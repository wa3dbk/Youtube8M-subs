00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
so let's come back to this drop drop and

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.640 
so let's come back to this drop drop and
the<00:02:58.980> third<00:02:59.400> course<00:03:00.000> which<00:03:00.660> you're<00:03:00.959> going<00:03:01.590> to

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
the third course which you're going to

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.300 
the third course which you're going to
play<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:03.410> absolutely<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.620> same<00:03:04.829> as<00:03:05.160> the

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
play is a absolutely the same as the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.479 
play is a absolutely the same as the
previous<00:03:05.549> one<00:03:05.790> II<00:03:05.970> just<00:03:06.299> move<00:03:06.930> up<00:03:07.079> you<00:03:07.860> say<00:03:08.340> the

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
previous one II just move up you say the

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.979 
previous one II just move up you say the
axles<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.030> same<00:03:09.180> positions<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.840> your

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
axles of the same positions of your

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.110 
axles of the same positions of your
fingers<00:03:10.350> but<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.680> just<00:03:10.829> move<00:03:11.010> up<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:11.430> you're

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
fingers but you just move up so you're

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.229 
fingers but you just move up so you're
gonna<00:03:12.269> be<00:03:12.690> on<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.530> this<00:03:13.950> okay<00:03:14.370> it's

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
gonna be on this and this okay it's

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.990 
gonna be on this and this okay it's
gonna<00:03:15.480> look<00:03:15.720> like<00:03:15.780> this<00:03:16.640> like<00:03:17.640> this<00:03:17.820> so<00:03:18.350> drew

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
gonna look like this like this so drew

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.530 
gonna look like this like this so drew
so<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:24.420> same<00:03:24.690> thing<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.670> let's<00:03:26.670> connect<00:03:27.180> the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
so the same thing and let's connect the

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.710 
so the same thing and let's connect the
three<00:03:27.930> chords

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.700 

and<00:03:34.980> then<00:03:35.980> you<00:03:36.250> just<00:03:36.550> go<00:03:36.790> down<00:03:37.180> so<00:03:37.780> absolutely

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
and then you just go down so absolutely

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.940 
and then you just go down so absolutely
the<00:03:38.860> same<00:03:39.070> quartz<00:03:39.640> is<00:03:39.820> just<00:03:40.150> another<00:03:40.540> order<00:03:41.200> so

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
the same quartz is just another order so

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:49.740 
the same quartz is just another order so
you<00:03:42.010> play<00:03:45.270> down<00:03:46.270> and<00:03:47.730> we<00:03:48.730> go<00:03:49.150> back<00:03:49.360> to<00:03:49.420> the

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
you play down and we go back to the

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.410 
you play down and we go back to the
first<00:03:50.370> core<00:03:51.370> Accord<00:03:52.060> yet<00:03:52.330> so<00:03:54.030> here<00:03:55.030> is<00:03:55.210> the

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
first core Accord yet so here is the

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.590 
first core Accord yet so here is the
verse<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:56.290> cores<00:03:56.920> is<00:03:57.220> actually<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:58.030> same<00:03:58.330> but

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
verse the cores is actually the same but

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.630 
verse the cores is actually the same but
you<00:03:58.750> just<00:03:58.930> play<00:03:59.320> it<00:03:59.380> in<00:03:59.740> another<00:04:00.010> way<00:04:00.370> just

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
you just play it in another way just

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.750 
you just play it in another way just
bite<00:04:00.880> more<00:04:01.180> aggressive<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.140> more<00:04:02.800> often<00:04:03.070> so

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
bite more aggressive and more often so

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.090 
bite more aggressive and more often so
you<00:04:04.090> play<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:04.630> cores<00:04:05.020> more<00:04:05.230> often<00:04:05.650> so<00:04:05.920> it's

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
you play the cores more often so it's

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:15.610 
you play the cores more often so it's
like

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.280 

so<00:04:16.620> here<00:04:16.889> it<00:04:17.040> is<00:04:17.070> I<00:04:17.459> think<00:04:17.729> it's<00:04:18.060> actually<00:04:18.660> very

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
so here it is I think it's actually very

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.670 
so here it is I think it's actually very
clear<00:04:19.739> it's<00:04:19.949> pretty<00:04:20.310> simple<00:04:20.850> and<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.680> think

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
clear it's pretty simple and I think

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.520 
clear it's pretty simple and I think
which<00:04:22.949> you<00:04:22.979> will<00:04:23.250> do<00:04:23.520> is<00:04:26.449> after<00:04:27.449> the<00:04:27.690> course<00:04:28.110> is

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
which you will do is after the course is

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:42.629 
which you will do is after the course is
the<00:04:29.370> hook<00:04:29.639> it's<00:04:29.970> like<00:04:33.410> there<00:04:34.410> is<00:04:34.560> a<00:04:34.590> pause

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.319 

so<00:04:43.639> what<00:04:44.119> we<00:04:44.360> do<00:04:44.629> is<00:04:45.549> absolutely<00:04:46.549> the<00:04:47.089> same

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:47.329 
so what we do is absolutely the same

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:49.299 
so what we do is absolutely the same
core<00:04:47.629> or<00:04:47.869> chords<00:04:48.409> but<00:04:48.559> you<00:04:48.649> just<00:04:48.829> played<00:04:49.099> an

00:04:49.299 --> 00:04:49.309 
core or chords but you just played an

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:55.089 
core or chords but you just played an
another<00:04:49.549> way<00:04:49.909> like<00:04:52.179> and<00:04:53.439> you<00:04:54.439> drop<00:04:54.769> it<00:04:54.949> and

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
another way like and you drop it and

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.439 
another way like and you drop it and
then<00:04:55.339> you<00:04:55.579> play<00:04:56.259> so<00:04:57.259> here<00:04:57.769> you<00:04:58.099> play<00:04:58.339> here<00:04:58.819> the

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
then you play so here you play here the

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.469 
then you play so here you play here the
third<00:05:00.199> fret<00:05:00.589> the<00:05:01.069> first<00:05:01.429> and<00:05:01.699> second<00:05:02.089> strings

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
third fret the first and second strings

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:11.319 
third fret the first and second strings
so<00:05:05.709> okay<00:05:06.709> I<00:05:07.009> think<00:05:07.459> it's<00:05:07.729> pretty<00:05:07.939> clear<00:05:08.239> and<00:05:10.329> so

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:11.329 
so okay I think it's pretty clear and so

00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:14.729 
so okay I think it's pretty clear and so
it's<00:05:11.689> almost<00:05:12.129> actually<00:05:13.129> the<00:05:13.639> whole<00:05:13.819> song<00:05:14.119> and

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:14.739 
it's almost actually the whole song and

00:05:14.739 --> 00:05:20.829 
it's almost actually the whole song and
um<00:05:17.259> to<00:05:18.259> be<00:05:18.289> honest<00:05:19.149> of<00:05:20.149> course<00:05:20.539> there<00:05:20.809> are

00:05:20.829 --> 00:05:20.839 
um to be honest of course there are

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:24.600 
um to be honest of course there are
loads<00:05:21.499> of<00:05:21.619> other<00:05:21.679> vey<00:05:22.399> ways<00:05:22.999> to<00:05:23.329> play<00:05:23.539> that<00:05:23.719> and

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
loads of other vey ways to play that and

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.429 
loads of other vey ways to play that and
as<00:05:25.610> for<00:05:25.879> the<00:05:26.089> last<00:05:26.360> course<00:05:26.749> of<00:05:26.929> the<00:05:27.049> song<00:05:27.259> I

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:27.439 
as for the last course of the song I

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:29.259 
as for the last course of the song I
play<00:05:27.709> it<00:05:27.769> a<00:05:27.949> bit<00:05:28.099> differently<00:05:28.759> but<00:05:29.059> it

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:29.269 
play it a bit differently but it

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:31.209 
play it a bit differently but it
actually<00:05:29.749> doesn't<00:05:29.959> matter<00:05:30.199> but<00:05:30.529> I'll<00:05:30.829> show

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:31.219 
actually doesn't matter but I'll show

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:35.129 
actually doesn't matter but I'll show
you<00:05:31.279> maybe<00:05:31.610> you<00:05:31.789> like<00:05:32.269> this<00:05:32.749> variant<00:05:33.229> more<00:05:33.709> so

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
you maybe you like this variant more so

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.450 
you maybe you like this variant more so
again<00:05:36.139> it<00:05:36.319> started<00:05:36.649> with<00:05:36.739> the<00:05:36.829> first<00:05:37.009> chord

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
again it started with the first chord

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.620 

and<00:05:40.720> you<00:05:41.720> go<00:05:41.930> here<00:05:42.260> so<00:05:42.890> I<00:05:42.920> think<00:05:43.400> it's<00:05:43.610> a<00:05:43.940> third

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
and you go here so I think it's a third

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.340 
and you go here so I think it's a third
and<00:05:44.870> fourth<00:05:45.410> string<00:05:46.310> on<00:05:46.640> the<00:05:47.030> fifth<00:05:47.810> fret<00:05:48.590> and

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
and fourth string on the fifth fret and

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.250 
and fourth string on the fifth fret and
you<00:05:51.350> put<00:05:51.680> your<00:05:52.010> first<00:05:52.370> finger<00:05:52.580> on<00:05:52.880> the<00:05:53.270> fifth

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
you put your first finger on the fifth

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.890 
you put your first finger on the fifth
string<00:05:54.380> on<00:05:55.160> the<00:05:55.370> third<00:05:55.790> fret<00:05:55.820> so<00:05:56.360> it's<00:05:56.570> like

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
string on the third fret so it's like

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.460 
string on the third fret so it's like
this<00:05:57.250> we<00:05:58.250> don't<00:05:58.430> use<00:05:58.610> this<00:05:58.850> I'm<00:05:59.060> sorry<00:05:59.350> it's<00:06:00.350> a

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
this we don't use this I'm sorry it's a

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.150 
this we don't use this I'm sorry it's a
bit<00:06:00.500> so<00:06:01.400> it's<00:06:01.960> absolutely<00:06:02.960> simple<00:06:03.320> and<00:06:03.740> then

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
bit so it's absolutely simple and then

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.050 
bit so it's absolutely simple and then
you<00:06:04.190> just<00:06:04.520> go<00:06:04.640> up<00:06:04.940> you<00:06:05.630> say<00:06:05.990> V<00:06:06.430> position<00:06:07.430> of<00:06:07.730> the

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
you just go up you say V position of the

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:17.590 
you just go up you say V position of the
fingers<00:06:08.330> and<00:06:08.990> so<00:06:09.890> it's<00:06:10.400> gonna<00:06:10.640> be<00:06:10.850> like<00:06:16.420> you<00:06:17.420> go

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
fingers and so it's gonna be like you go

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.050 
fingers and so it's gonna be like you go
down<00:06:20.590> sir<00:06:21.620> if<00:06:22.040> the<00:06:22.160> mallet<00:06:22.430> is<00:06:22.550> absolutely<00:06:22.940> the

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
down sir if the mallet is absolutely the

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.690 
down sir if the mallet is absolutely the
same<00:06:23.240> just<00:06:23.570> different<00:06:24.010> way<00:06:25.010> of<00:06:25.040> playing<00:06:25.460> it

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
same just different way of playing it

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:31.360 
same just different way of playing it
and<00:06:27.100> just<00:06:28.100> remember<00:06:28.700> this

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.110 

so<00:06:31.940> it's<00:06:32.210> pretty<00:06:32.510> clear<00:06:32.860> pretty<00:06:33.860> simple<00:06:34.639> and<00:06:34.940> I

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
so it's pretty clear pretty simple and I

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.270 
so it's pretty clear pretty simple and I
hope<00:06:35.150> it's<00:06:35.540> clear<00:06:35.780> if<00:06:36.110> it's<00:06:36.320> not<00:06:36.560> just<00:06:36.949> lemon

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
hope it's clear if it's not just lemon

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.120 
hope it's clear if it's not just lemon
