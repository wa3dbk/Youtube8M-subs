by<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> straight<00:00:18.390> post<00:00:19.039> so<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.070> mean<00:00:20.460> it's<00:00:20.609> get

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
by a straight post so I mean it's get

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.990 
by a straight post so I mean it's get
straight<00:00:21.000> into<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.650> so<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> box<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:23.970> have

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
straight into it so in the box we have

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.380 
straight into it so in the box we have
the<00:00:24.949> box<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.160> samsung<00:00:26.519> galaxy<00:00:26.880> s4<00:00:27.180> which

let's get cracking so um this is the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.520 
let's get cracking so um this is the
quad-core<00:00:43.980> version<00:00:44.489> as<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.910> octa-core<00:00:45.840> sadly
