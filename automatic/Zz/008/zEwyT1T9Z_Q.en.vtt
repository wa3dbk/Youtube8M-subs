00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
the king's castle here we'll see one of

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.700 
the king's castle here we'll see one of
the<00:02:53.840> first<00:02:54.110> uses<00:02:54.920> of<00:02:55.040> blueprints<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.710> I'm

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
the first uses of blueprints and I'm

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.490 
the first uses of blueprints and I'm
actually<00:02:57.980> trying<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.430> build<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.850> lumber<00:02:59.240> mill

can't get the higher up out items until

you get the lower items as seen on the

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.420 
you get the lower items as seen on the
tech<00:03:32.990> tree<00:03:33.230> right<00:03:33.410> there

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.040 

items<00:03:40.430> that<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.120> need<00:03:41.150> for<00:03:41.510> blueprints<00:03:41.960> are

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
items that you need for blueprints are

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.680 
items that you need for blueprints are
easily<00:03:42.380> marked<00:03:42.860> when<00:03:43.670> you<00:03:43.790> go<00:03:43.940> into<00:03:44.150> the

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
easily marked when you go into the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.220 
easily marked when you go into the
houses<00:03:45.190> like<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.310> workshop<00:03:46.790> or<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:48.020> wood

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
houses like the workshop or the wood

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.090 
houses like the workshop or the wood
mill<00:03:48.470> that<00:03:49.900> they'll<00:03:50.900> show<00:03:51.170> you<00:03:51.230> which<00:03:51.590> items

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
mill that they'll show you which items

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.650 
mill that they'll show you which items
you<00:03:52.190> need<00:03:52.460> in<00:03:52.670> your<00:03:52.790> blueprint<00:03:53.240> right<00:03:53.420> there

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
you need in your blueprint right there

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.540 
you need in your blueprint right there
so<00:03:53.900> it's<00:03:54.050> easier<00:03:54.380> to<00:03:54.500> figure<00:03:54.680> out<00:03:54.920> not<00:03:55.340> having

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
so it's easier to figure out not having

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.340 
so it's easier to figure out not having
to<00:03:55.640> guess<00:03:55.940> looking<00:03:56.390> at<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.600> picture<00:03:57.050> in<00:03:57.290> the

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
to guess looking at the picture in the

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.410 
to guess looking at the picture in the
blueprint

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.260 

lots<00:04:03.080> of<00:04:03.230> buildings<00:04:03.410> also<00:04:03.830> require<00:04:04.520> some

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
lots of buildings also require some

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.500 
lots of buildings also require some
special<00:04:05.660> items<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:06.709> those<00:04:06.890> are<00:04:07.280> not<00:04:07.790> specific

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
special items and those are not specific

special items and those are not specific
to<00:04:08.690> any<00:04:08.810> building<00:04:09.410> you<00:04:09.500> can<00:04:09.530> use<00:04:09.860> whatever<00:04:10.130> you

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
to any building you can use whatever you

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.979 
to any building you can use whatever you
want<00:04:10.430> there<00:04:12.130> here<00:04:13.130> we<00:04:13.340> see<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:14.150> one<00:04:14.810> of<00:04:14.900> the

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
want there here we see the one of the

other worlds in the game which is

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.530 
other worlds in the game which is
actually<00:04:18.530> more<00:04:18.739> of<00:04:18.799> a<00:04:18.919> desert<00:04:19.239> it's<00:04:20.239> a<00:04:20.299> little

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
actually more of a desert it's a little

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.409 
actually more of a desert it's a little
bit<00:04:20.660> smaller<00:04:20.930> than<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.290> main<00:04:21.500> world<00:04:22.090> but<00:04:23.090> it

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
bit smaller than the main world but it

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.110 
bit smaller than the main world but it
adds<00:04:24.410> to<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.830> story<00:04:25.100> and<00:04:25.280> also<00:04:25.730> gives<00:04:25.970> you

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
adds to the story and also gives you

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.030 
adds to the story and also gives you
different<00:04:26.389> resources<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.380> bring<00:04:27.560> back<00:04:27.740> to

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
different resources to bring back to

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.370 
different resources to bring back to
your<00:04:28.190> main<00:04:28.580> world

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.340 

and<00:04:35.120> here<00:04:36.120> we'll<00:04:36.270> see<00:04:36.480> one<00:04:36.750> of<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:36.960> quest

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
and here we'll see one of the quest

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:58.610 
and here we'll see one of the quest
elements<00:04:38.340> in<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.880> game<00:04:57.320> there<00:04:58.320> are<00:04:58.440> no

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
elements in the game there are no

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.470

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
own pace and you pretty much can build

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.000 
own pace and you pretty much can build
slow<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:05.970> just<00:05:06.390> go<00:05:06.600> at<00:05:06.810> an<00:05:06.930> easy<00:05:07.110> pace<00:05:07.260> or<00:05:07.740> try

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
slow and just go at an easy pace or try

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.110 
slow and just go at an easy pace or try
to<00:05:08.070> speed<00:05:08.400> through<00:05:08.550> it<00:05:08.670> as<00:05:08.760> quickly<00:05:08.790> as

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
to speed through it as quickly as

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.140 
to speed through it as quickly as
possible<00:05:09.180> it's<00:05:09.870> all<00:05:10.020> up<00:05:10.170> to<00:05:10.320> you<00:05:10.880> here<00:05:11.880> the

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
possible it's all up to you here the

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.780 
possible it's all up to you here the
quest<00:05:12.390> we<00:05:12.720> are<00:05:13.110> given<00:05:13.470> we<00:05:13.770> need<00:05:13.950> to<00:05:14.190> create<00:05:14.700> a

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
quest we are given we need to create a

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.360 
quest we are given we need to create a
bridge<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.390> get<00:05:15.540> across<00:05:15.800> but<00:05:16.800> in<00:05:16.920> order<00:05:17.220> to

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
bridge to get across but in order to

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.490 
bridge to get across but in order to
create<00:05:17.640> that<00:05:18.000> bridge<00:05:18.360> we're<00:05:19.020> actually<00:05:19.110> going

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
create that bridge we're actually going

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.790 
create that bridge we're actually going
to<00:05:19.710> need<00:05:19.950> a<00:05:20.160> glass<00:05:20.490> meant<00:05:21.000> to<00:05:21.660> make<00:05:21.840> glass<00:05:22.110> for

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
to need a glass meant to make glass for

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:54.350 
to need a glass meant to make glass for
the<00:05:22.890> bridge

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.230 

so<00:05:55.020> this<00:05:55.289> is<00:05:55.439> just<00:05:55.590> a<00:05:55.740> quick<00:05:55.889> look<00:05:56.219> of<00:05:56.460> a<00:05:56.879> world

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
so this is just a quick look of a world

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.809 
so this is just a quick look of a world
of<00:05:57.509> keflings<00:05:57.840> I<00:05:58.439> hope<00:05:59.039> you<00:05:59.219> enjoyed<00:05:59.550> this
