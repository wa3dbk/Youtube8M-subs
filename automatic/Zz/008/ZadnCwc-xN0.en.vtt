I<00:00:13.460> want<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.549> talk<00:00:14.670> about<00:00:14.790> some<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.240> details

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
I want to talk about some of the details

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.960 
I want to talk about some of the details
here<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:16.049> terms<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.590> side<00:00:17.400> effects<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.820> so

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
here in terms of side effects and so

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.540 
here in terms of side effects and so
forth<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.330> radiation<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.619> surgery<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.279> just<00:00:20.460> a

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
forth in radiation and surgery in just a

forth in radiation and surgery in just a
second<00:00:20.850> but<00:00:20.910> dr.<00:00:21.180> Morris<00:00:21.390> let<00:00:22.020> me<00:00:22.109> ask<00:00:22.289> you

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
second but dr. Morris let me ask you

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.859 
second but dr. Morris let me ask you
used<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.920> be<00:00:23.039> also<00:00:23.189> thought<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.660> for<00:00:24.660> example

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
used to be also thought that for example

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.779 
used to be also thought that for example
hormone<00:00:25.439> therapy<00:00:25.830> or<00:00:25.859> anti-hormone<00:00:26.760> therapy

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
hormone therapy or anti-hormone therapy

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.230 
hormone therapy or anti-hormone therapy
more<00:00:27.330> appropriately<00:00:28.140> was<00:00:28.609> kind<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.910> last

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
more appropriately was kind of that last

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.900 
more appropriately was kind of that last
line<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.650> defense<00:00:31.650> after<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.309> had<00:00:32.550> metastatic

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
line of defense after you had metastatic

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.729 
line of defense after you had metastatic
disease<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.960> had<00:00:34.110> broken<00:00:34.380> through

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
disease and it had broken through

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.440 
disease and it had broken through
whatever<00:00:35.100> other<00:00:35.340> therapies<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.059> had<00:00:36.210> but

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
whatever other therapies you had but

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.940 
whatever other therapies you had but
what<00:00:36.960> I'm<00:00:37.110> hearing<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.530> there<00:00:37.800> are

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
what I'm hearing is that there are

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.950 
what I'm hearing is that there are
there's<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.340> role<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:38.640> hormone<00:00:39.300> therapy<00:00:39.780> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
there's a role for hormone therapy and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.560 
there's a role for hormone therapy and
even<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.590> chemotherapy<00:00:40.890> which<00:00:41.460> was<00:00:41.730> never

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
even for chemotherapy which was never

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.600 
even for chemotherapy which was never
really<00:00:42.930> thought<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.739> have<00:00:44.160> much<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
really thought to be to have much of a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.910 
really thought to be to have much of a
role<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:44.850> prostate<00:00:45.660> cancer<00:00:45.719> there<00:00:46.590> are<00:00:46.620> roles

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
role in prostate cancer there are roles

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.549 
role in prostate cancer there are roles
for<00:00:47.160> these<00:00:47.280> kinds<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.899> treatment<00:00:48.899> even

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
for these kinds of treatment even

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.279 
for these kinds of treatment even
earlier<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.969> further<00:00:51.539> along<00:00:51.899> tell<00:00:52.199> me

earlier on and and further along tell me

earlier on and and further along tell me
a<00:00:52.320> little<00:00:52.469> bit<00:00:52.620> about<00:00:52.890> that

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
a little bit about that

of<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> disease<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.950> has<00:01:38.280> led

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
of the disease and so that that has led

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.640 
of the disease and so that that has led
to<00:01:38.850> an<00:01:38.970> extrapolation<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.530> apply

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
to an extrapolation then to apply

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.020 
to an extrapolation then to apply
hormones<00:01:42.829> not<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:44.220> when<00:01:44.399> patients<00:01:44.850> have

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
hormones not just when patients have

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.539 
hormones not just when patients have

newly diagnosed as well and then from

newly diagnosed as well and then from
there<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:51.210> patients<00:01:51.689> who<00:01:51.840> relapse

there to patients who relapse

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.380 
there to patients who relapse
not<00:01:52.920> necessarily<00:01:53.430> by<00:01:53.729> metastatic<00:01:54.180> disease

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
not necessarily by metastatic disease

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.899 
not necessarily by metastatic disease
but<00:01:54.840> whose<00:01:55.049> PSA<00:01:55.740> begins<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.280> rise<00:01:56.689> after

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
but whose PSA begins to rise after

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.330 
but whose PSA begins to rise after
either<00:01:59.909> radiation<00:02:00.540> or<00:02:00.780> surgery<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:02.100> now<00:02:02.280> you

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
either radiation or surgery so now you

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.550 
either radiation or surgery so now you
have<00:02:02.700> really<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.360> application<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.140> hormonal

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
have really the application of hormonal

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.219 
have really the application of hormonal
therapy<00:02:05.100> for<00:02:05.549> most<00:02:05.969> prostate<00:02:06.750> cancer

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
therapy for most prostate cancer

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.160 
therapy for most prostate cancer
patients<00:02:07.860> from<00:02:08.550> diagnosis<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.629> even<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
patients from diagnosis to even the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.770 
patients from diagnosis to even the
latest<00:02:10.649> phases<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.910> disease

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
latest phases of the disease

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.200 
latest phases of the disease
now<00:02:13.200> obviously<00:02:13.710> that's<00:02:13.920> raised<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.730> concern

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
now obviously that's raised the concern

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.650 
now obviously that's raised the concern
among<00:02:15.690> many<00:02:15.960> of<00:02:16.590> us<00:02:16.740> in<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.190> field<00:02:17.490> as<00:02:17.910> to

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
among many of us in the field as to

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.420 
among many of us in the field as to
whether<00:02:18.930> all<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.260> those<00:02:19.620> patients<00:02:19.980> need

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
whether all of those patients need

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.240 
whether all of those patients need
hormonal<00:02:21.150> therapy<00:02:21.800> because<00:02:22.800> hormonal

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
hormonal therapy because hormonal

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.920 
hormonal therapy because hormonal
therapy<00:02:23.700> has<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.910> lot<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.180> side<00:02:24.420> effects<00:02:24.750> that

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
therapy has a lot of side effects that

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.780 
therapy has a lot of side effects that
are<00:02:24.990> associated<00:02:25.740> with<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.130> long-term

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
are associated with it and long-term

functioning so I think that there is

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.780 
functioning so I think that there is
increasing<00:02:40.890> recognition<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.510> effects<00:02:43.170> of
