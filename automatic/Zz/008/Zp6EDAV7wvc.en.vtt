00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.839
 shellfish 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.940
 taking advantage of the fact that this month the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.389
 Just box brings among another great variety 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.110

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.730
 ibarra 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.130
 let's take advantage and we will use it 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.289
 in our recipe the other ingredients 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.190

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.720
 Lettuce leaves 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.990

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.000
 previously known and peeled three 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.239
 surimi sticks or substitute 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.590
 crab about five tablespoons 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.990
 mayonnaise 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.680

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:44.680
 about two tablespoons of ketchup and 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.360
 chive finally cut first 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.460
 what we have to do is cut the 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.740
 lettuce leaves first let's 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.780
 cut this part that has the trunk 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.700
 bigger and we're going to reserve it in case 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.490
 then we use it to decorate our 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.530
 dish then let's put it like this 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.710
 our lettuce we are going to make a 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.960
 cut end 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.960
 and we are going to cut it like this 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.790
 we will do the same for the rest of the 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.280
 leaves 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.350
 and we already have the lettuce cut and now 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.390
 let's move to cut sticks 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.150
 crab first let's make a cut 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.150
 well and then like this 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.079
 we have ready the surimi sticks 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.719
 and then we are going to cut the 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.270
 shrimp we have booked a few for 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.100
 after decorating, you just need to cut it 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.579
 a little bit is not necessary that the court and 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.579
 excessively 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.150
 we already have the prawns cut and we're going to 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.659
 move on to make the pink sauce so 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.759
 let's mix ketchup and mayonnaise 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.970
 with the help of a spoon we mix it 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.970
 all right 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.180
 as it develops it is already ready and 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.880
 we are going to mix everything we have 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.650
 put in the guy the lettuce we are going to 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.650
 add the crab sticks 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.820
 the chopped prawns 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.090
 and the pink traces 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.620
 how are we going to cast doubt for this 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.740
 case will be in excess we will leave a 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.580
 little bit 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.430
 and we're already mixing everything 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.260
 and now we have everything mixed and in the end 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.480
 I used all the pink sauce that 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.490
 we had prepared now I'm going to 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.890
