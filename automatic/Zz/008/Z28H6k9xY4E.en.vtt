 and we're going to start stirring 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.030
 and so you're going to do it 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.290
 until you see that it has been painted 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.290

 I would like more color 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.900
 because that's how I liked how it was and that's not 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.750
 we are going to do it 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.970

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.090
 good 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.240
 and then we're going to start billing like this 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.510

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.180

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.710
 that you need to make the hole 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.710
