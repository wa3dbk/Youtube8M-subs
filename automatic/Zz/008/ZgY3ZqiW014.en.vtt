00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
first turn off the image plane so we can

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.290 
first turn off the image plane so we can

now<00:04:30.520> if<00:04:30.639> you<00:04:30.729> switch<00:04:30.970> back<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:31.210> camera<00:04:31.750> two<00:04:31.960> and

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
now if you switch back to camera two and

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.830 
now if you switch back to camera two and
scrub<00:04:32.800> through<00:04:32.949> the<00:04:33.009> animation<00:04:33.129> timeline<00:04:34.120> you

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
scrub through the animation timeline you

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.450 
scrub through the animation timeline you
can<00:04:34.990> see<00:04:35.110> that<00:04:35.289> the<00:04:35.379> camera<00:04:35.800> follows<00:04:36.310> the

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
can see that the camera follows the

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.020 
can see that the camera follows the
police<00:04:36.729> car

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.060 

scrubbing<00:04:42.020> through<00:04:42.170> the<00:04:42.290> sequencer<00:04:42.770> again

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
scrubbing through the sequencer again

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.820 
scrubbing through the sequencer again
our<00:04:43.340> second<00:04:44.060> shot<00:04:44.240> is<00:04:44.420> a<00:04:44.450> bit<00:04:44.660> long<00:04:44.900> we'd

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
our second shot is a bit long we'd

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.560 
our second shot is a bit long we'd
ideally<00:04:46.130> like<00:04:46.340> to<00:04:46.520> jump<00:04:46.880> to<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.150> next<00:04:47.390> shot

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
ideally like to jump to the next shot

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.930 
ideally like to jump to the next shot
just<00:04:48.320> as<00:04:48.440> the<00:04:48.560> fire<00:04:48.740> truck<00:04:49.040> pulls<00:04:49.370> into<00:04:49.580> view

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
just as the fire truck pulls into view

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.390 
just as the fire truck pulls into view
so<00:04:50.540> let's<00:04:50.570> drag<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.140> duration<00:04:51.590> down<00:04:51.800> to<00:04:52.130> frame

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
so let's drag the duration down to frame

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.629 
so let's drag the duration down to frame

crashing into the fountain but if we
look<00:05:38.370> at<00:05:38.460> what<00:05:38.610> we<00:05:38.700> have<00:05:38.820> here<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.750> police<00:05:40.050> car

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
look at what we have here the police car

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.320 
look at what we have here the police car
is<00:05:40.290> already<00:05:40.620> resting<00:05:41.370> in<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.580> fountain<00:05:42.000> by

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
see the lead up to this we'd have to

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.540 
see the lead up to this we'd have to
pull<00:05:47.160> the<00:05:47.280> shot<00:05:47.550> back<00:05:47.760> to<00:05:48.090> about<00:05:48.360> frame<00:05:48.630> 185

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
the animation really comes into use if

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.350 
the animation really comes into use if
you've<00:06:01.320> noticed<00:06:01.560> as<00:06:01.980> we've<00:06:02.730> dragged<00:06:03.030> the<00:06:03.150> shot

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
you've noticed as we've dragged the shot

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.750 
you've noticed as we've dragged the shot
durations<00:06:03.990> two<00:06:04.620> numbers<00:06:04.980> have<00:06:05.190> been<00:06:05.340> changing

different things the top number

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.430 
different things the top number
represents<00:06:11.550> the<00:06:11.610> start<00:06:12.000> or<00:06:12.240> end<00:06:12.300> frame<00:06:12.900> in<00:06:13.140> the

sequentially in the animation and the

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.090 
sequentially in the animation and the

up however we can use this to make a

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.250 
up however we can use this to make a
shot<00:06:29.400> that<00:06:29.910> is<00:06:29.970> consecutive<00:06:30.630> in<00:06:30.750> the<00:06:30.840> sequence

this<00:06:41.820> back<00:06:41.880> to<00:06:42.420> about<00:06:42.600> frame<00:06:42.900> 185<00:06:44.060> notice<00:06:45.060> that

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
this back to about frame 185 notice that

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.510 
this back to about frame 185 notice that
when<00:06:45.390> you<00:06:45.510> do<00:06:45.690> this<00:06:45.870> the<00:06:46.500> shot<00:06:46.710> jumps<00:06:47.250> to<00:06:47.490> a

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
when you do this the shot jumps to a

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.820 
when you do this the shot jumps to a
lower<00:06:47.730> track<00:06:48.090> this<00:06:49.050> is<00:06:49.200> because<00:06:49.470> the<00:06:49.560> shots

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
lower track this is because the shots

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.730 
lower track this is because the shots
now<00:06:50.100> overlap<00:06:50.610> in<00:06:50.790> the<00:06:50.880> sequence<00:06:51.330> to<00:06:52.290> fix<00:06:52.530> this

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
now overlap in the sequence to fix this

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.650 
now overlap in the sequence to fix this
