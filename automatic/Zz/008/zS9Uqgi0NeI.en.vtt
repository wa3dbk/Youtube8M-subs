00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.099
 So we want to play in the 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.080
 monumental have been absolutely 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.460
 different our touches play visiting 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.680
 we can not trust that either 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.860
 but the team on a court as is 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.280
 clearly plays much better 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.080
 the issue of concentration 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.940
 have to go back to this team in the 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.350
 last game we have failed in that 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.170
 we know that audax is 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:36.610
 is fighting the possibilities of 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.640
 ensure their qualification to the playoffs 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.340
 and we have the great opportunity 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.520
 to return to 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.900
 to put it in an international cup like that 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.380
 that I think are the details 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.910
 that we have to correct above all here 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.090
 taking into account that the two teams 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.700
 they need to win and that is surely going to 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.050
 be a super open match then 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.720
 we have to try to be 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.540
 concentrated to be a team applied 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.160
 especially when we attack because 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.840
 we are also clear that from that 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.240
 Audax has good players especially 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.280
 mid-court forward that you 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.320
 they can define independently what they 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.300
 yesterday it happened to the wolf I think it's still 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.820
 being for me the best team the 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.750
 Chilean the current champion 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.660
 and while there is no other team that 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.300
 that can take away the throne flow follows 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.770
 being the team competitive and 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.620
 clearly one of the candidates to 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.710
 title so we like to highlight it 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.750
 we are preparing for that for 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.479
 first win on saturday and power 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.680
 classify the South American and second 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.630
 power 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.220
 return to being champion and that a while ago 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.520
 we are 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.250
 and I for the greatness of this club what 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.710
 merits and needs it 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.420
 I wish that 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.420
 do not be so hopefully that we are 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.670
 those who take away that possibility 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.619
 without detracting from the other teams that 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.540
 that are going to qualify for the playoffs but 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.709
 but clearly we would like 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.330
 be champions and take away that possibility 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.450
 since I'm here 5 years ago 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.310
 it seems that the debt of this club or of 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.459
 the players who have not touched here 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.140
 during all this time he has 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.090
 internationally we have not done good 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.290
 with national analysts and that's 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.750
 Clear 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.020
 the club like colo colo 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.390
 clearly you need to have a tournament 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.570
 important international fighting with 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.320
 the best teams in South America and 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.060
 we have not done it and with 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.760
 regarding the reinforcements surely a 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.560
 once the tournament finishes the body 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.170
 technician and the leadership will steal from 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.390
 to strengthen the players' team 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.930
 that are needed in each position 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.690
 us for now we have to try to 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.420
 in this month that we remain championship the 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.880
 afternoon to continue strengthening the team 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.500
 that the team keeps improving and 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.500
 obviously try to get to the end 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.120
 and we arrived much better than where we have 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.940
 past 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.680
 that helps us a lot but also 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.610
 we respect other teams very much 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.700
 we no longer trust 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.860
 what do I know I can see by having 30 points 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.780
 because because maybe we can finish 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.720
 first it seems to me that we would mistake the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.210
 path 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.400
 the tournaments although they are repeated a 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.580
 Periods tournament is a tournament 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.490
 totally different where 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.610
 if one gets up one day badly there is 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.530
 out the chickens 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.150
 in what I am clear that the team 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.260
 come much better prepared a lot 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:50.380
 better worked and that is surely going to 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.940
 mark something different in this month I 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.790
 it seems that the difference the great 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:59.250
 difference between this colo colo thread and 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.250
 the above is the physical part 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.340
 which has been a fundamental help for 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.319
 us a much better worked team 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.480
 physically 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.939
 without being afraid to do something to the other prices 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.499
 that they came that maybe in another side with 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.690
 his method of work went well and here 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:15.190
 do not 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.109
 but it seems to me that Jorge has made a 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.969
 work 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.260
 special with us with each of 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:23.570
 we 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.210
 you are they have realized that the 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.750
 especially team has been physically 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.950
 a sample of important improvement because 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.060
 good players this team nobody 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:38.419
 it's always nothing, it's 20 days 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.710
 aroma a month that we can be 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:44.660
 concentrated as long as necessary 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.730
 as they said some colleagues in goal 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.310
 back we all have to do the 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.270
 effort colo colo ago that 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.370
 you need a championship and if we 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.800
 we have to make that effort what 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.660
 we actually do not cost anything what 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.570
 we passed the concentrations we eat well 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:05.570
 well we rest the massages better a 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.130
 considerable advantage and I have said it 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.200
 always the chile glass for us a 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.630
 Like outstanding issue and we want to win 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.470
 independent that I have the body 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:19.320
 technical bar ice equipment 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.330
 the chile glass for us something that 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.310
 that is there that we want to win and that 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.780
 the team is going to make all the effort goes 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.780
 to stay with that as well
