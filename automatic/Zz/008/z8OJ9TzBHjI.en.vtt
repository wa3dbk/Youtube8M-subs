00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.979
 how are you 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.030
 look at this beautiful orchid that I have 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:17.970
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:21.440
 to make the wavy sheets and here 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.920
 we have two types 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.740
 two types on the sheet we have not done the 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.590
 leaf where fairy and also the one that we have 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.760
 given different ways as we can 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:39.940
 appreciate here has no other way than 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.940
 Now I'm going to show you how to prepare them 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.520
 we have prepared the wave in this way 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.610
 in a 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.930
 can be a pencil can be a brush 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:59.870
 let's go around the brush 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.870
 in this way we are not giving 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:06.600
 the necessary turns to be able to arm 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.799
 our petal 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.799
 then we have 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.770
 and we stretch them look 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.560
 we stretch them we can use the 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.130
 toilet paper cartons too 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.920
 friends 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.360
 look we can go around 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.360
 and we cut it 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.140
 we cut our pitalito here we give 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.140
 the turn 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.650
 thus 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.159
 we remove them, it is waved after 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.409
 we stretch and we will proceed accordingly 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.580
 to our previous tutorials that 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.790
 have I already prepared it out of no 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.790
 this form 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:06.500
 we retire we have already prepared one already with 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:10.910
 tail with nylon the color that I have 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.600
 chosen these are the waves 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.840
 I have prepared a simple that has 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.840
 continued 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:26.730
 Marking with the nail in this way does not 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:32.220
 Look, then, here we also put them together 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:36.269
 let's go and it's going to be like this 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:40.530
 two very different petals but that 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:44.489
 they are going to give a very nice presentation to 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.430
 our arrangement we have here these sheets 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.220

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.670
 lily we also have another one that we have not 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.269
