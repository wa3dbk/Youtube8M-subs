00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:09.059
 Here are some nozzles clean 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.660
 Ayla mechanically without any team 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.509
 electronics 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.759
 purely mechanical nozzles which 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.670
 applied principle on tillers on 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.170
 more new is applied here such 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.260
 similar dance walker from from another 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.400
 engine but basically they all look alike 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:29.820
 this is called no pin nozzles 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.820
 or field perforated and also called why 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.149
 I call it because she has 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.899
 sprayer without pin that is it 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:43.789
 Here is such a time this kind of whip 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.789
 here there are many holes 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.600
 on her not be seen but 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.810
 there are a lot of holes there are them here 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.850
 maybe three maybe five maybe 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.130
 be 4 it depends on the design 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.870
 engine and the second type of injectors 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.940
 Particularly, I have this here 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.340
 called pin nozzles why 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.410
 pin because she has 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:19.490
 pin spray that's and 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:22.270
 sprayer and this one this thing 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:27.080
 there is a pin because it is called 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.790
 pin because she has pin here 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.640
 it's almost 2 because 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.660
 the chapter is not completely hidden in the case and 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.520
 the pin is not from the underground part outside 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:41.090
 what else to say these jets like 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.600
 the rule is put on residents who 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.250
 has a pre-chamber four camera and other 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.440
 nonsense these nozzles are put 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.730
 answered which pruning occurs 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:00.550
 directly into the cylinder on these 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:05.170
 nozzles pressure is usually somewhere up 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:09.369
 150-150 atmospheres of these ranging from 150 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.540
 sometimes 300 300 odd 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.410
 Some nozzles this divine 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.950
 manufacturers write the pressure that she 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.950
 calculated 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:27.630
 250 bar the bar is almost the same as 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:31.080
 atmosphere without a few tenths 250 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.750
 atmospheres means where for camera 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.270
 This nozzle and pre-camera view is applied. 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.140
 likes where directly from 1 is 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.220
 injectors it is always suppressing below it 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:49.740
 why because the hand of the world has 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:55.170
 limited space here and drawings 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:57.990
 in order to inject fuel and she's 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.220
 misty different forms flew was this 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:06.540
 Extremely part of the pre- chamber combustion chamber 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.190
 ancestors need pressure less than this 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.600
 nozzle which will inject 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.730
 fuel here in such cameras and she needs 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.400
 more pressure to spray 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.570
 fuel has flown from the start of the sprayer 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:25.380
 to the extreme point of the combustion chamber 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:28.620
 so that means a mixture we said 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.310
 completely what will happen if the pressure of us 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.820
 less 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.010
 on the injectors means we have no fuel 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.110
 will reach the extreme part 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.380
 extreme at the boundary of the combustion chamber 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.190
 faraway she were here to ignite not 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.550
 reaching the end that is we will have 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.530
 ignition in one area of ​​the chamber then 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.970
 time here ignited here 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.700
 ignition is not yet and 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.070
 accordingly, the engine will be demich and not 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.110
 there will be enough power because 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.360
 fuel will not cause fully timeliness and 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.170
 it will burn the motor completely 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.760
 for copper will not have it already been burned 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.270
 then when the piston went down and in 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.940
 principle 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.920
 the burnout effect is gone 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.970
 addition if there is very low pressure here 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:18.120
 will accumulate on the card for the amount 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.939
 I do in principle show or show 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.319
 meter 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:29.039
 also from this what will happen if the pressure 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:31.080
 very large nozzles mean 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:37.099
 the nozzle will spray the fuel will 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:40.319
 fly into the back of the combustion chamber and 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:42.000
 settles on its walls that is 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:42.659
 fly in because there is a day and I am very 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.020
 high 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:46.889
 fight on the wall and again will not 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.569
 burns completely 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:53.190
 and correctly because she already sat on 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:56.060
 the wall and now from the wall it is necessary 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.110
 evaporate there is of course a film of combustion 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.750
 special motors are designed for this 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.340
 beforehand, but then it is put there 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:09.229
 it was not your knees that should be 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:12.389
 such as manual if you toupper 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.729
 accumulate a lot of pressure nozzle 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.180
 fall on the wall here burn plasma 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:20.039
 overheating loki limit combustion chambers 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.139
 there will be cracks on the head wears it very 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:25.050
 can sadly end if 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:28.440
 pressure is small he will have you very 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.800
 smoke smoke is very wrong 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.719
 sunbathe 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.840
 there will be no power over time 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:35.969
 the holes or the pin will be clogged i 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.830
 accordingly but still have to 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:42.180
 remove nozzle clean adjust 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.839
 so put the pressure right and 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.839
 check
