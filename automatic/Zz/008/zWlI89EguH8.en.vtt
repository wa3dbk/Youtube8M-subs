and head over this away ooh five coin

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.850 
and head over this away ooh five coin
challenge<00:01:21.689> that's<00:01:21.900> actually<00:01:22.229> helpful<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.710> can

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
challenge that's actually helpful I can

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.600 
challenge that's actually helpful I can
get<00:01:23.009> my<00:01:23.130> power<00:01:23.369> oh<00:01:25.070> yeah

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
and then over this away float on over

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.149 
and then over this away float on over
and<00:01:34.759> I<00:01:35.759> think<00:01:35.939> what<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:36.689> do<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.439> wall<00:01:37.799> jump

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
and I think what we do here is wall jump

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.760 
and I think what we do here is wall jump
I<00:01:38.520> would<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:39.060> incorrect<00:01:39.869> with<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.350> statement

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
I would be incorrect with that statement

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.530 
I would be incorrect with that statement
ah<00:01:42.380> float<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.680> over<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.430> way<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:46.610> up<00:01:47.610> here<00:01:48.329> oh

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
ah float on over this way and up here oh

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.710 
ah float on over this way and up here oh
I<00:01:49.470> remember<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.189> coin<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:51.119> has<00:01:51.270> been<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> while

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
grab that and then we backtrack and redo

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.700 
grab that and then we backtrack and redo
this<00:02:05.100> again<00:02:06.020> overall<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.200> kind<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.530> fun

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
this again overall it's kind of a fun

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.480 
this again overall it's kind of a fun
level<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.850> it's<00:02:09.569> pretty<00:02:10.130> snow<00:02:11.130> levels

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
level I like it it's pretty snow levels

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.460 
level I like it it's pretty snow levels
in<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.850> game<00:02:11.910> aren't<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.569> bad<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:13.080> used<00:02:13.290> to

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.380 
in this game aren't that bad I used to
hate<00:02:13.680> ice<00:02:13.860> levels<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.550> because<00:02:14.850> you'd<00:02:15.000> slip

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
hate ice levels just because you'd slip

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.080 
hate ice levels just because you'd slip
and<00:02:15.569> slide<00:02:15.900> all<00:02:16.080> around<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:16.650> Mario<00:02:17.040> games<00:02:17.280> but
