miniscule and spectating on free and

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.810 
miniscule and spectating on free and
these<00:02:50.200> will<00:02:50.440> help<00:02:50.860> you<00:02:51.630> when<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:52.930> record

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
these will help you when you record

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.810 
these will help you when you record
cinematics<00:02:54.820> so<00:02:55.090> if<00:02:56.020> what<00:02:56.920> you<00:02:57.100> should<00:02:57.340> do<00:02:57.520> is

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
cinematics so if what you should do is

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.360 
cinematics so if what you should do is
actually<00:02:58.090> go<00:02:58.390> watch<00:02:58.810> another<00:02:59.350> video<00:02:59.680> on<00:02:59.890> how

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
actually go watch another video on how

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.789 
actually go watch another video on how
to<00:03:00.400> do<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:00.910> on<00:03:00.940> 41<00:03:01.630> because<00:03:02.019> it<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:02.230> basically

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
to do it on 41 because it is basically

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.340 
to do it on 41 because it is basically
the<00:03:03.220> same<00:03:03.510> it's<00:03:04.510> just<00:03:04.750> different<00:03:05.080> ways<00:03:05.290> to

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
the same it's just different ways to

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.070 
the same it's just different ways to
start<00:03:05.739> up<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.040> mod<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.840> after<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:07.930> do<00:03:08.049> that

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
start up the mod and after you do that

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.320 
start up the mod and after you do that
I'm<00:03:08.950> going<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.160> explain<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.519> console<00:03:09.910> right

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
I'm going to explain the console right

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.310 
I'm going to explain the console right
now<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:11.290> console<00:03:11.680> is<00:03:11.739> different<00:03:12.160> then<00:03:13.320> 41

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
now the console is different then 41

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.430 
now the console is different then 41
because<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:14.769> don't<00:03:14.920> click<00:03:15.040> tilde<00:03:15.549> to<00:03:16.440> to

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
because you don't click tilde to to

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.360 
because you don't click tilde to to
start<00:03:17.799> open<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:19.470> console<00:03:20.470> well<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.220> want<00:03:21.340> to

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
start open the console well you want to

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.150 
start open the console well you want to
click<00:03:21.519> is<00:03:21.730> f2<00:03:22.360> and<00:03:22.630> f<00:03:23.230> 2<00:03:23.260> will<00:03:23.709> bring<00:03:23.890> up<00:03:24.010> this

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
click is f2 and f 2 will bring up this

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.699 
click is f2 and f 2 will bring up this
little<00:03:24.400> thing<00:03:24.640> right<00:03:24.670> here<00:03:24.850> um<00:03:25.390> this<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.500> your

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
little thing right here um this is your

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.400 
little thing right here um this is your
console<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:28.299> is<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.870> is<00:03:29.049> kind<00:03:29.290> of

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
console and it is it is kind of

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.940 
console and it is it is kind of
different<00:03:29.560> than<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.400> 41<00:03:31.739> command<00:03:32.739> wise

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
different than the 41 command wise

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.590 
different than the 41 command wise
although<00:03:33.370> it's<00:03:34.299> also<00:03:34.840> very<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.709> same<00:03:36.030> all<00:03:37.030> the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
although it's also very the same all the

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.160 
although it's also very the same all the
difference<00:03:38.019> is<00:03:38.260> is<00:03:38.680> you<00:03:39.640> don't<00:03:39.760> put<00:03:40.480> this<00:03:40.780> /

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
difference is is you don't put this /

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.680 
difference is is you don't put this /
before<00:03:41.680> things<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.610> you<00:03:43.090> don't<00:03:43.239> want<00:03:43.390> to<00:03:43.480> put

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
before things so you don't want to put

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.100 
before things so you don't want to put
the<00:03:43.930> forward<00:03:44.320> slash<00:03:44.620> for<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.700> CG<00:03:46.360> command<00:03:46.810> or

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
the forward slash for a CG command or

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.670 
the forward slash for a CG command or
any<00:03:47.440> other<00:03:47.650> rly<00:03:48.459> commands<00:03:49.140> if<00:03:50.140> you<00:03:50.350> look<00:03:50.560> at

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
any other rly commands if you look at

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.319 
any other rly commands if you look at
the<00:03:50.799> 41<00:03:51.100> videos<00:03:51.549> they<00:03:51.940> will<00:03:52.090> have<00:03:52.209> the

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
the 41 videos they will have the

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:58.530 
the 41 videos they will have the
commands<00:03:53.459> written<00:03:54.459> for<00:03:54.700> you<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:55.470> if<00:03:57.030> just<00:03:58.030> get

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
commands written for you and if just get

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.270 
commands written for you and if just get
rid<00:03:58.630> of<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:58.930> /<00:03:59.380> of<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.650> beginning<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:00.160> they

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
rid of the / of the beginning and they

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.869 
rid of the / of the beginning and they
should<00:04:00.489> work<00:04:00.670> so<00:04:00.880> like<00:04:01.060> CG<00:04:01.510> under<00:04:01.810> shore<00:04:02.669> draw

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
should work so like CG under shore draw

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.819 
should work so like CG under shore draw
2d0<00:04:06.019> this<00:04:07.019> won't<00:04:07.230> do<00:04:07.319> anything<00:04:07.500> right<00:04:07.769> now

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
2d0 this won't do anything right now

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.970 
2d0 this won't do anything right now
because<00:04:08.159> I'm<00:04:08.370> not<00:04:08.519> in<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.670> game<00:04:08.879> but<00:04:09.709> that's<00:04:10.709> how

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
because I'm not in a game but that's how

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.220 
because I'm not in a game but that's how
you<00:04:11.069> would<00:04:11.459> do<00:04:11.579> it<00:04:11.610> without<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.569> slash<00:04:12.780> okay

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
you would do it without the slash okay

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.430 
you would do it without the slash okay
so<00:04:13.829> um<00:04:14.480> there's<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.569> bunch<00:04:15.750> of<00:04:15.840> command<00:04:16.139> so<00:04:16.350> you

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
so um there's a bunch of command so you

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.210 
so um there's a bunch of command so you
can<00:04:16.590> use<00:04:17.060> just<00:04:18.060> do<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.539> that<00:04:18.780> way<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.289> I'm

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
can use just do it that way and I'm

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.219 
can use just do it that way and I'm
