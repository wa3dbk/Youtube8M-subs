00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.789 
coincidence they're all features of
attractiveness<00:00:08.880> well<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.719> don't<00:00:10.170> I

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.230 

my<00:00:13.799> personal<00:00:14.309> view<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.580> attractiveness<00:00:15.030> is

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
my personal view of attractiveness is

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.480 
my personal view of attractiveness is
that<00:00:15.389> those<00:00:15.570> features<00:00:15.809> are<00:00:16.470> not<00:00:16.920> important<00:00:17.430> I

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
that those features are not important I

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.460 
that those features are not important I
suppose<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.940> how<00:00:18.090> they<00:00:18.270> correlate<00:00:18.990> with<00:00:19.289> one

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
suppose it's how they correlate with one

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.230 
suppose it's how they correlate with one
another<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.949> are<00:00:20.130> they<00:00:20.250> aligned<00:00:20.609> and

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
another and are they aligned and

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.820 
another and are they aligned and
