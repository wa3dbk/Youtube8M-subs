have this image in Rebecca's I have the
complete<00:02:30.220> theory<00:02:30.430> so<00:02:30.970> I'm<00:02:31.030> real<00:02:31.180> excited

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
complete theory so I'm real excited

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.949 
complete theory so I'm real excited
about<00:02:31.569> that<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.760> next<00:02:34.000> book<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.269> thought<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.660> saw

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
about that the next book I thought I saw

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.800 
about that the next book I thought I saw
on<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.860> story<00:02:36.099> sirens<00:02:36.519> website<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.239> that's

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
on the story sirens website and that's

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.500 
on the story sirens website and that's
why<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:37.989> picked<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.349> up<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.739> it<00:02:39.160> is<00:02:39.510> deception

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
why I picked it up and it is deception

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.290 
why I picked it up and it is deception
by<00:02:40.989> being<00:02:41.290> Nichols<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:42.849> can't<00:02:43.090> wait<00:02:43.209> to

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.970 

but<00:02:50.440> I'm<00:02:51.280> really<00:02:51.489> excited<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.940> read<00:02:52.060> this

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
the cover now the final books that i got

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.979 
the cover now the final books that i got
was<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:01.420> entire<00:03:01.750> Beach<00:03:02.049> one<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:04.690> says

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
was the entire Beach one and it says

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.270 
was the entire Beach one and it says
bloodlust<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:06.010> initiation<00:03:07.799> so<00:03:08.799> I'm<00:03:08.980> guessing

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
bloodlust and initiation so I'm guessing

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.490 
bloodlust and initiation so I'm guessing
this<00:03:09.760> is<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.090> bind<00:03:10.450> up<00:03:10.660> which<00:03:10.930> I<00:03:11.049> didn't<00:03:11.380> know<00:03:11.470> a

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
this is a bind up which I didn't know a

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.620 
this is a bind up which I didn't know a
minute<00:03:11.860> ago<00:03:12.840> but<00:03:14.010> yeah<00:03:15.010> it's<00:03:15.580> find<00:03:15.880> up<00:03:16.060> so

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
minute ago but yeah it's find up so

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.509 
minute ago but yeah it's find up so
that's<00:03:16.720> really<00:03:16.870> exciting<00:03:17.019> I<00:03:17.560> didn't<00:03:18.400> notice

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
that's really exciting I didn't notice

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.360 
that's really exciting I didn't notice
with<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.790> bind<00:03:18.970> up<00:03:19.150> but<00:03:19.989> so<00:03:20.320> vampire<00:03:20.950> beach<00:03:21.130> one
