and on our first day here actually we
were<00:06:07.360> only<00:06:07.510> in<00:06:07.720> the<00:06:07.930> sphere<00:06:08.080> about<00:06:08.560> 10<00:06:08.860> minutes

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
were only in the sphere about 10 minutes

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.580 
were only in the sphere about 10 minutes
and<00:06:09.520> we<00:06:10.270> had<00:06:10.419> a<00:06:10.449> hummingbird<00:06:11.020> at<00:06:11.169> the<00:06:11.260> window

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
and we had a hummingbird at the window

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.310 
and we had a hummingbird at the window
which<00:06:11.800> is<00:06:11.979> a<00:06:12.160> real<00:06:12.850> treat<00:06:13.090> which<00:06:14.020> you<00:06:14.169> don't

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
which is a real treat which you don't

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.110 
which is a real treat which you don't
see<00:06:14.500> very<00:06:14.710> often<00:06:16.919> so<00:06:17.919> this<00:06:18.430> this<00:06:18.760> is<00:06:18.940> our

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
see very often so this this is our

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.580 
see very often so this this is our
experience<00:06:19.810> in<00:06:20.260> the<00:06:20.680> sphere<00:06:20.860> and<00:06:22.229> if<00:06:23.229> we<00:06:23.410> take

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
experience in the sphere and if we take

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:29.270 
experience in the sphere and if we take
a<00:06:23.650> look<00:06:23.889> the<00:06:24.490> other<00:06:24.520> way<00:06:24.760> from<00:06:25.630> the<00:06:25.750> inside<00:06:26.229> out

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:42.930 

you<00:06:30.280> can<00:06:30.460> see<00:06:30.639> how<00:06:30.790> the<00:06:30.850> door<00:06:34.410> opens<00:06:35.410> outwards

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.520 

and<00:06:43.940> from<00:06:44.420> up<00:06:44.600> here<00:06:44.780> you<00:06:44.900> can<00:06:45.080> actually<00:06:45.290> see

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
and from up here you can actually see

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.100 
and from up here you can actually see
Eve<00:06:46.010> through<00:06:46.850> the<00:06:47.000> trees<00:06:47.270> it's<00:06:47.570> very<00:06:47.780> private

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
Eve through the trees it's very private

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.530 
Eve through the trees it's very private
the<00:06:48.500> windows<00:06:48.830> are<00:06:48.980> in<00:06:49.070> opposite<00:06:49.490> direction<00:06:49.670> so

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:52.540 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.300 

nobody's<00:06:53.540> really<00:06:54.020> looking<00:06:54.470> at<00:06:54.590> the<00:06:54.860> next

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
nobody's really looking at the next

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:09.580 
nobody's really looking at the next
person

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.450 

and<00:07:10.010> the<00:07:11.000> entire<00:07:11.330> spear<00:07:12.020> is<00:07:12.200> actually<00:07:13.040> held<00:07:13.250> to

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
and the entire spear is actually held to

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.720 
and the entire spear is actually held to
the<00:07:13.580> tree<00:07:13.820> by<00:07:14.090> ropes<00:07:14.860> nothing<00:07:15.860> is<00:07:16.010> hammered

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:16.730 
the tree by ropes nothing is hammered

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.150 
the tree by ropes nothing is hammered
into<00:07:16.850> the<00:07:17.090> trees<00:07:17.390> to<00:07:17.840> harm<00:07:18.410> the<00:07:18.560> trees<00:07:18.830> in<00:07:19.010> any

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160 
into the trees to harm the trees in any

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.080 
into the trees to harm the trees in any
way<00:07:19.340> so<00:07:20.090> it's<00:07:20.390> a<00:07:20.540> very<00:07:20.570> friendly<00:07:21.170> way<00:07:21.560> of

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.090 
way so it's a very friendly way of

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:28.000 
way so it's a very friendly way of
creating<00:07:23.090> a<00:07:24.160> suspended<00:07:25.160> treehouse
