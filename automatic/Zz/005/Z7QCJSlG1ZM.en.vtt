00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.319
 good boys 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.959
 here you have already we will see stuck a 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.959
 tablet 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.610
 As you can see this is going to be the site of 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.430
 let 's say the oven 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.250
 and you already have the floor where more or less 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.470
 the pothole let's say the fire there this what 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.690
 I'm leaving cut for because the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.610
 door theme sometimes I do a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.260
 invention to want to copy it because 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.330
 do not have to spend a lump on the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.910
 doors because in the end the others are worth 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.540
 are the doors to draw 50 or 60 turkeys 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.660
 70 for each force 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.090
 what I want here and throw to make a 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.580
 ornette over or outside of this 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.940
 an ornette and good the enclosure because that 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.310
 because with raviglione heat frames 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.190
 when going out as the heat circulates inside 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.680
 as in a coil I have already said 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.530
 against more travel have the heat more 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.350
 Brick take the same heat when not 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.200
 going outside is maintained throughout the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.050
 travel and that once they take these 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.119
 heat bricks to release them with a 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.979
 little in there with the penalties 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.369
 some slopes that I am removing them to 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.950
 oven throughout the day because that with 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.630
 little law to those who then we are going to do 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.120
 also the inventory to see if it 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.250
 we can connect 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.200
 to see how we can connect 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.680
 the tubes to see if even that's the 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.490
 heating then that to apply it all 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.790
 the same 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.320
 putting a tube here with the heat at 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.720
 The water that came to the 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.250
 circuit of the heaters as it does 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.900
 the same effect as turning on the 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.170
 normal heating that is the water 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.500
 hot climbs up and that pushes and 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.990
 it is the circuit that makes the 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.990
 hot water for everyone 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.600
 is that nature takes its things and 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.750
 you do not have to warm your head almost by 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.750
 nothing 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.000
 you know that here the light could 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.770
 have good then and others end and I 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.370
 then he already told you here a light that 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.370
 see better 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.730
 here you can not see anything 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:31.300
 I'm just saying 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.300
 well here is for you to see this step 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.470
 and good and shock that that binds 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.100
 I already tell you that if any invention for 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.710
 doors here for some couplings with the 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.900
 same brick doors are made for 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.210
 that we have cast iron for years 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.260
 50 for you if for one euro I make one 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.880
 door this exercise and in equality the 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.370
 the same material will keep the same 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.850
 heel but good that 's the shore to see 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.210
 if I prepare it 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.190
 we are going to all this 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.230
 good guys come see if it's the 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.230
 next is this more advanced
