00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.990
 fiber pool to manufacturers 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.280
 installers 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.260
 the installation is done only in one 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.790
 day 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.030
 thus minimizing damage to 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.310
 your land the implantation of the pool 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.510
 is made by a size gauge 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.980
 real according to a predetermined plan 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:31.650
 checking the level of the pool by 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:33.930
 field report the precautions 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.660
 necessary steps are taken to limit 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.030
 the damage that can be caused to 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.250
 your environment beginning of 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.059
 the excavation of the pool as well as 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.059
 adjacent sidewalks 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:58.719
 a geotextile membrane is installed at 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.550
 bottom of the excavation to prevent that 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.729
 of crushed stone beds 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.430
 mix with the earth a drain of 4 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:11.100
 inches is installed between the excavation 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.100
 and the French dreff difficult signal 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.010
 the final check of the level of the bed 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.170
 crushed stone is done by a 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:27.270
 phibro pool laser level owns 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.100
 all the equipment needed to 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.490
 facilitate transportation and installation 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.250
 of your pool a highly personal 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:44.430
 qualified to ensure the establishment of 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:47.270
 this one final level check 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.270
 of the swimming pool 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.840
 at 10 inches lower than the pool is 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.390
 installed a dewatering well of 10 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.850
 inch in diameter designed for the 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.469
 check and control of the tablecloth 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.629
 of phreatic water their show cement of the 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:12.260
 pool is made with stone 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:15.080
 crushed 2.2 push me only to 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.519
 that sand is not used because this 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.010
 matter over weeks 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.989
 this compact and has the effect of 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.989
 destabilize the level of the sidewalk 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.450
 the installation of the filtration system 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.340
 can be done indoors or 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.950
 outdoors 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.420
 special attention and breaks when 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.420
 the installation of piping 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.980
 excavation and installation of the 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.980
 pool ends in one day 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.590
 if you chose the sidewalk option 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.819
 of reinforced concrete here are the steps of 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.829
 realization the installation of the forms of the 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.250
 sidewalk is done according to a very plan 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.769
 determined with the client the application 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.500
 crushed stone inside the 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:21.239
 forms aims to well drained the 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.239
 surface plus sidewalk 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:33.390
 the application of a frame to do 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.390
 saincy aims to solidify the concrete 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.440
 concrete pouring is done by a 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.590
 team specialized in the field of 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.590
 swimming pool 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.490
 plastic expansion joints 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.470
 inserted during pouring of the concrete are 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.740
 used to prevent training 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.470
 cracks that could result from 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.750
 the effect of frost fixing lids 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.459
 black icm and dupuy dewatering 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.860
 as well as the exit ramp 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:16.739
 the aesthetic finish and the last 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:19.840
 step the freshly poured concrete 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:24.190
 acquires its final pint after 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:27.040
 few days installing your 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.169
 phibro pool and its sidewalk 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.169
 concrete is now completed
