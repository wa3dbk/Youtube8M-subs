it's<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.060> derivative<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.779> alia<00:00:28.050> again

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
it's a derivative of the alia again

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.339 
it's a derivative of the alia again
pressure<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.970> back<00:00:30.179> foot<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.289> to

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
pressure on the back foot it's going to

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.860 
pressure on the back foot it's going to
slide<00:00:31.590> up<00:00:31.619> as<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.880> slides<00:00:33.120> up<00:00:33.420> that's<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.780> to

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
slide up as it slides up that's going to

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.690 
slide up as it slides up that's going to
slide<00:00:34.140> off<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.649> left<00:00:34.890> hand<00:00:35.160> side<00:00:35.399> or<00:00:35.579> to

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
slide off to the left hand side or to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.139 
slide off to the left hand side or to
the<00:00:35.820> shoulder<00:00:36.239> side<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:37.190> hill<00:00:38.190> side<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the shoulder side the hill side of the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.299 
the shoulder side the hill side of the
board<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.660> as<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.350> does<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.530> that's<00:00:41.100> going

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
board and as it does that that's going

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.700 
board and as it does that that's going
to<00:00:41.370> cause<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.969> board<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.270> flip<00:00:42.719> over<00:00:43.440> like

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
to cause the board to flip over like

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.729 
to cause the board to flip over like
that<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.100> you're<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.579> midair<00:00:45.530> completely<00:00:46.530> 360

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
that as you're in midair completely 360

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.350 
that as you're in midair completely 360
and<00:00:47.340> then<00:00:48.030> laying<00:00:48.210> back<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.660> board

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
and then laying back on the board

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.569 
and then laying back on the board
quite<00:00:51.360> hard<00:00:51.539> tricked<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.410> grasp<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.280> once<00:00:53.460> you

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
quite hard tricked to grasp but once you

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.639 
quite hard tricked to grasp but once you
get<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.449> really<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:54.960> fun<00:00:55.110> trick

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
get it it's a really really fun trick

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.350 
get it it's a really really fun trick
and<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.190> done<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.820> quite<00:00:57.000> an<00:00:57.120> impressive

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
and can be done and quite an impressive

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.869 
and can be done and quite an impressive
looking<00:00:57.809> trick<00:00:58.050> as<00:00:58.170> well<00:00:58.280> possibly<00:00:59.280> my

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
looking trick as well possibly my

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.310 
looking trick as well possibly my
favorite<00:01:00.270> trick<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> look<00:01:01.230> at

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
favorite trick so if we have a look at

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.010 
favorite trick so if we have a look at
it<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.800> all<00:01:02.489> about<00:01:02.730> foot<00:01:03.059> stance<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:06.780> is

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
it like this all about foot stance it is

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.789 
it like this all about foot stance it is
physics<00:01:07.799> on<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.130> trick<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> one<00:01:10.380> foot<00:01:10.650> is

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
physics on this trick so one foot is

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.200 
physics on this trick so one foot is
going<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> need<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.430> slightly<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.119> side

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
going to need to be slightly to the side

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.240 
going to need to be slightly to the side
so<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.590> that's<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.040> allow<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
so you can see that's going to allow it

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.450 
so you can see that's going to allow it
to<00:01:14.610> tilt<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.360> move<00:01:15.600> off<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.350> front<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:17.220> kick

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
to tilt and move off the front then kick

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.420 
to tilt and move off the front then kick
the<00:01:17.580> board<00:01:17.820> out<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.270> back<00:01:19.200> foot<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:20.250> to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the board out a back foot is going to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.030 
the board out a back foot is going to
need<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.700> be<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.990> tail<00:01:22.200> there<00:01:22.500> that's<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
need to be on the tail there that's the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.710 
need to be on the tail there that's the
one<00:01:23.159> that's<00:01:23.310> applying<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.820> pressure<00:01:24.000> down

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
one that's applying the pressure down

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.039 
one that's applying the pressure down
like<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.590> you're<00:01:25.680> going<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.830> come<00:01:26.040> down

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
like that so you're going to come down

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.899 
like that so you're going to come down
front<00:01:28.049> foots<00:01:28.290> going<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.530> move<00:01:28.710> slide<00:01:29.579> off<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
front foots going to move slide off the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.630 
front foots going to move slide off the
corner<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.479> kick<00:01:31.049> out<00:01:31.259> as<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.040> kicks<00:01:32.220> out<00:01:32.460> when

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
corner and kick out as it kicks out when

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.460 
corner and kick out as it kicks out when
it<00:01:32.759> hits<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.090> tip<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:33.960> going<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.170> push<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
it hits that tip it's going to push the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.999 
it hits that tip it's going to push the
board<00:01:34.710> around<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.409> then<00:01:37.409> over<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
board around like that and then over and

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.670 
board around like that and then over and
down<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.329> very<00:01:42.540> important<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.470> work

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
down so it's very important just to work

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.410 
down so it's very important just to work
out<00:01:43.920> exactly<00:01:44.159> where<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.790> need<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.060> put<00:01:45.240> your

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
out exactly where you need to put your

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.359 
out exactly where you need to put your
feet<00:01:45.630> for<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:45.930> trick<00:01:46.229> if<00:01:46.829> you're<00:01:46.920> trying<00:01:47.189> at

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
feet for this trick if you're trying at

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.460 
feet for this trick if you're trying at
it<00:01:47.490> up<00:01:47.700> here<00:01:48.090> right<00:01:48.810> there<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.290> doesn't

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
it up here right there and it doesn't

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.570 
it up here right there and it doesn't
work

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
work

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.050 
work
that<00:01:51.150> means<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.780> may<00:01:51.930> need<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.290> move<00:01:52.470> foot<00:01:53.160> so

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
that means you may need to move foot so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.000 
that means you may need to move foot so
trial<00:01:54.480> and<00:01:54.630> error<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.870> this<00:01:55.050> one<00:01:55.260> can<00:01:55.800> try

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
trial and error on this one can try

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.980 
trial and error on this one can try
putting<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.880> right<00:01:57.180> down<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.660> bottom<00:01:57.810> and

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
putting it right down on the bottom and

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.590 
putting it right down on the bottom and
just<00:01:58.170> kicking<00:01:58.350> down<00:01:58.970> that's<00:01:59.970> a<00:02:00.090> good<00:02:00.270> start

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
just kicking down that's a good start

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.930 
just kicking down that's a good start
for<00:02:00.690> trying<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:01.080> learn<00:02:01.230> how<00:02:01.440> to<00:02:01.470> kickflip<00:02:04.940> once

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
for trying to learn how to kickflip once

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.340 
for trying to learn how to kickflip once
you<00:02:06.060> figured<00:02:06.330> out<00:02:06.420> exactly<00:02:06.960> where<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.320> is

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
you figured out exactly where it is

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.650 
you figured out exactly where it is
that's<00:02:07.710> making<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.100> board<00:02:08.250> flip<00:02:08.660> together

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
that's making the board flip together

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.540 
that's making the board flip together
the<00:02:09.840> pressure<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:12.150> move<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.420> round<00:02:13.340> gather<00:02:14.340> the
