00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
through to this modern out which

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.029 
through to this modern out which

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
you haven't driven it but from a static

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.440 
you haven't driven it but from a static
situation<00:02:58.599> is<00:02:59.049> fantastic<00:02:59.859> and<00:03:00.189> it<00:03:01.150> would<00:03:01.359> have

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
situation is fantastic and it would have

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.000 
situation is fantastic and it would have
been<00:03:01.569> quite<00:03:01.720> nice<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:02.079> have<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.319> option<00:03:02.530> of

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
been quite nice to have the option of

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.599 
been quite nice to have the option of
the<00:03:03.879> air<00:03:04.000> scarf<00:03:04.389> I<00:03:05.169> think<00:03:05.650> in<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.829> BMW<00:03:06.040> tend<00:03:06.549> to

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
the air scarf I think in the BMW tend to

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.309 
the air scarf I think in the BMW tend to
be<00:03:06.700> quite<00:03:06.790> well<00:03:07.030> cocooned<00:03:07.419> anyway<00:03:07.720> so

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
be quite well cocooned anyway so

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.809 
be quite well cocooned anyway so
probably<00:03:08.680> not<00:03:08.889> going<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.099> be<00:03:09.220> an<00:03:09.310> issue<00:03:09.430> I

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
probably not going to be an issue I

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.520 
probably not going to be an issue I
think<00:03:10.629> it's<00:03:10.810> got<00:03:11.109> a<00:03:11.439> maturity<00:03:12.359> that<00:03:13.530> has

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
think it's got a maturity that has

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.619 
think it's got a maturity that has
progressed<00:03:15.340> from<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.730> original<00:03:16.359> designed
