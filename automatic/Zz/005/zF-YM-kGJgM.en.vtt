I'm in Santa Barbara where pansy start

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.790 
I'm in Santa Barbara where pansy start
to<00:00:16.420> appear<00:00:16.840> in<00:00:17.080> early<00:00:18.040> fall<00:00:18.340> and<00:00:18.760> then<00:00:19.390> they're

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
to appear in early fall and then they're

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.500 
to appear in early fall and then they're
going<00:00:20.800> out<00:00:21.010> out<00:00:21.190> by<00:00:21.400> late<00:00:21.640> spring<00:00:21.820> where<00:00:22.330> you

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
going out out by late spring where you

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.900 
going out out by late spring where you
are<00:00:22.690> they<00:00:23.230> could<00:00:23.410> be<00:00:23.440> more<00:00:23.710> of<00:00:23.770> a<00:00:23.920> spring<00:00:24.250> to

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
are they could be more of a spring to

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.090 
are they could be more of a spring to
summer<00:00:25.480> plant<00:00:26.250> but<00:00:27.250> they<00:00:27.790> like<00:00:28.090> full<00:00:28.780> Sun<00:00:29.140> but

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
summer plant but they like full Sun but

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.040 
summer plant but they like full Sun but
they<00:00:30.220> don't<00:00:30.400> like<00:00:30.610> hot<00:00:30.940> Sun<00:00:31.300> so<00:00:31.330> that's<00:00:31.840> why

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
they don't like hot Sun so that's why

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.779 
they don't like hot Sun so that's why
they<00:00:32.259> usually<00:00:32.439> don't<00:00:32.800> make<00:00:33.070> it<00:00:33.460> into<00:00:33.699> the

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789 
they usually don't make it into the

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.209 
they usually don't make it into the
summer<00:00:34.059> here<00:00:34.750> so<00:00:35.050> just<00:00:35.469> make<00:00:35.739> sure<00:00:35.859> you<00:00:36.070> give

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
summer here so just make sure you give

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.040 
summer here so just make sure you give
them<00:00:36.339> a<00:00:36.519> lot<00:00:36.789> of<00:00:36.940> light<00:00:37.179> some<00:00:37.570> of<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.780> smaller

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
them a lot of light some of the smaller

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.290 
them a lot of light some of the smaller
varieties<00:00:38.469> and<00:00:38.769> the<00:00:38.890> little<00:00:39.100> violas<00:00:39.550> can<00:00:40.120> take

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
varieties and the little violas can take

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.450 
varieties and the little violas can take
part<00:00:40.510> Sun<00:00:40.809> but<00:00:41.469> they're<00:00:41.649> pretty<00:00:41.829> much<00:00:42.100> of<00:00:42.399> a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
part Sun but they're pretty much of a

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.639 
part Sun but they're pretty much of a
full<00:00:42.699> Sun<00:00:42.940> plant<00:00:43.239> and<00:00:43.570> they<00:00:43.660> need<00:00:43.870> that<00:00:43.899> to

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
full Sun plant and they need that to

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.579 
full Sun plant and they need that to
flower<00:00:44.949> and<00:00:45.429> they<00:00:45.909> also<00:00:46.089> need<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.480> nice<00:00:46.989> rich

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
flower and they also need a nice rich

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.149 
flower and they also need a nice rich
soils<00:00:48.579> so<00:00:49.120> you<00:00:49.179> want<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.659> amend<00:00:50.379> whatever

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
soils so you want to amend whatever

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:52.349 
soils so you want to amend whatever
you're<00:00:51.339> planting<00:00:51.760> if<00:00:51.850> you're<00:00:51.940> planting<00:00:52.149> in

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
you're planting if you're planting in

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.869 
you're planting if you're planting in
the<00:00:52.420> garden<00:00:52.870> or<00:00:53.289> a<00:00:53.350> pot<00:00:53.800> you<00:00:54.039> want<00:00:54.309> to<00:00:54.429> amend<00:00:54.760> it

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
the garden or a pot you want to amend it

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.020 
the garden or a pot you want to amend it
with<00:00:54.909> a<00:00:55.059> lot<00:00:55.359> of<00:00:55.569> compost<00:00:56.559> worm<00:00:57.069> compost<00:00:57.730> and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
with a lot of compost worm compost and

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.680 
with a lot of compost worm compost and
or<00:00:58.539> chicken<00:00:59.289> manure<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.920> they<00:01:00.909> also<00:01:01.089> also

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
or chicken manure and they also also

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.809 
or chicken manure and they also also
like<00:01:01.899> good<00:01:02.140> drainage<00:01:02.379> too<00:01:02.859> they<00:01:03.429> can<00:01:03.460> be<00:01:03.789> a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
like good drainage too they can be a

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:05.790 
like good drainage too they can be a
little<00:01:04.449> tricky<00:01:04.780> because<00:01:04.960> if<00:01:05.230> they<00:01:05.380> go<00:01:05.530> dry

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
little tricky because if they go dry

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.880 
little tricky because if they go dry
they'll<00:01:06.580> go<00:01:06.790> all<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.450> way<00:01:07.480> down<00:01:07.870> and<00:01:08.230> if<00:01:08.740> you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
they'll go all the way down and if you

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.410 
they'll go all the way down and if you
give<00:01:09.070> them<00:01:09.280> too<00:01:09.550> much<00:01:09.730> water<00:01:10.060> they<00:01:10.390> are

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
give them too much water they are

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.440 
give them too much water they are
subject<00:01:11.290> to<00:01:11.350> rot<00:01:11.650> so<00:01:12.490> so<00:01:13.030> you<00:01:13.120> want<00:01:13.270> to<00:01:13.330> make

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
subject to rot so so you want to make

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.170 
subject to rot so so you want to make
sure<00:01:13.480> you<00:01:13.750> get<00:01:13.930> your<00:01:14.080> watering<00:01:14.610> fine<00:01:15.610> on<00:01:15.880> that

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
sure you get your watering fine on that

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.020 
sure you get your watering fine on that
and<00:01:16.630> in<00:01:17.350> terms<00:01:17.620> of<00:01:17.860> a<00:01:17.920> fertilizer<00:01:18.460> you<00:01:18.820> might

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
and in terms of a fertilizer you might

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.980 
and in terms of a fertilizer you might
want<00:01:19.300> to<00:01:19.450> just<00:01:19.810> give<00:01:20.110> them<00:01:20.290> an<00:01:20.470> organic<00:01:21.990> rose

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
want to just give them an organic rose

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.440 
want to just give them an organic rose
and<00:01:23.200> flower<00:01:23.410> food<00:01:23.770> that<00:01:24.130> would<00:01:24.280> be<00:01:24.430> fine<00:01:25.000> at

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
and flower food that would be fine at

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.030 
and flower food that would be fine at
the<00:01:25.570> beginning<00:01:26.020> when<00:01:26.500> you<00:01:26.590> plant<00:01:26.860> them

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
the beginning when you plant them

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.800 
the beginning when you plant them
because<00:01:27.790> though<00:01:27.940> because<00:01:28.570> they're<00:01:28.660> only

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
because though because they're only

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.340 
because though because they're only
going<00:01:29.020> to<00:01:29.110> go<00:01:29.230> for<00:01:29.860> probably<00:01:30.960> six<00:01:31.960> to<00:01:32.020> seven

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
going to go for probably six to seven

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.650 
going to go for probably six to seven
months<00:01:32.620> and<00:01:33.190> if<00:01:33.580> you<00:01:33.880> want<00:01:34.120> to<00:01:34.240> you<00:01:34.330> can<00:01:34.540> give

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
months and if you want to you can give

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.920 
months and if you want to you can give
them<00:01:34.840> another<00:01:35.340> fertilizing<00:01:36.340> in<00:01:36.490> between<00:01:36.930> and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
them another fertilizing in between and

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.790 
them another fertilizing in between and
in<00:01:38.440> terms<00:01:38.980> of<00:01:39.780> keeping<00:01:40.780> them<00:01:41.050> flowering<00:01:41.560> well

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
in terms of keeping them flowering well

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.980 
in terms of keeping them flowering well
you<00:01:42.400> just<00:01:42.640> want<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.270> take<00:01:43.420> off<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:43.630> spent

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
you just want to take off the spent

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
you just want to take off the spent
blooms<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:45.100> you<00:01:45.430> just<00:01:45.760> I<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:47.470> do<00:01:47.620> it<00:01:47.770> with<00:01:47.890> my

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
blooms and you just I can do it with my

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.150 
blooms and you just I can do it with my
fingernail<00:01:48.400> here<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:49.750> take<00:01:50.620> off<00:01:50.800> the<00:01:50.950> spent

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
fingernail here just take off the spent

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.220 
fingernail here just take off the spent
ones<00:01:51.370> these<00:01:51.940> are<00:01:52.180> fairly<00:01:52.420> young<00:01:52.780> so<00:01:53.110> they

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
ones these are fairly young so they

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.160 
ones these are fairly young so they
aren't<00:01:53.920> too<00:01:54.100> big<00:01:54.310> yet<00:01:54.550> but<00:01:55.180> they<00:01:55.300> tend<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:55.900> grow

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
aren't too big yet but they tend to grow

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.710 
aren't too big yet but they tend to grow
and<00:01:56.680> they<00:01:56.800> can<00:01:56.830> get<00:01:57.040> a<00:01:57.100> little<00:01:57.250> rangy<00:01:57.820> so<00:01:58.330> you

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
and they can get a little rangy so you

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.570 
and they can get a little rangy so you
might<00:01:59.050> want<00:01:59.230> to<00:01:59.290> pinch<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.950> new<00:02:00.130> growth<00:02:00.400> a

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
might want to pinch the new growth a

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.570 
might want to pinch the new growth a
little<00:02:00.700> bit<00:02:00.970> just<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.360> keep<00:02:01.900> them<00:02:02.170> in<00:02:02.410> check

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
little bit just to keep them in check

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.320
