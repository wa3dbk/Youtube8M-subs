waves as the days go ahead one important
thing<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.520> note<00:01:02.670> about<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> judge<00:01:03.719> said

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
thing to note about what the judge said

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.740 
thing to note about what the judge said
was<00:01:04.350> his<00:01:04.769> reasoning<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.939> decision<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
was his reasoning in the decision and

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.410 
was his reasoning in the decision and
what<00:01:06.930> he<00:01:07.140> said<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:08.070> he<00:01:08.280> rejects<00:01:09.030> all<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
what he said is that he rejects all the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.090 
what he said is that he rejects all the
theories<00:01:09.659> put<00:01:09.960> forward<00:01:10.020> by<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.619> defense

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
theories put forward by the defense

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.830 
theories put forward by the defense
about<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> possibility<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.390> someone<00:01:12.689> else

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
about the possibility that someone else

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.440 
about the possibility that someone else
was<00:01:13.110> responsible<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:14.280> these<00:01:14.369> bombings<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
was responsible for these bombings and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.730 
was responsible for these bombings and
the<00:01:15.570> reason<00:01:15.900> that's<00:01:16.049> important<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.680> because

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the reason that's important is because

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.410 
the reason that's important is because
there<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> great<00:01:17.549> deal<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.729> thought<00:01:18.119> in

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
there is a great deal of thought in

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.050

extreme Spanish society that perhaps

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.870 
process of bringing closure at least to
the<00:02:38.670> idea<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.390> who<00:02:40.200> did<00:02:40.470> this<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.890> hopefully

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
the idea of who did this and hopefully

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.180 
the idea of who did this and hopefully
