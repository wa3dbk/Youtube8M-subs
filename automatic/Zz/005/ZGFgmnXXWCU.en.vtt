 Hello girls, today's video was specially made for meucrespo.com.br channel 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.590
 and we'll learn how to make that gorgeous hairstyle that I'm here now 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.030
 which is a braid inlaid for curly hair this hairstyle is super cool for you to wear 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.830
 in the day to day to give an innovated there in the visual 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.250
 so come with me to the tutorial of this incredible hairstyle 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.070
 so let's go 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.290
 I start by separating the hair a little, kind of untangled with my fingers like this 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.810
 to make it easier to braid after that let's separate the hair in two 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.770
 parts: the top part of the head and the rest of the hair. 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.940
 The top part of the head you will divide into three more equal parts 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.879
 Then you will start to make a normal braid 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.860
 As soon as you braid your hair, you add a lock of hair in each 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.179
 part of the braid. 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:07.810
 So that's it, you braid once and add strand of hair, braid again and add 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:19.540
 a lock of hair on each part of the braid. 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.840
 Let's repeat this process all over our hair. 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.360
 You can stop the braid at the nape of the neck or complete the whole hair with the braid, 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.710
 It also looks super cute. 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.659
 But today I decided to make this braid, which I thought has a more bare face, 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:33.979
 I found it very different. 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.649
 It is a braid with a touch of jujube. 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:50.659
 And when it's finished, just attach it with a black rubber band. 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.850
 Then I'm going to give a cup of coffee at the root of the braid, pulling it with my fingers to give a volume 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.810
 the more at the root And if some little chains stand up, it's just 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.880
 apply a little mousse to him to sit down and be all cute. 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:10.799
 And look how amazing that got our braid built right in. 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.510
 super stripped and very easy to make. 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.060
 What's up? 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.202
 A kiss and until the next video, bye!
