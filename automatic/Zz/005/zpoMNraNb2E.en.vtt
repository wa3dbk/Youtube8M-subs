00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
going to be saying a sort of quick tip

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.320 
going to be saying a sort of quick tip

tutorial sort of thing over the next few
weeks<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.830> first<00:00:20.250> ones<00:00:20.520> death<00:00:20.730> it's

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
weeks and this the first ones death it's

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.060 
weeks and this the first ones death it's
a<00:00:21.119> helicopter<00:00:21.689> or<00:00:22.080> something<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.590> sort<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:22.949> you

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
a helicopter or something so sort of you

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.420 
a helicopter or something so sort of you
can<00:00:23.189> hear<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.430> um<00:00:24.180> anyway<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.430> tutorial

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
can hear that um anyway the the tutorial

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.040 
can hear that um anyway the the tutorial
today<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.730> going<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.910> be<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.570> symmetry

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
today is going to be on the symmetry

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.980 
today is going to be on the symmetry
objects<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.070> how<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.340> texture<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.599> if<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
objects and how to texture it so if I

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.819 
objects and how to texture it so if I
drop<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:32.210> symmetry<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.570> cinema<00:00:34.230> 4d<00:00:34.469> and

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
drop in a symmetry in a cinema 4d and

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.319 
drop in a symmetry in a cinema 4d and
then<00:00:35.040> throw<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.120> cube<00:00:37.579> if<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:38.760> grab<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> cube

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
then throw in a cube if we grab the cube

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.420 
then throw in a cube if we grab the cube
and<00:00:39.540> move<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.899> along<00:00:39.989> we<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.129> see<00:00:41.280> it's

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
and move it along we can see it's

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.799 
and move it along we can see it's
reflected<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> other<00:00:42.329> side<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:42.780> a

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
reflected in the other side like a

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.240 
reflected in the other side like a
mirror<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.410> that's<00:00:43.530> what<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.710> symmetry<00:00:44.070> does

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
mirror and that's what the symmetry does

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.660 
mirror and that's what the symmetry does
we<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.550> reflect<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.809> whichever<00:00:46.140> access<00:00:46.950> we

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
we can reflect it in whichever access we

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.020 
we can reflect it in whichever access we
want<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.950> problem<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.489> ran<00:00:50.520> into

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
want so the problem that I ran into

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.150 
want so the problem that I ran into
when<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.360> was<00:00:51.809> working<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.440> was<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
when I was working with this was the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.069 
when I was working with this was the
texturing<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.910> was<00:00:54.539> working<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> project

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
texturing I was working on a project

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.560 
texturing I was working on a project
where<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.379> had<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.800> double<00:00:56.640> door<00:00:56.850> that's<00:00:57.120> slid

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
where I had a double door that's slid

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.119 
where I had a double door that's slid
open<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.920> and<00:01:00.320> what<00:01:01.320> happened<00:01:01.620> was<00:01:01.770> one

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
open like this and what happened was one

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.590 
open like this and what happened was one
side<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> door<00:01:02.579> was<00:01:02.670> modelled<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
side of the door was modelled and the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.030 
side of the door was modelled and the
other<00:01:03.719> side<00:01:03.930> was<00:01:04.080> reflected<00:01:04.559> see<00:01:04.710> just<00:01:04.890> move

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
other side was reflected see just move

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.359 
other side was reflected see just move
one<00:01:05.220> door<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.670> they<00:01:05.790> came<00:01:06.570> open<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:07.049> this

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
one door and they came open like this

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.800 
one door and they came open like this
and<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.729> was<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> great<00:01:09.119> until<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.570> start

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
and that was a great until I start

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.800 
and that was a great until I start
texturing<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.490> ran<00:01:11.700> into<00:01:11.909> some<00:01:12.270> strange

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
texturing it and I ran into some strange

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.410 
texturing it and I ran into some strange
problems<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.520> was<00:01:14.640> using<00:01:14.820> cubic

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
problems because I was using cubic

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.170 
problems because I was using cubic
mapping<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.140> eww<00:01:16.770> mapping<00:01:17.189> oh<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:18.000> with

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
mapping and not eww mapping oh so with

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.850 
mapping and not eww mapping oh so with
the<00:01:18.270> UVW<00:01:18.630> mapping<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.470> move<00:01:19.650> it

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the UVW mapping if I move it

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.020 
the UVW mapping if I move it
everything's<00:01:20.520> fine

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
everything's fine

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.690 
everything's fine
but<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.509> switch<00:01:21.720> its<00:01:21.900> cubic<00:01:22.549> we<00:01:23.549> get

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
but you see if I switch its cubic we get

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.580 
but you see if I switch its cubic we get
this<00:01:23.820> strange<00:01:24.299> effect<00:01:24.810> as<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.170> we're<00:01:25.380> sort

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
this strange effect as if we're sort

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.620 
this strange effect as if we're sort
scrolling<00:01:26.369> along<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.729> texture<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.299> other

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
scrolling along the texture with other

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.440 
scrolling along the texture with other
objects<00:01:28.229> now<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.860> fix<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.610> all<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.240> have<00:01:30.329> to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
objects now to fix this all you have to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.990 
objects now to fix this all you have to
do<00:01:30.600> right<00:01:31.259> click<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> cube<00:01:31.920> come<00:01:32.549> cinema

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
do right click on the cube come cinema

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.950 
do right click on the cube come cinema
4d<00:01:33.240> tags<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.990> click<00:01:34.710> stick<00:01:35.400> texture<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.750> that

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
4d tags and click stick texture and that

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.370 
4d tags and click stick texture and that
should<00:01:37.369> basically<00:01:38.369> just<00:01:38.970> stick<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.960> texture

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
should basically just stick the texture

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.429 
should basically just stick the texture
to<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.799> cube<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.220> stop<00:01:41.490> its<00:01:41.640> scrolling<00:01:42.030> along

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
to the cube and stop its scrolling along

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.600 
to the cube and stop its scrolling along
so<00:01:43.439> that's<00:01:43.770> all<00:01:43.950> you're<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.250> cover<00:01:44.369> for

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
so that's all you're going to cover for

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.850 
so that's all you're going to cover for
