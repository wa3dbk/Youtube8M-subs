00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.290
 his job is house fitter in 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.160
 wood 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.830
 so here is frederic materials 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.750
 ecological low vegetation insulation 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.699
 energy consumption the house to 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.939
 wood frame is promised a bright future 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.740
 fuck pillar chevron is 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.060
 frederic who assembles them do you in 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.730
 do not do it for the strut 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.920
 Frederic is very precise to be super 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.500
 accurate is still the structure of 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.430
 the house is what holds all our 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.370
 hearts level the lighting the level that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.789
 must be hyper precise because if this 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.579
 that is done is not not right or 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.070
 is not my skin or do not hold it 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.289
 all may not see me before 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.809
 mount the frederic belt studied the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.579
 plans studies haircut measures angles 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.960
 pre- assembled parts in workshops 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.649
 have come up here like a game of 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.870
 construction 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.250
 of course there is the computer and the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.320
 numerically controlled machines 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.030
 but you have to have a look these 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.369
 houses are thought by engineers 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.460
 and all that but do not have the experience 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.380
 to sing so we're trying 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.689
 to improve it 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.740
 to change some things everything is 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:24.259
 calm and everything has to be ready otherwise the 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.920
 house too short for across where we 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.060
 risk an accident during the pre 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.039
 factory assembly 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.380
 the pieces have received anti 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.060
 mold of the ready to build which 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.600
 still requires precision 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.920
 in the gesture and some agility 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.000
 it's better not to be afraid of 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.569
 heights on these 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.090
 but we have the habit we know we're going 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.590
 not below charges 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.770
 we try to hope and who has been a 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.740
 maximum gold the director's job 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.140
 drink a lot of different quality 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.610
 powers like to work in a team and 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.490
 outdoor footage who loved work 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.840
 a motor someone very organized who 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.420
 must be able to adapt to find 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.700
 solutions to people's problems 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.160
 who must 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.860
 to be mobile in terms 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.269
 which must resell and 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.459
 technical knowledge of course 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.709
 that's how this advanced technician and 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.519
 so be able to adapt and train from 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:25.630
 way regularly at school I was in to 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:27.150
 his will and progress and then after we get 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.410
 feel there I had the opportunity 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.090
 to go and work a little shepherd 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.830
 power essama direct more more than the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.130
 mass opened so I started there 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.080
 in during the winter period one 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.420
 can choose formations that 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.250
 corresponds to our profession but we can 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.019
 go to training every year 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.880
 look at the alternating force and the 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.920
 Frederic finesse has a very big 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.569
 knowledge of the material he knows the 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.150
 differences in resistance and 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.209
 softness of the chestnut or 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.670
 coc loot hr frederic what would we do 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.030
 without you we communicate so much 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.040
 to be the masson encounter a problem 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.290
 we change directly our 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.569
 working techniques would have acted 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.440
 directly corneau there is a good 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.100
 communication 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.380
 we arrive virtually nothing 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.120
 we assemble pieces together and for 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.070
 Finally it made a home for us 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.250
 who counts is childhood butts 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.250
 who knows 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.920
 good but you are salam
