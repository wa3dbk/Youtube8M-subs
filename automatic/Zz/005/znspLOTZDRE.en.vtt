00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.560
 It can 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.309
 good 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.649
 I think we played a first time 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.629
 more organized than the second the second 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.629
 the valence came on us and 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.630
 our way of attack was against 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.730
 even so we also had 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.440
 clear situations to mark that we 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.840
 they could have given the game I think 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.670
 we played a very intense game very 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.690
 disputed area area with a lot 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.290
 dynamism where the middle of the field who 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.850
 resolved the circulation could attack in 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.180
 the first time as I said I just 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.070
 it seems that we play more organized and the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.900
 circulation happened in the second time 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.850
 our transitions will be towards 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.400
 forward very vertical because it was 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.990
 open the counterattack anyway 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.869
 a result that good not us 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.729
 it serves but that play as equals 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.330
 against the fourth classified team of 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.810
 the dark league will play a match with 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.420
 personality and I think in the past 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.990
 10 minutes to earn it 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.939
 leaves us some satisfaction we come to 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.750
 a very difficult field where they had 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.600
 lost most of the equipment and 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.220
 we were able to translate our football 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.899
 play against and defend in the 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.080
 second time against a lot of people who 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.970
 overturned our opponent in attack and by 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.209
 centimeters we could not get the second 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.550
 goal that would have been fantastic because 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.090
 give us 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.090
 Victory 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.319
 and I have one more year of contract 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.319
 if the club does not think otherwise I think 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.319
 respect 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.580
 sometimes a fantastic defender a 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.030
 player of a 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.880
 physical ability to cover the entire field 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.260
 with a defensive skill a trade 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.750
 defensive and instinctive almost with big 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.850
 physical qualities but especially with 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.000
 a point of aggressiveness that 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.670
 transforms into a fantastic defense I think 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.470
 that not only defends but has 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.840
 unlocked parties inclusive by the 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.370
 Valencia with its aerial game and we are 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.250
 in front of one of the great defenders 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.970
 of Argentine history and this area 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.970
 Of course 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.470
 yes 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.319
 if we review our league we have played 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.140
 very good matches against the 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.100
 ranked up and we've had 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.330
 problems with those classified towards 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.560
 down maybe because we can apply it 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.150
 in our pressure for that in teams 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.040
 who risk the ball or believe in the 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.610
 circulation and then we can 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.770
 press them and when we play 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.140
 we can hurt you today I think we saw 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.049
 a game played with great players 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.500
 that still at a very intense intensity 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.210
 high where seville forgiveness the 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.430
 Valencia 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.510
 organized and associated and we now to 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.390
 the contra we could mark or hurt 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.210
 I leave with the feeling of 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.920
 have lost two points maybe that's 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.030
 a look at the counterattacks 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.280
 failed 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.040
 have won one to contain all the 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.800
 valence attack and with a 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.639
 intimate satisfaction of planting against 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.129
 the fourth classified and tell him of what 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.530
 we want to win and we want to practice 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.300
 our football our idea in front of 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.870
 them and we believe that also the 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.870
 we can beat 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.810
 Thank you
