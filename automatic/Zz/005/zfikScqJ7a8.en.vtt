00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.509
 so this is the first time 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:16.150
 present at a show this press 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.519
 864 which is a model that has been around since 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.039
 last year but with an option that 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:24.089
 is called the b their self motion in this 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.070
 piece is in isobus configuration 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:29.859
 that is, it communicates with the 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.650
 tractor via i would say a language 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:36.430
 international isobus and it's a 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.190
 first that lippi and good gives some 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.469
 tractor orders the tractor becomes 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.300
 the slave of the press that's really 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.690
 a first then the peculiarity 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.750
 what is it that you have three in 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.260
 formation ie the opening of the 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.539
 door 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.879
 the bullet diameter but also the 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.460
 discharge the ball are sent to 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:01.269
 electronic communication box 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.620
 who is mounted on the press in this 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.710
 electronic box that goes up on the 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.159
 press is loaded software that 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.280
 is called b their self motion that goes to him 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.310
 send information via the 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.850
 isobus communication other actors for 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.170
 ask him to stop starting from 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.610
 trigger the binding to open the door 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.579
 to be certain that the ball is well 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.220
 charges and to close the door and 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.890
 then to give a signal via the 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.750
 greenstar console with water booths 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.979
 driver to restart before 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.259
 tractors 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.990
 it's 75% of the manipulations that are 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.369
 canceled i would say and it's really a 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.929
 great comfort to make a ball 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.600
 with a traditional press this is at 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:51.539
 minimum 4 manipulation ie a 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.700
 declutching a braking an opening of 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.200
 door sloping 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.600
 a step back often to put 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.119
 the ball reclosing doors and re 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.210
 walk forward so a ball to the minute 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.060
 c4 minimum handling on time 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.319
 you imagine these 240 manipulation of the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.209
 fate of long days of pressing 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.190
 10 hours for example its 2400 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.760
 handling by the day we do not go 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.769
 account 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.450
 that's why chauffeur are hyper 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.780
 tired when he leaves and that's very 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.200
 tiring and his subjects to errors of 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.160
 driving and well there is reduced to a 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.110
 handling the pressing of a ring 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.640
 frames products so be 25% 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.410
 only 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.870
 ie at 60 manipulation per hour 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.019
 and 600 handling a day instead of 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.700
 2400 that really makes the difference 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.470
 especially since the manipulations the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.000
 manipulation that asked the only 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.920
 it's just to restart 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.750
 before the tractor and that is to say that the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.329
 driver is sitting right in his seat 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.560
 to restart before then 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.959
 the manipulations he was doing 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.269
 usually had turned back so 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.280
 return to open the door of 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.700
 close the door but it's the most 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.130
 painless 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.819
 so I would say from a fatigue point of view 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.250
 of the driver 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.780
 we reduce it but really 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.370
 sensitive 1 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.780
 it allows him to work more 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.049
 long time and have fewer problems 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.049
 health
