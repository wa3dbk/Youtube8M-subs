pedagogy during this professional
development<00:00:10.500> day<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.889> decided<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.910> would

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
development day I decided that I would

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.680 
development day I decided that I would
make<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.540> traditional<00:00:13.170> new<00:00:13.860> yak<00:00:14.099> bola<00:00:14.690> this

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
make a traditional new yak bola this

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.620 
make a traditional new yak bola this
involved<00:00:16.520> braiding<00:00:17.520> four<00:00:18.120> ropes<00:00:18.390> together

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
involved braiding four ropes together

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.260 
involved braiding four ropes together
and<00:00:19.250> fine<00:00:20.250> piece<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.640> wood<00:00:20.790> on<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.030> end<00:00:21.150> of

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
and fine piece of wood on the end of

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.710 
and fine piece of wood on the end of
them<00:00:21.390> then<00:00:22.290> I<00:00:22.620> cut<00:00:23.070> out<00:00:23.100> three<00:00:23.580> circles<00:00:24.090> up

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
them then I cut out three circles up

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.030 
them then I cut out three circles up
from<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.320> sealskin<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.840> sewed<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.500> seal<00:00:28.740> skins

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
from a sealskin and sewed the seal skins

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.910 
from a sealskin and sewed the seal skins
into<00:00:29.400> balls<00:00:29.700> I<00:00:30.090> filled<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.960> balls<00:00:31.200> with<00:00:31.560> sand

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
into balls I filled the balls with sand

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.970 
into balls I filled the balls with sand
and<00:00:32.309> stuck<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.780> piece<00:00:33.990> of<00:00:34.140> wood<00:00:34.320> thus

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
and stuck in the piece of wood thus

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.200 
and stuck in the piece of wood thus
making<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.850> ball<00:00:36.360> with<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> rope<00:00:37.050> attached<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.440> it

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
making a ball with a rope attached to it

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.090 
making a ball with a rope attached to it
we<00:00:39.210> then<00:00:39.420> tied<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.020> ends<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.890> ropes

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
we then tied the ends of the ropes

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.540 
we then tied the ends of the ropes
together<00:00:41.630> this<00:00:42.630> created<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.380> slingshot<00:00:43.920> type

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
together this created a slingshot type

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.240 
together this created a slingshot type
of<00:00:44.760> tool<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> hunter<00:00:46.110> would<00:00:46.380> swing<00:00:46.800> over

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
of tool that a hunter would swing over

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.210 
of tool that a hunter would swing over
his<00:00:47.400> head<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:48.360> let<00:00:48.600> fly<00:00:48.980> you<00:00:49.980> would<00:00:50.100> only

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
his head and then let fly you would only

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.130 
his head and then let fly you would only
twirl<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> couple<00:00:51.060> of<00:00:51.180> times<00:00:51.510> because<00:00:51.900> if

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
twirl it a couple of times because if

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.960 
twirl it a couple of times because if
you<00:00:52.230> twirled<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.739> more<00:00:52.950> than<00:00:53.130> that<00:00:53.310> the<00:00:53.730> ropes

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
you twirled it more than that the ropes

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.240 
you twirled it more than that the ropes
would<00:00:54.300> twist<00:00:54.660> around<00:00:54.840> each<00:00:55.140> other<00:00:55.380> after

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
would twist around each other after

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.830 
would twist around each other after
spinning<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.730> bola<00:00:56.970> around<00:00:57.480> your<00:00:57.660> head<00:00:57.810> a

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
spinning the bola around your head a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.810 
spinning the bola around your head a
couple<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.290> times

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
couple of times

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.790 
couple of times
throwing<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.970> bola<00:01:00.420> would<00:01:00.720> result<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.380> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
throwing the bola would result in the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.450 
throwing the bola would result in the
ends

of<00:01:05.519> hitting<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.300> bird<00:01:10.280> imagine<00:01:11.280> how<00:01:11.430> difficult

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
of hitting a bird imagine how difficult

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.760 
of hitting a bird imagine how difficult
it<00:01:12.090> would<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.960> hunter<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.380> feed<00:01:13.590> himself

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
it would be for a hunter to feed himself

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.550 
it would be for a hunter to feed himself
and<00:01:14.250> his<00:01:14.460> family<00:01:14.700> using<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.780> technique<00:01:16.229> I

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
and his family using this technique I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.250 
and his family using this technique I
tried<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.670> over<00:01:17.970> an<00:01:18.060> hour<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.900> didn't<00:01:19.170> even

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
tried for over an hour and I didn't even

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.030 
tried for over an hour and I didn't even
come<00:01:19.530> close<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.950> getting<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.250> bird<00:01:20.430> once<00:01:20.880> I

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
come close to getting the bird once I

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.830 
come close to getting the bird once I
imagine<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.159> many<00:01:23.340> years<00:01:23.610> ago<00:01:23.760> a<00:01:24.360> hunter

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
imagine that many years ago a hunter

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.570 
imagine that many years ago a hunter
would<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.080> laid<00:01:25.290> down<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> popular<00:01:26.280> spot

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
would have laid down in a popular spot

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.850 
would have laid down in a popular spot
and<00:01:26.880> waited<00:01:27.450> for<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> flock<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:27.960> birds<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.650> land

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
and waited for a flock of birds to land

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.050 
and waited for a flock of birds to land
close<00:01:29.130> by<00:01:29.369> hoping<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.270> get<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.420> lucky<00:01:30.750> shot

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
close by hoping to get a lucky shot

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.300 
close by hoping to get a lucky shot
during<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.390> exercise<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:34.590> had<00:01:34.740> decided<00:01:35.100> that

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
during this exercise we had decided that

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.430 
during this exercise we had decided that
our<00:01:35.549> best<00:01:35.940> chance<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.510> actually<00:01:36.960> being<00:01:37.320> able

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
our best chance of actually being able

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.920 
our best chance of actually being able
to<00:01:37.619> catch<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.070> bird<00:01:38.310> was<00:01:39.000> at<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> local<00:01:39.659> dump

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
to catch a bird was at the local dump

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.780 
to catch a bird was at the local dump
where<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.710> course<00:01:40.740> there<00:01:41.220> are<00:01:41.310> many<00:01:41.490> birds

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
where of course there are many birds

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.310 
where of course there are many birds
feeding<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.540> garbage

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.679 

now<00:01:49.320> here<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> go<00:01:49.950> I'm<00:01:50.250> rushing<00:01:51.180> towards<00:01:51.509> the

now here I go I'm rushing towards the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.219 
now here I go I'm rushing towards the
bird<00:01:51.930> now<00:01:52.229> ready<00:01:52.830> to<00:01:52.979> make<00:01:53.130> my<00:01:53.340> kill<00:01:54.229> there

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
bird now ready to make my kill there

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.010 
bird now ready to make my kill there
goes<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.619> bird<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.159> twist<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.090> bowl<00:01:57.299> around<00:01:57.539> my

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
goes the bird I twist the bowl around my

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.859 
goes the bird I twist the bowl around my
head<00:01:58.259> once<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.340> there<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.210> goes

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
head once and there it goes

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.850 
head once and there it goes
narrowly<00:02:01.799> missing<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.460> bird<00:02:02.850> oh<00:02:03.210> well<00:02:04.200> maybe

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
narrowly missing the bird oh well maybe

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:33.820 
narrowly missing the bird oh well maybe
next<00:02:05.189> time<00:02:05.369> I'll<00:02:05.729> have<00:02:05.880> better<00:02:06.179> luck

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.649 

it<00:02:34.830> did<00:02:35.129> indeed<00:02:35.519> turn<00:02:35.879> out<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.180> be<00:02:36.209> much<00:02:36.599> more

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
it did indeed turn out to be much more

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.130 
it did indeed turn out to be much more
difficult<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.680> find<00:02:38.250> my<00:02:38.549> Pola<00:02:38.849> one<00:02:39.569> shot<00:02:39.840> once

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
difficult to find my Pola one shot once
