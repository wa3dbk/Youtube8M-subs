know what I'm not exactly sure how long
I've<00:06:54.809> been<00:06:54.839> I've<00:06:55.439> gone<00:06:55.649> because<00:06:55.889> i<00:06:56.159> forgot<00:06:56.309> to

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:56.519 
I've been I've gone because i forgot to

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:58.189

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 
so i think that that discovering

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.239 
so i think that that discovering
currency<00:07:00.899> there<00:07:01.109> is<00:07:01.199> a<00:07:01.229> good<00:07:01.529> time<00:07:01.799> to<00:07:01.829> stop

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:02.249 
currency there is a good time to stop
