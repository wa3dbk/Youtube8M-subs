across<00:00:36.840> with<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.260> weapon<00:00:37.440> because<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.070> a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
across with this weapon because it is a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.860 
across with this weapon because it is a
bit<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.489> dual<00:00:38.730> sided<00:00:39.030> sword<00:00:39.390> when<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.690> use

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.760 
bit of a dual sided sword when you use
it<00:00:40.020> because<00:00:40.110> there<00:00:40.290> are<00:00:40.440> some<00:00:40.620> good

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
it because there are some good

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.389 
it because there are some good
advantages<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:41.850> there<00:00:42.149> are<00:00:42.239> some<00:00:42.480> really<00:00:42.809> bad

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
advantages but there are some really bad

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.090 
advantages but there are some really bad
disadvantages<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.760> well<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:46.860> first

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
disadvantages to it as well so the first

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.580 
disadvantages to it as well so the first
advantage<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:47.940> weapon<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:49.410> is

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
than two it's two down someone that had

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.060 
than two it's two down someone that had
armor<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.659> i'm<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.079> say<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.560> always<00:01:40.799> a

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
armor so i'm going to say it is always a

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.999 
armor so i'm going to say it is always a
to<00:01:41.130> hit<00:01:41.490> down<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.670> people<00:01:42.119> who<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.360> armor

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
to hit down on people who have armor

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.039 
to hit down on people who have armor
which<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.040> really<00:01:44.430> cool<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:45.509> really<00:01:45.780> quick

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
which is really cool it's really quick

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.929 
which is really cool it's really quick
at<00:01:46.259> taking<00:01:46.680> people<00:01:46.860> down<00:01:46.890> armor<00:01:47.399> at<00:01:47.670> close

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
at taking people down armor at close

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.649 
at taking people down armor at close
range<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.549> is<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.759> biggest<00:01:51.030> advantage

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
range so that is the biggest advantage

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.770 
range so that is the biggest advantage
to<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:51.990> weapon<00:01:52.399> and<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:54.210> i<00:01:54.240> doubt<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.630> most

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
to this weapon and that i doubt the most

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.859 
to this weapon and that i doubt the most
important<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:56.219> there<00:01:56.939> are<00:01:56.969> some<00:01:57.360> huge

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
important but there are some huge

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.429 
important but there are some huge
disadvantages<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.860> weapon<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:01.140> first

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
disadvantages to this weapon the first

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.510 
disadvantages to this weapon the first
being<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.759> only<00:02:03.329> has<00:02:03.689> two<00:02:04.590> hits<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.280> it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
being that it only has two hits on it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.109 
being that it only has two hits on it
meaning<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:07.740> own<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.250> one<00:02:08.640> person

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
meaning that you can own down one person

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.330 
meaning that you can own down one person
with<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.420> really<00:02:09.660> more<00:02:10.440> than<00:02:10.530> likely<00:02:10.709> before

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
with it really more than likely before

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.580 
with it really more than likely before
it<00:02:11.610> breaks

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
it breaks

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.610 
it breaks
which<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.370> kind<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.670> bad<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.209> it<00:02:15.080> really

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
which is kind of bad and it really

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.979 
which is kind of bad and it really
brings<00:02:16.370> up<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.849> next<00:02:17.060> disadvantage<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.840> it

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
brings up to the next disadvantage of it

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.460 
brings up to the next disadvantage of it
to<00:02:18.650> why<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.310> weapon<00:02:19.849> is<00:02:20.030> really<00:02:20.569> bad<00:02:20.720> is<00:02:20.930> the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
to why this weapon is really bad is the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.680 
to why this weapon is really bad is the
amount<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.980> calls<00:02:22.459> for<00:02:22.760> loadout<00:02:23.209> points

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
amount that calls for loadout points

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.960 
amount that calls for loadout points
this<00:02:24.410> weapon<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.950> not<00:02:25.220> worth<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.670> way<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:25.879> is

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
this weapon is not worth the way it is

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.240 
this weapon is not worth the way it is
now<00:02:26.150> for<00:02:26.629> loadout<00:02:27.110> points<00:02:27.470> there<00:02:28.040> are<00:02:28.129> some

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
now for loadout points there are some

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.320 
now for loadout points there are some
things<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.519> think<00:02:28.790> they<00:02:28.849> could<00:02:29.000> do<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.090> make

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
things that think they could do to make

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.150 
things that think they could do to make
it<00:02:29.360> worth<00:02:29.870> for<00:02:30.230> loadout<00:02:30.530> points<00:02:30.830> or<00:02:30.920> make<00:02:31.040> it

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
it worth for loadout points or make it

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.680 
it worth for loadout points or make it
worth<00:02:31.370> maybe<00:02:31.760> three<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.209> think<00:02:32.480> it's<00:02:32.569> worth

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
worth maybe three I think it's worth

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.330 
worth maybe three I think it's worth
about<00:02:32.810> two<00:02:33.140> right<00:02:33.440> now<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.709> same<00:02:34.069> as<00:02:34.190> the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
about two right now the same as the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.630 
about two right now the same as the
flamethrower<00:02:34.870> but<00:02:36.190> I'll<00:02:37.190> go<00:02:37.400> with<00:02:37.549> those

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
flamethrower but I'll go with those

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.789 
flamethrower but I'll go with those
later<00:02:38.030> but<00:02:38.569> you<00:02:38.959> know<00:02:39.080> it's<00:02:39.290> definitely<00:02:39.500> not

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
later but you know it's definitely not

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.729 
later but you know it's definitely not
worth<00:02:39.980> for<00:02:40.250> loadout<00:02:40.549> points<00:02:40.910> it's<00:02:41.410> calico<00:02:42.410> you

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
worth for loadout points it's calico you

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.860 
worth for loadout points it's calico you
know<00:02:42.890> it's<00:02:43.519> a<00:02:43.580> weapon<00:02:43.849> that<00:02:43.970> if<00:02:44.540> you're<00:02:44.780> going

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
know it's a weapon that if you're going

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.080 
know it's a weapon that if you're going
to<00:02:44.930> use<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.319> it<00:02:46.069> better<00:02:46.310> be<00:02:46.340> because<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:46.760> want

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
to use it it better be because you want

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.610 
to use it it better be because you want
to<00:02:47.180> use<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.569> machete<00:02:47.870> not<00:02:48.079> because<00:02:48.349> it's<00:02:48.530> a

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
to use the machete not because it's a

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.960 
to use the machete not because it's a
good<00:02:48.739> weapon<00:02:48.920> because<00:02:49.340> it's<00:02:49.549> not<00:02:49.760> worth

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
good weapon because it's not worth

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.330 
good weapon because it's not worth
before<00:02:50.180> loadout<00:02:50.690> points<00:02:51.079> at<00:02:51.200> all<00:02:51.500> it's<00:02:52.160> not

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
before loadout points at all it's not

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.860 
before loadout points at all it's not
worth<00:02:52.519> taking<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:53.060> know<00:02:53.150> away<00:02:53.329> from<00:02:53.450> other

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
worth taking you know away from other

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.819 
worth taking you know away from other
things<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.380> your<00:02:54.470> class<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.040> then<00:02:56.829> next

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
things in your class and then next

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.190 
things in your class and then next
disadvantage<00:02:58.459> is<00:02:58.579> that<00:02:59.620> it<00:03:00.620> has<00:03:01.069> no<00:03:01.930> one<00:03:02.930> hit

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
disadvantage is that it has no one hit

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.660 
disadvantage is that it has no one hit
feature<00:03:03.500> on<00:03:03.769> it<00:03:03.890> unless<00:03:04.010> they're<00:03:04.370> already

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
feature on it unless they're already

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.390 
feature on it unless they're already
hurt<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.239> it<00:03:05.840> has<00:03:06.019> no<00:03:06.230> instacool<00:03:06.829> feature<00:03:07.129> on

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
hurt and it has no instacool feature on

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.729 
hurt and it has no instacool feature on
it<00:03:07.579> which<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.150> think<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.540> should<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.110> I'm

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
it which I think it should and I'm

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.970 
it which I think it should and I'm
saying<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:10.250> because<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:11.090> upgraded<00:03:11.799> to<00:03:12.799> buy

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
saying this because the upgraded to buy

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.900 
saying this because the upgraded to buy
for<00:03:13.280> can<00:03:13.790> in<00:03:13.970> stood<00:03:14.209> on<00:03:14.390> people<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:15.910> the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
for can in stood on people and the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.569 
for can in stood on people and the
machete<00:03:17.450> itself<00:03:17.870> has<00:03:18.620> no<00:03:18.650> one<00:03:19.130> hit<00:03:19.310> feature

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
machete itself has no one hit feature

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.729 
machete itself has no one hit feature
unless<00:03:19.970> they're<00:03:20.180> already<00:03:20.510> hurt<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.560> getting

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
unless they're already hurt so getting

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.559 
unless they're already hurt so getting
back<00:03:21.859> to<00:03:22.010> what<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.250> was<00:03:22.310> saying<00:03:22.459> earlier<00:03:22.790> if<00:03:23.209> you

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
back to what I was saying earlier if you

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.180 
back to what I was saying earlier if you
were<00:03:23.810> run<00:03:24.019> to<00:03:24.230> somewhere<00:03:24.440> near<00:03:24.650> both<00:03:24.859> the<00:03:24.980> full

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
were run to somewhere near both the full

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.440 
were run to somewhere near both the full
health<00:03:25.400> and<00:03:25.519> they<00:03:25.639> had<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:25.850> upgrade<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.150> two<00:03:26.329> by

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
health and they had to upgrade a two by

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.509 
health and they had to upgrade a two by
four<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:26.780> you<00:03:26.900> had<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.049> machete<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:28.370> would

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
four and you had the machete you would

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.220 
four and you had the machete you would
get<00:03:28.639> a<00:03:28.700> hidden<00:03:29.120> with<00:03:29.329> the<00:03:29.359> machete<00:03:29.720> if<00:03:29.900> I<00:03:29.989> was

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
get a hidden with the machete if I was

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.170 
get a hidden with the machete if I was
fun<00:03:30.410> at<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.590> same<00:03:30.709> time<00:03:30.950> but<00:03:31.609> then<00:03:31.670> you<00:03:31.910> would

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
fun at the same time but then you would

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.300 
fun at the same time but then you would
get<00:03:32.299> one<00:03:32.599> hit<00:03:32.780> down<00:03:33.019> by<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.500> two<00:03:33.709> by<00:03:33.859> four<00:03:34.130> and

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
get one hit down by the two by four and

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.069 
get one hit down by the two by four and
there<00:03:35.180> would<00:03:35.299> be<00:03:35.329> nothing<00:03:35.599> you<00:03:35.840> could<00:03:35.959> do

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
there would be nothing you could do

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.860 
there would be nothing you could do
about<00:03:36.109> that<00:03:36.620> would<00:03:37.190> happen<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.790> it<00:03:38.239> sucks<00:03:38.630> and

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
about that would happen and it sucks and

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.470 
about that would happen and it sucks and
it's<00:03:39.650> kind<00:03:39.859> of<00:03:39.920> crappy<00:03:40.579> because<00:03:41.150> even<00:03:41.389> when

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
it's kind of crappy because even when

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.670 
it's kind of crappy because even when
you<00:03:41.540> have<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.750> upgraded<00:03:42.109> machete<00:03:42.410> which<00:03:42.620> is

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
you have the upgraded machete which is

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.870 
you have the upgraded machete which is
supposed<00:03:42.889> to<00:03:42.950> be<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.040> best<00:03:43.220> melee<00:03:43.549> weapon<00:03:43.790> in

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
supposed to be the best melee weapon in

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.569 
supposed to be the best melee weapon in
the<00:03:43.970> game<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:45.019> still<00:03:45.410> loses<00:03:45.919> to<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.190> upgraded

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
the game it still loses to and upgraded

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.530 
the game it still loses to and upgraded
to<00:03:46.700> buy<00:03:46.849> for<00:03:47.139> so<00:03:48.139> I<00:03:49.060> really<00:03:50.060> don't<00:03:50.180> like<00:03:50.299> that

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
to buy for so I really don't like that

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.460 
to buy for so I really don't like that
at<00:03:50.840> all<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:51.319> kind<00:03:51.739> of<00:03:51.859> upsets<00:03:52.040> me<00:03:52.849> but<00:03:53.470> Nina

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
at all it kind of upsets me but Nina

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.110 
at all it kind of upsets me but Nina
getting<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.130> my<00:03:55.220> next<00:03:55.250> point<00:03:55.489> is<00:03:55.730> maybe<00:03:55.940> they

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
getting to my next point is maybe they

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.610 
getting to my next point is maybe they
could<00:03:56.239> do<00:03:56.329> some<00:03:56.510> things<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:56.900> make<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.260> machete

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
could do some things to make the machete

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.710 
could do some things to make the machete
a<00:03:57.680> little<00:03:57.889> bit<00:03:57.980> better<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:59.239> first<00:03:59.510> of<00:03:59.660> which

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
a little bit better the first of which

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.870 
a little bit better the first of which
is<00:03:59.840> being<00:04:00.200> if<00:04:01.069> they're<00:04:01.280> going<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.489> leave<00:04:01.609> the

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
is being if they're going to leave the

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.240 
is being if they're going to leave the
machete<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.389> way<00:04:02.510> it<00:04:02.630> is<00:04:02.720> now<00:04:02.930> lower<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:03.980> cost

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
machete the way it is now lower the cost

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.370 
machete the way it is now lower the cost
of<00:04:04.519> it<00:04:04.669> because<00:04:04.940> it<00:04:05.090> sure<00:04:05.780> as<00:04:05.930> hell<00:04:06.139> is<00:04:06.349> not

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
of it because it sure as hell is not

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.990 
of it because it sure as hell is not
worth<00:04:06.709> four<00:04:06.950> points<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.459> way<00:04:07.489> it<00:04:07.700> is<00:04:07.819> now

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
worth four points the way it is now

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.030 
worth four points the way it is now
without<00:04:08.870> a<00:04:08.900> doubt<00:04:09.019> it's<00:04:09.470> not<00:04:09.620> worth<00:04:09.799> four

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
without a doubt it's not worth four

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.509 
without a doubt it's not worth four
points<00:04:11.560> but<00:04:12.560> if<00:04:12.769> they<00:04:12.980> were<00:04:13.040> going<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.370> leave

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
points but if they were going to leave

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.740 
points but if they were going to leave
it<00:04:13.639> at<00:04:13.730> four<00:04:14.000> if<00:04:14.209> they're<00:04:14.329> going<00:04:14.480> to<00:04:14.540> leave<00:04:14.630> the

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
it at four if they're going to leave the

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.080 
it at four if they're going to leave the
four<00:04:15.019> I<00:04:15.290> almost<00:04:15.980> have<00:04:16.250> to<00:04:16.280> suggest<00:04:16.820> they<00:04:17.030> do

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
four I almost have to suggest they do

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.589 
four I almost have to suggest they do
this<00:04:17.739> they<00:04:18.739> give<00:04:18.979> it<00:04:19.099> a<00:04:19.220> shift<00:04:19.729> function<00:04:20.120> to

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
this they give it a shift function to

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:21.909 
this they give it a shift function to
where<00:04:20.719> it<00:04:20.840> doesn't<00:04:21.019> insta-kill<00:04:21.620> when<00:04:21.829> you

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
where it doesn't insta-kill when you

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.360 
where it doesn't insta-kill when you
come<00:04:22.070> up<00:04:22.159> behind<00:04:22.280> someone

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
come up behind someone

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.780 
come up behind someone
I<00:04:23.490> feel<00:04:24.479> like<00:04:24.600> they<00:04:24.720> have<00:04:24.750> to<00:04:24.990> do<00:04:25.260> that<00:04:25.470> and

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
I feel like they have to do that and

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.670 
I feel like they have to do that and
then<00:04:26.790> make<00:04:27.389> it<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:27.630> where<00:04:27.750> instead<00:04:28.110> of<00:04:28.169> downing

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
then make it to where instead of downing

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.070 
then make it to where instead of downing
people<00:04:28.979> it<00:04:29.160> just<00:04:29.430> kills<00:04:29.699> them<00:04:30.000> that<00:04:30.930> would

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
people it just kills them that would

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.689 
people it just kills them that would
make<00:04:31.260> it<00:04:31.290> worth<00:04:31.560> four<00:04:32.010> points<00:04:32.040> it<00:04:32.490> would<00:04:32.580> make

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
make it worth four points it would make

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.850 
make it worth four points it would make
it<00:04:32.820> a<00:04:32.910> very<00:04:33.060> deadly<00:04:33.419> weapon<00:04:33.900> and<00:04:34.020> it<00:04:34.710> would

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
it a very deadly weapon and it would

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.070 
it a very deadly weapon and it would
make<00:04:35.699> the<00:04:36.000> four<00:04:36.240> points<00:04:36.570> worth<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:36.960> would

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
make the four points worth it would

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.330 
make the four points worth it would
definitely<00:04:37.260> make<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.620> four<00:04:37.770> points<00:04:38.040> worth<00:04:38.190> it

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
definitely make the four points worth it

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.800 
definitely make the four points worth it
in<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:38.610> case<00:04:38.850> and<00:04:39.120> that<00:04:39.210> guy<00:04:39.419> could<00:04:39.630> see<00:04:39.780> a

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
in that case and that guy could see a

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.180 
in that case and that guy could see a
whole<00:04:39.960> lot<00:04:39.990> more<00:04:40.229> people<00:04:40.470> using<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.889> weapon

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
whole lot more people using the weapon

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.550 
whole lot more people using the weapon
then<00:04:41.449> because<00:04:42.449> right<00:04:42.750> now<00:04:42.780> only<00:04:43.350> time<00:04:43.440> you

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
then because right now only time you

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.900 
then because right now only time you
ever<00:04:43.590> see<00:04:43.740> someone<00:04:43.949> used<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.160> machete<00:04:44.490> is

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
ever see someone used the machete is

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.460 
ever see someone used the machete is
when<00:04:45.150> you<00:04:45.270> see<00:04:45.510> someone<00:04:45.690> whose<00:04:45.870> last<00:04:46.080> person

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
when you see someone whose last person

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.580 
when you see someone whose last person
left<00:04:46.590> on<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.860> enemy<00:04:47.010> team<00:04:47.130> really<00:04:47.810> so<00:04:48.810> that's

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
left on the enemy team really so that's

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.469 
left on the enemy team really so that's
when<00:04:49.830> those<00:04:50.520> are<00:04:50.550> some<00:04:50.880> main<00:04:51.030> things<00:04:51.270> they

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
when those are some main things they

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:52.990 
when those are some main things they
could<00:04:51.630> do<00:04:51.750> I<00:04:51.780> think<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.110> improve<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.590> weapon

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
could do I think to improve the weapon

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.279 
could do I think to improve the weapon
but<00:04:54.000> will<00:04:54.300> they<00:04:54.449> happen<00:04:54.840> probably<00:04:55.620> not<00:04:55.940> but

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
but will they happen probably not but

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.290 
but will they happen probably not but
