00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.119
 I think it's time for a summer 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.680
 hacks video 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.739
 lately, i'm totally watching myself 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.879
 like all these summer videos and it 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.360
 befits the concrete so appreciate her 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.309
 rotate 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.769
 So today there are just useful and 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.480
 cool tips on how to cool down and 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.699
 so tips maybe good on vacation 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.930
 can use or even if you 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.390
 simply at home during the summer holidays 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.370
 stays and I would say we drive 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.370
 easy on and a lot of fun at the mio 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.540
 So a thing you necessarily this 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.670
 These are the summer to try 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.350
 sun tattoos and the most important 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.509
 trying not to need is natural 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.190
 Sun and I have now easy 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.119
 a template from a bit of paper 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.530
 cut out 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.720
 I am now for a heart 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.149
 but your creativity is decided 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.740
 of course, no limit set so you 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.410
 can you many different ones 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.300
 think out motives and then you 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.400
 shall then you simply sets 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.560
 stencil on the spot on her 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.450
 like to have the tattoo later and 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.880
 gradually, the skin around the 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.770
 template braunau and then you have on 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.689
 end so a footprint and it them 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.290
 happy looks like me and very much 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.290
 summery 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.560
 is your name in the summer too 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.240
 strawberries then you can do it 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.190
 probably that these are based 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.190
 Angel I just do not know 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.630
 knows us to really annoy and there is 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.340
 it's a really cool trick as her 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.770
 get out of here without a hurry 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.180
 quite a bit of the strawberry here 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.430
 you need to cut it out 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.050
 just a straw and then you get 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.120
 you just by the green stuff 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.360
 calm and you have very fast 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.430
 your strawberries peeled no me 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.110
 really clever but you know that 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.630
 and ye have also so in such a 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.430
 evil little spit around 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.590
 take berlin if you want and if 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.900
 we are already on the subject fruit I love 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.190
 love love so great but it is 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.800
 sometimes not so easy on that 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.390
 delicious inner hand come but have got there 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.790
 I have a really cool method for you 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.590
 as you can peel best mango 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.140
 and that's where I'm cutting both 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.140
 The mango bypass came around 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.130
 and then I cut with my knife 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.810
 such a checkerboard pattern in the mango 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.460
 pure and then you can do the mango 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.410
 just push it outward and it 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.570
 The result is a super cool bar 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.340
 pattern and that's the best thing about it 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.510
 that these little mango pieces themselves 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.100
 now very easy on the shell 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.900
 get rid of it and you can do it 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.310
 right imagine I would not be 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.350
 in the living room but somewhere on the 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.770
 roadside I 'm mine 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.600
 hereby and with me comes 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.760
 somehow always that too 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.980
 mobile with the beach but the problem 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.110
 is the sand sometimes comes in this 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.540
 small own from mobile phone and so on 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.480
 and somehow even if you pay attention 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.010
 Sand is always everywhere and that's why 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.140
 I just have my phone in that way 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.820
 put in a small bag and that 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.830
 you can close up and that all 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.620
 best thing is you can use the phone 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.680
 still use because the display 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.220
 still works and that is 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.110
 I find it very convenient for the beach 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.790
 next, I'll show you how you are 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.070
 a bottle quite simply yourself 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.110
 you can do rÃ¶sler you have to 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.850
 for the first time, doing sports and doing so 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.620
 I just have something like that now 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.620
 like cola or fanta or quarrel 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.510
 and that shakes properly right through 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.790
 so the real one gives you much higher 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.560
 that is very very important and 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.960
 then the drinks just come for that 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.990
 To effectively see everyone hours like hours 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.150
 Expensive the ifab is a few ins 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.560
 Freezer and he now drink the 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.750
 to take drinks out before you 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.370
 are completely frozen through the 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.530
 This is the one that has shaken now 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.310
 Bottle consistency is formed correctly 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.230
 really cool 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.359
 by allowing so much pressure in just 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.190
 the bottle was in it could the ice 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.310
 so not to a blog and freeze 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.440
 Simply fill in the bottle this 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.690
 bottle consistency and it tastes good 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.160
 really really delicious you can stop 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.260
 just not the drinks too long in the 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.480
 freezer leave otherwise they freeze 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.340
 but at some point to the blog but comes 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.600
 just come in and then 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:40.419
 come with the fingers on the idea 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.070
 that one so yes he found for example with coal 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.690
 can mix and then in bern so 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.880
 different layers of short ski 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.360
 on each other emerged that he determined 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.360
 also cool 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.900
 maybe you know the problem that 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.000
 nail polish in the summer sometimes so believe 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.370
 throws and somehow the consistency totally 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.470
 thick now that's because 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.600
 it's so warm outside and the nail polish 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.250
 This heat is not so well tolerated and 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.990
 That's why you can get your nail polish now 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.930
 simply store in the fridge 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.520
 that is a little under sight, though 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.620
 It makes the consistency of nail polish 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.090
 nice and smooth again and you 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.090
 they can apply much better 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:21.509
 next there is a hyper delicious 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.009
 I just have my own ice sandwich 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.400
 favorite ice of battle jerry's 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:28.710
 and have it so in slices 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.340
 cut and then I just have 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.889
 two of maine favorite biscuits on the 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.900
 as if that can be somehow of 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.990
 myself and then have the paper 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.090
 agreed and warm is your ipad 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.740
 and it's so good 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.949
 Mix from the hold ice and the 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.650
 lukewarm cookies or normal lanes 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:52.460
 cookies's just I do not want 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.460
 eat another more 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.850
 and then I would last you yet 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.080
 show as I was a little cool the 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.790
 make a spray yourself 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.190
 I have a spray bottle for that 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.440
 the java just rinsed out and again 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.630
 cold water dumped on it and then 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.550
 I have tea tree oil in the water purely 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.070
 mixed you can on peppermint oil 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.900
 take or reasonable oil has something 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.790
 what is really beautiful bold on the skin 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.680
 and every time you go with that 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.330
 spray a spray then you have one 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.620
 really nice fresh feeling on the 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.610
 skin and that is natural in the summer 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.230
 really great 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.480
 and if you want you can too 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.160
 still in the refrigerator store then that is 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:31.250
 temperature of the spray also still 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.250
 little cool really nice vision

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.500
