 put and they will be a look that is with 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.970
 copper and a touch of orange but orange 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:22.039
 it's very very 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.169
 very hidden but for example when 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.060
 they want this they mixed everything in their clothes 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.449
 who does not know how to mix this is a 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.039
 good way and I hope you like it already 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.170
 to keep and I bring my base recipes 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.820
 that now I bring with airbrush that is going 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.769
 to place in sanjuanita I see myself as 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.290
 clown like nothing more then this and 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.290
 nothing at all but we're going with our eyes 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.700
 let's start I'm using my order 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.329
 that there is an impact as a basis for 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.329
 the eyes 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.240
 and I'm going to start the missal with walk this 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.240
 tone is like a copper 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.920
 we start the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.300
 as in the last part of our eye 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.890
 now with a 217 I can not explain 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.110
 do not 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:57.210
 at the beginning we are going to take a more 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.210
 of course I will use 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.640
 baker of the naked 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.600
 one 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.600
 practices 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.850
 at the beginning 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.569
 to mix with my copper 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.810
 now I'm going to use a bit of cork 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:36.150
 this clear coffee 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.150
 let's mix everything we already have 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.830
 now to add a little more this 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.150
 as intensity we are going to apply a 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.550
 black and using coal of any 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.540
 black shadow just very little in the 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.519
 shore 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.519
 and we go up new and light 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.740
 and now with a clean painter we are going to 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.810
 mix all this 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.810
 I'm taking another 27 but already clean 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.489
 and from return with mini removes led for 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.489
 add piercing this tone 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:46.499
 so that it does not look like that, where are we going 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.499
 for 217 clean to mix everything 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.739
 it may be a little of my braun people 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.739
 planking I go to the lines 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.610
 is something 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.280
 a nothing we have for the eye will be seen 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.520
 parallel can get a touch of this 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:19.609
 orange what style of sea you do not take 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.609
 a little bit and we're going to put it right here 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:25.050
 once I have a little space 

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:29.120
 but let's mix with the coffee the 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.120
 black and is the client that we have 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:38.070
 and they give it a super nice touch 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.630
 this as a little touch of color looks 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.669
 very clear that it feels to have very 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.880
 good interest now the only thing they add 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.169
 the false eyelashes are us 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.419
 remember evolution in states like 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.380
 add long runs lend 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.600
 bushy and right now he returns 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.700
 and it adds my tabs functions almost from 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.990
 my size what happened I do not want me 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.900
 give a little more volume I'm going to put 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.060
 They were very big but I do not like it anymore 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.890
 get after the we are also 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.110
 for the bottom or add the same 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.110
 volk ​​the first tone we use 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.260
 to delineate the complete software 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.250
 and we are going to add a little 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.360
 we go to this order line and the gold 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:34.930
 which is called ex wing gold to give 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:39.250
 that touch of color at the beginning nothing 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.250
 then at the beginning 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.860
 best 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.860
 to light up a little 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.060
 and I'm going to load black shadow 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:09.809
 the mushrooms are much more stuck possible to 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.809
 My eyelashes 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.150
 this picture earn a lot of mascara I'm going to 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:29.290
 do my eyebrow avoid return 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:33.300
 and ready with much more complete cgsb 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:35.770
 the look for the birds is very natural 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.280
 I'm doing well 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.280
 phoenix 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:50.920
 above the level of your face 

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:02.139
 and I'm going to have applied also with 

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:05.110
 airbrush to this 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:07.569
 I will leave and so the look that I hope 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.340
 they liked that it has a little touch 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:12.550
 golden has been said that he was going to put 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.740
 orange but it will not change me but 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.700
 then this is the wright look with 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:20.510
 the eye 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:22.430
 with golden copper and this start that 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:26.260
 we give I think it's very very nice this 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:28.430
 touch we give like more life to the water 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.720
 so I hope you like it and 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.720
 put into practice until later
