dollar store makeup sponges so that's

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.420

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.209 
pieces that I'm going to a little pieces
of<00:02:16.870> paper<00:02:17.079> I've<00:02:17.290> cut<00:02:17.559> those<00:02:17.799> out<00:02:17.980> and

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:18.219

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
the front of my in chi

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.420 
the front of my in chi
and<00:02:21.870> I'm<00:02:21.959> going<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.200> eventually<00:02:22.620> glue<00:02:23.280> them

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
and I'm going to eventually glue them

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.880 
and I'm going to eventually glue them
down<00:02:23.870> but<00:02:24.870> first<00:02:25.080> I'm<00:02:25.380> going<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.650> add<00:02:25.860> some

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
then a little bit to the stay of papers

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.510 
then a little bit to the stay of papers
one<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.800> things<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.100> you'll<00:02:41.280> find

one of the things that you'll find

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.160 
one of the things that you'll find
within<00:02:41.790> cheese<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.600> really<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:42.870> to

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
within cheese is that you really have to

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.490 
within cheese is that you really have to
be<00:02:43.200> thinking<00:02:43.640> um<00:02:44.640> very<00:02:45.090> small<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.840> smaller

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
be thinking um very small and smaller

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.559 
be thinking um very small and smaller
than<00:02:46.680> you're<00:02:46.830> absolutely<00:02:47.489> used<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.120> for

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
than you're absolutely used to for

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.930 
than you're absolutely used to for
creating<00:02:49.020> this<00:02:49.110> kind<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.410> art<00:02:49.650> in<00:02:49.830> cheese<00:02:50.520> you

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
creating this kind of art in cheese you

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.550 
creating this kind of art in cheese you
can't<00:02:51.209> get<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.450> kinds<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.810> detail<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.530> you

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
can't get the kinds of detail that you

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.490 
can't get the kinds of detail that you
would<00:02:52.920> on<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.880> larger<00:02:54.269> piece<00:02:54.480> obviously<00:02:55.260> and

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
would on a larger piece obviously and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.770 
would on a larger piece obviously and
usually<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.489> find<00:02:56.640> in<00:02:57.000> cheese<00:02:57.180> work<00:02:57.420> with<00:02:57.600> just

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
usually I find in cheese work with just

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.540 
usually I find in cheese work with just
a<00:02:57.870> single<00:02:58.080> focal<00:02:58.560> point<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:58.980> each<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.250> these<00:02:59.370> is

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
a single focal point so each of these is

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.800 
a single focal point so each of these is
going<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.730> have<00:02:59.850> a<00:02:59.880> single<00:03:00.239> focal<00:03:00.570> point

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
going to have a single focal point

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.960 
going to have a single focal point
there's<00:03:01.050> would<00:03:01.170> be<00:03:01.260> two<00:03:01.800> flowers<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.519> leaf<00:03:02.790> and

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
there's would be two flowers a leaf and

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.840 
there's would be two flowers a leaf and
a<00:03:03.120> heart<00:03:03.380> if<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:05.070> get<00:03:05.250> too<00:03:05.519> much<00:03:05.550> more

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
a heart if you get too much more

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.699 
a heart if you get too much more
complicated<00:03:06.180> than<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.569> with<00:03:06.959> an<00:03:07.080> itchy<00:03:07.230> it's

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
complicated than that with an itchy it's

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.949 
complicated than that with an itchy it's
just<00:03:08.430> it's<00:03:08.730> just<00:03:08.880> you're<00:03:09.120> working<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:09.630> small

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
just it's just you're working so small

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.960 
just it's just you're working so small
so<00:03:10.230> hard<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.650> fact<00:03:11.100> some<00:03:11.340> artists<00:03:11.850> when

so hard in fact some artists when

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.380 
so hard in fact some artists when
they're<00:03:12.120> making<00:03:12.209> entries<00:03:12.690> actually<00:03:13.200> use<00:03:13.470> a

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
they're making entries actually use a

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.259 
they're making entries actually use a
magnifying<00:03:15.390> glass<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:16.140> will<00:03:16.260> help<00:03:16.380> them<00:03:17.269> so

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
magnifying glass that will help them so

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.059 
magnifying glass that will help them so
here<00:03:18.510> I've<00:03:18.630> gone<00:03:18.840> in<00:03:19.110> I've<00:03:19.560> glued<00:03:19.890> everything

work and you'll see when i go in with

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.259 
work and you'll see when i go in with
the<00:03:54.930> pen<00:03:55.140> here<00:03:55.470> how<00:03:56.070> it's<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.459> lot<00:03:56.730> easier<00:03:56.880> to

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
the pen here how it's a lot easier to

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.930 
the pen here how it's a lot easier to
hold<00:03:57.450> on<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:58.019> inches<00:03:58.350> are<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:58.650> small<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.010> you

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
hold on the inches are so small that you

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.640 
hold on the inches are so small that you
have<00:04:00.150> trouble<00:04:00.359> actually<00:04:00.660> holding<00:04:01.140> on<00:04:01.320> to<00:04:01.500> them

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
have trouble actually holding on to them

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.229 
have trouble actually holding on to them
with<00:04:01.829> your<00:04:01.950> fingers<00:04:02.130> but<00:04:02.519> if<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:02.820> take<00:04:03.000> them

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
with your fingers but if you take them

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.390 
with your fingers but if you take them
to<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.450> board<00:04:03.690> like<00:04:03.959> so<00:04:04.230> you'll<00:04:04.950> find<00:04:05.220> that

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
to the board like so you'll find that

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.430 
to the board like so you'll find that
you<00:04:05.549> can<00:04:05.730> just<00:04:05.970> add<00:04:06.390> detail<00:04:06.930> really<00:04:07.140> quickly

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
you can just add detail really quickly

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.520 
you can just add detail really quickly
and<00:04:07.530> spin<00:04:07.769> it<00:04:07.799> around<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:08.430> forth<00:04:09.109> so<00:04:10.109> sort

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
and spin it around and so forth so sort

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.930 
and spin it around and so forth so sort
