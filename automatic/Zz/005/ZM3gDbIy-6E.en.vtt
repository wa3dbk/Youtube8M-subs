episode<00:00:02.850> number<00:00:03.000> 53<00:00:03.840> this<00:00:04.380> week<00:00:04.620> I'm<00:00:04.770> going<00:00:04.920> to

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
episode number 53 this week I'm going to

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.590 
episode number 53 this week I'm going to
be<00:00:05.040> talking<00:00:05.339> about<00:00:05.700> how<00:00:06.000> you<00:00:06.060> can<00:00:06.299> hook<00:00:06.450> up

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
be talking about how you can hook up

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.049 
be talking about how you can hook up
your<00:00:06.720> own<00:00:06.870> sensors<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.710> camera<00:00:08.069> ax<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.490> as

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
your own sensors to the camera ax and as

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.839 
your own sensors to the camera ax and as
an<00:00:09.179> example<00:00:09.630> I'll<00:00:10.230> be<00:00:10.590> using<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:11.099> adjustable

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
an example I'll be using this adjustable

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.700 
an example I'll be using this adjustable
gain<00:00:13.040> amplified<00:00:14.040> microphone<00:00:15.170> from<00:00:16.170> Adafruit

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
gain amplified microphone from Adafruit

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.070 
gain amplified microphone from Adafruit
this<00:00:17.670> looks<00:00:17.910> like<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.090> pretty<00:00:18.300> nice<00:00:18.600> sensor

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
this looks like a pretty nice sensor

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.170 
this looks like a pretty nice sensor
from<00:00:19.289> them<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.730> haven't<00:00:20.730> tried<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:20.970> out<00:00:21.119> yet

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
from them and haven't tried it out yet

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.029 
from them and haven't tried it out yet
but<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.840> assume<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.350> going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.560> work<00:00:22.680> pretty

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
but I assume it's going to work pretty

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.460 
but I assume it's going to work pretty
sweet<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.449> fact<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:24.990> adjustable

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
sweet and the fact that it's adjustable

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.849 
sweet and the fact that it's adjustable
gay<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.920> sort<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.160> sets<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.550> apart<00:00:26.640> from<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
gay and sort of sets it apart from the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.830 
gay and sort of sets it apart from the
sound<00:00:28.859> sensor<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.550> currently<00:00:30.179> ship<00:00:30.660> for

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
sound sensor that I currently ship for

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.290 
sound sensor that I currently ship for
the<00:00:30.900> camera<00:00:31.230> acts<00:00:31.380> right<00:00:31.650> people<00:00:32.120> once<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.239> a

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the camera acts right people once in a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.990 
the camera acts right people once in a
while<00:00:33.450> want<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.899> be<00:00:34.020> able<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.350> detect<00:00:35.000> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
while want to be able to detect the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.080 
while want to be able to detect the
difference<00:00:36.360> between<00:00:37.219> louder<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.640> quieter

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
difference between louder and quieter

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.090 
difference between louder and quieter
noises<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.350> do<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.829> some

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
noises and and you can do that to some

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.250 
noises and and you can do that to some
extent<00:00:41.460> but<00:00:41.820> by<00:00:42.059> having<00:00:42.210> an<00:00:42.480> adjustable<00:00:43.079> gain

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
extent but by having an adjustable gain

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.310 
extent but by having an adjustable gain
you<00:00:43.410> kind<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.710> increase<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.000> dynamic<00:00:45.539> range

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you kind of increase the dynamic range

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.220 
you kind of increase the dynamic range
so<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.250> max<00:00:47.460> gain<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.090> sensor<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.600> about

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
so the max gain on this sensor is about

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.040 
so the max gain on this sensor is about
the<00:00:49.410> same<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.980> sensor<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.370> use<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:51.449> being

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
the same as the sensor I use but being

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.930 
the same as the sensor I use but being
able<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.350> go<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.680> smaller<00:00:52.949> game<00:00:53.430> could<00:00:53.760> be

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
able to go to a smaller game could be

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.310 
able to go to a smaller game could be
useful<00:00:54.360> when<00:00:54.780> you're<00:00:54.870> trying<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
useful when you're trying to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.740 
useful when you're trying to
differentiate<00:00:56.100> between<00:00:56.550> really<00:00:57.000> loud<00:00:57.390> noises

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
differentiate between really loud noises

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.319 
differentiate between really loud noises
a<00:00:58.050> few<00:00:58.710> years<00:00:58.890> ago<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.370> person<00:01:00.149> was

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
a few years ago a person was

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.100 
a few years ago a person was
photographing<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:02.480> one<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> space

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
photographing the one of the space

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.070 
photographing the one of the space
shuttle<00:01:04.140> launches<00:01:04.769> with<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> camera<00:01:05.400> axe<00:01:05.580> and

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
shuttle launches with the camera axe and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.690 
shuttle launches with the camera axe and
he<00:01:07.080> needed<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.470> detect<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.310> difference

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
he needed to detect the difference

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.760 
he needed to detect the difference
between<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.150> helicopter<00:01:09.840> flying<00:01:10.080> overhead<00:01:10.439> and

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
between a helicopter flying overhead and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.000 
between a helicopter flying overhead and
the<00:01:11.520> actual<00:01:11.820> space<00:01:12.180> shuttle<00:01:12.510> launch<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.619> in

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the actual space shuttle launch so in

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.880 
the actual space shuttle launch so in
that<00:01:14.250> case<00:01:14.840> this<00:01:15.840> adjustable<00:01:16.350> gain<00:01:16.650> would

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
that case this adjustable gain would

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.770 
that case this adjustable gain would
have<00:01:17.009> been<00:01:17.130> useful<00:01:17.340> because<00:01:17.700> everything<00:01:18.689> was

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
have been useful because everything was

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.999 
have been useful because everything was
very<00:01:19.170> loud<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:21.320> standard<00:01:22.320> sound<00:01:22.619> sensor

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
very loud and the standard sound sensor

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.560 
very loud and the standard sound sensor
for<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> camera<00:01:23.520> axe<00:01:23.640> was<00:01:23.820> always<00:01:24.180> clipping

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
for the camera axe was always clipping

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.539 
for the camera axe was always clipping
he<00:01:24.689> ended<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:24.990> solving<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.560> by<00:01:25.770> putting<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
he ended up solving that by putting the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.690 
he ended up solving that by putting the
sound<00:01:26.820> sensor<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.450> an<00:01:27.630> enclosure<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.860> this

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
sound sensor in an enclosure but this

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.429 
sound sensor in an enclosure but this
adjustable<00:01:30.270> game<00:01:30.570> feature<00:01:30.840> would<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.290> been

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
adjustable game feature would have been

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.399 
adjustable game feature would have been
nice<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.040> case<00:01:32.450> anyways<00:01:33.450> let's<00:01:33.990> get

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
nice in that case anyways let's get

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.410 
nice in that case anyways let's get
exploring<00:01:35.340> how<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.520> would<00:01:35.700> actually<00:01:35.909> hook<00:01:36.270> up

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
exploring how you would actually hook up

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.080 
exploring how you would actually hook up
this<00:01:36.570> out<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.710> fruit<00:01:37.920> sound<00:01:38.280> sensor<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
this out of fruit sound sensor to the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.639 
this out of fruit sound sensor to the
camera<00:01:39.390> acts<00:01:41.509> so<00:01:42.509> now<00:01:42.689> we're<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.229> going<00:01:43.590> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
camera acts so now we're just going to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.289 
camera acts so now we're just going to
solder<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.509> wires<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.930> sensor<00:01:47.090> find<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.240> a

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
solder the wires to the sensor find it a

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.999 
solder the wires to the sensor find it a
little<00:01:48.420> easier<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.049> apply<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> solder

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
little easier to just apply the solder

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.100 
little easier to just apply the solder
on<00:01:50.340> some<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.850> these<00:01:50.939> smaller<00:01:51.149> sensors<00:01:51.810> first

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
on some of these smaller sensors first

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.850 
on some of these smaller sensors first
and<00:01:53.299> then<00:01:54.299> we're<00:01:54.540> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.869> solder<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> wires

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
and then we're going to solder the wires

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.600 
and then we're going to solder the wires
on<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.420> measured<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.610> white

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
on so we just measured that the white

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.020 
on so we just measured that the white
wire<00:01:59.880> here<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.710> connected<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.860> ring<00:02:02.189> which

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
wire here is connected to the ring which

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.560 
wire here is connected to the ring which
we<00:02:03.540> want<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:04.799> be<00:02:05.159> connected<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.180> sense

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
we want to be connected to the sense

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.180 
we want to be connected to the sense
wire<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.590> here<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.399> called<00:02:08.789> out<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:10.679> we're

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
wire that here is called out so we're

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.520 
wire that here is called out so we're
good<00:02:11.340> there<00:02:11.550> then<00:02:11.940> we<00:02:12.150> measured

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
good there then we measured

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.290 
good there then we measured
that<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.740> yellow<00:02:13.950> wire<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.370> connected<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
that the yellow wire is connected to the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.900 
that the yellow wire is connected to the
ground<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.760> we<00:02:17.760> want<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:20.400> be<00:02:20.520> wired<00:02:20.790> to

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
ground and we want that to be wired to

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:30.950 
ground and we want that to be wired to
ground<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.750> sensor

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.390 

and<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.710> tricky<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.220> do<00:02:32.370> this<00:02:32.490> on<00:02:32.700> camera<00:02:34.130> but<00:02:35.130> in

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
and a tricky to do this on camera but in

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.930 
and a tricky to do this on camera but in
that<00:02:35.670> looks<00:02:35.910> good<00:02:36.180> enough<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.610> we<00:02:38.610> measured

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
that looks good enough and we measured

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.090 
that looks good enough and we measured
that<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.360> red<00:02:39.540> wire<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:40.020> connected<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
that the red wire is connected to the

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.660 
that the red wire is connected to the
tip<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:42.080> we<00:02:43.080> need<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.800> be<00:02:43.950> connected<00:02:44.250> to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
tip and we need that to be connected to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.050 
tip and we need that to be connected to
this<00:02:44.940> VCC<00:02:45.510> pin<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:49.200> we<00:02:49.650> should<00:02:49.890> be<00:02:50.010> good<00:02:50.060> now

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
this VCC pin and we should be good now

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.270 
this VCC pin and we should be good now
normally<00:02:51.660> I'd<00:02:51.780> put<00:02:52.050> some<00:02:52.470> hot<00:02:52.650> glue<00:02:52.890> or

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
normally I'd put some hot glue or

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.190 
normally I'd put some hot glue or
something<00:02:53.490> on<00:02:53.820> here<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.300> make<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.630> connection

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
something on here to make the connection

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.170 
something on here to make the connection
a<00:02:55.260> little<00:02:55.500> bit<00:02:55.650> solid<00:02:56.310> or<00:02:56.430> maybe<00:02:56.670> wrap<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.090> in

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
a little bit solid or maybe wrap it in

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.290 
a little bit solid or maybe wrap it in
some<00:02:57.960> tape<00:02:58.290> or<00:02:58.530> shrink<00:02:58.890> wrap<00:02:59.070> but<00:02:59.340> for<00:03:00.210> this

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
some tape or shrink wrap but for this

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.990 
some tape or shrink wrap but for this
demonstration<00:03:00.500> that's<00:03:01.500> good<00:03:01.800> enough<00:03:02.010> we

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
demonstration that's good enough we

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.480 
demonstration that's good enough we
should<00:03:03.300> at<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:03.630> point<00:03:03.990> be<00:03:04.530> able<00:03:04.740> to<00:03:04.950> connect

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
should at this point be able to connect

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.580 
should at this point be able to connect
it<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.210> camera<00:03:06.450> axe<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.020> get<00:03:07.350> some

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
it to the camera axe and get some

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.690 
it to the camera axe and get some
readings<00:03:09.710> so<00:03:10.710> at<00:03:10.890> this<00:03:10.920> point<00:03:11.340> I've<00:03:11.520> actually

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
readings so at this point I've actually

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.060 
readings so at this point I've actually
done<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.030> little<00:03:12.240> bit<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.480> testing<00:03:12.990> with<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.710> lot

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
done a little bit of testing with a lot

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.390 
done a little bit of testing with a lot
of<00:03:14.130> fruit<00:03:14.490> sensor<00:03:14.970> here<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:16.560> seems<00:03:17.010> really

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
of fruit sensor here and it seems really

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.650 
of fruit sensor here and it seems really
nice<00:03:17.550> it<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.830> adjustable<00:03:20.040> gain<00:03:20.640> is<00:03:20.970> right

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
nice it the adjustable gain is right

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.070 
nice it the adjustable gain is right
here<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.320> that<00:03:23.280> seems<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:24.630> work<00:03:24.810> as

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
here and that seems to to work as

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.760 
here and that seems to to work as
advertised<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:27.570> sound<00:03:28.170> signal<00:03:28.470> is

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
advertised and the sound signal is

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.670 
advertised and the sound signal is
giving<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.490> camera<00:03:29.790> axe<00:03:29.970> seems<00:03:30.570> just<00:03:31.530> as

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
giving to the camera axe seems just as

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.500 
giving to the camera axe seems just as
good<00:03:31.860> as<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.220> sound<00:03:32.730> sensor<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.270> I've<00:03:33.390> been

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
good as the sound sensor that I've been

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.230 
good as the sound sensor that I've been
using<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.170> is<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:35.190> great<00:03:35.490> bargain<00:03:35.760> right<00:03:36.180> i

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
using and is a great bargain right i

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.750 
using and is a great bargain right i
mean<00:03:36.450> this<00:03:36.720> sensor<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.230> under<00:03:38.010> seven<00:03:38.400> dollars

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
mean this sensor is under seven dollars

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.300 
mean this sensor is under seven dollars
at<00:03:38.940> out<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.210> fruit<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:39.630> they've<00:03:40.320> really<00:03:40.620> cheap

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
at out of fruit and they've really cheap

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.760 
at out of fruit and they've really cheap
shipping<00:03:41.550> at<00:03:41.970> least<00:03:42.210> to<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.570> United<00:03:43.200> States<00:03:43.440> I

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
shipping at least to the United States I

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.550 
shipping at least to the United States I
I<00:03:43.980> got<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.510> shipping<00:03:45.840> on<00:03:45.930> this<00:03:46.050> cost<00:03:46.320> me

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
I got the the shipping on this cost me

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.340 
I got the the shipping on this cost me
about<00:03:46.680> four<00:03:47.070> bucks<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.690> seven<00:03:48.690> bucks<00:03:49.050> for<00:03:49.260> the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
about four bucks and seven bucks for the

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.650 
about four bucks and seven bucks for the
sensor<00:03:49.800> so<00:03:50.160> that's<00:03:50.550> less<00:03:50.820> than<00:03:50.850> you'd<00:03:51.270> pay<00:03:51.450> for

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
sensor so that's less than you'd pay for

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.170 
sensor so that's less than you'd pay for
the<00:03:51.780> sound<00:03:52.170> sensor<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.640> ship<00:03:53.910> for<00:03:54.090> the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
the sound sensor that I ship for the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.060 
the sound sensor that I ship for the
camera<00:03:54.450> acts<00:03:54.570> so<00:03:54.930> it's<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.470> great<00:03:55.590> deal<00:03:55.890> for

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
camera acts so it's a great deal for

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.110 
camera acts so it's a great deal for
people<00:03:56.220> who<00:03:56.430> want<00:03:56.550> to<00:03:56.700> make<00:03:56.820> their<00:03:57.060> own<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:59.120> at

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
people who want to make their own and at

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.790 
people who want to make their own and at
this<00:04:00.300> point<00:04:00.540> I'll<00:04:00.720> just<00:04:00.900> sort<00:04:01.260> of<00:04:01.320> show

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
this point I'll just sort of show

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.060 
this point I'll just sort of show
everyone<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.580> is<00:04:02.730> indeed<00:04:03.090> working<00:04:03.710> so<00:04:04.710> if

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
everyone that it is indeed working so if

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.560 
everyone that it is indeed working so if
we<00:04:06.140> go<00:04:07.140> down<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.830> this<00:04:08.040> menu<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:09.240> second

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
we go down to this menu the second

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.340 
we go down to this menu the second
number<00:04:09.690> there<00:04:10.050> is<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:11.900> sound<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:13.140> it's

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
number there is the sound that it's

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.260 
number there is the sound that it's
detecting<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.640> can<00:04:14.820> see<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.120> it's

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
detecting and you can see it it's

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.990 
detecting and you can see it it's
fluctuating<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:15.960> little<00:04:16.170> bit<00:04:16.350> up<00:04:16.739> in<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.220> 30s

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
fluctuating a little bit up in the 30s

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.090 
fluctuating a little bit up in the 30s
and<00:04:18.299> 40s<00:04:21.140> when<00:04:22.140> I<00:04:22.170> was<00:04:22.350> quiet<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.800> dropped<00:04:23.010> down

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
and 40s when I was quiet it dropped down

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.480 
and 40s when I was quiet it dropped down
to<00:04:23.220> 517<00:04:24.030> so<00:04:24.950> everything's<00:04:25.950> working<00:04:26.340> as

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
to 517 so everything's working as

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.300 
to 517 so everything's working as
expected<00:04:26.910> and<00:04:27.600> you<00:04:28.320> know<00:04:28.440> if<00:04:28.650> I<00:04:28.770> touch<00:04:29.040> the

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
expected and you know if I touch the

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.460 
expected and you know if I touch the
sensor<00:04:29.730> that's<00:04:30.570> like<00:04:30.840> a<00:04:30.870> really<00:04:31.110> loud<00:04:31.440> noise

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
sensor that's like a really loud noise

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.390 
sensor that's like a really loud noise
and<00:04:32.010> it'll<00:04:32.220> go<00:04:32.490> up<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.790> 5<00:04:33.540> 99<00:04:33.930> so<00:04:34.470> if<00:04:34.740> you<00:04:35.100> wanted

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
and it'll go up to 5 99 so if you wanted

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.860 
and it'll go up to 5 99 so if you wanted
to<00:04:35.490> use<00:04:35.640> this<00:04:35.850> with<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.120> camera<00:04:36.480> axe<00:04:36.660> to

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
to use this with the camera axe to

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.200 
to use this with the camera axe to
actually<00:04:37.170> trigger<00:04:37.410> a<00:04:37.620> camera<00:04:38.370> that<00:04:38.520> was<00:04:38.850> or

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
actually trigger a camera that was or

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.780 
actually trigger a camera that was or
flash<00:04:39.750> that<00:04:40.020> was<00:04:40.169> plugged<00:04:40.530> into<00:04:40.790> camera

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
flash that was plugged into camera

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.070 
flash that was plugged into camera
sensor<00:04:42.780> port<00:04:42.990> number<00:04:43.290> one

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
sensor port number one

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.110 
sensor port number one
got<00:04:44.289> a<00:04:44.319> video<00:04:44.949> that<00:04:45.099> goes<00:04:45.370> into<00:04:45.610> a<00:04:45.699> lot<00:04:45.909> more

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
got a video that goes into a lot more

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.290 
got a video that goes into a lot more
depth<00:04:46.419> i'm<00:04:46.599> using<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.050> sound<00:04:47.289> sensor<00:04:47.710> but

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
depth i'm using the sound sensor but

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.119 
depth i'm using the sound sensor but
we'll<00:04:49.300> just<00:04:49.330> quick<00:04:49.900> set<00:04:50.199> something<00:04:50.650> up<00:04:50.740> here

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:51.129 
we'll just quick set something up here

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:55.279 
we'll just quick set something up here
so<00:04:51.490> we'll<00:04:51.639> set<00:04:51.879> the<00:04:52.090> trigger<00:04:52.479> to<00:04:53.289> let's<00:04:53.860> say

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
so we'll set the trigger to let's say

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:02.610 
so we'll set the trigger to let's say
550<00:04:56.289> and<00:04:57.150> activate<00:04:58.150> that<00:05:00.840> so<00:05:01.840> now<00:05:02.020> when<00:05:02.349> a<00:05:02.379> loud

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
550 and activate that so now when a loud

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.730 
550 and activate that so now when a loud
noise<00:05:02.889> is<00:05:03.159> made<00:05:03.300> like<00:05:04.300> me<00:05:04.479> talking<00:05:04.900> it<00:05:05.319> detects

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
noise is made like me talking it detects

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.429 
noise is made like me talking it detects
it<00:05:05.919> and<00:05:06.159> it<00:05:06.430> tries<00:05:06.729> to<00:05:06.759> trigger<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.479> flash<00:05:08.199> or

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:08.439 
it and it tries to trigger the flash or

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.589 
it and it tries to trigger the flash or
camera<00:05:08.710> that's<00:05:08.889> attached<00:05:09.219> and<00:05:09.759> if<00:05:10.240> I<00:05:10.389> touch<00:05:10.569> it

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
camera that's attached and if I touch it

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:11.969 
camera that's attached and if I touch it
it's<00:05:10.930> definitely<00:05:11.319> going<00:05:11.409> to<00:05:11.469> be<00:05:11.530> a<00:05:11.590> loud<00:05:11.800> noise

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
it's definitely going to be a loud noise

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.080 
it's definitely going to be a loud noise
so<00:05:12.849> that's<00:05:13.539> pretty<00:05:14.500> much<00:05:14.650> how<00:05:14.830> it<00:05:14.860> works<00:05:15.099> great

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
so that's pretty much how it works great

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.950 
so that's pretty much how it works great
sensor<00:05:16.690> made<00:05:17.169> by<00:05:17.379> atif<00:05:17.800> root<00:05:17.979> and<00:05:18.840> you<00:05:19.840> know

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
sensor made by atif root and you know

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.779 
sensor made by atif root and you know
they've<00:05:20.289> got<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.500> lot<00:05:20.680> of<00:05:20.740> other<00:05:20.949> sensors<00:05:21.460> there

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
they've got a lot of other sensors there

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.230 
they've got a lot of other sensors there
that<00:05:22.330> are<00:05:22.930> things<00:05:23.229> that<00:05:23.319> I<00:05:23.500> don't<00:05:23.680> have

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
that are things that I don't have

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.399 
that are things that I don't have
standard<00:05:25.240> sensors<00:05:25.599> for<00:05:25.810> so<00:05:26.080> if<00:05:26.259> you're

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:26.409 
standard sensors for so if you're

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.439 
standard sensors for so if you're
interested<00:05:26.590> in<00:05:27.190> trying<00:05:27.699> to<00:05:27.819> hook<00:05:27.940> up<00:05:28.060> some<00:05:28.270> new

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
interested in trying to hook up some new

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.050 
interested in trying to hook up some new
sensors<00:05:28.990> to<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:29.889> camera<00:05:30.190> axe<00:05:30.400> go<00:05:30.759> and<00:05:30.940> check

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
sensors to the camera axe go and check

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.450 
sensors to the camera axe go and check
out<00:05:31.270> their<00:05:31.509> page<00:05:32.259> and<00:05:32.560> you<00:05:32.919> know<00:05:33.039> if<00:05:33.280> the

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
out their page and you know if the

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.059 
out their page and you know if the
sensor<00:05:33.699> just<00:05:34.030> takes<00:05:34.330> power<00:05:34.719> ground<00:05:35.199> and<00:05:35.560> then

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069 
sensor just takes power ground and then

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.689 
sensor just takes power ground and then
outputs<00:05:36.610> an<00:05:36.759> analog<00:05:37.150> signal<00:05:38.669> like<00:05:39.669> this

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
outputs an analog signal like this

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.909 
outputs an analog signal like this
sensor<00:05:40.300> it's<00:05:40.509> you<00:05:40.930> know<00:05:41.050> trivial<00:05:41.650> to<00:05:41.770> hook

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
sensor it's you know trivial to hook

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.499 
sensor it's you know trivial to hook
them<00:05:42.069> up<00:05:42.189> and<00:05:42.430> use<00:05:42.759> them<00:05:42.909> with<00:05:43.029> the<00:05:43.120> camera<00:05:43.360> axe

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
them up and use them with the camera axe

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.469 
them up and use them with the camera axe
thanks<00:05:44.289> for<00:05:44.439> watching
