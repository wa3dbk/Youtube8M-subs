00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.270 

and<00:03:44.599> it's<00:03:44.840> waiting<00:03:45.290> he's<00:03:45.470> basically<00:03:45.950> right

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
and it's waiting he's basically right

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.040 
and it's waiting he's basically right
now<00:03:46.310> he's<00:03:46.640> probably<00:03:46.940> thinking<00:03:47.569> about<00:03:47.629> the

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
now he's probably thinking about the

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.800 
now he's probably thinking about the
Renault<00:03:48.440> will<00:03:48.920> come<00:03:49.250> over<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:50.030> ridge<00:03:50.300> line<00:03:50.599> to

Renault will come over the ridge line to

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.900 
Renault will come over the ridge line to
attack<00:03:51.170> him<00:03:51.410> and<00:03:51.709> he's<00:03:52.129> on<00:03:52.250> really<00:03:52.550> low<00:03:52.670> health

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
attack him and he's on really low health

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.070 
attack him and he's on really low health
so<00:03:52.970> he<00:03:53.150> doesn't<00:03:53.420> really<00:03:53.480> want<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:53.810> make<00:03:53.930> the

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
so he doesn't really want to make the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.720 
so he doesn't really want to make the
first<00:03:54.260> move<00:03:56.680> but<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:57.920> doesn't<00:03:58.310> look<00:03:58.430> like<00:03:58.459> the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
first move but it doesn't look like the

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.759 
first move but it doesn't look like the
