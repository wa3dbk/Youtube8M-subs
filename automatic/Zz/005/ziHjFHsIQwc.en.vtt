okay<00:00:15.090> now<00:00:15.270> that<00:00:15.420> we've<00:00:15.510> had<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.690> quick<00:00:15.930> look

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
okay now that we've had a quick look

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.870 
okay now that we've had a quick look
around<00:00:16.170> let's<00:00:16.830> take<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.070> look<00:00:17.250> at<00:00:17.370> a<00:00:17.400> few<00:00:17.610> key

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
around let's take a look at a few key

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.550 
around let's take a look at a few key
moto<00:00:18.210> features<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.900> methodologies<00:00:19.530> that

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
moto features and methodologies that

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.170 
moto features and methodologies that
you're<00:00:20.070> going<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.310> need<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.550> know<00:00:20.670> about<00:00:20.790> and

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
you're going to need to know about and

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.520 
you're going to need to know about and
you're<00:00:21.780> going<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.050> want<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.230> take<00:00:22.350> advantage

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.530 
you're going to want to take advantage

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.710 
you're going to want to take advantage
of<00:00:22.950> first<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.820> all<00:00:23.910> let's<00:00:24.300> talk<00:00:24.420> about

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
of first of all let's talk about

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.320 
of first of all let's talk about
navigation<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> viewport<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.520> you<00:00:27.180> can

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
navigation in the viewport and you can

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.140 
navigation in the viewport and you can
see<00:00:27.450> I'm<00:00:27.690> in<00:00:27.869> my<00:00:28.050> model<00:00:28.650> tab<00:00:28.860> here<00:00:29.190> and<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:30.090> is

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
see I'm in my model tab here and this is

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.080 
see I'm in my model tab here and this is
kind<00:00:30.540> of<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.840> default<00:00:31.490> orientation<00:00:32.490> for

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
kind of the default orientation for

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.190 
kind of the default orientation for
everything<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.510> set<00:00:33.750> up<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.020> everything

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
everything and set up for everything

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.090 
everything and set up for everything
when<00:00:34.470> you<00:00:34.560> first<00:00:34.830> fire<00:00:35.130> up<00:00:35.310> moto<00:00:35.930> okay<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.530> just

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
when you first fire up moto okay so just

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.620 
when you first fire up moto okay so just
to<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.370> some<00:00:38.550> geometry<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.120> look<00:00:39.270> at<00:00:39.450> I'm

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
to have some geometry to look at I'm

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.150 
to have some geometry to look at I'm
going<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.990> quickly<00:00:40.320> create<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.770> teapot

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
going to quickly create a teapot

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.950 
going to quickly create a teapot
primitive<00:00:41.640> by<00:00:41.880> right-clicking<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
primitive by right-clicking in the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.640 
primitive by right-clicking in the
viewport<00:00:43.310> go<00:00:44.310> down<00:00:44.460> here<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.700> primitive<00:00:45.060> and

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
viewport go down here to primitive and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.830 
viewport go down here to primitive and
select<00:00:46.650> teapot<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.600> there's<00:00:48.600> our<00:00:48.810> little

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
select teapot and there's our little

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.900 
select teapot and there's our little
teapot<00:00:49.410> right<00:00:49.590> there<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.670> kind<00:00:50.880> of

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
teapot right there and it's kind of

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.210 
teapot right there and it's kind of
small<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.390> view<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:51.900> I'm<00:00:52.080> going<00:00:52.380> to<00:00:52.590> fit<00:00:53.100> it

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
small in the view so I'm going to fit it

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.220 
small in the view so I'm going to fit it
to<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.400> view<00:00:53.730> by<00:00:53.760> hitting<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.660> key<00:00:55.020> and

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
to the view by hitting the a key and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.220 
to the view by hitting the a key and
that<00:00:55.440> does<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> fit<00:00:56.220> all<00:00:56.480> you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.630> do<00:00:57.720> shift<00:00:58.020> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
that does a fit all you can do shift a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.170 
that does a fit all you can do shift a
and<00:00:58.470> just<00:00:58.680> fit<00:00:59.010> select<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.460> if<00:00:59.580> you<00:00:59.670> want<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.000> as

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and just fit select it if you want to as

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.410 
and just fit select it if you want to as
well<00:01:00.470> okay<00:01:01.470> so<00:01:01.980> now<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.220> rotate<00:01:02.700> around<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.300> our

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
well okay so now to rotate around in our

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.729 
well okay so now to rotate around in our
viewport<00:01:03.840> here<00:01:03.960> I'm<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> hold

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
viewport here I'm just going to hold

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.580 
viewport here I'm just going to hold
down<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.610> Alt<00:01:05.850> key<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.990> can<00:01:07.110> see<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.320> my

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
down the Alt key and you can see that my

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.710 
down the Alt key and you can see that my
icon<00:01:08.009> changes<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.759> this<00:01:09.090> little<00:01:09.330> rotation

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
icon changes to this little rotation

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.410 
icon changes to this little rotation
icon<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.439> if<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.280> start<00:01:11.490> left<00:01:12.180> click<00:01:12.390> and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
icon and if I just start left click and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.320 
icon and if I just start left click and
drag<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:13.140> my<00:01:13.650> mouse<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:14.909> see<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.299> I

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
drag of my mouse you can see that I

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.319 
drag of my mouse you can see that I
rotate<00:01:16.220> okay<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.789> rotate<00:01:18.240> around<00:01:18.359> here<00:01:18.929> and

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
rotate okay so rotate around here and

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.029 
rotate okay so rotate around here and
moto<00:01:21.329> uses<00:01:21.780> what's<00:01:22.020> called<00:01:22.109> a<00:01:22.439> trackball

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
moto uses what's called a trackball

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.459 
moto uses what's called a trackball
rotation<00:01:23.700> by<00:01:23.850> default<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.539> you<00:01:25.079> can<00:01:25.229> see<00:01:25.439> that

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
rotation by default and you can see that

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.260 
rotation by default and you can see that
when<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.920> rotate<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.640> actually<00:01:26.789> kind<00:01:27.149> of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
when you rotate you can actually kind of

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.700 
when you rotate you can actually kind of
get<00:01:27.509> into<00:01:28.259> these<00:01:28.409> weird<00:01:28.829> sort<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.280> banked

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
get into these weird sort of banked

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.069 
get into these weird sort of banked
positions<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:31.950> your<00:01:32.069> geometry<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:33.149> this<00:01:33.899> can

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
positions for your geometry and this can

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.770 
positions for your geometry and this can
be<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> little<00:01:34.469> a<00:01:35.280> little<00:01:35.509> hard<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.600> wrap<00:01:36.749> your

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
be a little a little hard to wrap your

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.840 
be a little a little hard to wrap your
head<00:01:36.960> around<00:01:37.109> at<00:01:37.530> first<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.100> especially<00:01:38.579> if

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
head around at first if we especially if

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.679 
head around at first if we especially if
you're<00:01:38.999> used<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.450> Max's<00:01:40.310> rotation<00:01:41.310> tool<00:01:41.659> but<00:01:42.659> I

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
you're used to Max's rotation tool but I

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.649 
you're used to Max's rotation tool but I
actually<00:01:42.899> like<00:01:43.490> Moto's<00:01:44.490> trackball<00:01:44.999> rotation

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
actually like Moto's trackball rotation

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.719 
actually like Moto's trackball rotation
and<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.679> way<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> think<00:01:47.219> of<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.549> that

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
and the way I think of it is that

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.809 
and the way I think of it is that
there's<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.539> a<00:01:48.569> big<00:01:48.990> sphere<00:01:49.819> invisible

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
there's like like a big sphere invisible

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.849 
there's like like a big sphere invisible
sphere<00:01:51.030> here<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> scene<00:01:51.929> and<00:01:52.139> I'm<00:01:52.619> just

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
sphere here in the scene and I'm just

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:55.609 
sphere here in the scene and I'm just
kind<00:01:53.039> of<00:01:53.159> clicking<00:01:53.609> on<00:01:53.789> it<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.409> making<00:01:55.409> it

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
kind of clicking on it and making it

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.510 
kind of clicking on it and making it
rotate<00:01:56.100> around<00:01:57.109> and<00:01:58.109> that's<00:01:58.799> kind<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.490> good

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
rotate around and that's kind of a good

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.699 
rotate around and that's kind of a good
way<00:01:59.789> to<00:01:59.850> visualize<00:02:00.420> how<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.049> track<00:02:01.319> ball<00:02:01.560> is

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
way to visualize how that track ball is

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.789 
way to visualize how that track ball is
going<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.130> rotate<00:02:02.340> things<00:02:02.909> okay<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.109> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
around the viewport and if I just use my

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.720 
around the viewport and if I just use my
scroll<00:02:33.240> wheel<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.450> can<00:02:33.750> zoom<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.230> out<00:02:34.730> with

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
scroll wheel I can zoom in and out with

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.720 
scroll wheel I can zoom in and out with
that<00:02:36.140> okay<00:02:37.140> one<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.280> other<00:02:38.400> things<00:02:38.459> to

that okay one of the other things to

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.490 
that okay one of the other things to
notice<00:02:39.060> about<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.510> scroll<00:02:39.780> wheel<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.380> it

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
notice about the scroll wheel is that it

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.410 
notice about the scroll wheel is that it
seems<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.920> wherever<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.370> cursor<00:02:41.520> is<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:42.209> if<00:02:42.330> I

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
seems to wherever the cursor is so if I

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.390 
seems to wherever the cursor is so if I
put<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.780> right<00:02:42.900> here<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.230> tip<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.739> spout

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
put it right here the tip of the spout

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.080 
put it right here the tip of the spout
it'll<00:02:44.760> zoom<00:02:44.910> in<00:02:45.090> on<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:46.580> moves<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:47.670> back<00:02:47.850> out

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
it'll zoom in on that moves you back out

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.620 
it'll zoom in on that moves you back out
zoom<00:02:49.020> in<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:50.989> zoom<00:02:51.989> in<00:02:52.110> on<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.290> okay

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630

zoom in on that zoom in on that okay
another<00:02:54.630> cool<00:02:54.900> shortcut<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.680> keep<00:02:56.130> in<00:02:56.250> mind<00:02:56.489> is

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
another cool shortcut to keep in mind is

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.090 
another cool shortcut to keep in mind is
the<00:02:57.180> G<00:02:57.569> key<00:02:57.840> which<00:02:58.200> will<00:02:58.230> center<00:02:58.890> on<00:02:58.920> the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
the G key which will center on the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.430 
the G key which will center on the
cursor<00:02:59.580> and<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.540> if<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.720> just<00:03:00.959> put<00:03:01.110> my<00:03:01.230> cursor

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
cursor and so if I just put my cursor

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.990 
cursor and so if I just put my cursor
over<00:03:01.680> here<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.130> hit<00:03:02.220> G<00:03:02.519> it'll<00:03:03.330> pop<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:05.000> point

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
over here and hit G it'll pop the point

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.940 
over here and hit G it'll pop the point
that<00:03:06.269> I<00:03:06.330> was<00:03:06.480> hovered<00:03:06.780> over<00:03:07.019> into<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.650> center

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
that I was hovered over into the center

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.100 
that I was hovered over into the center
of<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.130> viewport<00:03:08.550> can<00:03:08.940> put<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.239> over<00:03:09.330> here<00:03:09.660> it

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
of the viewport can put it over here it

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.890 
of the viewport can put it over here it
G<00:03:10.470> pops<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.730> center<00:03:11.970> hit<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.750> fit<00:03:13.880> ok<00:03:14.900> so

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
G pops it to the center hit to fit ok so

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.220 
G pops it to the center hit to fit ok so
back<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.739> track<00:03:17.459> ball<00:03:18.200> situation<00:03:19.200> here

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
to relearn a new navigational strategy

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.350 
to relearn a new navigational strategy
and<00:03:31.079> moto<00:03:31.350> you<00:03:31.500> may<00:03:31.739> just<00:03:31.980> would<00:03:32.910> rather<00:03:33.060> just

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
be able to use the same navigation set

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.949 
be able to use the same navigation set
up<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.019> have<00:03:37.230> in<00:03:37.530> max<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.959> moto

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
up that you have in max and moto

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.350 
up that you have in max and moto
actually<00:03:40.350> lets<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.620> set<00:03:40.980> up<00:03:41.220> moto<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.209> be<00:03:42.329> a

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
actually lets you set up moto to be a

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.759 
actually lets you set up moto to be a
little<00:03:42.570> more<00:03:42.720> max<00:03:42.959> like<00:03:43.200> when<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.470> comes<00:03:43.590> to

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
little more max like when it comes to

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.170 
little more max like when it comes to
navigation<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.610> way<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.760> do<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.120> is

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
navigation and the way you do that is

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.870 
navigation and the way you do that is
just<00:03:45.360> go<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.959> system<00:03:46.380> menu<00:03:46.920> go<00:03:47.850> to

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
just go to the system menu go to

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.810 
just go to the system menu go to
preferences<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:50.370> first<00:03:50.549> thing<00:03:50.700> we're

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
preferences and the first thing we're

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.940 
preferences and the first thing we're
going<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.060> do<00:03:51.239> is<00:03:51.570> shut<00:03:52.019> off<00:03:52.049> this<00:03:52.440> track<00:03:52.709> ball

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
going to do is shut off this track ball

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.670 
going to do is shut off this track ball
rotation<00:03:53.400> so<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.060> rotate<00:03:54.680> performs

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
rotation so that the rotate performs

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.620 
rotation so that the rotate performs
just<00:03:55.739> like<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.310> doesn't<00:03:56.519> max<00:03:56.880> so<00:03:57.359> I'm<00:03:57.480> just

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
just like it doesn't max so I'm just
