00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.450 

hi<00:00:01.199> today<00:00:01.829> we'll<00:00:01.979> be<00:00:02.129> learning<00:00:02.250> about

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hi today we'll be learning about

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.660 
hi today we'll be learning about
multiple<00:00:03.419> alleles<00:00:04.130> so<00:00:05.130> far<00:00:05.400> what<00:00:05.549> we've

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
multiple alleles so far what we've

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.560 
multiple alleles so far what we've
talked<00:00:05.879> about<00:00:06.000> in<00:00:06.240> class<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:07.970> traits<00:00:08.970> that

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
talked about in class is traits that

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.169 
talked about in class is traits that
come<00:00:10.080> from<00:00:10.260> one<00:00:10.559> gene<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:10.920> have<00:00:11.429> only<00:00:11.790> two

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
come from one gene that have only two

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.330 
come from one gene that have only two
alleles<00:00:12.630> for<00:00:12.900> instance<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.380> color<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.190> two

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
alleles for instance I color the two

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.609 
alleles for instance I color the two
alleles<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.849> e<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.929> either<00:00:16.049> going<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.289> be<00:00:16.350> brown

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
alleles is e is either going to be brown

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.310 
alleles is e is either going to be brown
or<00:00:16.980> blue<00:00:17.369> hair<00:00:17.670> color<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.539> two<00:00:18.750> versions<00:00:19.230> of

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
or blue hair color the two versions of

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.400 
or blue hair color the two versions of
the<00:00:19.439> gene<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.890> black<00:00:20.460> or<00:00:20.820> blonde<00:00:21.300> height<00:00:21.779> with

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the gene is black or blonde height with

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.900 
the gene is black or blonde height with
Mendel<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.070> two<00:00:23.220> versions<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> pea

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
Mendel the two versions of the pea

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.870 
Mendel the two versions of the pea
plants<00:00:24.359> James<00:00:25.050> was<00:00:25.830> either<00:00:26.070> tall<00:00:26.369> or<00:00:26.640> short

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
plants James was either tall or short

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.810 
plants James was either tall or short
but<00:00:27.720> those<00:00:28.260> are<00:00:28.529> very<00:00:28.740> simple<00:00:29.099> examples<00:00:29.670> and

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
but those are very simple examples and

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.310 
but those are very simple examples and
the<00:00:29.880> vast<00:00:30.119> majority<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.720> traits<00:00:31.019> are<00:00:31.140> going<00:00:31.260> to

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
the vast majority of traits are going to

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.510 
the vast majority of traits are going to
have<00:00:31.470> multiple<00:00:32.130> alleles<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:34.100> still<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> simple

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
have multiple alleles and still a simple

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.910 
have multiple alleles and still a simple
example<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.450> would<00:00:36.750> be<00:00:36.960> something<00:00:37.469> that

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
example of that would be something that

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.720 
example of that would be something that
is<00:00:38.190> both<00:00:38.730> tall<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.510> let's<00:00:39.719> talk<00:00:39.960> about<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.739> tall

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
is both tall so let's talk about a tall

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.770 
is both tall so let's talk about a tall
plant<00:00:43.579> tall<00:00:44.579> plant<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:45.030> leaves<00:00:45.270> down<00:00:45.570> one

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
plant tall plant with leaves down one

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.810 
plant tall plant with leaves down one
side<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.020> down<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.440> other<00:00:46.530> side<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:47.640> would

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
side and down the other side we would

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.670 
side and down the other side we would
then<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> different<00:00:48.960> allele<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.350> makes

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
then have a different allele that makes

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.900 
then have a different allele that makes
a<00:00:49.980> medium<00:00:50.760> plant<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.710> we<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.739> an<00:00:53.250> allele<00:00:53.550> for

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
a medium plant and we have an allele for

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.590 
a medium plant and we have an allele for
a<00:00:53.969> short<00:00:54.719> plant<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.920> one<00:00:56.520> trait<00:00:56.879> three

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
a short plant so this is one trait three

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.180 
a short plant so this is one trait three
different<00:00:57.930> alleles<00:00:58.170> no<00:00:58.410> longer<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:58.859> one<00:00:59.039> or

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
different alleles no longer just one or

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.670 
different alleles no longer just one or
the<00:00:59.250> other<00:00:59.600> we<00:01:00.600> now<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.440> three

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the other we now have the three

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.900 
the other we now have the three
different<00:01:01.980> alleles<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.489> means<00:01:02.730> there's

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
different alleles this means there's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.670 
different alleles this means there's
going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.270> great<00:01:03.719> deal<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.019> different

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
going to be a great deal of different

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.920 
going to be a great deal of different
combinations<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.700> we<00:01:05.909> could<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.900> could

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
combinations that we could have we could

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.550 
combinations that we could have we could
have<00:01:07.110> something<00:01:08.010> that's<00:01:08.400> tall<00:01:08.820> tall<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:10.380> could

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
have something that's tall tall we could

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.800 
have something that's tall tall we could
have<00:01:10.650> something<00:01:10.830> that's<00:01:11.100> tall<00:01:11.400> medium<00:01:12.270> we

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
have something that's tall medium we

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.530 
have something that's tall medium we
have<00:01:13.110> tall<00:01:13.530> short<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.580> could<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.850> medium

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
have tall short we could have medium

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.560 
have tall short we could have medium
medium<00:01:16.200> medium<00:01:16.799> short<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.939> could<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.270> short

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
medium medium short we could have short

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.380 
medium medium short we could have short
short<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.299> addition<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.159> an<00:01:23.390> extra

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
short so with the addition of an extra

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.510 
short so with the addition of an extra
allele<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:25.110> add<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.650> great<00:01:26.159> bigger<00:01:27.030> number<00:01:27.600> of

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
allele we add a great bigger number of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.390 
allele we add a great bigger number of
genotypes<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:30.150> individuals<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:31.079> have

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
genotypes that individuals can have

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.999 
genotypes that individuals can have
let's<00:01:32.400> look<00:01:32.610> at<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> common<00:01:33.090> example<00:01:34.009> one

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
let's look at a common example one

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.719 
let's look at a common example one
example<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.360> human<00:01:36.869> blood<00:01:37.140> type

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
example for this is human blood type

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.100 
example for this is human blood type
human<00:01:38.729> blood<00:01:38.909> type<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.270> controlled<00:01:39.659> by<00:01:39.720> one

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
human blood type is controlled by one

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.499 
human blood type is controlled by one
gene<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.159> has<00:01:41.340> three<00:01:41.729> different<00:01:41.759> versions

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
gene and it has three different versions

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.730 
gene and it has three different versions
three<00:01:42.930> different<00:01:43.229> alleles

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
three different alleles

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.590 
three different alleles
and<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> three<00:01:44.520> versions<00:01:44.970> are<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.329> B<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.470> O<00:01:46.890> a

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
and the three versions are a B and O a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.950 
and the three versions are a B and O a
and<00:01:48.600> B<00:01:48.720> are<00:01:48.899> both<00:01:48.950> codominant<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.600> O<00:01:51.600> is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
and B are both codominant and O is

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.569 
and B are both codominant and O is
recessive<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.680> both<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.369> B<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.590> what<00:01:56.430> we

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
recessive to both a and B so what we

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.969 
recessive to both a and B so what we
know<00:01:56.759> about<00:01:56.909> human<00:01:57.299> blood<00:01:57.719> type<00:01:57.960> humans<00:01:58.770> could

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
know about human blood type humans could

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.190 
know about human blood type humans could
have<00:01:59.189> blood<00:02:00.180> type<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.750> we're<00:02:00.899> talking<00:02:01.079> about

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
have blood type so we're talking about

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.640 
have blood type so we're talking about
phenotypes

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.400 

humans<00:02:05.650> can<00:02:05.799> have<00:02:05.979> type<00:02:06.280> A<00:02:06.490> blood

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
humans can have type A blood

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.680 
humans can have type A blood
we<00:02:08.410> could<00:02:08.619> have<00:02:08.800> type<00:02:09.160> B<00:02:09.520> blood<00:02:09.550> we<00:02:10.420> can<00:02:10.569> have

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
we could have type B blood we can have

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.780 
we could have type B blood we can have
type<00:02:10.899> O<00:02:11.110> blood<00:02:11.170> or<00:02:11.800> we<00:02:12.130> could<00:02:12.250> have<00:02:12.400> type<00:02:12.670> A<00:02:13.080> B

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
type O blood or we could have type A B

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.390 
type O blood or we could have type A B
let's<00:02:15.790> look<00:02:16.000> at<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.540> genotypes<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.560> go<00:02:17.830> code

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
let's look at the genotypes that go code

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.059 
let's look at the genotypes that go code
for<00:02:18.760> these<00:02:19.000> phenotypes<00:02:19.500> well<00:02:20.500> if<00:02:20.739> you<00:02:20.890> have

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
for these phenotypes well if you have

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.229 
for these phenotypes well if you have
type<00:02:21.370> A<00:02:21.550> blood<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.810> could<00:02:23.170> come<00:02:23.470> from<00:02:24.239> having

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
type A blood that could come from having

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.380 
type A blood that could come from having
two<00:02:25.900> alleles<00:02:26.410> for<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.890> but<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:27.489> asset<00:02:27.970> also

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
two alleles for a but that asset also

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.880 
two alleles for a but that asset also
could<00:02:28.780> come<00:02:28.959> from<00:02:29.170> someone<00:02:29.530> who<00:02:29.650> has<00:02:29.860> a

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
could come from someone who has a

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.850 
could come from someone who has a
dominant<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.060> recessive<00:02:31.600> oh<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:32.590> both<00:02:32.830> of

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
dominant a and a recessive oh so both of

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.790 
dominant a and a recessive oh so both of
these<00:02:33.750> genotypes<00:02:34.750> codes<00:02:35.200> for<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.560> phenotype

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
these genotypes codes for the phenotype

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.830 
these genotypes codes for the phenotype
a<00:02:37.260> same<00:02:38.260> deal<00:02:38.530> with<00:02:38.920> type<00:02:39.640> B<00:02:40.060> type<00:02:40.739> B<00:02:41.739> blood<00:02:41.980> is

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
a same deal with type B type B blood is

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.720 
a same deal with type B type B blood is
coded<00:02:43.840> for<00:02:43.930> by<00:02:44.260> something<00:02:44.590> with<00:02:44.890> two<00:02:45.370> B

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
coded for by something with two B

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.259 
coded for by something with two B
alleles<00:02:46.600> or<00:02:47.250> something<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.370> has<00:02:48.519> a<00:02:48.550> B<00:02:48.850> allele

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
alleles or something that has a B allele

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.729 
alleles or something that has a B allele
that<00:02:49.300> masks<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.440> Oh

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
that masks the Oh

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.470 
that masks the Oh
this<00:02:51.519> gives<00:02:51.819> people<00:02:52.269> type<00:02:52.780> B<00:02:53.170> blood<00:02:53.380> type<00:02:54.480> O

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
this gives people type B blood type O

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.740 
this gives people type B blood type O
blood<00:02:55.569> is<00:02:56.819> recessive<00:02:57.819> so<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.300> need<00:02:58.480> two

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
blood is recessive so you need two

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.090 
blood is recessive so you need two
copies<00:02:59.050> of<00:02:59.319> the<00:02:59.620> O<00:02:59.800> for<00:03:00.670> type<00:03:00.880> O<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.950> since<00:03:02.950> a

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
copies of the O for type O and since a

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.150 
copies of the O for type O and since a
and<00:03:03.430> B<00:03:03.580> are<00:03:03.850> codominant<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:05.650> person<00:03:06.040> is

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
and B are codominant this person is

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
and B are codominant this person is
going<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.340> have<00:03:06.519> blood<00:03:06.880> type<00:03:07.120> A<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.950> B<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:10.000> this

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
going to have blood type A and B so this

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.600 
going to have blood type A and B so this
is<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.829> simple<00:03:11.829> example<00:03:12.010> of<00:03:13.049> a<00:03:14.049> trait

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
is a simple example of a trait

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.789 
is a simple example of a trait
controlled<00:03:15.610> by<00:03:15.730> one<00:03:16.030> gene<00:03:16.360> with<00:03:17.140> more<00:03:17.560> than

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
controlled by one gene with more than

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.310 
controlled by one gene with more than
two<00:03:18.100> alleles<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.970> in<00:03:19.150> this<00:03:19.299> case<00:03:19.600> three

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
two alleles and in this case three

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.490 
two alleles and in this case three
alleles<00:03:20.769> having<00:03:21.670> three<00:03:21.940> alleles<00:03:22.329> and<00:03:22.660> two<00:03:23.380> of

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
alleles having three alleles and two of

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.990 
alleles having three alleles and two of
them<00:03:23.620> being<00:03:23.799> codominant<00:03:24.459> one<00:03:24.640> recessive

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
them being codominant one recessive

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.500 
them being codominant one recessive
gives<00:03:25.930> us<00:03:26.170> four<00:03:26.980> different<00:03:27.670> phenotypes<00:03:28.329> that

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
gives us four different phenotypes that

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.069 
gives us four different phenotypes that
