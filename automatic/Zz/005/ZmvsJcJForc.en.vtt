00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
is facing the door which is great

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.619 
is facing the door which is great
because<00:00:39.920> they<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.000> see<00:00:42.000> what's<00:00:42.180> coming

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
because they can see what's coming

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.709 
because they can see what's coming
they're<00:00:42.870> facing<00:00:43.290> opportunity<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.719> that's

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
they're facing opportunity and that's

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.630 
they're facing opportunity and that's
exactly<00:00:46.289> where<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.469> would<00:00:46.559> put<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> couch<00:00:47.190> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
exactly where I would put the couch the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.389 
exactly where I would put the couch the
only<00:00:47.910> adjustment<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.690> would<00:00:48.840> make<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.399> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
only adjustment I would make is the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.670 
only adjustment I would make is the
thing<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.730> isn't<00:00:50.940> great<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:52.140> actually<00:00:52.289> be

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
thing that isn't great is to actually be

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.950 
thing that isn't great is to actually be
in<00:00:52.800> line<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.730> door<00:00:54.000> because<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.930> door

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
in line with the door because the door

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.860 
in line with the door because the door
is<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.860> call<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.670> mouth<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.629> chi

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
is what we call the mouth of the chi

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.740 
is what we call the mouth of the chi
that<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.770> where<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.160> chi<00:00:59.489> or<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> energy<00:01:00.000> most

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
that is where the chi or the energy most

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.280 
that is where the chi or the energy most
strongly<00:01:01.500> enters<00:01:02.100> your<00:01:02.250> home<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.629> sit<00:01:03.930> in

strongly enters your home and to sit in
line<00:01:05.189> with<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.810> could<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:07.020> harmful<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:08.220> not

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
line with it could be harmful it's not

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.550 
line with it could be harmful it's not
necessarily<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.750> depends<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.350> how

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
necessarily but it depends on how

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.590 
necessarily but it depends on how
strongly<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.369> Chi<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.670> entering<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
strongly that Chi is entering so to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.260 
strongly that Chi is entering so to
protect<00:01:13.229> yourself<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:14.490> don't<00:01:14.820> want<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.090> sit

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
protect yourself you don't want to sit

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.270 
protect yourself you don't want to sit
right<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.540> line<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> door<00:01:16.200> now<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.890> way

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
right in line with the door now the way

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.020 
right in line with the door now the way
that<00:01:17.640> their<00:01:18.060> couch<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:19.159> it<00:01:20.159> actually<00:01:20.700> could<00:01:21.000> be

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that their couch is it actually could be

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.080 
that their couch is it actually could be
shifted<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.110> little<00:01:22.290> bit<00:01:22.439> more<00:01:22.830> over<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.060> that

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
shifted a little bit more over so that

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.670 
shifted a little bit more over so that
they're<00:01:24.330> not<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.540> line<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.229> door<00:01:25.409> of

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
they're not in line with the door of

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.580 
they're not in line with the door of
course<00:01:26.520> then<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.659> get<00:01:27.840> into<00:01:28.200> things<00:01:28.380> like

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
course then you get into things like

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.130 
course then you get into things like
it's<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:29.640> too<00:01:29.820> close<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.570> hallway

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
it's a little too close to the hallway

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.490 
it's a little too close to the hallway
what<00:01:31.860> do<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.280> then<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.720> they<00:01:34.020> decided

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
what do you do then so if they decided

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.410 
what do you do then so if they decided
to<00:01:34.710> leave<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> couch<00:01:35.430> where<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.210> not

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
to leave the couch where it is and not

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.899 
to leave the couch where it is and not
move<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.040> we<00:01:38.040> would<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.579> do

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
move it we would just have to do

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.810 
move it we would just have to do
something<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:40.049> block<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.560> Chi<00:01:41.130> from<00:01:41.460> coming

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
something to block the Chi from coming

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.080 
something to block the Chi from coming
too<00:01:42.000> quickly<00:01:42.509> at<00:01:42.930> them<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:44.189> we'd<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.880> put

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
too quickly at them so we'd have to put

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.410 
too quickly at them so we'd have to put
something<00:01:45.479> between<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.049> door<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.710> couch

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
something between the door and the couch

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420 
something between the door and the couch
and<00:01:48.420> there's<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.110> couple<00:01:49.470> things<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.130> can

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
and there's a couple things that we can

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.420 
and there's a couple things that we can
do<00:01:50.930> one<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.320> actually<00:01:52.710> hang<00:01:53.100> something

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
do one is to actually hang something

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.760 
do one is to actually hang something
from<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.880> ceiling<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.659> I'm<00:01:55.350> going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> show

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
from the ceiling and I'm going to show

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.139 
from the ceiling and I'm going to show
you<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.950> little<00:01:56.189> bit<00:01:56.280> later<00:01:56.579> one<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.030> those

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
you a little bit later one of those

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.780
