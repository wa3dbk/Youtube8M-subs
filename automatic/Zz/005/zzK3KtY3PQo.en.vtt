handy as I say it's on a Citroen

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.310 
handy as I say it's on a Citroen
dispatch<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:52.519> that's<00:02:53.519> a<00:02:53.610> nice<00:02:53.930> nice<00:02:54.930> kappa

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.070 

plenty<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.410> room<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.799> there<00:02:59.060> and<00:03:00.060> as<00:03:00.750> far<00:03:01.019> as

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
plenty of room in there and as far as

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.729 
plenty of room in there and as far as
the<00:03:01.560> beds<00:03:02.070> are<00:03:02.340> concerned<00:03:02.820> it<00:03:03.000> looks<00:03:03.030> again

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
the beds are concerned it looks again

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.259 
the beds are concerned it looks again
you've<00:03:04.739> got<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.920> table<00:03:05.160> there<00:03:05.580> were<00:03:05.730> two<00:03:05.940> chairs

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
you've got a table there were two chairs

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.030 
you've got a table there were two chairs
which<00:03:06.660> looks<00:03:06.989> like<00:03:07.049> it<00:03:07.320> converts<00:03:07.709> into<00:03:07.950> a

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
which looks like it converts into a

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.390 
which looks like it converts into a
single<00:03:08.430> bed<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.420> city<00:03:09.630> there<00:03:10.200> which<00:03:11.070> will

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
single bed and the city there which will

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.890 
single bed and the city there which will
convert<00:03:11.670> into<00:03:12.860> a<00:03:13.860> single<00:03:14.820> bed<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:15.750> would

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
convert into a single bed and I would

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.870 
convert into a single bed and I would
imagine<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.709> can<00:03:16.950> put<00:03:17.250> something

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
imagine that you can put something

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.330 
imagine that you can put something
across<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:18.510> middle<00:03:18.810> there<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.799> make<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.070> into

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
across the middle there to make it into

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.780 
across the middle there to make it into
a<00:03:20.370> larger<00:03:20.760> double<00:03:21.030> if<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.299> want<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:23.670> only

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
a larger double if you want the only

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.080 
a larger double if you want the only
thing<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.120> would<00:03:24.180> say<00:03:24.299> about<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:25.049> one<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:26.090> it

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
thing I would say about this one is it

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.310 
thing I would say about this one is it
looks<00:03:27.239> like<00:03:27.420> it's<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.750> two<00:03:27.930> person<00:03:28.170> only<00:03:30.260> so<00:03:31.260> you
