00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.080
 hello youtube friends today I bring you 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.000
 an analysis to the 13th remember that this 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.900
 analysis is exclusively for nintendo 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.730
 wii as you all know wi is inferior in 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.259
 how much power compared to the others 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.000
 consoles of this generation ps3 xbox360 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.800
 fact reflected in the game was 13 and not 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.560
 only in the graphics as many 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.400
 you will think here I leave you with the analysis 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.829
 playability 3 out of 10 is impossible to play 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.839
 well just start you realize that 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.180
 the game is very slow even with 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.860
 aerial fighters with no face instead of 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.480
 running in a ring seems to run in the 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.580
 Moon of such slowness graphics 4 of 10 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.470
 obviously having no graphics in hd we 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.660
 and can not give as much as the others of 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.090
 generation but yes that can give more 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.790
 that in 13 where the graphics could be 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.440
 of ps2 as seen in games 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.320
 like the legend of zelda twilight 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.390
 princess or super mario galaxy we know 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.480
 that the dv3 graphics in wii is not 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.310
 box 360 compares the differences 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.090
 they are tremendous 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.830
 26 out of 10 you remember the online mode 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.840
 forget about him because in wii he is not 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.480
 present although we have the modes 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.180
 exhibition attitude of era and others 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.800
 present in the other versions is not 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.280
 the only big disadvantage in comparison 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.440
 to ps3 and xbox but also those of lc that 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.570
 in wii there is no fun 4 out of 10 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.890
 I'm seldom bored by a game but this one 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.660
 not only bored me 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.000
 I really hate him for the disappointment that 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.580
 I have caused myself and there is surely 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.650
 a lot of wii users after 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.570
 all the promos of always of the segment 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.790
 with john laurinaitis in ground over 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.979
 what would be the cover the disappointment is 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.020
 huge is nothing realistic that 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.020
 characters of the weight of mick foley tarden 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.000
 more than a second to fall nudge by 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.790
 another mistake is the bad use 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.210
 of spanglish which deteriorates the beautiful 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.720
 Spanish language in summary where fails 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.790
 this game in its slowness if wii is not 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.640
 powerful enough for the predator 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.220
 technology 2.0 should have taken the 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.590
 play directly paraguay or console 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.010
 that will be out in less than a month that has 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.010
 been everything
