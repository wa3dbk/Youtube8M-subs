almost<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.259> month<00:01:40.439> earlier<00:01:40.950> than<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:42.000> Xbox<00:01:42.540> one

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
almost a month earlier than the Xbox one

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.609

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
think about that for a second so I mean

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.139 
think about that for a second so I mean
it<00:01:46.740> would<00:01:46.829> still<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.159> tough<00:01:47.430> console<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.939> get

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
it would still be a tough console to get

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.660 
it would still be a tough console to get

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.590

for<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.470> PlayStation<00:01:53.070> 4<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:54.149> if<00:01:54.270> they<00:01:54.450> are

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
