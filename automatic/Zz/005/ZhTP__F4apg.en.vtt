00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.130
 Hello dear friends today 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.529
 I'll show you how to build such a truck 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:11.610
 minecraft put the first block of coal 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.700
 spam three blocks put another one on 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.250
 fourth put another block of coal 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.250
 now we have to retreat 9 blocks and 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.660
 we put directly the tenth one more 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.650
 block back down three blocks set another 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:37.770
 now fly to our front wheels 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:41.040
 we put it like this 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:47.190
 we put three blocks because I'm sorry 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:50.180
 not so even so on yes everything is like this 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.180
 we put 3 blocks 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.180
 connecting 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:06.830
 and here we fill this space too 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:09.979
 yellow clay put these rear wheels 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.910
 like this two blocks 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:20.360
 this is superfluous with us and on the second wheel 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:24.979
 do the same thing and now we have to 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.619
 to take from rice and red clay yellow 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.369
 we must owe between no space 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:37.119
 stay space in one block 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:41.380
 now we do the same here 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:49.880
 ready further raising red clay on 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:50.450
 one block is also doing from the second 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.479
 block 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.670
 that is, here we are raising the same way 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.460
 one more goal 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.390
 then we will have to do here 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:10.690
 the same therebetween 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:14.049
 partition and pour the floor u just 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.049
 red clay 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:23.360
 fill it, too, so we missed a little bit 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:27.610
 we fill in too simply and 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.610
 make a floor to this 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:39.000
 but it's not the truck itself yet it's him 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:46.350
 trailer before we take the red glass 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.380
 panel just such and here and here and here 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:53.820
 we put it in something like that 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:03:02.160
 which opens yes now we go here 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:06.180
 and make here a wall three blocks high 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.530
 apart from this one two three and so 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.530
 flood fill 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.540

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:46.489
 make the ceiling so the wind is strong 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:54.830
 anything head up when we poured everything 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:04:00.930

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:06.500
