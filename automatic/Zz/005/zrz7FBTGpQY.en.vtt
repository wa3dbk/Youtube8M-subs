that<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.100> doesn't<00:00:38.489> leave<00:00:38.700> them<00:00:38.969> with<00:00:39.120> very

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
that it doesn't leave them with very

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
much time to go for this exploratory

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.700 
much time to go for this exploratory
methods<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.270> teaching<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.290> what<00:00:43.620> you

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
methods of teaching is that what you

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.740 
methods of teaching is that what you
understand<00:00:44.190> as<00:00:44.370> well<00:00:44.550> as<00:00:44.850> all<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.600> these

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
understand as well as all of these

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.560 
understand as well as all of these
things<00:00:46.050> come<00:00:47.059> you<00:00:48.059> would<00:00:48.210> need<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.539> think

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
things come you would need to think

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.529 
things come you would need to think
differently<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.700> I<00:00:50.700> think<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
differently and I think it is the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.869 
differently and I think it is the
thinking<00:00:52.110> differently<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:54.379> makes<00:00:55.379> for

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
thinking differently that makes for

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.750 
thinking differently that makes for
different<00:00:56.879> work<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.360> different<00:00:58.260> work

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
different work and different work

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.369 
different work and different work
inevitably<00:00:59.760> becomes<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.480> little<00:01:00.960> bit<00:01:01.109> more

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
inevitably becomes a little bit more

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.380 
inevitably becomes a little bit more
work<00:01:01.620> because<00:01:04.309> things<00:01:05.309> get<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.880> lot<00:01:06.150> more

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
work because things get a lot more

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.050 
work because things get a lot more
complicated<00:01:06.869> as<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.799> do<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.729> example

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
complicated as we do this for example

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.250 
complicated as we do this for example
when<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.450> want<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.689> do<00:01:09.869> something

when you want to do something

when you want to do something

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
help teaching be more meaningful that's

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.010 
help teaching be more meaningful that's
why<00:02:05.549> they<00:02:05.729> are<00:02:05.759> good<00:02:05.939> ideas<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:06.659> not<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> good

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
why they are good ideas it's not a good

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.119 
why they are good ideas it's not a good
idea<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.409> get<00:02:07.500> an<00:02:07.649> award

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
idea to get an award

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.040 
idea to get an award
I<00:02:08.160> think<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.179> award<00:02:09.420> was<00:02:09.629> just<00:02:09.899> that

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
I think the award was just that

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.400 
I think the award was just that
structure<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:11.459> give<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.290> framework

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
structure to to give it a of a framework

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.259 
structure to to give it a of a framework

they<00:02:42.250> found<00:02:42.580> that<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:43.830> 1-1<00:02:44.830> point<00:02:45.670> would<00:02:45.880> be

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
they found that a 1-1 point would be

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.880 
they found that a 1-1 point would be
during<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.720> first<00:02:46.750> year<00:02:47.230> because<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.860> first

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
during the first year because the first

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.280 
during the first year because the first
year<00:02:48.130> is<00:02:48.340> really<00:02:48.850> quite<00:02:49.300> terrifying<00:02:49.480> there's

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
year is really quite terrifying there's

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.030 
year is really quite terrifying there's
so<00:02:50.800> many<00:02:51.130> new<00:02:51.430> things<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.910> do<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:53.020> and<00:02:53.710> it's<00:02:53.950> a

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
so many new things to do and and it's a

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.340 
so many new things to do and and it's a
totally<00:02:54.520> new<00:02:54.550> culture<00:02:55.180> etc<00:02:55.300> so<00:02:55.900> that<00:02:55.930> first

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
totally new culture etc so that first

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.710 
totally new culture etc so that first
year<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.860> really<00:02:57.040> tough<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.610> then<00:02:58.210> there<00:02:58.570> is

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
year is really tough and then there is

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.720 
year is really tough and then there is
another<00:02:59.050> point<00:02:59.440> I'm<00:03:00.010> not<00:03:00.250> quite<00:03:00.460> sure<00:03:00.490> whether

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
another point I'm not quite sure whether

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.670 
another point I'm not quite sure whether
it<00:03:00.880> was<00:03:00.940> at<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.210> third<00:03:01.450> year<00:03:01.720> when<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.440> bond

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
it was at the third year when the bond

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.040 
it was at the third year when the bond
is<00:03:02.860> up<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.250> then<00:03:03.670> people<00:03:04.240> will<00:03:04.420> think<00:03:04.570> do<00:03:05.020> I

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
is up and then people will think do I

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.800 
is up and then people will think do I
really<00:03:05.200> have<00:03:05.770> another<00:03:06.580> choice<00:03:06.850> why<00:03:07.390> is<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:07.660> so

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
really have another choice why is it so

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.660 
really have another choice why is it so
important<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.590> science<00:03:08.950> of<00:03:09.070> stress<00:03:09.460> are

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
important that the science of stress are

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.900 
important that the science of stress are
recognized<00:03:11.580> if<00:03:12.580> they<00:03:13.120> were<00:03:13.180> not<00:03:13.480> recognized

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
recognized if they were not recognized

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.200 
recognized if they were not recognized
we<00:03:15.910> lose<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:17.470> much<00:03:17.680> we<00:03:18.310> need<00:03:18.580> all<00:03:18.880> of<00:03:18.910> you

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
we lose so much we need all of you

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.750 
we lose so much we need all of you
because<00:03:19.630> as<00:03:20.290> many<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:20.800> you<00:03:21.070> as<00:03:21.220> we<00:03:21.400> can<00:03:21.550> keep

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
because as many of you as we can keep

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.810 
because as many of you as we can keep
successfully<00:03:22.630> helps<00:03:23.440> us<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.980> therefore<00:03:24.640> have

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
successfully helps us to therefore have

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.180 
successfully helps us to therefore have
enough<00:03:25.180> teachers<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.780> keep<00:03:25.960> some<00:03:26.500> class<00:03:26.860> sizes

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
enough teachers to keep some class sizes

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.000 
enough teachers to keep some class sizes
down<00:03:27.670> so<00:03:28.300> it's<00:03:28.480> important<00:03:29.020> to<00:03:29.110> us<00:03:29.290> every

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
down so it's important to us every

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.590 
down so it's important to us every
teacher<00:03:30.310> that<00:03:30.490> leaves<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.060> profession<00:03:31.570> for

whatever reason is a loss as the saying

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.370 
whatever reason is a loss as the saying

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
level representative so in any case if

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.720 
level representative so in any case if
you<00:04:07.570> have<00:04:07.720> any<00:04:07.900> any<00:04:08.110> resources<00:04:08.890> or<00:04:09.190> unclear<00:04:09.670> of

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
you have any any resources or unclear of

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.330 
you have any any resources or unclear of
anything<00:04:10.150> we<00:04:10.750> can<00:04:10.930> she<00:04:11.050> referred<00:04:11.380> to<00:04:11.410> her<00:04:11.709> so<00:04:12.070> I

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
anything we can she referred to her so I

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.010 
anything we can she referred to her so I
guess<00:04:12.489> sometimes<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.030> mentor<00:04:13.390> is<00:04:13.600> not<00:04:13.780> very

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
guess sometimes the mentor is not very

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.900 
guess sometimes the mentor is not very
formal<00:04:14.350> sometimes<00:04:14.709> it<00:04:14.920> can<00:04:15.130> be<00:04:15.280> just<00:04:15.610> a<00:04:15.730> meet

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
formal sometimes it can be just a meet

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.729 
formal sometimes it can be just a meet
up<00:04:16.090> along<00:04:16.480> the<00:04:16.570> corridor<00:04:17.080> and<00:04:17.260> then<00:04:17.440> we<00:04:17.530> can

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
up along the corridor and then we can

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.890 
up along the corridor and then we can
just<00:04:17.980> tell<00:04:18.609> her<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:18.970> problem<00:04:19.180> we<00:04:19.390> face<00:04:19.419> on<00:04:19.810> the

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
just tell her the problem we face on the

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.020 
just tell her the problem we face on the
actually<00:04:20.350> and<00:04:20.590> sure<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.609> men<00:04:21.760> thought<00:04:21.970> they

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
actually and sure the men thought they

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.270 
actually and sure the men thought they
were<00:04:22.270> just<00:04:22.540> help<00:04:22.750> us<00:04:22.870> directly<00:04:23.560> immediately

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
were just help us directly immediately

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.610 
were just help us directly immediately
what<00:04:24.820> do<00:04:25.030> you<00:04:25.180> think<00:04:25.510> is<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.870> most<00:04:26.020> critical

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
what do you think is the most critical

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.950 
what do you think is the most critical
factor<00:04:27.130> that<00:04:27.700> makes<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.330> mentoring<00:04:28.660> system

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
factor that makes the mentoring system

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.260 
factor that makes the mentoring system
work<00:04:29.500> I<00:04:29.830> think<00:04:30.180> we<00:04:31.180> must<00:04:31.300> be<00:04:31.450> very<00:04:31.630> open<00:04:32.190> and

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
work I think we must be very open and

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.900 
work I think we must be very open and
non-judgmental<00:04:34.350> because<00:04:35.350> as<00:04:35.890> mentors<00:04:36.640> we<00:04:36.820> are

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
non-judgmental because as mentors we are

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.220 
non-judgmental because as mentors we are
not<00:04:37.060> there<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.360> judge<00:04:37.419> whether<00:04:37.960> they<00:04:38.169> are

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
not there to judge whether they are

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.720 
not there to judge whether they are
doing<00:04:38.320> a<00:04:38.470> good<00:04:38.620> job<00:04:38.680> we<00:04:39.100> should<00:04:39.280> be<00:04:39.370> very

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
doing a good job we should be very

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.820 
doing a good job we should be very
understanding<00:04:40.510> that<00:04:40.660> means<00:04:40.840> every<00:04:41.080> time<00:04:41.260> they

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
understanding that means every time they

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.340 
understanding that means every time they
have<00:04:41.980> a<00:04:42.010> problem<00:04:42.400> we<00:04:43.030> target<00:04:43.450> at<00:04:43.570> a<00:04:43.630> problem<00:04:44.140> we

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
have a problem we target at a problem we

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.220 
have a problem we target at a problem we
really<00:04:45.180> try<00:04:46.180> and<00:04:46.210> solve<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:46.870> problem

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
really try and solve the problem

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.970 
really try and solve the problem
together<00:04:47.410> I<00:04:48.010> think<00:04:48.550> that's<00:04:48.700> more<00:04:48.850> important

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
together I think that's more important

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.970 
together I think that's more important
and<00:04:50.210> then<00:04:51.210> telling<00:04:52.170> them<00:04:52.320> where<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.860> have

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
and then telling them where you have

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.370 
and then telling them where you have
gone<00:04:53.220> wrong<00:04:53.460> because<00:04:53.910> we<00:04:54.690> all<00:04:54.840> make<00:04:54.990> mistakes

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
gone wrong because we all make mistakes

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.050 
gone wrong because we all make mistakes
and<00:04:55.650> we<00:04:55.860> all<00:04:56.010> learn<00:04:56.190> throughout<00:04:56.490> one<00:04:56.640> mystics

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060
