00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 now that we have this 

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.100
 which we have already learned as 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.170
 watermark 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.809
 we'll be tomorrow is the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.750
 resizing than this 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.660
 the comb the fish for you to resize 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.189
 a very simple image here in the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.279
 diagonals it shows an option 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.710
 this option here in this square is 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.349
 you move the mouse over him 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.750
 I realize that there is some change what is this 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.239
 when you click and drag click with 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.510
 the left mouse button is rare you 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.879
 save resizing the screen size 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.460
 of paint 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:45.930
 now when you come here and I wanted a 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.489
 circus selection on it here gives you another 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.190
 silas option noticed that it is not 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.730
 more related to the painting screen 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.340
 just object you click here on you 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.629
 network mentions the size of images 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.219
 both for the smallest and the largest 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.369
 now how to do this same process in the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.710
 link is not too difficult in the same place 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.930
 and I know that there are no squares here 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.920
 Let's try national network but he has 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.030
 shortcut 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.340
 you can come here image size of 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.729
 canvas what's that you 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.580
 is modifying the size of the deed 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:30.150
 but it was not modifying the layer for 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:32.670
 example this padlock here is what if I 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.369
 begin to decrease kim and will decrease in 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.570
 right down and click 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.259
 change size 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:44.009
 I realize this behind and already represents this 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:48.890
 and this dashed represents the 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.780
 our our other layer of watermark 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.130
 much later in the future but the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.570
 size of the canvas was 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.060
 decreasing then it is this size 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.950
 when you were to tell this image she 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.689
 will only recognize the size of the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.489
 not the size of the image that is 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.400
 the same process I did a comb 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.650
 change the humanity painting is as if I 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.770
 would create 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.290
 a rectangle here and get this montage 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.010
 paint and cut if n 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.500
 it may even exist until more but as 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.040
 decrease the size of the canvas and 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.650
 only recognizes and the size of the screen that 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.290
 is here in which you are resized 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.610
 when you know this image and do not talk 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.850
 is the whole image and even in the case of pent 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.610
 You can even erase a game case. 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.090
 The end is still there in the same 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.620
 size of the area found to be task 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.200
 coming back as it was 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.750
 I am selected that the background that the 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.660
 our photo and you come here to 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.660
 carving tool to resize 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.860
 change the size of the layer you will 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.900
 click 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.940
 when you click on the image it appears 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.970
 those options 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:17.880
 that's right the d'aquino a comb these 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.880
 options in selection click here 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.180
 I did not need to select and select 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.920
 the object 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:32.829
 in this case it is this tool 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.440
 she recognizes the entire layer she does not 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.280
 recognized another layer and here in the 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.579
 Olympic 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.549
 he works in a more advanced way 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:45.430
 and works across layers of data allows 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.280
 use advanced features and here 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.019
 also you can keep a padlock that 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.850
 what is this when you decrease the image 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.930
 and it will decrease equally 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:04:01.000
 or you remove the padlock and resized 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:03.540
 it only width but it is not changing 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.930
 here below to the height 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:11.440
 if you do not want to make it to Josue but 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.090
 he shows you how she is there but not 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.970
 I mean she changed she just goes 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.370
 change when you want to resize and 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.660
 nor gives you the option to restore you 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:26.030
 can also make me 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:29.900
 click here image as it was 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.450
 you click resize ready 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.550
 the image has been scaled the thesis is thus 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.730
 but has a background its lens understands the 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.570
 our new layer and was our 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:44.110
 you can resize it you can 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.110
 be click here 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:53.450
 resize we can zoom pave one 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:57.380
 was you ask me or click 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:05:00.310
 move in the moving layer where you 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.590
 I want to put it, I realized that we 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.690
 we learned what to resize to 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.500
 and resizes the size of the 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:21.449
 canvas 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:21.449
