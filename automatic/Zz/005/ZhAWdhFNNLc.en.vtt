00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.730 

the<00:01:47.820> 3g<00:01:48.359> version<00:01:48.390> downloads<00:01:49.289> in<00:01:50.000> five<00:01:51.000> seconds

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.999

download<00:02:05.240> speeds<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:06.080> again<00:02:06.350> if<00:02:06.560> we<00:02:07.070> compare

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
download speeds and again if we compare

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.270 
download speeds and again if we compare
