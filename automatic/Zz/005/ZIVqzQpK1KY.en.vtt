00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.069
 ah 

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:06.069
 how 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.940
 ah 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.940
 ah 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.430
 and the people I am that the stripper also 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.080
 known as the heir of isildur and 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.550
 I'm here it looks like it's a trick 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.990
 quite interesting, pretty cool 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.980
 I discovered the other day and good for longer 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.450
 you know that I do not look for much in 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.640
 minecraft and from time to time then I do 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.770
 strange things good first thing I go 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.980
 to leave is these guys of 70 if I believe 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.290
 that is worth a two three come 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.200
 oh my god a dragon that sets fire 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.660
 It's cool what this is about, it's pretty 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.340
 quite curious I have become a dragon 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.960
 well this dragon is from the map of the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.090
 crafter who later showed us his map 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.879
 my very old that you should have like 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.290
 about two years old or more not not a year and 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.790
 medium but he has or two years I do not know 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.430
 but it has a lot and good this is 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.629
 quite curious there you see it is worth and here 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.820
 I'm going to show you another example that this one 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.680
 it's more hardcore to practice explaining 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.500
 is very hardcore yes and this is the example 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.440
 more normal guys how do you see two 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.840
 fireballs made fire but 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.550
 normal and I'm worth this is very very simple 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.130
 how I did it, then let's stop 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.630
 we're going to stop it here and I'm going to 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.730
 teach a little thing guys we're going to 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.170
 come here for a moment 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.170
 and I do not know if you listen 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.640
 today mine but this has appeared 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.140
 cows if you remember a long time ago 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.240
 I made a video of a mox submachine gun 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.190
 ok and it was something like that so this here 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.230
 there are invisible blocks, I can not 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.080
 access them and then if now 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.960
 himself launched a mode here because it 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.700
 shoot or you see look again and it has 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.710
 fired does already there are very well and now 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.110
 here I throw mox mogollÃ³n here inside 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.210
 so now let's make an example 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.130
 small since many mobs the head 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.860
 box increases it seems that increasing 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.500
 then when he later launched some 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.590
 another mode or exposes to some other move in 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.540
 this area here here or here comes out 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.920
 shot towards one direction you see 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.260
 what because here in a lot of 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.460
 mobs and therefore therefore it seems that 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.620
 they shoot out because they are afraid not 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.620
 I know then let's kill these cows 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.560
 very well very well and that you touch them more 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.850
 very well and now I will explain 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.620
 what are fireballs I suppose 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.330
 Many of you will know, guys. 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.640
 what have I done before linking a 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.240
 invisibility position and the balls of 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.580
 fires are nothing but cursed 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.980
 zombies let's see it here and here we go 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.660
 to put instead of 14 we are going to put an 11 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.120
 and we are going to remove the fire this is the 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.230
 fire is worth the fire is the fire these 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.540
 commands are going to be all in the 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.100
 description and you know you have to 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.420
 download them 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.030
 we give him here and as you can see there they are 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.950
 all zombies worth is chaos this 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.350
 but hey it 's a pretty fat chaos 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.850
 my god, my god, let's cover it up 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.739
 mods do not die because they exist 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.720
 but it is a matter of doing so and they are already 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.850
 all dead then they have 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.560
 invisibility and they have fire vale 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.940
 then it seems that as good as 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.280
 It has invisibility and fire because it seems 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.050
 that the flame and the dragon come out here 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.180
 made several systems that are good 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.040
 simple one is slower another faster 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.530
 and another is normal this last one here is 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.720
 curious for one thing let's put here 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.100
 so here we are going to take the fire away 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.720
 to see one thing that is pretty funny 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.290
 the other day I left the eyelet enough 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.520
 to fix the guys to look at that 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.080
 see what happens in the network box this 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.670
 is what makes you look at the cows are 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.370
 completely the houses are moved 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.020
 ok this does not affect but I would not have 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.180
 been here I do not know I found it quite 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.090
 curious the truth see so many the house and 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.670
 so jumping is pretty curious yes yes 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.660
 the next my god like nothing this 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.569
 is a trick then in the 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.090
 inscription you have the commands are valid and 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.650
 Well, you know that this can be done 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.700
 do a lot of things I was thinking 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.440
 make a cannon so if you want 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.450
 do it, you can do it 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.090
 then as you can see there appear the 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.560
 dragon balls and this one is already exaggerated 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.230
 that appear many more than the 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.880
 true, I did it like that and that's 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.040
 here is the one I like but right now 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.050
 Well it does not work because the cows this 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.220
 it should be the fire should be here 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.360
 in 100 there and now it would work already 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.080
 the bad thing is that cows like it is not so 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.930
 invisible as it moves and if more things 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.520
 You see how the time is much worse is 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:14.520
 very strange so well burned burnt 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.900
 burned to the bottom my god here 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.810
 even reality or a little look with 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.120
 your damn maps for all 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.580
 and good guys it was I hope that I have 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.860
 liked this little video and I 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.590
 dismissal by pressing this button and watching 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.770
 as cremonia is again the cows what 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.620
 about them and as always no 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.910
 assume to see many movies not to go 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.910
 to the cinema to see many movies 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.450
 uy I was forgetting guys this map is 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.190
 a map of hunger games' it's worth doing 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.310
 a lot of time ago with several 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.620
 several friends among them marmolillo and 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.330
 a crazy biker that is a big one that 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.670
 helped me do a lot of things is a 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.050
 map that did not have much success because 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.460
 they were hunger games' and that one 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.400
 people have no idea what they would do 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.500
 janer game and good is a little water 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.940
 but this map cost us a lot 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.830
 doing it we are doing it in summer and 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.870
 the truth because it was pretty cool if 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.270
 you want to see the trailer I leave the 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.550
 description worth looking for the crafter 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.130

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.830
 trailer is cool enough I'm leaving or I 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.500
 I stay with that here things do not 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.870
 I 'm wrong and then, well, that's 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.110
 I wanted to download is in the description 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.090
 and it's now I'm leaving and you want 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.460
 there to do your little things look at the 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.830
