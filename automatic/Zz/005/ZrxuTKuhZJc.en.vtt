00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
like this team right here and not sure

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.229 
like this team right here and not sure
about<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.229> blizzy<00:04:12.650> though<00:04:12.859> it<00:04:13.159> wasn't<00:04:14.060> able

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
about the blizzy though it wasn't able

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.599 
about the blizzy though it wasn't able
to<00:04:14.449> really<00:04:14.750> do<00:04:14.900> much<00:04:15.259> any<00:04:15.859> kind<00:04:15.889> of<00:04:16.190> place<00:04:16.340> as<00:04:16.579> a

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
to really do much any kind of place as a

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.509 
to really do much any kind of place as a
same<00:04:17.060> exact<00:04:17.479> role<00:04:17.659> of<00:04:17.900> chances<00:04:18.799> so<00:04:19.039> later<00:04:19.250> on<00:04:19.340> I

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
same exact role of chances so later on I

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.320 
same exact role of chances so later on I
decided<00:04:19.969> to<00:04:20.180> replace<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:20.919> Pokemon<00:04:22.330> which
