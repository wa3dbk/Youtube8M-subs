00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.720
 Zoellick here an elixir 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.200
 2010 with the slightly higher resolution 800 times 480 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.589
 will be fed directly by the captain 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.239
 Crown 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:16.890
 nice with Windows 7 running 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.480
 but you have to go out Hermann from the previous year 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:26.979
 Peter Skaarup Summing Up Sad Signal with Burkhalter Electronics 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:32.329
 make up the jury consisting of an ICE 2 commentator and Spaniard 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.739
 relative 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.010
 with the bouquet 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.140
 future 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.250
 close 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.480
 in the middle of blood 960 times 540 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.060
 30 is value in thale 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.090
 The picture actually wages quite stable 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.120
 lying on the ground has been curious to hear was actually relatively easy 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.090
 Human League move up 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.140
 Peter Kammerer gritty the crawling let Hedl be 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.160
 for Les Bleus job 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.390
 there were 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.110
 curious 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.140
 we just need active 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.170
 For brewing bat the controller is up here next to the dvd drive 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.500
 MÃ¶lders USB cable 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.500
 I get out in the back 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.380
 To get ONP 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.420
 the depiction is actually so important clean Odenthal it is 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.830
 stunted screen unfortunately not natively drive 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.830
 that is to hear 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.690
 Click this would clear bouts of combat 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.470
 Indeed 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.470
 it was important 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.420
 this CCP 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.160
 which father is an original optics for free choice 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.780
 then should 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.310
 and so at that time the display here was at the discretion the fee 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.630
 navigation 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.940
 District new features 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.690
 are just continuing 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.900
 good use 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.890
 the KBC is running here special was requested in the network input 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.169
 young firing head use 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:32.229
 but the format representation 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.739
 also quite compared 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.739
 so Bruno impression 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:43.909
 Klapheck count is required are the amounts of word people arms 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:47.619
 what's it called again 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.120
 May definitely 2 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.359
 feel integrated by the dual atom processor RAM 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.579
 Percent graphic card 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.149
 now Astana 500 kilovolts 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:03:02.969
 the fairground Euro Odenthal partitions on it partition 85 thereby through the 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:04.879
 operating system 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.879
 now known the second partition 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:12.309
 the menu word 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:15.309
 Otterstedt but agree 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.949
 the samples for the 20th 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:23.449
 for me that was important for the percent of the SPD 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.119
 Strauss-Kahn has 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:30.669
 and percent so you can live in the case now quickly breakdown from death 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.139
 provided 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.969
 you have to control and of course also to full sound 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.569
 In addition, the analog inputs are used by the ns-regime 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.609
 but in order to either muck to wrinkle Bensmann the analog one can immediately 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:47.549
 Neck up 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.549
 Berardi without navigation Switch 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:55.619
 Digital output 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:58.759
 stealthily a half fundamental processor 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.179
 back to the 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:01.659
 with analogue input Scholl 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.549
 for the time being 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.149
 regulated differently 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:07.599
 Yes who 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.919
 would like to build something like that 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.369
 the Munich Marco Klitschko
