rookie<00:00:47.239> cards<00:00:47.510> out<00:00:47.629> yet<00:00:47.960> but<00:00:47.989> let's<00:00:48.350> look<00:00:48.469> at

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.940 
rookie cards out yet but let's look at
these<00:00:48.739> stats<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:49.790> he's<00:00:50.300> comparison<00:00:50.989> against

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
these stats so he's comparison against

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.000 
these stats so he's comparison against
my<00:00:52.129> Steve<00:00:52.550> Smith<00:00:52.820> senior<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:53.510> he's<00:00:54.260> had<00:00:54.770> some

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
my Steve Smith senior and he's had some

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.970 
my Steve Smith senior and he's had some
insane<00:00:55.340> sets<00:00:55.700> his<00:00:56.510> speeds<00:00:56.840> in<00:00:56.960> 96<00:00:57.469> it's<00:00:57.770> only

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
insane sets his speeds in 96 it's only

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.830 
insane sets his speeds in 96 it's only
worse<00:00:58.280> by<00:00:58.460> Steve<00:00:58.760> Smith<00:00:59.059> by<00:00:59.239> three<00:00:59.629> I<00:00:59.660> think

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
worse by Steve Smith by three I think

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.760 
worse by Steve Smith by three I think
Smith<00:01:00.829> has<00:01:01.100> um<00:01:01.399> a<00:01:01.699> 99<00:01:02.660> speed<00:01:02.989> but<00:01:03.230> he<00:01:03.260> has<00:01:03.379> 99

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
Smith has um a 99 speed but he has 99

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.380 
Smith has um a 99 speed but he has 99
catch<00:01:04.360> 97<00:01:05.360> acceleration<00:01:06.280> 96<00:01:07.280> jumped<00:01:07.700> 96

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
catch 97 acceleration 96 jumped 96

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.749 
catch 97 acceleration 96 jumped 96
agility<00:01:08.960> I<00:01:09.229> thought<00:01:09.979> his<00:01:10.160> strength<00:01:10.490> would<00:01:10.640> be

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
agility I thought his strength would be

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.730 
agility I thought his strength would be
a<00:01:10.789> little<00:01:10.970> better<00:01:11.210> because<00:01:11.509> he's<00:01:12.229> a<00:01:12.259> really

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
a little better because he's a really

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.399 
a little better because he's a really
dominant<00:01:13.220> wide<00:01:13.909> receiver<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:14.750> they<00:01:15.229> gave<00:01:15.350> him

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
dominant wide receiver and they gave him

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.490 
dominant wide receiver and they gave him
79<00:01:15.920> strike<00:01:16.159> that<00:01:16.280> is<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.490> lot<00:01:16.760> but<00:01:17.060> I<00:01:17.380> would<00:01:18.380> have

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
79 strike that is a lot but I would have

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.200 
79 strike that is a lot but I would have
been<00:01:18.590> like<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:18.920> see<00:01:19.070> maybe<00:01:19.369> in<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.580> 80s<00:01:20.000> I

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
they had to add him in but maybe if we

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.539 
they had to add him in but maybe if we
didnt<00:04:14.049> glitch<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.620> they<00:04:14.769> because<00:04:15.220> they<00:04:15.340> kind

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
didnt glitch and they because they kind

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.340 
didnt glitch and they because they kind
of<00:04:15.610> did<00:04:15.820> it<00:04:15.850> so<00:04:16.060> people<00:04:16.299> already<00:04:16.750> had<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.109> cam

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
of did it so people already had the cam

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.560 
of did it so people already had the cam
so<00:04:17.560> they're<00:04:17.709> saying<00:04:17.950> hey<00:04:18.160> if<00:04:18.609> you<00:04:19.150> you<00:04:19.419> already

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
so they're saying hey if you you already

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.880 
so they're saying hey if you you already
have<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.840> cam<00:04:20.019> so<00:04:20.229> let's<00:04:20.410> try<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.709> add

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
have the cam so let's try to add

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.560 
have the cam so let's try to add
something<00:04:21.220> to<00:04:21.430> make<00:04:21.609> you<00:04:21.729> actually<00:04:22.120> do<00:04:22.360> the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
something to make you actually do the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.180 
something to make you actually do the
set<00:04:22.840> so<00:04:23.050> they<00:04:23.140> kind<00:04:23.320> of<00:04:23.350> made<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.620> more<00:04:23.740> while

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
set so they kind of made it more while

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.909 
set so they kind of made it more while
more<00:04:24.669> worthwhile<00:04:24.940> doing<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.720> set<00:04:25.960> for<00:04:26.770> those

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
more worthwhile doing the set for those

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.460 
more worthwhile doing the set for those
who<00:04:27.160> did<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.550> glitch<00:04:27.900> but<00:04:28.900> what's<00:04:29.140> it<00:04:29.260> called

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
who did the glitch but what's it called

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.860 
who did the glitch but what's it called
but<00:04:29.950> it<00:04:30.099> would<00:04:30.280> have<00:04:30.340> been<00:04:30.460> sick<00:04:31.150> if<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.479> if<00:04:31.720> it

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
but it would have been sick if you if it

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.300 
but it would have been sick if you if it
didn't<00:04:32.140> happen<00:04:32.289> and<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:32.830> didn't<00:04:33.099> do<00:04:33.190> that

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
didn't happen and it didn't do that

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.969 
didn't happen and it didn't do that
maybe<00:04:33.550> possibly<00:04:34.030> another<00:04:34.360> type<00:04:34.900> of<00:04:34.979> content

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
maybe possibly another type of content

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.219 
maybe possibly another type of content
could've<00:04:36.310> came<00:04:36.460> over<00:04:36.640> for<00:04:36.789> Byron<00:04:37.120> Maxwell<00:04:37.300> so

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
could've came over for Byron Maxwell so

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.200 
could've came over for Byron Maxwell so
you<00:04:38.289> get<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.590> whole<00:04:38.710> Legion<00:04:39.010> of<00:04:39.130> boom<00:04:39.310> but

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
you get the whole Legion of boom but

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.120 
you get the whole Legion of boom but
it's<00:04:40.450> kind<00:04:40.630> of<00:04:40.660> cool<00:04:40.870> that<00:04:40.900> they<00:04:41.169> added<00:04:41.919> it<00:04:42.039> I

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
it's kind of cool that they added it I

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.010 
it's kind of cool that they added it I
guess<00:04:42.340> so<00:04:42.580> it's<00:04:43.150> like<00:04:43.419> two<00:04:43.599> birds<00:04:43.870> with<00:04:43.960> one

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
guess so it's like two birds with one

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.589 
guess so it's like two birds with one
stone<00:04:44.169> I<00:04:44.620> guess<00:04:44.830> so<00:04:45.039> this<00:04:45.880> is<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.120> last<00:04:46.300> pack

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
stone I guess so this is the last pack

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.930 
stone I guess so this is the last pack
on<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:47.020> iphone<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:47.890> we'll<00:04:48.099> go<00:04:48.610> ahead<00:04:48.700> and
