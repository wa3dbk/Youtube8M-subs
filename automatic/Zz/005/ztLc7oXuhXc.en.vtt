in the end she got in the end I think it

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.070 
in the end she got in the end I think it
was<00:06:02.219> the<00:06:02.370> level<00:06:02.550> of<00:06:02.699> violence<00:06:03.020> that<00:06:04.020> she

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
was the level of violence that she

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.140 
was the level of violence that she
brought<00:06:04.439> to<00:06:04.620> the<00:06:04.710> party<00:06:05.069> because<00:06:05.639> she<00:06:05.909> she

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150

brought to the party because she she
bitch-slapped<00:06:06.389> a<00:06:06.839> lot<00:06:07.349> of<00:06:07.469> people<00:06:07.770> I<00:06:07.830> mean<00:06:07.949> the

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
bitch-slapped a lot of people I mean the

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.649 
bitch-slapped a lot of people I mean the
one<00:06:08.729> thing<00:06:08.939> that<00:06:09.029> would<00:06:09.120> make<00:06:09.300> me<00:06:09.449> say

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659 
one thing that would make me say

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:12.549 
one thing that would make me say
something<00:06:10.469> is<00:06:10.650> not<00:06:10.889> the<00:06:11.039> woman<00:06:11.279> of<00:06:11.400> my<00:06:11.430> dreams

00:06:12.549 --> 00:06:12.559 
something is not the woman of my dreams

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:16.939 
something is not the woman of my dreams
she<00:06:13.559> hits<00:06:13.770> everything<00:06:14.039> that<00:06:14.279> moves<00:06:15.830> so<00:06:16.830> it's

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:16.949 
she hits everything that moves so it's

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:18.290 
she hits everything that moves so it's
not<00:06:17.009> the<00:06:17.129> fact<00:06:17.309> that<00:06:17.370> she<00:06:17.550> has<00:06:17.639> a<00:06:17.669> crap<00:06:17.999> every

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
not the fact that she has a crap every

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.769 
not the fact that she has a crap every
time<00:06:19.099> you<00:06:20.099> speak<00:06:20.339> for<00:06:20.550> more<00:06:20.669> than<00:06:20.819> a<00:06:20.849> minute

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:23.779 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:27.560 

it's<00:06:24.779> in<00:06:24.839> the<00:06:24.960> pipeline<00:06:25.169> right
