00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:14.416
Hello, bonjour,
my name is Simon Brault

00:00:14.416 --> 00:00:18.750
and I am the Director and CEO of
the Canada Council for the Arts

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.708
and I am speaking to you from

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:24.041
the Canada Council
Art Bank in Ottawa.

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:27.541
In January of this year,
at our Annual Public Meeting,

00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:30.208
I announced that the
Canada Council had embarked

00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:35.500
on a journey of profound renewal
to remain a vibrant, responsive,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.000
agile and relevant organization
in a rapidly changing world.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.625
We are now at an important
milestone in that journey

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:47.583
of renewal, the announcement
of 6 new funding programs

00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:52.333
that will replace our current
granting programs by 2017.

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:56.125
And yet, this is only
one step along our journey,

00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:59.083
with important
milestones still to come,

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:02.708
including this fall
when we will share more details

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:05.291
about the 6 new programs.

00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:08.750
We are committed to
fully delivering on our mandate

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.541
to promote the creation
and enjoyment of the arts

00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:15.916
in the 21st century,
just as we've done -

00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:18.291
with equal passion
and determination -

00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:20.833
over the past 58 years.

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:24.541
I want to emphasize
that unlike many arts funders

00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:27.333
around the world
which have had to restructure

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:31.208
due to budget cuts
and other external pressures,

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:35.958
we have undertaken this exercise
proactively from a position

00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:39.708
of strength - on our
own terms - to respond to

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:42.916
the changing needs
of the Canadian arts sector.

00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:46.375
Needs that have
been stated and reiterated

00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:49.750
in numerous conversations
and consultations.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.250
Our goal is to reinvent
ourselves in a way that honours

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.416
our history and expertise,
and the learnings that we gain

00:01:58.416 --> 00:02:01.166
each and every day from artists,

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:04.416
cultural workers
and arts organizations.

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:08.416
And so we will move
from a prescriptive model

00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:12.666
to a more open one in which
artists and arts organizations

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:17.333
conduct their quest for
excellence on their own terms.

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:20.833
Let me also emphasize that
we are re-affirming, updating

00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:25.666
and integrating our core values
into our new funding model.

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:29.000
Our commitment to artistic
excellence and peer assessment,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.583
our respect for and promotion
of Canada's official languages,

00:02:33.583 --> 00:02:37.125
our specific support
for the languages, stories,

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:42.000
traditions and contemporary arts
practices of Aboriginal peoples,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.250
and our appreciation of the
diversity and the practices

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.583
of deaf, disabled and
culturally diverse artists -

00:02:50.583 --> 00:02:55.500
these all remain at the heart
of the model we're building.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.500
We are committed
to making the arts a part

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.458
of the everyday lives of all
Canadians and to the principle

00:03:02.458 --> 00:03:07.208
that every citizen must have
the opportunity to see, hear,

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:10.375
experience and
participate in artworks

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:13.208
that have been supported
by public funds.

00:03:13.208 --> 00:03:16.083
The conversations and
consultations that we've had

00:03:16.083 --> 00:03:19.000
with artists
from every discipline and region

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.083
have highlighted complex
and pressing challenges

00:03:22.083 --> 00:03:26.666
and opportunities related to
the creation and sharing of art.

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:29.833
These are the challenges
we want to address

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:32.125
with the 6 new
funding programs.

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:35.708
These conversations
will continue, notably after

00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:40.500
we announce the details of
the 6 programs in the late fall.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.083
One thing that we've heard
loud and clear is that

00:03:44.083 --> 00:03:49.083
we need to simplify and lighten
our application processes.

00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:51.083
We are working on this.

00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:54.333
We also heard that
our current suite of programs,

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:57.791
with strictly defined
disciplines and genres,

00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:01.000
is limiting for
an increasing number of artists

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.250
who work across disciplines.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.666
In the 21st century,
with cultural lines of all kinds

00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:10.333
blurring in profound ways,
and with a wide range

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:15.333
of new practices emerging,
practices that no longer fit

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:18.375
into traditional
disciplinary categories.

00:04:18.375 --> 00:04:22.833
We believe a non-disciplinary
approach to granting,

00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:26.916
an approach based on artistic
interventions, processes

00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:30.500
and impacts
rather than disciplines,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.958
will deliver the greatest
benefits to artists,

00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958
arts organizations
and audiences.

00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:40.458
Therefore,
before the end of 2017

00:04:40.458 --> 00:04:43.125
the Canada Council
will be reducing the number

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:49.166
of granting programs it offers
from 147 to 6 national,

00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:52.125
non-disciplinary
programs that include

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.791
all fields
of artistic practice.

00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:58.000
Like most Canadians we
also understand that this is

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.083
a pivotal moment in the long
and troubled history between

00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:06.000
Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal
peoples in Canada.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.875
The Canada Council is proud
to have helped to nurture

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:13.416
a generation of Aboriginal
artists whose talent, and

00:05:13.416 --> 00:05:18.416
whose national and global impact
is remarkable and undeniable.

00:05:18.416 --> 00:05:21.958
Now we are ready to break
new ground, by establishing

00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.875
an ambitious and culturally
self-determined program

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:31.250
dedicated to creating, knowing
and sharing Aboriginal arts.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.166
We also need to have our artists
represented in global networks,

00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:38.791
collaborations and exchanges.

00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:43.083
These can only enrich their
practices and perspectives here

00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:48.291
at home, and ensure Canada is
even more recognized worldwide

00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:53.291
for its creativity, excellence,
diversity and innovation.

00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:55.958
The new programs
are the first step

00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.583
in a positive transformation
to scale up the impact

00:05:59.583 --> 00:06:03.000
of all our actions
and interventions.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.833
I assure you that everyone
who is currently eligible

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:11.625
for our programs will also be
eligible for the new programs,

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:15.041
and that the funding
envelopes currently dedicated

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:19.083
for each discipline
or priority, such as equity,

00:06:19.083 --> 00:06:21.833
will be the baseline
for the new funding model.

00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:25.000
The transition between the
many current disciplinary-based

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.375
programs and the new simplified
model will be carefully planned.

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:33.916
It will be done smoothly,
respecting funding commitments

00:06:33.916 --> 00:06:37.541
in place and the many needs
of the artists and organizations

00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:40.833
that are currently clients,
and in a way that welcomes

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:43.416
the aspirations
of a new generation,

00:06:43.416 --> 00:06:46.166
and hopefully
for the next 10 years.

00:06:46.166 --> 00:06:49.916
The new funding model
will give us greater flexibility

00:06:49.916 --> 00:06:53.958
and agility over time to
carry out strategic priorities

00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.041
as they emerge,
and to measure and report

00:06:57.041 --> 00:07:00.250
on the impact and
results of our interventions.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.000
And ultimately
to respond to the needs

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.333
of a new generation of artists
exploring today's approaches

00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:09.625
and organizational models.

00:07:09.625 --> 00:07:13.833
We look forward to sharing more
information with you this fall,

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:16.833
and to continuing
the work we do every day

00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:19.958
with the arts community,
finding more ways

00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:24.250
to develop the appreciation,
the value, the access

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.541
and the participation
in the arts in Canadian society.

00:07:27.541 --> 00:07:28.958
Thank you.
