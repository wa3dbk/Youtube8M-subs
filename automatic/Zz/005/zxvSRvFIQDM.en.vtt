just<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.420> actual<00:00:19.050> beat<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.590> when<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> beat<00:00:20.039> does

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
just a actual beat so when the beat does

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.359 
just a actual beat so when the beat does
kick<00:00:20.609> back<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:21.060> heavy<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.720> gonna<00:00:22.170> slam<00:00:22.590> so

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369

because I've done it so many times and I
I<00:00:38.840> mean<00:00:39.840> when<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.500> play<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.800> studio<00:00:41.219> you

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
I mean when you play in the studio you

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.740 
I mean when you play in the studio you
do<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> studio<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:42.090> when<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.329> play<00:00:42.510> live

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
do in the studio but when you play live

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.810 
do in the studio but when you play live
you<00:00:42.930> go<00:00:43.020> maybe<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.500> should<00:00:43.680> try<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.579> it

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
you go maybe I should try this but it

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.910 
you go maybe I should try this but it
was<00:00:45.000> too<00:00:45.180> late<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.600> do<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> studio<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.890> you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
was too late to do in the studio so you

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.430 
was too late to do in the studio so you
kind<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> idea<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.600> I'm<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.379> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
