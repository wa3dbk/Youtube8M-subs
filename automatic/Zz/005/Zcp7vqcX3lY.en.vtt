00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.449 
then you leave it on for half an hour to
45<00:03:17.920> minutes<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:18.579> then<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:20.220> emulsify<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.280> so

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
45 minutes and then you emulsify it so

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.770 
45 minutes and then you emulsify it so
you<00:03:21.549> put<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.790> little<00:03:21.970> bit<00:03:22.090> of<00:03:22.239> water<00:03:22.420> in<00:03:22.660> your

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
you put a little bit of water in your

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.800 
you put a little bit of water in your
hair<00:03:23.019> lather<00:03:23.440> it<00:03:23.860> up<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.820> then<00:03:25.329> rinse<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:25.720> out

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
hair lather it up and then rinse it out

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.539 
hair lather it up and then rinse it out
really<00:03:26.079> well<00:03:26.350> it<00:03:26.560> takes<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:26.829> long<00:03:27.040> time<00:03:27.070> to

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
really well it takes a long time to

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.090 
really well it takes a long time to
rinse<00:03:27.820> I<00:03:28.120> think<00:03:28.840> it's<00:03:28.989> more<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:29.320> a<00:03:29.500> hair<00:03:29.680> stain

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
rinse I think it's more of a hair stain

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.120 
rinse I think it's more of a hair stain
than<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.400> hair<00:03:30.730> dye<00:03:31.049> because<00:03:32.049> it<00:03:32.320> tends<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.739> stay

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
than a hair dye because it tends to stay

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.090 
than a hair dye because it tends to stay
more<00:03:33.730> than<00:03:33.790> dye<00:03:34.180> things<00:03:34.510> um<00:03:34.750> which<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:35.920> not<00:03:36.070> a

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
more than dye things um which is not a

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.789 
more than dye things um which is not a
bad<00:03:36.370> thing<00:03:36.820> because<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.780> really<00:03:38.350> like<00:03:38.560> the

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
bad thing because I really like the

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.890 
bad thing because I really like the
color<00:03:39.489> that<00:03:39.579> it<00:03:39.880> gives<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.329> stuff<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:40.750> like

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
color that it gives and stuff and I like

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.740 
color that it gives and stuff and I like
that<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.200> doesn't<00:03:41.350> fade<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:43.180> after<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.600> do

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
that it doesn't fade and after you do

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.479

great things that people have said about
them<00:05:08.960> so<00:05:09.380> maybe<00:05:09.590> it<00:05:09.770> was<00:05:09.919> just<00:05:09.950> because<00:05:10.400> my

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
them so maybe it was just because my

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.640 
them so maybe it was just because my
hair<00:05:10.730> is<00:05:10.760> processed<00:05:11.360> I<00:05:11.510> do<00:05:11.570> have<00:05:11.960> a<00:05:11.990> perm<00:05:12.350> in<00:05:12.530> my
