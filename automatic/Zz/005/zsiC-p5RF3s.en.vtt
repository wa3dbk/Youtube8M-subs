outside<00:00:20.000> inside<00:00:24.470> all<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.740> time<00:00:54.559> outside

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:59.030 

inside<00:01:09.439> if<00:01:36.140> this<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.350> my<00:01:37.530> house<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.530> I'm<00:01:58.770> going

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
inside if this is my house so I'm going

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:09.059 
inside if this is my house so I'm going
at<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> beginning

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:20.569 

so<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:09.969> have<00:02:10.179> no<00:02:10.620> wash<00:02:11.620> in<00:02:12.099> a<00:02:12.250> half<00:02:12.659> if<00:02:13.659> I<00:02:13.870> do<00:02:13.930> this

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:30.500 

now<00:02:26.819> if<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:28.030> go<00:02:28.180> back<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:28.750> beginning<00:02:29.250> and

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
now if I go back to the beginning and

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.229 
now if I go back to the beginning and
now<00:02:31.560> I'll<00:02:32.560> use<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:33.099> redstone<00:02:33.459> torch<00:02:33.700> in<00:02:34.090> hand

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
now I'll use a redstone torch in hand

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:41.879 
now I'll use a redstone torch in hand
this<00:02:34.959> is<00:02:35.109> what<00:02:35.319> it's<00:02:35.799> going<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.069> look<00:02:36.189> like<00:02:40.889> so

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:41.889 
this is what it's going to look like so

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:47.280 
this is what it's going to look like so
I<00:02:41.920> have<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.129> redstone<00:02:42.489> torch<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:43.030> hand

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.940 

so<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:48.099> am<00:02:48.220> unloaded<00:02:48.790> from<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.299> minecart<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.110> I

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
so I am unloaded from the minecart and I

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.490 
so I am unloaded from the minecart and I
minecart<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.519> going<00:02:51.790> into<00:02:51.939> a<00:02:52.090> storage<00:02:52.500> area

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
minecart is going into a storage area

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.679 
minecart is going into a storage area
and<00:02:53.739> this<00:02:54.579> map<00:02:54.760> shows<00:02:54.970> me<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.269> there<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.599> a

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:55.689 
and this map shows me that there is a

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.899 
and this map shows me that there is a
minecart<00:02:56.049> waiting<00:02:56.409> for<00:02:56.590> me<00:02:56.680> so<00:02:57.430> I'm<00:02:57.519> going<00:02:57.730> to

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
minecart waiting for me so I'm going to

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:06.930 
minecart waiting for me so I'm going to
my<00:02:58.060> house<00:03:03.060> when<00:03:04.060> I'm<00:03:04.180> finished<00:03:04.569> I<00:03:05.730> call<00:03:06.730> back

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
my house when I'm finished I call back

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:18.020 
my house when I'm finished I call back
my<00:03:07.120> minecart<00:03:07.569> and<00:03:09.060> jump<00:03:10.060> inside

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.039 

so<00:03:19.030> how<00:03:19.510> does<00:03:19.569> it<00:03:19.840> work<00:03:20.049> well<00:03:21.330> in<00:03:22.330> fact<00:03:22.659> I

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
so how does it work well in fact I

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:34.850 
so how does it work well in fact I
cheated<00:03:23.890> I'm<00:03:24.220> going<00:03:24.519> to<00:03:24.640> show<00:03:24.819> you

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.980 

in<00:03:35.820> fact<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.360> was<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.630> detector<00:03:37.200> rail<00:03:37.580> and

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
in fact this was the detector rail and

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.310 
in fact this was the detector rail and
behind<00:03:39.990> we<00:03:40.440> have<00:03:40.590> an<00:03:40.800> and<00:03:41.070> gate<00:03:42.170> working<00:03:43.170> with

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
behind we have an and gate working with

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.800 
behind we have an and gate working with
the<00:03:43.440> switch<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.970> underneath<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.360> just<00:03:45.630> a

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
the switch and underneath is just a

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.930 
the switch and underneath is just a
current<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.620> could<00:03:46.860> be<00:03:47.010> another<00:03:47.220> feature<00:03:47.550> very

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
current it could be another feature very

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:56.450 
current it could be another feature very
interesting<00:03:53.690> this<00:03:54.690> is<00:03:54.930> activity<00:03:55.740> so<00:03:56.220> this

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
interesting this is activity so this

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.080 
interesting this is activity so this
works<00:03:56.790> if<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.420> ever<00:03:57.570> stone<00:03:58.110> touching<00:03:58.470> him<00:03:58.650> and

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
works if I ever stone touching him and

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.880 
works if I ever stone touching him and
this<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.150> deactivated<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:01.410> if<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:01.680> do<00:04:01.740> something

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
this is deactivated so if I do something

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:12.410 
this is deactivated so if I do something
now<00:04:02.630> nothing<00:04:03.630> would<00:04:03.780> happen<00:04:07.910> even<00:04:08.910> if<00:04:11.420> this

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
now nothing would happen even if this

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.220 
now nothing would happen even if this
was<00:04:12.630> just<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.959> purpose<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.560> demonstration

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
was just a purpose of the demonstration

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.900 
was just a purpose of the demonstration
inside<00:04:16.230> this<00:04:16.470> area<00:04:17.459> there<00:04:17.730> is<00:04:18.380> an<00:04:19.380> or<00:04:19.680> gate

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
inside this area there is an or gate

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.390 
inside this area there is an or gate
memory<00:04:21.019> which<00:04:22.019> stores<00:04:22.380> windows<00:04:22.860> in<00:04:22.980> my<00:04:23.100> cart

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
memory which stores windows in my cart

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.660 
memory which stores windows in my cart
is<00:04:23.690> inside<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.870> box<00:04:25.470> this<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.250> could<00:04:26.550> be

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
is inside the box this is could be

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.210 
is inside the box this is could be
interesting<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.270> store<00:04:27.870> mine<00:04:28.110> cuts<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.680> the

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
interesting to store mine cuts and the

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.520 
interesting to store mine cuts and the
shows<00:04:29.490> player<00:04:29.880> when<00:04:30.630> it<00:04:30.750> is<00:04:30.900> available<00:04:31.320> and

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
shows player when it is available and

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.980 
shows player when it is available and
using<00:04:31.890> an<00:04:32.010> unloading<00:04:32.430> for<00:04:32.820> example<00:04:33.210> saying

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
using an unloading for example saying

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.490 
using an unloading for example saying
that<00:04:34.230> for<00:04:34.560> example<00:04:34.800> I<00:04:35.100> want<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.520> stop<00:04:35.760> here<00:04:36.060> and

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
that for example I want to stop here and

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:54.830 
that for example I want to stop here and
then<00:04:39.020> I<00:04:47.510> have<00:04:51.770> this<00:04:52.770> is<00:04:52.830> a<00:04:53.070> subjection<00:04:53.520> so<00:04:54.000> you

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
then I have this is a subjection so you

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.400 
then I have this is a subjection so you
can't<00:04:55.110> elude<00:04:55.470> my<00:04:55.950> rated<00:04:56.310> suggestion<00:04:57.020> in<00:04:58.020> the
