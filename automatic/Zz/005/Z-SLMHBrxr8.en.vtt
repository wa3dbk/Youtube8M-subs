00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.230
 the game becomes coop and I take a good 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.110
 teacher but I think I can be a 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.089
 good luck there is a distinction the prof 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.789
 of singing already knows they will do 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.560
 work positioning his larynx 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.990
 the resonance versus what we 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.910
 calls the mask for sounds of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.519
 vowels things like that the teacher of 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.680
 singing work except me I see myself more 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.050
 like a finger that is worth listening to that 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.969
 my family will come and offer me 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.610
 will work the interpretation of that 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.590
 the positioning of the movements of 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.440
 intentions it's more in that sense 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.300
 that I show you honestly I have 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.070
 not the taste of how it plays obadia and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.480
 with them they are not there for any 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.820
 way necessarily make a career 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.500
 they are here to live an experience in 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.360
 same time have to do a little bit 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.940
 be careful to be too complacent no 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.649
 more because many told us 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.469
 well if it's not correct and we 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:04.920
 so we see we're going to find the right one 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:08.250
 and beautiful feint and it has been the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.560
 para una to improve it's true 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.070
 is like an hour after the war 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.119
 I did not want to interest you 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.680
 that's it that's it's the big 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.189
 family just mothers 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.280
 and you parceled you join the family 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.350
 like in competition no one feels it for 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.640
 a healthy competition in the sense of me 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.439
 I do not want to gag give you give it 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.000
 maximum to our families but what is 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.979
 the fun is that in the semi-finals the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.170
 final the bruno family putting his 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.280
 Serbian gang family in semifinal 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:51.680

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:56.210
 what good guys not all along good 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.210

 singing I find port if I opened them 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.099
 people would not change on which one 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:29.250
 begins then I join them in 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:33.299

 jane is here is that it is under 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.209
 bonnets March at the beginning we had 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.389
 many hopes but it's going to be a 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.989
 good show it's comforting stopped the 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.170
 job 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.430
 friendly not the ear their role 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.150
 not but that's not what this 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:13.880
 change chan waouh 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.880
 so my guide and continue to live 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.370
 bruno is coach bruno coach 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.360
 it is the coach of jean françois 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.000
 dartigues brenon it was my first 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.430
 coach game in our lady of paris 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.470
 I was little ass I came in this 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.180
 wonderful world of song and bruno 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.040
 furrier I watched them I got them 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.800
 followed in the pot and the eye during 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:47.230
 some games it's grinning be 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:49.060
 realistic it has been very very long 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.980
 thrown a greedy little job no I the 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.780
 watching with a trainee already good 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.320
 kind of coach must be quickly a 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.730
 very attentive coach putting 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.450
 today to compare to bruno he 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.400
 is not at all very attentive 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.170
 yes especially listening to families who 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.760
 are there because we have several families 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.530
 in fact several meetings 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.170
 I think each of the families at the 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.400
 strengths of the weaknesses try to go 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.720
 work on the weaknesses then 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.269
 try to undo the knots but 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.620
 especially to reclaim what 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.290
 are because they were chosen from 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.370
 200 a few families and they are there 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.380
 because he feels they have some 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.240
 thing it is and this few young people have 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:31.110
 you understand something that we do 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.110
 it's all facts and its players 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:42.310
 lighthouses and alas the most competitive 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:44.470
 strait definitely regains offside 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.510
 art is more than I wanted not there 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.730
 to go but there is a beautiful 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.490
 for the sepa not know for show 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.400
 TV the scrum turns really fun and that 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.740
 give that gives a special Ben spice 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.110
 avenue work the family spirit in 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.820
 sum it is true that we play on the words 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:06.810
 but it's true we meet 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.810
 really seemed like a spirit we know each other 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.970
 thank you thank you
