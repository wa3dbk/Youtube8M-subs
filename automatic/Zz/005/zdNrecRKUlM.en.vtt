starting with a building a tablet an

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.840 
starting with a building a tablet an
interesting<00:02:53.650> decision<00:02:53.890> I<00:02:54.100> guess<00:02:54.130> on<00:02:54.400> one<00:02:54.610> hand

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.490 
interesting decision I guess on one hand
it's<00:02:54.940> less<00:02:55.120> mission-critical<00:02:55.720> so<00:02:56.200> people<00:02:56.410> are

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
it's less mission-critical so people are

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.230 
it's less mission-critical so people are

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.810 
are the Nexus 6 or the note 4 if
anything<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:40.990> think<00:03:41.380> we'll<00:03:41.650> see<00:03:41.830> the<00:03:41.950> iPad<00:03:42.370> and

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
anything I think we'll see the iPad and

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.250 
anything I think we'll see the iPad and
it's<00:03:42.940> all<00:03:43.090> kind<00:03:43.360> of<00:03:43.420> getting<00:03:43.780> bigger<00:03:43.959> moving

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
it's all kind of getting bigger moving

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.780 
it's all kind of getting bigger moving
up<00:03:44.320> to<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.470> 12<00:03:44.680> inch<00:03:44.830> to<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:44.950> 14<00:03:45.310> inch<00:03:45.490> size

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
up to the 12 inch to the 14 inch size

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.030 
up to the 12 inch to the 14 inch size
you<00:03:46.209> know<00:03:46.300> just<00:03:46.570> to<00:03:46.720> maintain<00:03:47.020> some<00:03:47.530> sort<00:03:47.709> of<00:03:47.890> a

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
you know just to maintain some sort of a

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.800 
you know just to maintain some sort of a
some<00:03:48.640> sort<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:48.850> a<00:03:48.910> niche<00:03:49.000> ultimately<00:03:49.540> that's

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
some sort of a niche ultimately that's

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.390 
some sort of a niche ultimately that's
so<00:03:49.870> going<00:03:49.990> to<00:03:50.050> be<00:03:50.140> a<00:03:50.170> smaller<00:03:50.650> niche<00:03:51.010> I<00:03:51.220> think

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
so going to be a smaller niche I think

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.710 
so going to be a smaller niche I think
the<00:03:51.459> tablet<00:03:51.760> sales<00:03:51.910> are<00:03:52.090> gonna<00:03:52.300> continue<00:03:52.510> to

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
the tablet sales are gonna continue to

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.660 
the tablet sales are gonna continue to
decline<00:03:53.080> but<00:03:53.920> ultimately<00:03:54.280> if<00:03:54.400> you've<00:03:54.520> got<00:03:54.640> a

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
decline but ultimately if you've got a

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.860 
decline but ultimately if you've got a
six<00:03:54.880> inch<00:03:55.030> phone<00:03:55.180> in<00:03:55.240> your<00:03:55.300> pocket<00:03:55.420> why<00:03:55.720> do<00:03:55.780> you

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
six inch phone in your pocket why do you

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.690 
six inch phone in your pocket why do you
need<00:03:55.990> an<00:03:56.080> 8<00:03:56.170> inch<00:03:56.320> tablet<00:03:56.860> in<00:03:57.160> your<00:03:57.190> hand<00:03:57.459> you'd

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
need an 8 inch tablet in your hand you'd

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.070 
need an 8 inch tablet in your hand you'd
want<00:03:57.910> something<00:03:58.090> significantly<00:03:58.720> different

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
want something significantly different

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.330 
want something significantly different
and<00:03:59.260> that<00:03:59.620> would<00:03:59.709> be<00:03:59.770> the<00:03:59.860> one<00:03:59.950> reason<00:04:00.100> to<00:04:00.250> have

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
and that would be the one reason to have

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.020 
and that would be the one reason to have
a<00:04:00.370> tablet<00:04:00.610> everything

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
a tablet everything

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.150 
a tablet everything
well<00:04:01.660> I<00:04:01.690> gotta<00:04:01.930> say<00:04:01.990> they've<00:04:02.650> raised<00:04:02.950> a

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
well I gotta say they've raised a

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.070 
well I gotta say they've raised a
million<00:04:03.400> plus<00:04:03.940> dollars<00:04:04.000> I<00:04:04.630> mean<00:04:04.750> somebody

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
million plus dollars I mean somebody

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.220 
million plus dollars I mean somebody
wants<00:04:05.380> it<00:04:05.880> so<00:04:06.880> I<00:04:06.910> mean<00:04:07.330> my<00:04:07.690> point<00:04:08.050> of<00:04:08.140> doing

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
wants it so I mean my point of doing

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.600 
wants it so I mean my point of doing
this<00:04:08.410> is<00:04:08.470> that<00:04:08.740> is<00:04:08.980> that<00:04:09.130> these<00:04:09.280> things<00:04:09.430> are

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
this is that is that these things are

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.699 
this is that is that these things are
actually<00:04:09.880> converging<00:04:10.420> it's<00:04:10.600> not<00:04:10.780> that<00:04:11.020> you

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
actually converging it's not that you

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.610 
actually converging it's not that you
know<00:04:11.800> the<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:13.030> phone<00:04:13.600> tablet<00:04:14.050> dichotomy

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
know the the the phone tablet dichotomy

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.710 
know the the the phone tablet dichotomy
was<00:04:14.770> basically<00:04:15.280> a<00:04:15.640> design<00:04:16.239> decision<00:04:16.690> that

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
was basically a design decision that

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.479 
was basically a design decision that
Apple<00:04:17.080> made<00:04:17.230> a<00:04:17.260> few<00:04:17.500> years<00:04:17.680> ago<00:04:17.799> based<00:04:18.250> on<00:04:18.400> the

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
Apple made a few years ago based on the

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.469 
Apple made a few years ago based on the
technology<00:04:18.730> at<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.060> time<00:04:19.410> and<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:22.120> sort<00:04:22.419> of

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
technology at the time and that sort of

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:23.640 
technology at the time and that sort of
got<00:04:22.660> baked<00:04:22.900> into<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.140> way<00:04:23.260> people<00:04:23.290> thought

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
got baked into the way people thought

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.260 
got baked into the way people thought
about<00:04:23.860> these<00:04:24.040> things<00:04:24.370> as<00:04:24.640> separate<00:04:25.090> entities

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
about these things as separate entities

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.240 
about these things as separate entities
whereas<00:04:26.080> now<00:04:26.260> there's<00:04:26.530> there's<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:26.800> continued

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
whereas now there's there's a continued

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.540 
whereas now there's there's a continued
you<00:04:27.520> can<00:04:27.700> you<00:04:27.970> know<00:04:28.030> Samsung<00:04:28.450> has<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:29.430> thing<00:04:30.430> at

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
you can you know Samsung has a thing at

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.730 
you can you know Samsung has a thing at
every<00:04:30.820> measurement<00:04:31.660> between<00:04:32.170> three<00:04:32.470> inches

every measurement between three inches

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.660 
every measurement between three inches
and<00:04:33.190> 12<00:04:33.570> and<00:04:34.650> people<00:04:35.650> can<00:04:35.770> pick<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.340> ones<00:04:36.490> out

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
and 12 and people can pick the ones out

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.490 
and 12 and people can pick the ones out
they<00:04:36.850> want<00:04:37.000> to<00:04:37.090> use<00:04:37.300> and<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.780> software<00:04:38.110> is<00:04:38.290> net

they want to use and the software is net

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.040 
they want to use and the software is net
has<00:04:39.010> is<00:04:39.280> moving<00:04:39.970> now<00:04:40.300> Apple<00:04:40.510> has<00:04:40.600> finally

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
has is moving now Apple has finally

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.200 
has is moving now Apple has finally
shipped<00:04:41.260> something<00:04:41.440> big<00:04:41.860> bigger<00:04:42.160> phones<00:04:42.460> from

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
shipped something big bigger phones from

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.230 
shipped something big bigger phones from
that<00:04:43.510> dichotomy<00:04:43.900> to<00:04:44.410> this<00:04:44.670> continuous<00:04:45.670> in<00:04:46.150> a

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
that dichotomy to this continuous in a

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.690 
that dichotomy to this continuous in a
responsive<00:04:46.720> design<00:04:46.750> model<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:47.560> I<00:04:48.010> think<00:04:48.220> is

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
responsive design model and I think is

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.770 
responsive design model and I think is
this<00:04:48.820> question<00:04:49.000> of<00:04:49.150> picking<00:04:49.300> which<00:04:49.570> which

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
this question of picking which which

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.060 
this question of picking which which
size<00:04:49.990> thing<00:04:50.260> you<00:04:50.350> want<00:04:50.500> to<00:04:50.590> be<00:04:50.650> using<00:04:50.800> at<00:04:50.980> the

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
size thing you want to be using at the

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.250 
size thing you want to be using at the
moment<00:04:51.340> that's<00:04:51.940> fair<00:04:52.300> I<00:04:52.510> think<00:04:52.690> that<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:53.050> only

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
moment that's fair I think that the only

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.590 
moment that's fair I think that the only
argument<00:04:53.530> I<00:04:53.860> make<00:04:54.120> contrary<00:04:55.120> to<00:04:55.270> that<00:04:55.420> is<00:04:55.570> just

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
argument I make contrary to that is just

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.270 
argument I make contrary to that is just
that<00:04:55.990> there<00:04:56.410> is<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:56.620> very<00:04:56.920> different

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
that there is a very different

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.920 
that there is a very different
relationship<00:04:57.430> you<00:04:58.000> have<00:04:58.180> with<00:04:58.210> your<00:04:58.600> phone

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
relationship you have with your phone

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.080 
relationship you have with your phone
versus<00:04:59.680> a<00:04:59.800> tablet<00:05:00.040> which<00:05:00.400> might<00:05:00.580> be<00:05:00.700> shared<00:05:00.940> in

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
our phone with passion this is what

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.560 
our phone with passion this is what
people<00:05:53.290> want<00:05:53.620> this<00:05:53.979> is<00:05:54.160> there's<00:05:54.640> the<00:05:54.790> most<00:05:55.000> the

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
people want this is there's the most the

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.380 
people want this is there's the most the
most<00:05:55.780> intimate<00:05:56.140> technology<00:05:56.770> in<00:05:56.919> history<00:05:57.390> but

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
most intimate technology in history but

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.340 
most intimate technology in history but
I<00:05:58.419> think<00:05:58.570> the<00:05:58.660> other<00:05:58.690> thing<00:05:58.930> is<00:05:59.050> that<00:05:59.229> that

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
I think the other thing is that that

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.400 
I think the other thing is that that
we're<00:05:59.500> starting<00:05:59.680> to<00:05:59.830> get<00:06:00.100> them<00:06:00.960> the<00:06:01.960> notion

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
we're starting to get them the notion

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.590 
we're starting to get them the notion
that<00:06:02.580> you<00:06:03.580> can<00:06:03.610> move<00:06:03.880> the<00:06:04.000> stuff<00:06:04.210> between<00:06:04.390> the

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
that you can move the stuff between the

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.600 
that you can move the stuff between the
screens<00:06:05.020> is<00:06:05.380> becoming<00:06:05.860> much<00:06:06.010> more<00:06:06.220> obvious

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
screens is becoming much more obvious

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.190 
screens is becoming much more obvious
and<00:06:06.790> smoother<00:06:07.150> and<00:06:07.330> we've<00:06:07.450> had<00:06:07.600> we<00:06:07.750> had<00:06:07.900> bits

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
and smoother and we've had we had bits

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.340 
and smoother and we've had we had bits
of<00:06:08.380> that<00:06:08.530> with<00:06:08.850> Apple<00:06:09.850> TV<00:06:10.000> and<00:06:10.600> Chrome<00:06:10.990> and

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
of that with Apple TV and Chrome and

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.860 
of that with Apple TV and Chrome and
it's<00:06:11.590> it's<00:06:11.800> very<00:06:11.890> obvious<00:06:12.310> but<00:06:12.690> what<00:06:13.690> you're

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
it's it's very obvious but what you're

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.810 
it's it's very obvious but what you're
saying<00:06:14.110> about<00:06:14.229> the<00:06:14.500> car<00:06:15.220> stuff<00:06:15.520> where<00:06:15.729> it's

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
saying about the car stuff where it's

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.610 
saying about the car stuff where it's
like<00:06:15.940> okay<00:06:16.300> the<00:06:16.479> car<00:06:16.690> just<00:06:16.960> becomes<00:06:17.229> a<00:06:17.380> screen

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
like okay the car just becomes a screen

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.520 
like okay the car just becomes a screen
for<00:06:17.800> your<00:06:17.860> phone<00:06:18.600> so<00:06:19.600> there<00:06:20.050> is<00:06:20.169> this<00:06:20.320> sense

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
for your phone so there is this sense

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.990 
for your phone so there is this sense
that<00:06:20.800> you've<00:06:21.130> got<00:06:21.340> you<00:06:21.550> may<00:06:21.700> have<00:06:21.880> been

that you've got you may have been
carrying<00:06:22.270> this<00:06:22.419> thing<00:06:22.479> but<00:06:23.080> it<00:06:23.229> can<00:06:23.320> take

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
carrying this thing but it can take

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.840 
carrying this thing but it can take
advantage<00:06:23.890> of<00:06:23.950> the<00:06:24.070> screens<00:06:24.370> that<00:06:24.460> are<00:06:24.580> around

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
advantage of the screens that are around

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.040 
advantage of the screens that are around
you<00:06:25.000> or<00:06:25.060> the<00:06:25.150> or<00:06:25.300> the<00:06:25.330> other<00:06:25.479> places<00:06:25.720> that<00:06:25.900> are

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
there and the that's an obvious thing

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
listen in groups at concerts over then

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.650 
listen in groups at concerts over then
we<00:06:47.650> would<00:06:47.770> have<00:06:47.860> our<00:06:48.040> stereo<00:06:48.520> it's<00:06:49.330> got<00:06:49.450> more

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
we would have our stereo it's got more

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.180 
we would have our stereo it's got more
and<00:06:49.780> more<00:06:49.840> intimate<00:06:50.290> the<00:06:50.530> phone<00:06:50.710> is<00:06:50.889> very<00:06:51.010> much

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
and more intimate the phone is very much

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.190 
and more intimate the phone is very much
like<00:06:51.340> the<00:06:51.490> iPod<00:06:51.820> where<00:06:52.060> the<00:06:52.150> music<00:06:52.600> now<00:06:52.780> is<00:06:53.020> a

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.200 
like the iPod where the music now is a

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.000 
like the iPod where the music now is a
very<00:06:53.710> personal<00:06:54.220> connection<00:06:54.370> one<00:06:54.910> on<00:06:55.060> one

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
very personal connection one on one

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.740 
very personal connection one on one
despite<00:06:57.010> the<00:06:57.160> Microsoft<00:06:57.820> squirt<00:06:58.210> ads<00:06:58.480> where

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
despite the Microsoft squirt ads where

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.620 
despite the Microsoft squirt ads where
people<00:06:59.020> were<00:06:59.080> sharing<00:06:59.380> their<00:06:59.560> head<00:06:59.800> earbuds<00:07:00.790> I

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
people were sharing their head earbuds I

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.540 
people were sharing their head earbuds I
think<00:07:02.110> really<00:07:02.260> people<00:07:02.470> pretty<00:07:02.740> much<00:07:02.830> their

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550 
think really people pretty much their

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.360 
think really people pretty much their
music<00:07:03.910> they<00:07:04.030> consumed<00:07:04.389> a<00:07:04.630> solo<00:07:05.200> in<00:07:05.560> a<00:07:06.040> solitary

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
music they consumed a solo in a solitary

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.310 
music they consumed a solo in a solitary
way<00:07:06.639> and<00:07:06.790> I<00:07:06.850> think<00:07:07.300> computing<00:07:07.870> is<00:07:07.960> rapidly

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 
way and I think computing is rapidly

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.590 
way and I think computing is rapidly
moving<00:07:08.410> that<00:07:08.740> direction<00:07:08.860> I<00:07:09.340> think<00:07:10.300> that's

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:10.600 
moving that direction I think that's

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.530 
moving that direction I think that's
this<00:07:10.810> back<00:07:11.020> and<00:07:11.139> forth<00:07:11.200> I<00:07:11.500> think<00:07:11.880> it<00:07:12.880> was<00:07:13.510> a

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:13.540 
this back and forth I think it was a

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.650 
this back and forth I think it was a
solitary<00:07:14.020> thing<00:07:14.200> but<00:07:15.130> the<00:07:15.280> ability<00:07:15.430> to<00:07:15.669> cast

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:16.660 
solitary thing but the ability to cast

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.390 
solitary thing but the ability to cast
it<00:07:16.900> to<00:07:17.020> the<00:07:17.110> room<00:07:17.290> is<00:07:17.470> is<00:07:17.650> useful<00:07:18.070> to<00:07:18.220> the

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
it to the room is is useful to the

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.650 
it to the room is is useful to the
people<00:07:18.639> they<00:07:18.880> sell<00:07:19.060> a<00:07:19.090> lot<00:07:19.270> of<00:07:19.389> these<00:07:19.479> large

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:19.660 
people they sell a lot of these large

bit of headphones that's mostly because

bit of headphones that's mostly because
I<00:07:24.160> can't<00:07:24.520> hold<00:07:24.669> my<00:07:24.880> phone<00:07:25.120> my<00:07:25.810> precious<00:07:26.320> I<00:07:26.590> have

I can't hold my phone my precious I have

to put it down while I wash the dishes

to put it down while I wash the dishes
there's<00:07:30.400> no<00:07:30.580> question<00:07:31.000> we'll<00:07:31.300> be<00:07:31.450> flicking

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.050 
there's no question we'll be flicking

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.260 
there's no question we'll be flicking
you<00:07:32.800> know<00:07:32.950> different<00:07:33.669> types<00:07:33.700> of<00:07:33.940> media<00:07:34.210> and

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:34.270 
you know different types of media and

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.879 
you know different types of media and
projecting<00:07:35.139> things<00:07:35.260> and<00:07:35.500> using<00:07:35.740> all<00:07:35.800> the

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:35.889 
projecting things and using all the

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:37.290 
projecting things and using all the
screens<00:07:36.130> around<00:07:36.400> that<00:07:36.520> it's<00:07:36.669> like<00:07:36.880> frankly<00:07:37.270> I

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.300 
screens around that it's like frankly I

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.280 
screens around that it's like frankly I
don't<00:07:37.419> think<00:07:37.600> it's<00:07:37.780> a<00:07:37.840> very<00:07:38.020> interesting

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:38.290 
don't think it's a very interesting

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.250 
don't think it's a very interesting
business<00:07:38.650> to<00:07:38.919> be<00:07:39.040> a<00:07:39.070> screen<00:07:39.370> manufacturer<00:07:40.260> and

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:41.260 
business to be a screen manufacturer and

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.350 
business to be a screen manufacturer and
so<00:07:41.889> the<00:07:42.190> question<00:07:42.490> is<00:07:42.550> like<00:07:42.700> where's<00:07:42.910> the<00:07:43.090> the

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 
so the question is like where's the the

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.330 
so the question is like where's the the
nexus<00:07:43.780> of<00:07:43.930> software<00:07:44.530> and<00:07:44.650> information<00:07:44.890> and

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:45.340 
nexus of software and information and

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.520 
nexus of software and information and
communication<00:07:45.400> and<00:07:46.240> you<00:07:46.750> know<00:07:46.870> I'm<00:07:47.260> sure

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:47.530 
communication and you know I'm sure

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.140 
communication and you know I'm sure
there'll<00:07:47.710> be<00:07:47.740> things<00:07:48.039> that<00:07:48.130> look<00:07:48.340> the<00:07:48.640> size<00:07:48.910> of

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:49.150 
there'll be things that look the size of

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.969 
there'll be things that look the size of
tablets<00:07:49.600> or<00:07:49.750> bigger<00:07:50.050> tablets<00:07:50.590> that<00:07:50.710> I'll<00:07:50.860> be

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:50.979 
tablets or bigger tablets that I'll be

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:53.219 
tablets or bigger tablets that I'll be

you know pushing data to but I just I

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:54.810 
you know pushing data to but I just I
don't<00:07:53.590> think<00:07:53.710> the<00:07:53.770> companies<00:07:54.130> I<00:07:54.400> think<00:07:54.700> it's

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:54.820 
don't think the companies I think it's

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.400 
don't think the companies I think it's
an<00:07:54.880> interesting<00:07:55.120> decision<00:07:55.750> for<00:07:55.990> a<00:07:56.020> company<00:07:56.380> to

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:56.410 
an interesting decision for a company to

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.580 
an interesting decision for a company to
focus<00:07:56.890> on<00:07:57.039> those<00:07:57.250> right<00:07:57.550> now
