gave<00:01:35.970> us<00:01:36.149> I<00:01:36.390> thought<00:01:39.259> if<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.560> works<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.130> our

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
gave us I thought if this works like our

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.580 
gave us I thought if this works like our
thermometers<00:01:41.880> back<00:01:42.090> home<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.899> red<00:01:43.259> bar

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
thermometers back home this red bar

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.940 
thermometers back home this red bar
moves<00:01:43.979> up<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.520> down<00:01:44.689> lower<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.960> cooler<00:01:46.259> higher

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
moves up and down lower is cooler higher

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.940 
moves up and down lower is cooler higher
is<00:01:47.220> hotter<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.970> these<00:01:48.600> numbers<00:01:49.229> tell<00:01:49.619> us<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
is hotter and these numbers tell us the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.880 
is hotter and these numbers tell us the
actual<00:01:50.310> temperature<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.179> cyber<00:01:51.600> degrees<00:01:52.170> so

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
actual temperature in cyber degrees so

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.480 
actual temperature in cyber degrees so
the<00:01:53.009> air<00:01:53.130> around<00:01:53.369> us<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.090> 50<00:01:54.659> cyber<00:01:54.960> degrees

the air around us is 50 cyber degrees
let's<00:01:56.490> see<00:01:56.700> what<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.939> temp<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.420> inside<00:01:57.929> the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
really cute oh yes my best invention
ever

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
ever

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.699 
ever
I<00:02:54.940> still<00:02:55.940> think<00:02:56.269> so<00:02:56.599> despite<00:02:57.260> what<00:02:57.470> everyone

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
I still think so despite what everyone

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.199 
I still think so despite what everyone
else<00:02:58.040> says<00:02:58.750> huh<00:02:59.950> what<00:03:00.950> do<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.099> mean<00:03:01.220> what<00:03:02.000> does

fool<00:03:13.299> a<00:03:14.299> cloud<00:03:14.930> oh<00:03:16.659> but<00:03:17.980> fool<00:03:19.569> I<00:03:22.209> guess<00:03:23.209> I<00:03:23.420> do

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
fool a cloud oh but fool I guess I do

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.680 
fool a cloud oh but fool I guess I do
make<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:23.989> lot<00:03:24.290> of<00:03:24.349> mistakes<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:25.370> don't<00:03:26.269> mean<00:03:26.480> to

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
make a lot of mistakes I don't mean to

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.530 
make a lot of mistakes I don't mean to
but<00:03:27.440> I<00:03:27.470> do<00:03:29.799> guys<00:03:30.819> just<00:03:31.819> because<00:03:32.120> there<00:03:32.269> isn't<00:03:32.480> a

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
but I do guys just because there isn't a

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.420 
but I do guys just because there isn't a
number<00:03:32.690> next<00:03:33.019> to<00:03:33.139> the<00:03:33.230> red<00:03:33.409> bar<00:03:33.680> doesn't<00:03:34.340> mean

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
number next to the red bar doesn't mean

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.589 
number next to the red bar doesn't mean
we<00:03:34.519> can't<00:03:34.730> figure<00:03:34.970> out<00:03:35.180> what<00:03:35.329> the<00:03:35.420> temperature

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
we can't figure out what the temperature

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.069 
we can't figure out what the temperature
is<00:03:36.019> okay<00:03:36.829> what<00:03:37.519> do<00:03:37.609> we<00:03:37.760> know<00:03:37.940> we<00:03:38.690> know<00:03:38.720> the

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
is okay what do we know we know the

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:46.000 
is okay what do we know we know the
numbers<00:03:39.409> go<00:03:39.620> 0<00:03:40.099> 10<00:03:41.290> 20<00:03:42.290> 30<00:03:43.359> Hey<00:03:44.500> they<00:03:45.500> count<00:03:45.859> up

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
numbers go 0 10 20 30 Hey they count up

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.259 
numbers go 0 10 20 30 Hey they count up
by<00:03:46.040> tens

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
by tens

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.039 
by tens
so<00:03:47.780> each<00:03:48.230> thick<00:03:48.829> line<00:03:49.160> is<00:03:49.519> 10<00:03:50.060> degrees<00:03:50.599> higher

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
so each thick line is 10 degrees higher

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.009 
so each thick line is 10 degrees higher
than<00:03:51.079> the<00:03:51.530> one<00:03:51.919> below<00:03:52.489> it<00:03:52.730> if<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.359> red<00:03:53.599> reaches

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
than the one below it if the red reaches

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.530 
than the one below it if the red reaches
above<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.440> line<00:03:54.650> marked<00:03:55.040> 40<00:03:55.489> but<00:03:55.849> stays<00:03:56.150> below

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
above the line marked 40 but stays below

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.170 
above the line marked 40 but stays below
the<00:03:57.079> line<00:03:57.290> mark<00:03:57.590> 50<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.459> temperature<00:03:58.970> has<00:03:59.150> to

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
the line mark 50 the temperature has to

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.379 
the line mark 50 the temperature has to
be<00:03:59.329> somewhere<00:03:59.780> between<00:03:59.959> 40<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:00.530> 50<00:04:00.949> hmm<00:04:01.819> maybe

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
be somewhere between 40 and 50 hmm maybe

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.740 
be somewhere between 40 and 50 hmm maybe
these<00:04:02.690> thin<00:04:03.079> lines<00:04:03.410> can<00:04:03.769> tell<00:04:03.980> us<00:04:04.160> something

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
these thin lines can tell us something

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.390 
these thin lines can tell us something
yeah<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:06.169> temperatures<00:04:06.709> three<00:04:06.980> lines<00:04:07.190> up

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
yeah the temperatures three lines up

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.869 
yeah the temperatures three lines up
from<00:04:07.609> 40<00:04:08.060> so<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.810> temperature<00:04:09.410> must<00:04:09.709> be<00:04:09.889> 43

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
from 40 so the temperature must be 43

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.020 
from 40 so the temperature must be 43
cyber<00:04:11.150> degrees<00:04:11.540> that's<00:04:12.260> still<00:04:12.739> too<00:04:13.040> hot<00:04:13.310> we

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
cyber degrees that's still too hot we

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.860 
cyber degrees that's still too hot we
needed<00:04:14.419> to<00:04:14.540> do<00:04:14.690> 37<00:04:15.470> cyber<00:04:15.769> degrees<00:04:16.310> or<00:04:16.519> below

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
needed to do 37 cyber degrees or below

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.439 
needed to do 37 cyber degrees or below
Heian<00:04:17.870> we<00:04:18.590> read<00:04:18.829> this<00:04:19.010> wrong<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.970> temperature

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
Heian we read this wrong the temperature

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.870 
Heian we read this wrong the temperature
can't<00:04:20.750> be<00:04:20.870> 43<00:04:21.530> look<00:04:22.070> at<00:04:22.190> where<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.460> top<00:04:22.669> of<00:04:22.699> the

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
can't be 43 look at where the top of the

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.240 
can't be 43 look at where the top of the
red<00:04:23.060> is<00:04:23.270> it's<00:04:23.479> more<00:04:23.750> than<00:04:24.050> halfway<00:04:24.289> between<00:04:24.710> 40

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
red is it's more than halfway between 40

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.530 
red is it's more than halfway between 40
and<00:04:25.280> 50

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
and 50

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.600 
and 50
means<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:27.380> temperature<00:04:27.860> is<00:04:27.980> higher<00:04:28.310> than

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
means the temperature is higher than

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:43.570 
means the temperature is higher than
forty<00:04:29.000> three<00:04:29.300> higher<00:04:31.510> much<00:04:32.510> higher<00:04:41.950> yeah<00:04:42.950> I'm

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
forty three higher much higher yeah I'm

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.540 
forty three higher much higher yeah I'm
the<00:04:43.850> one<00:04:43.880> with<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.450> problem<00:04:45.020> not<00:04:45.050> you<00:04:45.620> but

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
the one with the problem not you but

you can know and improve you can really
do<00:05:16.040> that<00:05:16.340> I<00:05:16.670> can<00:05:17.420> and<00:05:17.870> I<00:05:18.320> will<00:05:20.560> just<00:05:21.560> sign<00:05:21.950> this

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
do that I can and I will just sign this

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.650 
do that I can and I will just sign this
and<00:05:23.450> give<00:05:23.780> me<00:05:23.930> your<00:05:24.170> permission

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.240 

we<00:05:28.660> know<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:28.990> thin<00:05:29.200> lines<00:05:29.470> can't<00:05:29.889> be<00:05:30.040> one

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
we know the thin lines can't be one

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.430 
we know the thin lines can't be one
degree<00:05:30.430> apart<00:05:30.910> but<00:05:31.600> they're<00:05:31.780> evenly<00:05:32.020> spaced

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
degree apart but they're evenly spaced

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.200 
degree apart but they're evenly spaced
so<00:05:33.010> they<00:05:33.130> must<00:05:33.370> be<00:05:33.490> the<00:05:33.669> same<00:05:33.880> number<00:05:34.180> of

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
so they must be the same number of

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.360 
so they must be the same number of
degrees<00:05:34.630> apart

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
degrees apart

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.710 
degrees apart
let's<00:05:36.370> try<00:05:36.550> counting<00:05:36.880> by<00:05:36.970> twos<00:05:37.240> instead<00:05:37.630> of

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
let's try counting by twos instead of

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:46.020 
let's try counting by twos instead of
ones<00:05:37.930> okay<00:05:38.860> 40<00:05:39.820> 42<00:05:40.889> 44<00:05:41.889> 46<00:05:42.210> 48<00:05:43.740> 50<00:05:44.910> counting<00:05:45.910> by

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
ones okay 40 42 44 46 48 50 counting by

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.720 
ones okay 40 42 44 46 48 50 counting by
twos<00:05:46.330> works<00:05:46.810> then<00:05:47.710> the<00:05:47.889> temperature<00:05:48.430> of<00:05:48.460> the

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
twos works then the temperature of the

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:55.440 
twos works then the temperature of the
sculpture<00:05:49.270> is<00:05:49.360> actually<00:05:50.460> 42<00:05:52.500> 44<00:05:53.500> 46<00:05:54.450> cyber

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
sculpture is actually 42 44 46 cyber

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.720 
sculpture is actually 42 44 46 cyber
degrees<00:05:55.930> that's<00:05:56.620> even<00:05:57.070> hotter<00:05:57.280> than<00:05:57.550> we

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
degrees that's even hotter than we

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.890 
degrees that's even hotter than we
thought<00:05:58.030> and<00:05:58.419> the<00:05:58.780> blanket<00:05:59.169> is<00:05:59.260> dry<00:05:59.500> again

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
thought and the blanket is dry again

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.330 
thought and the blanket is dry again
we<00:06:01.900> have<00:06:02.050> to<00:06:02.229> keep<00:06:02.380> wetting<00:06:02.650> this<00:06:02.950> so<00:06:03.100> we<00:06:03.190> can

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
we have to keep wetting this so we can

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.250 
we have to keep wetting this so we can
take<00:06:03.550> away<00:06:03.790> more<00:06:04.150> heat<00:06:04.419> and<00:06:04.600> cool<00:06:04.840> down<00:06:05.050> the

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
take away more heat and cool down the

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:12.750 
take away more heat and cool down the
chocolate<00:06:08.790> temperatures<00:06:09.790> dropping<00:06:10.240> again<00:06:11.760> it

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
chocolate temperatures dropping again it

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.150 
chocolate temperatures dropping again it
stopped<00:06:13.090> halfway<00:06:13.389> between<00:06:13.750> 42<00:06:14.470> and<00:06:14.979> 48<00:06:15.960> 41<00:06:17.160> but

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
stopped halfway between 42 and 48 41 but

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.310 
stopped halfway between 42 and 48 41 but
there's<00:06:18.370> still<00:06:18.580> water<00:06:18.790> to<00:06:19.120> evaporate<00:06:19.720> it

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
there's still water to evaporate it

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.740 
there's still water to evaporate it
should<00:06:20.650> be<00:06:20.800> getting<00:06:21.130> cooler<00:06:21.490> then<00:06:22.389> how<00:06:22.570> come

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
should be getting cooler then how come

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.800 
should be getting cooler then how come
it<00:06:22.810> stopped<00:06:23.110> cooling<00:06:23.620> I<00:06:23.860> don't<00:06:24.430> know<00:06:24.700> but<00:06:25.479> I<00:06:25.720> do

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
it stopped cooling I don't know but I do

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.070 
it stopped cooling I don't know but I do
know<00:06:26.229> this<00:06:27.000> if<00:06:28.000> we<00:06:28.270> don't<00:06:28.450> find<00:06:28.690> a<00:06:28.840> way<00:06:28.870> to

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
know this if we don't find a way to

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.830 
know this if we don't find a way to

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
bring it down to 37 cyber degrees fast

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:40.070 
bring it down to 37 cyber degrees fast

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
wetting the blanket isn't enough there

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.860 
wetting the blanket isn't enough there
must<00:06:44.580> be<00:06:44.819> another<00:06:45.120> way<00:06:45.389> to<00:06:45.449> bring<00:06:45.720> the

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
must be another way to bring the

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:48.389 
temperature down more oh I knew this

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:50.149 
temperature down more oh I knew this
surprise<00:06:48.840> party<00:06:48.870> wouldn't<00:06:49.590> work

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:50.159 
surprise party wouldn't work

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:55.790

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:01.819 
a breeze yeah it makes me feel cooler

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:06.040 
a breeze yeah it makes me feel cooler
especially<00:07:02.749> here<00:07:03.819> maybe<00:07:04.819> the<00:07:05.209> breeze<00:07:05.629> makes

the water evaporate faster if it works
for<00:07:09.379> us<00:07:09.649> it<00:07:09.919> should<00:07:10.279> work<00:07:10.490> for<00:07:10.729> the<00:07:10.789> sculpture

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:12.819
