Whitney<00:01:11.869> isn't<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.990> cool<00:01:13.280> but<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.369> actually

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
Whitney isn't that cool but it actually

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.390 
Whitney isn't that cool but it actually
gets<00:01:14.790> better<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:16.290> also<00:01:16.439> look<00:01:16.740> around<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
gets better I can also look around and

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.080 
gets better I can also look around and
have<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> map<00:01:18.780> rotate<00:01:19.590> with<00:01:19.799> me<00:01:23.090> always

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
have the map rotate with me always

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.730 
have the map rotate with me always
