00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.260
 I'm using the white one I'm going to add 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.330
 a spoonful of mustard if they have 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.720

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.530
 of lemon or lemon juice would be 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.340
 more or less around a lemon and 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.259
 medium we are going to liquefy very 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.509
 once they are well integrated these 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.979
 ingredients we will be adding oil 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.740
 I have here two cases of oil 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.719
 olive you can use grape oil 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.329
 canola oil oil that the 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.340
 vegetable right now I tell you which one suits you 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.880
 more and how little by little and 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.880
 adding him 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.840
 It is very important that you integrate the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.460
 oil little by little and after that 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.990
 We will continue when for about two or 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.690
 three minutes this will help us 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.570
 that our mayonnaise is thicker 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.250
 Here is mine, I 'll give you some 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.660
 tips for this mayonnaise is greater this 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.970
 it does not have conservatives so 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.800
 probably will last you in the fridge of 15 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.360
 to 17 days if you want to last a 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.100
 little bit more add a spoonful of 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.590
 vinegar that helps you conserve 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.420
 second tip depends on the oil many 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.460
 Sometimes we are afraid of fats 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.020
 fats that your body needs 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.149
 You need fat is why we always 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.640
 recommends eating salmon that contains 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.259
 the omega 3 canola oil the oil 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.450
 of olive tree can help you 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.220
 negative cholesterol you go discarding 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.680
 the same the nuts the peanuts the 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.480
 question here is to eat it in moderation 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.370
 in small portions because around 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.290
 of a spoonful of canola oil 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.239
 olive tree has about 120 calories so 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.980
 we have to be careful with the 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.930
 ok portions can also use 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.850
 vegetable oil the oil likes a 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.800
 Very strong flavor if you are not very supportive 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.810
 of olive oil better to use the 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.120
 canola oil that its flavor is much 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.620
 more versatile or vegetable oil I hope 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.610
