though<00:04:49.790> in<00:04:49.940> this<00:04:50.090> game<00:04:50.270> where<00:04:50.540> you<00:04:50.630> they<00:04:51.080> could

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
though in this game where you they could

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.840 
though in this game where you they could
pick<00:04:51.410> up<00:04:51.530> stars<00:04:51.800> or<00:04:52.040> starting<00:04:52.430> enemies<00:04:52.699> and

pick up stars or starting enemies and
that<00:04:52.940> which<00:04:53.090> I<00:04:53.240> find<00:04:53.479> really<00:04:53.690> quite<00:04:53.960> cool<00:04:54.199> it

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
that which I find really quite cool it

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.100 
that which I find really quite cool it
gives<00:04:54.740> it<00:04:54.889> a<00:04:54.949> sort<00:04:55.130> I<00:04:55.250> can<00:04:55.430> never<00:04:56.180> upper<00:04:56.870> hand

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
gives it a sort I can never upper hand

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.050 
gives it a sort I can never upper hand
for<00:04:57.229> us<00:04:57.380> though<00:04:57.680> really<00:04:57.979> as<00:04:58.040> well<00:04:58.220> but<00:04:58.400> it's

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
for us though really as well but it's

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.250 
for us though really as well but it's
down<00:04:59.300> though<00:04:59.479> in<00:04:59.600> the<00:04:59.690> right<00:04:59.900> sort<00:05:00.110> of

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
down though in the right sort of

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.320 
down though in the right sort of
direction<00:05:00.530> just<00:05:00.800> to<00:05:00.919> give<00:05:01.729> you<00:05:01.850> a<00:05:01.880> bit<00:05:02.090> of<00:05:02.150> help

though on the screen the difficulty on
the<00:05:13.460> game<00:05:13.699> is<00:05:14.000> very<00:05:14.120> very<00:05:14.510> difficult<00:05:14.930> I<00:05:15.290> have

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
the game is very very difficult I have

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.379 
the game is very very difficult I have
to<00:05:15.500> say<00:05:15.650> it's<00:05:15.889> very<00:05:16.100> very<00:05:16.220> hard<00:05:16.610> a<00:05:16.789> lot<00:05:17.150> more

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
to say it's very very hard a lot more

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:18.850 
to say it's very very hard a lot more
hard<00:05:17.600> than<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:17.870> first<00:05:18.110> one<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.410> first<00:05:18.440> one<00:05:18.830> I

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
hard than the first one the first one I

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.469 
hard than the first one the first one I
found<00:05:19.190> a<00:05:19.310> little<00:05:19.550> bit<00:05:19.699> more<00:05:19.760> easier<00:05:20.180> but<00:05:20.330> this

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
found a little bit more easier but this

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.270 
found a little bit more easier but this
one<00:05:20.660> does<00:05:21.350> provide<00:05:21.740> a<00:05:21.800> bit<00:05:22.010> more<00:05:22.160> of<00:05:22.220> a

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
one does provide a bit more of a

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.640 
one does provide a bit more of a
challenge<00:05:22.639> it<00:05:22.729> the<00:05:23.300> levels<00:05:23.810> like<00:05:24.260> I<00:05:24.289> said<00:05:24.530> I'll

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
challenge it the levels like I said I'll

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.290 
challenge it the levels like I said I'll
just<00:05:24.800> like<00:05:25.010> topsy-turvy<00:05:25.370> all<00:05:25.820> over<00:05:26.060> the<00:05:26.180> place

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
just like topsy-turvy all over the place

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.120 
just like topsy-turvy all over the place
in<00:05:26.449> that<00:05:26.479> it<00:05:26.750> adds<00:05:27.080> a<00:05:27.229> new<00:05:27.380> so<00:05:27.590> I've<00:05:27.710> done<00:05:27.919> of<00:05:28.039> it
