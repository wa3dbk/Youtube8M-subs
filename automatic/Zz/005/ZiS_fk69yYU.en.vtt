from<00:01:37.630> which<00:01:37.660> the<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.380> newer<00:01:38.830> kings

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.680 

favorite<00:01:48.500> character<00:01:48.950> would<00:01:49.670> probably<00:01:50.240> be

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
favorite character would probably be

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.070 
favorite character would probably be
heihachi<00:01:51.560> mishima<00:01:51.979> as<00:01:52.310> far<00:01:52.490> as<00:01:52.610> playing<00:01:53.080> if

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
heihachi mishima as far as playing if

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.020 
heihachi mishima as far as playing if
it's<00:01:54.650> from<00:01:54.800> like<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.190> whole<00:01:55.340> Tekken<00:01:55.670> setting

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
it's from like the whole Tekken setting

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.600 
it's from like the whole Tekken setting
and<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.479> story<00:01:56.780> was<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:57.320> guess<00:01:57.650> Jin<00:01:58.460> Kazama

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
and the story was I guess Jin Kazama

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.490 
and the story was I guess Jin Kazama
because<00:01:59.090> he's<00:01:59.270> kind<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.570> been<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.900> main

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
because he's kind of been the main

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.810 
because he's kind of been the main
character<00:02:00.890> throughout<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.280> series<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.760> the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
character throughout the series and the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.270 
character throughout the series and the
stories<00:02:02.090> never<00:02:02.270> trade<00:02:02.630> through<00:02:02.810> his<00:02:02.900> eyes<00:02:03.280> so

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
stories never trade through his eyes so

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:13.750 
stories never trade through his eyes so
both<00:02:04.520> of<00:02:04.550> those<00:02:04.820> characters

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.089 

as<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.000> mentioned<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.599> 2d<00:02:16.050> fighting<00:02:16.590> has

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
as you mentioned to 2d fighting has

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.610 
as you mentioned to 2d fighting has
really<00:02:17.400> kind<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:18.110> senior<00:02:19.110> resurgence

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
really kind of senior resurgence

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.880 
really kind of senior resurgence
recently<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:21.180> as<00:02:21.720> far<00:02:21.900> as<00:02:22.019> where<00:02:22.140> 3d<00:02:22.470> fighting

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
recently and as far as where 3d fighting

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.369 
recently and as far as where 3d fighting
is<00:02:23.160> going<00:02:23.459> towards<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:24.030> think<00:02:24.750> even<00:02:24.900> the

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
is going towards I think even the

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.309 
is going towards I think even the
popular<00:02:26.040> 2d<00:02:26.370> fighters<00:02:26.700> like<00:02:26.879> Street<00:02:27.180> Fighter

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
popular 2d fighters like Street Fighter

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.449 
popular 2d fighters like Street Fighter
have<00:02:28.319> kind<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.680> incorporated<00:02:29.220> some

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
have kind of incorporated some

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.539

technology<00:02:30.090> from<00:02:30.420> 3d<00:02:30.870> such<00:02:31.530> as<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.920> models

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
technology from 3d such as the models

technology from 3d such as the models
the<00:02:33.330> way<00:02:33.480> they<00:02:33.599> make<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.780> game<00:02:34.049> although<00:02:34.920> it's

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
the way they make a game although it's

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.970 
the way they make a game although it's
still<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.640> gameplay<00:02:35.940> mechanics<00:02:36.330> or<00:02:36.450> 2d<00:02:36.980> and

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
still the gameplay mechanics or 2d and

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.369 
still the gameplay mechanics or 2d and
even<00:02:38.700> as<00:02:38.819> far<00:02:39.030> as<00:02:39.239> games<00:02:39.599> like<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.049> Virtua

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
even as far as games like the Virtua

even as far as games like the Virtua
Fighter<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.709> Tekken<00:02:40.769> literature<00:02:41.549> 3d

Fighter and Tekken literature 3d

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.069 
Fighter and Tekken literature 3d
fighting<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.709> think<00:02:44.489> that<00:02:44.549> similar<00:02:45.329> to<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.660> FPS

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
fighting I think that similar to the FPS

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.910 
fighting I think that similar to the FPS
is<00:02:46.260> kind<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.769> matured<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.489> we've<00:02:48.299> reached<00:02:48.510> a

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
is kind of matured and we've reached a

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.539 
is kind of matured and we've reached a
certain<00:02:49.920> level<00:02:50.069> at<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.269> point<00:02:51.569> I<00:02:51.690> think<00:02:51.750> so

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
certain level at this point I think so

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.220 
certain level at this point I think so
rather<00:02:53.549> than<00:02:53.760> continuing<00:02:54.209> on<00:02:54.390> maybe<00:02:54.780> perhaps

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
rather than continuing on maybe perhaps

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.650 
rather than continuing on maybe perhaps
some<00:02:55.560> kind<00:02:55.739> of<00:02:55.799> visual<00:02:56.099> tweaking<00:02:56.549> like<00:02:56.660> how

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
some kind of visual tweaking like how

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.800 
some kind of visual tweaking like how
you've<00:02:57.840> seen<00:02:58.079> a<00:02:58.110> 3d<00:02:59.150> applied<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.329> movies<00:03:00.660> and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
you've seen a 3d applied to movies and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.569 
you've seen a 3d applied to movies and
such<00:03:00.959> recently<00:03:01.440> maybe<00:03:01.980> something<00:03:02.400> like<00:03:02.549> that

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
such recently maybe something like that

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.150 
such recently maybe something like that
could<00:03:03.060> be<00:03:03.209> applied<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.780> 3d<00:03:04.530> fighting<00:03:04.709> games<00:03:04.980> as

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
could be applied to 3d fighting games as

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.860 
could be applied to 3d fighting games as
well<00:03:05.599> from<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.750> visual<00:03:07.440> aspect<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.099> game
