always being very very confused here by
earlier<00:00:46.140> Windows<00:00:46.590> versions<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.280> mean<00:00:47.460> it's

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
earlier Windows versions I mean it's

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.260 
earlier Windows versions I mean it's
like<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:49.320> many<00:00:49.590> things<00:00:49.789> doesn't<00:00:50.789> feel<00:00:50.940> like

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
like so many things doesn't feel like

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.139 
like so many things doesn't feel like
they've<00:00:51.660> organized<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:53.460> an<00:00:53.640> easy<00:00:53.910> way

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
they've organized it in in an easy way

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.360 
they've organized it in in an easy way
if<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.449> want<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.719> go<00:00:54.840> into<00:00:55.020> display<00:00:55.860> settings

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
it eventually but they may way better

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.920 
it eventually but they may way better

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
interesting there how it doesn't really

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.770 
interesting there how it doesn't really
seem<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:22.110> option<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.780> that

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
seem to have the option there to that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.480 
seem to have the option there to that
one-minute<00:01:25.470> screen<00:01:25.950> timeout

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
one-minute screen timeout

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.130 
one-minute screen timeout
not<00:01:27.060> quite<00:01:27.270> sure<00:01:27.509> maybe<00:01:27.780> there<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.670> here<00:01:29.670> some

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
not quite sure maybe there is here some

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.050 
not quite sure maybe there is here some
someplace<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.500> don't<00:01:31.799> know<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> go<00:01:32.880> look

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
someplace I don't know I have to go look

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.550 
someplace I don't know I have to go look
for<00:01:33.119> that

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
for that

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.219 
for that
okay<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.619> let's<00:01:34.950> compare<00:01:35.189> these<00:01:35.369> two<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
okay so let's compare these two so the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.630 
okay so let's compare these two so the
first<00:01:37.439> thing<00:01:37.650> you're<00:01:37.770> giving<00:01:38.009> notes<00:01:38.189> here<00:01:38.520> is

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
first thing you're giving notes here is

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.609 
first thing you're giving notes here is
a<00:01:38.670> little<00:01:38.820> bit<00:01:39.000> different<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:40.140> way<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
a little bit different is the way the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.030 
a little bit different is the way the
background<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:42.030> background<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.619> you

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
background the background is that you

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.490 
background the background is that you
can<00:01:44.220> pick<00:01:44.460> how<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.270> being<00:01:45.509> displayed<00:01:45.899> here

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
can pick how it's being displayed here

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.219 
can pick how it's being displayed here
in<00:01:46.649> Windows<00:01:46.950> 10<00:01:47.310> technical<00:01:48.270> preview<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:49.110> can

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
in Windows 10 technical preview you can

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.440 
in Windows 10 technical preview you can
see<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:50.009> fully<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> background<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.390> a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
see it's fully in the background in a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.810 
see it's fully in the background in a
seat<00:01:51.689> here<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.350> there<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.189> background<00:01:53.369> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
seat here in there in the background and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.109 
seat here in there in the background and
you<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:54.659> see<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.020> behind<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.770> task<00:01:56.119> versus

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
you can see it's behind the task versus

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.370 
you can see it's behind the task versus
here<00:01:57.450> when<00:01:57.630> you're<00:01:57.750> gonna<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.259> this

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
here when you're gonna have this

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.440 
here when you're gonna have this
background<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.159> like<00:01:59.430> red<00:01:59.670> background<00:01:59.909> it's

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
background it's like red background it's

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.410 
background it's like red background it's
only<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.189> top<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.850> not<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
only on the top it's not in the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.770 
only on the top it's not in the
background<00:02:04.219> so<00:02:06.590> that's<00:02:07.590> interesting<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.190> guess

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
background so that's interesting I guess

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.570 
background so that's interesting I guess
you<00:02:09.780> can<00:02:09.929> also<00:02:10.020> see<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.349> lag<00:02:10.530> here<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.220> Windows

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
you can also see the lag here in Windows

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.280 
you can also see the lag here in Windows

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
is because it's a preview but then again

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.580 
is because it's a preview but then again
also<00:02:16.549> the<00:02:16.700> Lumia<00:02:17.030> 830<00:02:17.120> has<00:02:17.689> a<00:02:17.959> little<00:02:18.319> bit<00:02:18.379> low

also the Lumia 830 has a little bit low

you can also see a pretty interesting

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.530 
you can also see a pretty interesting
thing<00:06:43.090> here<00:06:43.540> that<00:06:43.750> I<00:06:43.780> noticed<00:06:44.139> which<00:06:45.540> of

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
course you can see here probably sharper

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.320 
course you can see here probably sharper
performance<00:06:49.900> than<00:06:50.350> the<00:06:50.500> technical<00:06:50.800> preview

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
performance than the technical preview

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.050 
performance than the technical preview
yeah<00:06:52.330> you<00:06:52.389> can<00:06:52.630> see<00:06:52.750> it<00:06:52.780> this<00:06:52.990> one<00:06:53.260> is<00:06:53.440> so<00:06:53.680> like

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 
yeah you can see it this one is so like

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.670 
yeah you can see it this one is so like
rerender<00:06:55.090> definitely<00:06:55.960> take<00:06:56.110> some<00:06:56.260> time<00:06:56.470> but

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
rerender definitely take some time but

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.440 
rerender definitely take some time but
you<00:06:57.310> can<00:06:57.460> kind<00:06:57.669> of<00:06:57.700> see<00:06:57.820> how<00:06:57.880> the<00:06:57.940> brightness

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.450 
you can kind of see how the brightness

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.480 
you can kind of see how the brightness
is<00:06:58.570> way<00:06:58.780> brighter<00:06:59.139> here<00:06:59.560> in<00:06:59.860> Windows<00:07:00.340> Phone

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
is way brighter here in Windows Phone

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.810 
is way brighter here in Windows Phone
8.1<00:07:00.910> and<00:07:01.450> the<00:07:01.660> 930<00:07:02.229> here<00:07:03.220> I<00:07:03.250> mean<00:07:03.550> it's<00:07:03.729> not

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:03.820 
8.1 and the 930 here I mean it's not

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.140 
8.1 and the 930 here I mean it's not
even<00:07:04.000> close<00:07:04.479> to<00:07:04.930> as<00:07:05.229> bright<00:07:05.590> so<00:07:06.039> that<00:07:07.000> is

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.150 
even close to as bright so that is

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.170 
even close to as bright so that is
definitely<00:07:07.389> a<00:07:07.750> little<00:07:08.020> bit<00:07:08.580> annoying<00:07:09.580> there<00:07:10.000> I

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180 
definitely a little bit annoying there I

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.570 
definitely a little bit annoying there I
find<00:07:11.280> could<00:07:12.280> be<00:07:12.490> is<00:07:12.669> because<00:07:12.850> it's<00:07:13.240> a<00:07:13.419> preview

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.580 
find could be is because it's a preview

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.180 
find could be is because it's a preview
but<00:07:15.580> it's<00:07:16.090> kind<00:07:16.330> of<00:07:16.389> nice<00:07:16.539> in<00:07:16.900> the<00:07:17.470> music<00:07:17.830> video

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.190 
but it's kind of nice in the music video

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.610 
but it's kind of nice in the music video
and<00:07:18.220> the<00:07:18.729> Maps<00:07:18.970> app<00:07:19.210> should<00:07:19.450> also<00:07:19.630> be<00:07:19.930> updated

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
and the Maps app should also be updated

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.210 
and the Maps app should also be updated
of<00:07:20.740> course

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:21.220 
of course

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.800 
of course
so<00:07:21.520> it<00:07:21.729> might<00:07:21.880> different<00:07:22.300> take<00:07:22.450> a<00:07:22.479> look<00:07:22.690> at

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:22.810 
so it might different take a look at

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.140 
so it might different take a look at
that<00:07:22.960> as<00:07:23.110> well<00:07:23.490> but<00:07:24.490> there<00:07:24.700> are<00:07:24.760> definitely

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.150 
that as well but there are definitely

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.230 
that as well but there are definitely
some<00:07:25.240> nice<00:07:25.990> additions<00:07:26.590> overall<00:07:27.160> and<00:07:27.460> they

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 
some nice additions overall and they

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.210 
some nice additions overall and they
never<00:07:28.450> need<00:07:28.690> to<00:07:28.720> fix<00:07:28.990> this<00:07:29.229> like<00:07:29.560> slowness

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:30.220 
never need to fix this like slowness

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.409 
never need to fix this like slowness
here<00:07:30.610> as<00:07:30.700> you<00:07:30.880> see<00:07:31.240> it's<00:07:31.510> quite<00:07:32.200> quite<00:07:32.710> a<00:07:32.740> mess

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:33.419 
here as you see it's quite quite a mess

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:35.820 
here as you see it's quite quite a mess
but<00:07:34.419> I<00:07:34.479> think<00:07:34.870> that<00:07:35.050> if<00:07:35.139> they<00:07:35.260> continue<00:07:35.800> to

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.830 
but I think that if they continue to

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.600 
but I think that if they continue to
work<00:07:36.190> on<00:07:36.430> it<00:07:36.580> it<00:07:37.030> could<00:07:37.840> definitely<00:07:38.500> turn<00:07:39.250> out

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:39.610 
work on it it could definitely turn out

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.779 
work on it it could definitely turn out
nice<00:07:39.820> so<00:07:40.360> yeah<00:07:41.289> quickly<00:07:41.740> videos<00:07:42.190> check<00:07:42.520> it<00:07:42.669> out

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:42.789 
nice so yeah quickly videos check it out

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:44.279 
nice so yeah quickly videos check it out
hopefully<00:07:43.060> you<00:07:43.360> didn't<00:07:43.660> do<00:07:43.810> it<00:07:43.930> and<00:07:44.020> I<00:07:44.139> might

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:44.289 
hopefully you didn't do it and I might

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:46.770
