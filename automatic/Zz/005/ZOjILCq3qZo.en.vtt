00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.410
 And songs at Tokyo Auto Salon 2012 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:14.550
 4 wd concept car with sport hybrid system 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:18.300
 We exhibited sport hybrid concept 2 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:22.090
 The aim of the car is that the hybrid is Toyota's 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:27.910
 It is also a signboard, but in that 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:29.680
 Was made with the fact that I want to make even a car that can run in sport sporty is there in this car 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.350
 I say I was in recess 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:40.989
 When running on a motor quietly with a hybrid, when you run by the sea while listening to the sound of the wind 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:46.600
 In the city with a reasonable fuel consumption while 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.050
 Planning and design work to this kind of car this time by say want to run the sport in places like 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.700
 Better was 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:55.070
 Basically the cockpit relationship is 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:58.220
 Thank you for using mrs and everything else is kind 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.360
 Especially the suspension is uncommon in such cars 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:06.830
 All in particular has created a new rear is that 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.690
 We have adopted a very multi-link of the new type is that it's important 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.460
 Stay on even if I put the power where Well that sense 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:17.890
 In the front and rear we use a new type of opposing brakes 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:24.790
 Then that 's right for this car 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:26.340
 It is an aluminum wheel in terms of the foot, but this is also newly designed for this car 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.460
 I use 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.390
 Basically that rx 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.810
 Is using 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:39.850
 I am using a 3.5 liter hybrid system 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.830
 That is the sink of the engine and motor gear only at the front of this car 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:47.350
 Replace it all 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.790
 I used the four-wheel system that only the motor had a rear end and the front had 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.050
 We 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:58.520
 Well compared to Rex, but about 600 yen lighter 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:02:03.259
 And I think the Fu that considerable speed acceleration is in the same system 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.439
 I 'm running slowly now, but it 's like I used to run a little while ago 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.520
 I would like to do it once more with fun to drive again 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.520
 I would like you to ride
