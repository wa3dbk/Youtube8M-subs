00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.559
 Halli hello love people today clarify how 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.250
 the question and how do you do that 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.110
 the buttons 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.580
 this question has been more often now 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.070
 put in my videos how do I do 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.020
 that with the buttons and that is about 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:27.660
 the secret door you are still here 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:32.349
 does not see and now secret again 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.930
 button to press secret door and this 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.830
 principle, I'll show you now 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.630
 how it works from the back 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.470
 from but if you time not so long 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:48.030
 I'll show you how it works 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:51.820
 the two buttons and first we have 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:57.220
 namely this fact that redstone through 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.720
 blocks does not work here 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.690
 Redstone set then you see that it 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.960
 lights with a repeater goes 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:09.790
 redstone through blocks but not through 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.840
 lars however through other blocks like 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.570
 stone or wool 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:19.510
 I would like to do so 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.870
 principle goes even further if we now 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:27.000
 make a circle here 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:30.070
 zack zack zack zack zack so you see that 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.020
 and I'll say that to redstone 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.610
 torch makes you look away again 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.900
 her it is still lit is always 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:41.470
 even if I now but worry 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.930
 that I'm with one of a runway and 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.880
 a second push button so there is a 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.580
 compressed air has just given the energy 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.830
 which is still running in a circle and 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.320
 the second should be for this one 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.040
 is triggered and zack is 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.040
 everything again 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.150
 but that is only for a short time so 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.430
 that's what he does just a little 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.820
 then we push again 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.400
 on 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.530
 that shines again everything looks the 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.760
 repeater is on and off and this is the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.960
 whole principle actually already from 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.540
 my two friends like me 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.160
 have made 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.140
 namely, I have a runway here 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.390
 I've got a dollar 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:29.270
 I collected then I made circle 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.580
 I have connected so and so 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.280
 That's it, here I am 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.700
 Just do my door now 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.770
 door 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.910
 Let's say it's the door, too 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.810
 so that you see that there is something moving 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.250
 Now I go to my first button 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.080
 and turns on the door to open the door 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:54.170
 The door is open and now mostly again 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:57.560
 So what happens is there for sure 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.180
 piston is called now pushes the role 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.830
 away and breaks through the resulting 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.190
 this circuit is there all the time 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.500
 flows so we have the first impulse 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.570
 get there in the circle so cool 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.350
 lured and the slopes are again 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.480
 away from zack the door closes again and 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.340
 that is the whole principle is much more 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.540
 that's not the way you can do that 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.500
 connect and you can do that for everyone 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.290
 use other thing 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.370
 Let's think of it that's totally 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.410
 practically not permanently as a 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.130
 you have to switch to call it the whole 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.060
 a breaker that's it 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.860
 even from me 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.150
 if you have any questions, let me know 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.440
 I hope you understand if I am 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.680
 then you always have to look through something 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.660
 even more detailed but I think 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.220
 think that was allowed to get done then 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.870
 I wish a lot of fun and see you soon 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.870
 yours can give you your 80th
