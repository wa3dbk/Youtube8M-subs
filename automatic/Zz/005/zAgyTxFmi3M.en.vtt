about the flashpoint x-series 2.4
gigahertz<00:00:14.549> remote<00:00:15.120> flash<00:00:15.420> trigger<00:00:15.870> kit<00:00:16.230> and

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
gigahertz remote flash trigger kit and

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.859 
gigahertz remote flash trigger kit and
that<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.670> transmitter<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.480> receiver<00:00:18.720> I

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
that is the transmitter and receiver I

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.380 
that is the transmitter and receiver I
have<00:00:19.170> right<00:00:19.380> here<00:00:19.410> now<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.039> kit<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.580> both<00:00:21.270> of

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
have right here now this kit is both of

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.420 
have right here now this kit is both of
these<00:00:21.480> plus<00:00:21.810> some<00:00:22.020> cables<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:22.710> $100

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
these plus some cables and it's $100

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.769 
these plus some cables and it's $100
which<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.150> really<00:00:24.359> nice

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
which is really nice

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.509 
which is really nice
what<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.170> allows<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.710> do<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.310> put<00:00:26.490> one

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
what this allows you to do is to put one

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.250 
what this allows you to do is to put one
of<00:00:26.880> these<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> camera<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.930> other<00:00:28.050> one

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
of these on a camera and the other one

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.470 
of these on a camera and the other one
on<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> flash<00:00:29.369> either<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.760> speed<00:00:30.060> light<00:00:30.240> or

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
on a flash either a speed light or

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.620 
on a flash either a speed light or
studio<00:00:30.840> strobe<00:00:31.170> like<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.000> you<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.270> use

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
studio strobe like this and you can use

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.900 
studio strobe like this and you can use
that<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.230> trigger<00:00:34.410> your<00:00:34.739> flashes<00:00:35.280> instead<00:00:35.730> of

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
that to trigger your flashes instead of

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.060 
that to trigger your flashes instead of
having<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.510> sync<00:00:36.780> cable<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:37.980> gives

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
having a sync cable and so that gives

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.790 
having a sync cable and so that gives
you<00:00:38.219> some<00:00:38.399> freedom<00:00:38.670> now<00:00:39.210> these<00:00:39.660> are<00:00:39.960> strictly

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
you some freedom now these are strictly

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.700 
you some freedom now these are strictly
triggers<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.879> there<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.180> no<00:00:42.570> TTL<00:00:43.350> there's

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
triggers so there is no TTL there's

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.229 
triggers so there is no TTL there's
nothing<00:00:44.100> else<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.399> these<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:44.700> all<00:00:44.760> they<00:00:45.180> do

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
nothing else that these do all they do

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.540 
nothing else that these do all they do
is<00:00:45.570> send<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.989> signal<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.440> make<00:00:46.800> your<00:00:46.950> flash<00:00:47.190> fire

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
is send a signal to make your flash fire

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.979 
is send a signal to make your flash fire
so<00:00:47.820> there's<00:00:48.000> no<00:00:48.180> hyper<00:00:48.420> sync<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:48.870> high-speed

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
so there's no hyper sync or high-speed

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.889 
so there's no hyper sync or high-speed
sync<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:49.860> TTL<00:00:50.520> metering<00:00:50.700> none<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.570> stuff

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
sync or TTL metering none of that stuff

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.529 
sync or TTL metering none of that stuff
there<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.320> triggers<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.789> what<00:00:54.149> these<00:00:54.239> do

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
there just triggers and so what these do

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.450 
there just triggers and so what these do
is<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.960> allows<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.649> not<00:00:55.800> only<00:00:55.860> trigger

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
is this allows you to not only trigger

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.939 
is this allows you to not only trigger
from<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.090> standard<00:00:57.629> modern<00:00:57.960> DSLR<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:58.770> this

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
from a standard modern DSLR like this

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.770 
from a standard modern DSLR like this
that<00:00:59.129> has<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> hot<00:00:59.520> shoe<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.480> use<00:01:00.600> for

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
that has a hot shoe that you can use for

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.569 
that has a hot shoe that you can use for
flashing<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.680> even<00:01:01.890> hook<00:01:02.399> these<00:01:02.520> up

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
flashing but you can even hook these up

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.850 
flashing but you can even hook these up
to<00:01:02.910> old-school<00:01:03.270> cameras<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.500> Polaroid

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
to old-school cameras like this Polaroid

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.130 
to old-school cameras like this Polaroid
as<00:01:05.189> long<00:01:05.640> as<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.880> has<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> PC<00:01:06.540> terminal<00:01:06.990> that

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
as long as it has a PC terminal that

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.740 
as long as it has a PC terminal that
allows<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:08.030> give<00:01:09.030> some<00:01:09.270> kind<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.510> trigger

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
allows you to give some kind of trigger

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.750 
allows you to give some kind of trigger
to<00:01:09.930> tell<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> flash<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.710> fire<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.490> I'll<00:01:11.580> show

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
to tell the flash to fire so I'll show

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.940 
to tell the flash to fire so I'll show
you<00:01:11.820> both<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.180> these<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.720> again<00:01:13.439> as<00:01:13.830> I

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
you both of these and again as I

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.679 
you both of these and again as I
mentioned<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.369> trigger<00:01:14.760> even<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.420> speed

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
mentioned you can trigger even a speed

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.080 
mentioned you can trigger even a speed
light<00:01:15.840> or<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.500> studio<00:01:17.040> strobe<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.790> let's<00:01:17.970> look

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
light or a studio strobe so let's look

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.539 
light or a studio strobe so let's look
and<00:01:18.240> see<00:01:18.330> how<00:01:18.630> these<00:01:18.840> guys<00:01:19.140> work<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.250> what

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
and see how these guys work and so what

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.800 
and see how these guys work and so what
you<00:01:20.610> need<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.820> do<00:01:20.939> first<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.630> make<00:01:21.780> sure

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
you need to do first is to make sure

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.200 
you need to do first is to make sure
that<00:01:22.020> these<00:01:22.290> are<00:01:22.500> turned<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.549> at<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.000> same

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
that these are turned on and at the same

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.929 
that these are turned on and at the same
channel<00:01:24.720> now<00:01:25.080> these<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.409> 16<00:01:26.009> channels<00:01:26.490> so

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
channel now these have 16 channels so

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.310 
channel now these have 16 channels so
there's<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.180> little<00:01:27.330> dial<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.200> goes

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
there's a little dial here and it goes

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.020 
there's a little dial here and it goes
from<00:01:28.439> 1<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.740> 16<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.670> make<00:01:29.850> sure

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
from 1 to 16 and so you just make sure

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.609 
from 1 to 16 and so you just make sure
that<00:01:30.210> each<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.450> these<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.020> transmitter<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
that each of these the transmitter and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.340 
that each of these the transmitter and
the<00:01:31.740> receiver<00:01:31.770> are<00:01:32.280> set<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> same<00:01:33.360> channel

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the receiver are set to the same channel

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.679 
the receiver are set to the same channel
and<00:01:34.530> then<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.100> turn<00:01:35.310> both<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.790> these<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.210> and

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
and then you turn both of these on and

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.120 
and then you turn both of these on and
then<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.290> make<00:01:37.439> sure<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.860> there's<00:01:38.100> a

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
then to make sure it's on there's a

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.440 
then to make sure it's on there's a
little<00:01:38.280> button<00:01:38.520> right<00:01:38.700> here<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.240> can

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
little button right here that you can

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.420 
little button right here that you can
click<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.990> if<00:01:40.439> both<00:01:40.650> things<00:01:40.950> are<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.220> you're

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
click and if both things are on you're

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.710 
click and if both things are on you're
going<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.610> get<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.790> little<00:01:41.970> light<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.420> shines

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
going to get a little light that shines

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.719 
going to get a little light that shines
here<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.829> know<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.549> is

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
here and so you know that this is

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.039 
here and so you know that this is
working<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.479> way<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.720> should<00:01:45.899> be

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
working the way it should be

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.929 
working the way it should be
if<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.409> isn't<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.040> when<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.670> click<00:01:47.909> that

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
if this isn't on when you click that

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.249 
if this isn't on when you click that
nothing<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.540> going<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.720> happen<00:01:49.020> or<00:01:49.140> this

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
nothing it's going to happen or this

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.080 
nothing it's going to happen or this
one's<00:01:49.470> not<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.700> really<00:01:50.939> quickly

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
one's not on so you can really quickly

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.670 
one's not on so you can really quickly
make<00:01:51.509> sure<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.290> everything<00:01:52.530> set

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
make sure that you have everything set

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.440 
make sure that you have everything set
correctly<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.399> right<00:01:53.549> channels<00:01:53.939> are<00:01:54.060> set<00:01:54.270> and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
correctly the right channels are set and

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.749 
correctly the right channels are set and
it's<00:01:54.990> good<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.350> go<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.130> take<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.490> guy<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
it's good to go so you take this guy and

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.730 
it's good to go so you take this guy and
this<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.600> transmitter<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.560> goes

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
this is the transmitter and it goes

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.770 
this is the transmitter and it goes
right<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> hot<00:01:59.549> shoe<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.790> your<00:02:00.210> camera

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
right on to the hot shoe of your camera

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.420 
right on to the hot shoe of your camera
I'll<00:02:01.290> show<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.770> second<00:02:02.070> how<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.159> mount

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
I'll show you in a second how to mount

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.130 
I'll show you in a second how to mount
it<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.579> something<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.420> then<00:02:03.810> this

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
it to something like this and then this

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.709 
it to something like this and then this
is<00:02:04.920> very<00:02:05.159> simple<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:05.759> take<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> flash<00:02:06.420> and

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
is very simple you just take a flash and

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.290 
is very simple you just take a flash and
slide<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.770> hot<00:02:07.950> shoe<00:02:08.160> right<00:02:08.940> there

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
slide it on to the hot shoe right there

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.029 
slide it on to the hot shoe right there
and<00:02:09.479> then<00:02:10.020> when<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.289> take<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.470> picture<00:02:10.649> that's

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
and then when you take a picture that's

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.030 
and then when you take a picture that's
going<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.060> fire

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
going to fire

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.910 
going to fire
this<00:02:13.340> has<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.819> all<00:02:13.939> be<00:02:14.329> metered<00:02:15.140> in<00:02:15.349> manual

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
this has to all be metered in manual

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.649 
this has to all be metered in manual
mode<00:02:15.950> there<00:02:16.219> is<00:02:16.250> no<00:02:16.489> TTL<00:02:17.000> metering<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:17.510> when

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
mode there is no TTL metering so when

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.479 
mode there is no TTL metering so when
you're<00:02:17.780> using<00:02:17.989> this<00:02:18.230> on<00:02:18.409> a<00:02:18.500> speedlight<00:02:18.980> you

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
you're using this on a speedlight you

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.250 
you're using this on a speedlight you
have<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.760> use<00:02:19.879> that<00:02:20.030> in<00:02:20.150> manual<00:02:20.540> mode<00:02:20.569> and<00:02:20.989> then

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
have to use that in manual mode and then

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.289 
have to use that in manual mode and then
either<00:02:21.920> use<00:02:22.159> a<00:02:22.189> guide<00:02:22.459> number<00:02:22.670> or<00:02:22.939> a<00:02:22.969> flash

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
either use a guide number or a flash

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.509 
either use a guide number or a flash
meter<00:02:23.599> to<00:02:23.780> figure<00:02:24.019> out<00:02:24.170> what<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.129> put<00:02:25.340> that

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
meter to figure out what to put that

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.640 
meter to figure out what to put that
flash<00:02:25.909> on<00:02:26.209> because<00:02:26.420> again<00:02:26.659> there<00:02:26.900> is<00:02:26.989> no<00:02:27.170> TTL

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
flash on because again there is no TTL

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.490 
flash on because again there is no TTL
so<00:02:28.159> when<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.310> take<00:02:28.489> this<00:02:28.670> off<00:02:28.879> of<00:02:29.180> here<00:02:29.420> if<00:02:30.290> I

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
so when I take this off of here if I

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.080 
so when I take this off of here if I
wanted<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.799> connect<00:02:31.220> this<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:31.640> let's<00:02:31.970> say<00:02:32.060> a

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
wanted to connect this to let's say a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.000 
wanted to connect this to let's say a
studio<00:02:32.540> strobe<00:02:32.930> well<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.260> could<00:02:33.560> use<00:02:33.769> one<00:02:33.980> of

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
studio strobe well I could use one of

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.490 
studio strobe well I could use one of
these<00:02:34.189> included<00:02:34.849> cables<00:02:35.329> and<00:02:35.540> they<00:02:35.989> have<00:02:36.200> a

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
these included cables and they have a

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.410 
these included cables and they have a
lot<00:02:36.769> of<00:02:36.859> different<00:02:37.129> options<00:02:37.340> here<00:02:37.700> for<00:02:38.180> that

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
lot of different options here for that

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.440 
lot of different options here for that
and<00:02:38.659> so<00:02:39.230> I'm<00:02:39.470> going<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.650> use<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.129> mini<00:02:40.459> Jack

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
and so I'm going to use this mini Jack

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.970 
and so I'm going to use this mini Jack
right<00:02:41.629> here<00:02:41.659> put<00:02:42.019> it<00:02:42.079> in<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.260> sync<00:02:42.500> cable<00:02:42.680> of

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
right here put it in the sync cable of

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.890 
right here put it in the sync cable of
my<00:02:43.159> Profoto<00:02:43.579> and<00:02:43.819> then<00:02:44.239> I<00:02:44.450> can<00:02:44.599> put<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:44.840> on

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
my Profoto and then I can put this on

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.240 
my Profoto and then I can put this on
the<00:02:45.049> back<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.590> receiver

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
the back of the receiver

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.039 
the back of the receiver
I<00:02:46.280> don't<00:02:46.670> know<00:02:46.760> flash<00:02:47.030> attached<00:02:47.599> to<00:02:47.780> this<00:02:47.900> but

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
I don't know flash attached to this but

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.690 
I don't know flash attached to this but
it<00:02:48.109> works<00:02:48.260> just<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.470> same<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:48.859> when<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.010> trigger

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
it works just the same so when I trigger

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.670 
it works just the same so when I trigger
this<00:02:49.939> that<00:02:50.450> would<00:02:50.569> tell<00:02:50.689> the<00:02:50.780> flash<00:02:51.019> pack<00:02:51.500> to

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
this that would tell the flash pack to

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.619 
this that would tell the flash pack to
fire<00:02:51.889> and<00:02:52.159> a<00:02:52.250> flash<00:02:52.489> would<00:02:52.700> fire<00:02:52.939> and<00:02:53.209> so

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
fire and a flash would fire and so

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.170 
fire and a flash would fire and so
that's<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.900> pretty<00:02:54.109> standard<00:02:55.180> configuration

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
that's a pretty standard configuration

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.330 
that's a pretty standard configuration
which<00:02:56.629> is<00:02:56.750> really<00:02:56.959> nice<00:02:57.109> and<00:02:57.379> the<00:02:57.889> other<00:02:58.069> thing

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
which is really nice and the other thing

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.490 
which is really nice and the other thing
that's<00:02:58.489> really<00:02:58.579> nice<00:02:58.970> is<00:02:59.269> let's<00:02:59.930> say<00:03:00.139> I'm

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
that's really nice is let's say I'm

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.869 
that's really nice is let's say I'm
going<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.680> put<00:03:00.799> this<00:03:00.889> back<00:03:01.129> on<00:03:01.340> my<00:03:01.489> speed<00:03:01.730> light

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
going to put this back on my speed light

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.500 
going to put this back on my speed light

here and what I can do is on the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.520 
here and what I can do is on the
transmitter

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
transmitter

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.490

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:23.659 
there that's an 8 inch pin and then this

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.080 
there that's an 8 inch pin and then this
has<00:03:23.870> an<00:03:24.079> actual<00:03:24.349> PC<00:03:24.769> terminal<00:03:25.190> which<00:03:25.699> most

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
has an actual PC terminal which most

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.119 
has an actual PC terminal which most
modern<00:03:26.569> cameras<00:03:27.049> have<00:03:27.260> but<00:03:27.440> some<00:03:27.620> old<00:03:27.799> cameras

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
modern cameras have but some old cameras

modern cameras have but some old cameras
do<00:03:28.250> as<00:03:28.400> well<00:03:28.549> so<00:03:29.120> as<00:03:29.239> long<00:03:29.329> as<00:03:29.389> I<00:03:29.540> plug<00:03:29.750> that<00:03:29.870> in

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
do as well so as long as I plug that in

do as well so as long as I plug that in
there<00:03:30.229> now<00:03:30.739> this<00:03:31.040> is<00:03:31.250> going<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:31.549> tell<00:03:31.760> the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
there now this is going to tell the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.879 
there now this is going to tell the
transmitter<00:03:32.479> to<00:03:32.569> tell<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.079> receiver<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.709> tell

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
transmitter to tell the receiver to tell

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.399 
transmitter to tell the receiver to tell
the<00:03:34.190> flash<00:03:34.489> to<00:03:34.729> fire<00:03:34.879> and<00:03:35.239> so<00:03:35.840> it'll<00:03:36.019> work<00:03:36.049> so

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
the flash to fire and so it'll work so

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.379

I've got this all hooked up and now when
I<00:03:38.419> click<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:39.229> button<00:03:40.000> boom<00:03:41.060> there<00:03:41.629> it<00:03:41.750> goes<00:03:41.959> so

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
I click the button boom there it goes so

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.020 
I click the button boom there it goes so
I<00:03:42.829> can<00:03:42.979> do<00:03:43.069> that<00:03:43.220> over<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:43.609> over<00:03:43.639> and<00:03:43.879> this<00:03:43.970> is

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
I can do that over and over and this is

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.990 
I can do that over and over and this is
going<00:03:44.359> to<00:03:44.540> flash<00:03:45.099> works<00:03:46.099> just<00:03:46.310> fine<00:03:46.459> so<00:03:46.909> it

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
going to flash works just fine so it

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.330 
going to flash works just fine so it
works<00:03:47.209> with<00:03:47.329> older<00:03:47.829> cameras<00:03:48.829> as<00:03:48.979> well<00:03:49.159> as
