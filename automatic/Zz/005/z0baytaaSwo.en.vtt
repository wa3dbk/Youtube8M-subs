they're on a lot of goals scored I know
everyone's<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.939> criticize<00:01:36.720> me<00:01:36.930> because

everyone's going to criticize me because

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.990 
everyone's going to criticize me because
I<00:01:37.259> don't<00:01:37.409> see<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.890> as<00:01:38.040> being<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.520> beautiful

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
I don't see it as being the beautiful

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.030 
I don't see it as being the beautiful
game<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.600> I'm<00:01:39.720> from<00:01:39.930> North<00:01:40.170> America<00:01:40.740> not

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
game because I'm from North America not

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.620 
game because I'm from North America not
in<00:01:41.130> other<00:01:41.250> parts<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.759> world<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.509> know

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
in other parts of the world but I know

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.420 
in other parts of the world but I know
I'm<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.020> minority<00:01:43.110> there's<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.070> reason<00:01:44.250> why

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
I'm in the minority there's a reason why

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.830 
I'm in the minority there's a reason why
it's<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.610> most<00:01:44.759> popular<00:01:44.820> game<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.630> world

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
it's the most popular game in the world

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.539 
it's the most popular game in the world
so<00:01:46.320> maybe<00:01:46.500> that's<00:01:46.799> why<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.009> view<00:01:47.430> this

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
so maybe that's why I view this

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.730 
so maybe that's why I view this
situation<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.689> little<00:01:49.110> bit<00:01:49.320> different

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
