my dad would take me to show so I got to

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.620 
my dad would take me to show so I got to
live<00:00:38.440> through<00:00:38.800> this<00:00:38.980> whole<00:00:39.310> revolution<00:00:39.640> so

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
live through this whole revolution so

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.870 
live through this whole revolution so
close<00:00:40.930> to<00:00:41.200> it<00:00:41.320> and<00:00:41.470> it<00:00:41.650> was<00:00:41.770> a<00:00:41.800> lot<00:00:42.520> of<00:00:42.550> lucky

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
close to it and it was a lot of lucky

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.970 
close to it and it was a lot of lucky
things<00:00:43.120> not<00:00:43.630> really<00:00:43.840> intentional<00:00:44.290> now<00:00:44.860> how

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
things not really intentional now how

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.170 
things not really intentional now how
did<00:00:45.040> you<00:00:45.160> get<00:00:45.310> into<00:00:45.550> actually<00:00:45.850> building

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
did you get into actually building

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.760 
did you get into actually building
electronics<00:00:46.810> and<00:00:46.960> aided<00:00:47.230> at<00:00:47.320> an<00:00:47.440> early<00:00:47.739> age

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
electronics and aided at an early age

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.650 
electronics and aided at an early age
well<00:00:48.250> it<00:00:48.670> starts<00:00:49.000> out<00:00:49.120> with<00:00:49.239> the<00:00:49.300> normal

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
well it starts out with the normal

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.970 
well it starts out with the normal
things<00:00:49.900> you<00:00:50.020> know<00:00:50.200> I<00:00:50.230> did<00:00:50.440> my<00:00:50.530> mom<00:00:50.739> taught<00:00:50.950> me

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
things you know I did my mom taught me

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.530 
things you know I did my mom taught me
flashcards<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:51.760> I<00:00:51.850> beat<00:00:52.000> the<00:00:52.150> girls<00:00:52.270> in

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
flashcards and I beat the girls in

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.180 
flashcards and I beat the girls in
school<00:00:52.720> and<00:00:52.870> they<00:00:52.989> said<00:00:53.140> you're<00:00:53.710> good<00:00:53.890> at<00:00:54.010> math

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
school and they said you're good at math

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.069 
school and they said you're good at math
you<00:00:54.489> know<00:00:54.610> and<00:00:54.790> so<00:00:55.030> I<00:00:55.060> decided<00:00:55.630> in<00:00:55.780> third<00:00:55.930> grade

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
you know and so I decided in third grade

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.170 
you know and so I decided in third grade
I'm<00:00:56.320> good<00:00:56.500> at<00:00:56.590> math<00:00:56.800> and<00:00:57.070> then<00:00:57.520> my<00:00:58.000> father

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
I'm good at math and then my father

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.460 
I'm good at math and then my father
helped<00:00:58.420> me<00:00:58.510> with<00:00:58.630> science<00:00:58.780> fair<00:00:59.050> projects

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
helped me with science fair projects

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.470 
helped me with science fair projects
that<00:00:59.590> involved<00:00:59.890> electronics<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:00.610> some<00:01:01.360> of

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
that involved electronics and some of

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.479 
that involved electronics and some of
those<00:01:01.540> became<00:01:01.899> very<00:01:02.290> extreme<00:01:02.800> in<00:01:02.950> fifth<00:01:03.220> grade

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
those became very extreme in fifth grade

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.999 
those became very extreme in fifth grade
sixth<00:01:04.000> grade<00:01:04.239> sixth<00:01:04.960> grade<00:01:05.110> guy<00:01:05.290> I<00:01:05.320> had

these sort of things were done and in
high<00:02:52.900> school<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.470> discovered<00:02:54.190> we<00:02:54.970> didn't<00:02:55.209> have

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
high school I discovered we didn't have

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.790 
high school I discovered we didn't have
computer<00:02:55.720> in<00:02:55.780> our<00:02:55.870> high<00:02:55.989> school<00:02:56.230> my

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
computer in our high school my

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.890 
computer in our high school my
electronics<00:02:57.400> teacher<00:02:57.550> said<00:02:57.880> most<00:02:58.720> of<00:02:58.810> the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
electronics teacher said most of the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.690 
electronics teacher said most of the
teachers<00:02:59.110> say<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.560> education<00:03:00.280> is<00:03:00.340> in<00:03:00.520> our

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
teachers say that education is in our

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.220 
teachers say that education is in our
school<00:03:01.000> what<00:03:01.300> we<00:03:01.390> have<00:03:01.540> in<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.720> class<00:03:01.900> what<00:03:02.140> we

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
school what we have in the class what we

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.660 
school what we have in the class what we
have<00:03:02.380> in<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.560> school<00:03:02.800> that's<00:03:03.220> what<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.520> get

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
have in the school that's what you get

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.520 
have in the school that's what you get
well<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:04.209> teacher<00:03:04.450> went<00:03:04.840> outside<00:03:05.050> like<00:03:05.500> a

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
well this teacher went outside like a

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.260 
well this teacher went outside like a
few<00:03:05.770> teachers<00:03:05.920> do<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.489> got<00:03:06.670> me<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:06.970> go<00:03:07.090> down

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
few teachers do and got me to go down

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.630 
few teachers do and got me to go down
once<00:03:07.570> a<00:03:07.690> week<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:08.290> program<00:03:08.830> a<00:03:08.860> computer<00:03:09.160> at

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
once a week to program a computer at

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.790 
once a week to program a computer at
Sylvania<00:03:10.239> in<00:03:10.360> sunnyvale<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.080> I<00:03:11.470> would<00:03:11.650> go

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
Sylvania in sunnyvale and I would go

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.650 
Sylvania in sunnyvale and I would go
down<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.220> write<00:03:12.430> these<00:03:12.580> programs<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.480> it

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
down and write these programs and it

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.449 
down and write these programs and it
just<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:13.930> was<00:03:14.050> just<00:03:14.080> so<00:03:14.350> much<00:03:14.500> fun<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:15.190> one

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
just it was just so much fun the one

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.800 
just it was just so much fun the one
thing<00:03:15.580> I<00:03:15.670> thought<00:03:15.850> was<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.030> computer<00:03:16.510> can<00:03:16.660> do<00:03:16.780> a

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
thing I thought was a computer can do a

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.900 
thing I thought was a computer can do a
million<00:03:17.140> things<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.560> second<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.070> humans<00:03:18.700> could

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
million things a second and humans could

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.120 
million things a second and humans could
never<00:03:19.209> ever<00:03:19.330> do<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.750> sort<00:03:20.080> of<00:03:20.170> thing<00:03:20.230> my<00:03:20.799> gosh

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
never ever do that sort of thing my gosh

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.039 
never ever do that sort of thing my gosh
what<00:03:21.430> power<00:03:21.700> I<00:03:21.880> have<00:03:22.060> in<00:03:22.209> my<00:03:22.330> hands<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:22.750> I

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
what power I have in my hands and I

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.750 
what power I have in my hands and I
wrote<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.260> program<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.920> jump<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.280> night<00:03:24.489> around

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
wrote a program to jump a night around

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.759 
wrote a program to jump a night around
the<00:03:24.910> chessboard<00:03:25.150> every<00:03:25.810> square<00:03:26.110> exactly<00:03:26.590> once

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
the chessboard every square exactly once

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.800 
the chessboard every square exactly once
and<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.670> program<00:03:27.910> never<00:03:28.209> finished<00:03:28.600> and<00:03:28.780> I

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
and the program never finished and I

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.509 
and the program never finished and I
learned<00:03:29.019> about<00:03:29.080> loops<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.070> came<00:03:30.310> back<00:03:30.340> and

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
learned about loops and I came back and

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:31.979 
learned about loops and I came back and
I<00:03:30.760> printed<00:03:31.030> out<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.299> chess<00:03:31.480> boards<00:03:31.750> as<00:03:31.870> it

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
I printed out the chess boards as it

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.600 
I printed out the chess boards as it
played<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.739> I<00:03:32.799> found<00:03:32.980> out<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.280> was<00:03:33.370> doing

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
played and I found out it was doing

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.190 
played and I found out it was doing
exactly<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.269> right<00:03:34.299> thing<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.810> solve<00:03:35.049> the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
exactly the right thing to solve the

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.930 
exactly the right thing to solve the
problem<00:03:35.620> but<00:03:35.950> it<00:03:36.070> was<00:03:36.190> going<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.400> take<00:03:36.549> 10<00:03:36.820> to

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
problem but it was going to take 10 to

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.060 
problem but it was going to take 10 to
the<00:03:37.000> 25th<00:03:37.420> years<00:03:37.870> which<00:03:38.440> is<00:03:38.470> longer<00:03:38.799> than<00:03:39.010> the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
the 25th years which is longer than the

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.880 
the 25th years which is longer than the
universe<00:03:39.459> has<00:03:39.730> existed<00:03:40.209> so<00:03:40.750> I<00:03:40.780> learned<00:03:41.620> that

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
universe has existed so I learned that

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.530 
universe has existed so I learned that
day<00:03:42.100> that<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:42.549> know<00:03:42.670> what<00:03:42.880> speed<00:03:43.330> of<00:03:43.480> a

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
day that you know what speed of a

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.520 
day that you know what speed of a
computer<00:03:43.780> doesn't<00:03:44.170> make<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.380> whole

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
computer doesn't make the whole

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.990 
computer doesn't make the whole
difference<00:03:44.829> you<00:03:44.980> need<00:03:45.130> smart<00:03:45.430> approaches<00:03:45.730> to

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
difference you need smart approaches to

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.479 
difference you need smart approaches to
solving<00:03:46.570> these<00:03:46.840> problems<00:03:47.019> now<00:03:47.829> I<00:03:47.860> didn't<00:03:48.310> have

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
solving these problems now I didn't have

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.039 
solving these problems now I didn't have
a<00:03:48.519> computer<00:03:48.730> my<00:03:49.120> own<00:03:49.269> but<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.510> discovered<00:03:49.989> a

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
a computer my own but I discovered a

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.780 
a computer my own but I discovered a
manual<00:03:50.470> down<00:03:50.650> at<00:03:50.769> Sylvania<00:03:51.280> called<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.579> small

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
manual down at Sylvania called the small

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.580 
manual down at Sylvania called the small
computer<00:03:51.970> handbook<00:03:52.540> it<00:03:52.900> described<00:03:53.470> the

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
computer handbook it described the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.960 
computer handbook it described the
architecture<00:03:54.220> of<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.370> computer<00:03:54.700> the

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
architecture of a computer the

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.340 
architecture of a computer the
architecture<00:03:55.450> is<00:03:55.510> like<00:03:55.630> the<00:03:55.750> architecture<00:03:56.320> of

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
architecture is like the architecture of

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.050 
architecture is like the architecture of
a<00:03:56.440> house<00:03:56.590> say<00:03:57.220> you<00:03:57.280> had<00:03:57.519> a<00:03:57.549> diagram<00:03:57.940> that

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
a house say you had a diagram that

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.340 
a house say you had a diagram that
described<00:03:58.420> where<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.720> rooms<00:03:58.900> were<00:03:59.079> where<00:03:59.260> the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
described where the rooms were where the

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.539 
described where the rooms were where the
doors<00:03:59.590> were<00:03:59.769> where<00:03:59.920> the<00:03:59.980> cabinets<00:04:00.370> were<00:04:00.430> in

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
doors were where the cabinets were in

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.370 
doors were where the cabinets were in
all<00:04:00.640> this<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.000> then<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:01.600> have<00:04:01.780> all<00:04:02.019> of<00:04:02.260> the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
all this and then you have all of the

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.050 
all this and then you have all of the
lumber<00:04:02.829> pieces<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.459> you<00:04:03.519> know<00:04:03.640> how<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:03.820> put

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
lumber pieces and you know how to put

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.880 
lumber pieces and you know how to put
them<00:04:04.150> together<00:04:04.329> very<00:04:04.840> well<00:04:04.900> and<00:04:05.260> saw<00:04:05.709> them

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
them together very well and saw them

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.440 
them together very well and saw them
into<00:04:06.070> the<00:04:06.160> right<00:04:06.280> shapes<00:04:06.579> you<00:04:06.850> could<00:04:07.060> build<00:04:07.269> a

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
into the right shapes you could build a

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.390 
into the right shapes you could build a
house<00:04:07.630> out<00:04:07.840> of<00:04:07.900> lumber<00:04:08.350> well<00:04:08.799> to<00:04:08.950> me<00:04:09.100> the

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
house out of lumber well to me the

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.430 
house out of lumber well to me the
architecture<00:04:09.970> of<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.090> computer<00:04:10.420> describes<00:04:11.079> the

computer basically and then I knew the

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.569 
computer basically and then I knew the
chips<00:04:14.350> and<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.590> parts<00:04:14.980> that<00:04:15.040> made<00:04:15.310> it<00:04:15.459> the

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
chips and the parts that made it the

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.370 
chips and the parts that made it the
logic<00:04:15.940> gates<00:04:16.090> from<00:04:16.269> my<00:04:16.479> science<00:04:17.200> fair<00:04:17.260> project

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
logic gates from my science fair project

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.530 
logic gates from my science fair project
so<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.160> started<00:04:18.430> sitting<00:04:18.609> down<00:04:18.790> on<00:04:18.940> paper<00:04:19.120> all

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
so I started sitting down on paper all

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.630 
so I started sitting down on paper all
alone<00:04:20.109> in<00:04:20.320> my<00:04:20.350> room<00:04:20.500> not<00:04:20.919> with<00:04:21.040> my<00:04:21.190> father<00:04:21.430> not

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
alone in my room not with my father not

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.830 
alone in my room not with my father not
with<00:04:21.760> friends<00:04:22.030> not<00:04:22.120> with<00:04:22.270> teachers<00:04:22.540> nobody

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
with friends not with teachers nobody

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.990 
with friends not with teachers nobody
else<00:04:22.960> knew<00:04:23.140> what<00:04:23.260> this<00:04:23.350> was<00:04:23.410> I<00:04:23.770> just<00:04:24.370> love<00:04:24.729> to

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
else knew what this was I just love to

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.610 
else knew what this was I just love to
figure<00:04:25.270> out<00:04:25.419> how<00:04:25.840> do<00:04:25.900> you<00:04:26.050> put<00:04:26.289> these<00:04:26.440> together

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
figure out how do you put these together

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.920 
figure out how do you put these together
to<00:04:26.979> design<00:04:27.130> a<00:04:27.280> computer<00:04:27.789> so<00:04:28.390> it<00:04:28.450> was<00:04:28.570> totally

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
to design a computer so it was totally

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:29.780 
to design a computer so it was totally
self-taught<00:04:29.289> no

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
self-taught no

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.490 
self-taught no
or<00:04:29.940> anything<00:04:30.240> and<00:04:30.510> I<00:04:30.570> tried<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.080> once<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.440> it

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
or anything and I tried it once and it

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.020 
or anything and I tried it once and it
took<00:04:31.650> many<00:04:31.830> pages<00:04:32.130> and<00:04:32.400> it<00:04:32.460> wasn't<00:04:32.730> complete

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
took many pages and it wasn't complete

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.430 
took many pages and it wasn't complete
and<00:04:33.180> wasn't<00:04:33.390> going<00:04:33.510> to<00:04:33.570> work<00:04:33.690> I<00:04:33.900> got<00:04:34.290> an<00:04:34.380> idea

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
and wasn't going to work I got an idea

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.170 
and wasn't going to work I got an idea
later<00:04:34.770> on<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:35.130> some<00:04:35.280> better<00:04:35.460> chips<00:04:35.760> came<00:04:36.000> out

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
later on and some better chips came out

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.880 
later on and some better chips came out
my<00:04:36.570> father<00:04:36.810> kept<00:04:37.050> supplying<00:04:37.410> me<00:04:37.560> the<00:04:37.680> better

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
my father kept supplying me the better

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.830 
my father kept supplying me the better
chip<00:04:38.190> manuals<00:04:38.610> is<00:04:38.730> the<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.180> chip<00:04:39.420> companies

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
chip manuals is the the chip companies

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.840 
chip manuals is the the chip companies
develop<00:04:40.230> better<00:04:40.410> and<00:04:40.650> better<00:04:40.830> parts<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.430> then

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
develop better and better parts and then

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.820 
develop better and better parts and then
I<00:04:41.880> sat<00:04:41.970> down<00:04:42.180> tried<00:04:42.570> to<00:04:42.690> design<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.440> computer

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
I sat down tried to design the computer

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.350 
I sat down tried to design the computer
again<00:04:44.010> I<00:04:44.190> got<00:04:44.400> one<00:04:44.610> designed<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:45.120> thought

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
again I got one designed I thought

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.330 
again I got one designed I thought
pretty<00:04:45.630> completely<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.410> then<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:46.890> learned<00:04:47.130> how

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
pretty completely and then I learned how

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.950 
pretty completely and then I learned how
to<00:04:47.400> get<00:04:47.550> manuals<00:04:48.120> for<00:04:48.240> all<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.450> computers<00:04:48.870> i

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
to get manuals for all the computers i

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.330 
to get manuals for all the computers i
would<00:04:49.110> go<00:04:49.230> down<00:04:49.350> to<00:04:49.560> Stanford<00:04:50.250> Linear

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
would go down to Stanford Linear

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.220 
would go down to Stanford Linear
Accelerator<00:04:50.520> Center<00:04:51.030> because<00:04:51.960> a<00:04:51.990> lot<00:04:52.200> of

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
Accelerator Center because a lot of

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.660 
Accelerator Center because a lot of
smart<00:04:52.560> people<00:04:52.590> work<00:04:53.070> there<00:04:53.280> they<00:04:53.430> always

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
smart people work there they always

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.400 
smart people work there they always
leave<00:04:53.820> doors<00:04:54.090> open<00:04:54.450> so<00:04:54.870> I<00:04:54.900> get<00:04:55.140> into<00:04:55.320> the

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
leave doors open so I get into the

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.070 
leave doors open so I get into the
library<00:04:55.950> I<00:04:56.190> would<00:04:57.060> get<00:04:57.180> into<00:04:57.390> the<00:04:57.480> library<00:04:57.930> on

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
library I would get into the library on

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.870 
library I would get into the library on
Sundays<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:58.890> would<00:04:59.040> read<00:04:59.370> computer

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
Sundays and I would read computer

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.480 
Sundays and I would read computer
magazines<00:05:00.570> and<00:05:00.780> I<00:05:01.050> could<00:05:01.260> order<00:05:01.500> manuals<00:05:02.370> for

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
magazines and I could order manuals for

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.280 
magazines and I could order manuals for
computers<00:05:02.940> so<00:05:03.120> I<00:05:03.360> would<00:05:03.600> order<00:05:03.720> manuals<00:05:04.170> for

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
computers so I would order manuals for

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.570 
computers so I would order manuals for
hewlett-packard<00:05:04.560> computers<00:05:05.250> Varian

and<00:05:08.910> when<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.270> manuals<00:05:09.690> came<00:05:09.930> eventually<00:05:10.290> I

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
and when the manuals came eventually I

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.990 
and when the manuals came eventually I
would<00:05:10.740> sit<00:05:10.980> down<00:05:11.010> one<00:05:11.370> day<00:05:11.400> and<00:05:11.550> look<00:05:11.790> at<00:05:11.910> the

would sit down one day and look at the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.030 
would sit down one day and look at the
architecture<00:05:12.330> of<00:05:12.690> the<00:05:12.780> computer<00:05:13.230> and<00:05:13.380> use<00:05:13.860> my

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
architecture of the computer and use my

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.560 
architecture of the computer and use my
chip<00:05:14.370> ability<00:05:14.940> which<00:05:15.060> was<00:05:15.180> getting<00:05:15.390> better

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
chip ability which was getting better

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.030 
chip ability which was getting better
and<00:05:15.720> better<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:16.110> combine<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.680> chips<00:05:16.890> together

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
and better to combine the chips together

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.550 
and better to combine the chips together
that<00:05:17.610> would<00:05:17.730> make<00:05:17.970> that<00:05:18.150> computer<00:05:18.630> now<00:05:19.200> after

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
that would make that computer now after

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.050 
that would make that computer now after
I<00:05:19.590> got<00:05:19.800> bored<00:05:20.160> this<00:05:20.460> is<00:05:20.610> going<00:05:20.790> through<00:05:20.970> my

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
I got bored this is going through my

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.280 
I got bored this is going through my
senior<00:05:21.360> year<00:05:21.390> of<00:05:21.510> high<00:05:21.690> school<00:05:21.720> I'm<00:05:22.020> getting

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
senior year of high school I'm getting

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.690 
senior year of high school I'm getting
bored<00:05:22.440> with<00:05:22.560> nothing<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:22.980> do<00:05:23.130> any<00:05:23.310> weekend

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
bored with nothing to do any weekend

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.390 
bored with nothing to do any weekend
I'll<00:05:23.880> sit<00:05:24.390> down<00:05:24.570> and<00:05:24.780> try<00:05:24.900> to<00:05:24.990> redesign<00:05:25.830> the

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
I'll sit down and try to redesign the

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.060 
I'll sit down and try to redesign the
same<00:05:26.700> computer<00:05:27.180> with<00:05:27.540> fewer<00:05:27.930> parts<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.500> made<00:05:29.040> up

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
same computer with fewer parts I made up

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.160 
same computer with fewer parts I made up
the<00:05:29.250> game<00:05:29.430> it<00:05:30.000> was<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.210> challenge<00:05:30.660> with<00:05:30.780> myself

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
the game it was a challenge with myself

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.870 
the game it was a challenge with myself
so<00:05:31.380> I<00:05:31.560> was<00:05:31.800> competing<00:05:32.070> with<00:05:32.220> myself<00:05:32.730> and

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
so I was competing with myself and

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.280 
so I was competing with myself and
that's<00:05:33.180> where<00:05:33.510> I<00:05:33.540> really<00:05:33.870> honed<00:05:34.080> my<00:05:34.260> skills

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
that's where I really honed my skills

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.380 
that's where I really honed my skills
and<00:05:34.800> got<00:05:35.160> so<00:05:35.340> good<00:05:35.520> at<00:05:35.580> it<00:05:35.700> that<00:05:35.820> eventually<00:05:36.360> I

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
and got so good at it that eventually I

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.970 
and got so good at it that eventually I
