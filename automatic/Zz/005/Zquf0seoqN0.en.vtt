00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.740
 indaiatuba it's good to have our page 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.890
 also on facebook 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.009
 and then everything and these channels of communication 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.150
 You'll know everything, but it 's good. 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.360
 It's in this video I'm going to talk about surdina 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.369
 You're here, it's not a lot. 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.479
 people came here 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.640
 in surdina surdina this little thing that the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.259
 People put it here in the box here at 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.759
 violin one little piece that in a few 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.780
 rubber urine 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.869
 It's good for the surdina people. 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.009
 this one in particular is one that arises from 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.890
 orchestra 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.289
 It's okay for anyone who plays in an orchestra. 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.910
 for anyone who plays in the church orchestra 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.520
 this is not to use here 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.490
 My church party okay people to 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.650
 not be like the churches that make 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.400
 repertory you have written there with 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.310
 muted pa why that uses muted 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.310
 because it changes the tone of the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.510
 instrument is on a violin of your 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.830
 here touch you do not see you do not have 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:38.970
 difference 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:39.780
 the difference is very small and there is little 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.860
 difference 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.290
 It sure does not make any difference. 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.750
 practically a violin but at the time 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.750
 We are talking about 20 violins in a 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.390
 orchestra playing time that changes the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.580
 timbre hockey then had composers 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.850
 who wrote crisis arts said that if 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.830
 inscribed there with surdina nÃ© sometimes 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.990
 generally the second movement of 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.510
 some parts do not have the 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.910
 to consume then everyone puts that 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.100
 to hear a different sound a tone 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.870
 different from that instrument for this 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.540
 that serves as an orchestra 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.490
 Well, then, if you have iron or 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.050
 coming from wood that it is placed 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.050
 on the easel 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.350
 It's good for you to see more about the 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.720
 urns have a video there from the channel friends 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.709
 violinists they talk about 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.600
 coming up he explains there paulo explains 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.670
 several dedicated popping up and put shows 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.530
 play for you see the difference of each sound 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.480
 Okay, I 'm not here with the 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.550
 common study for you to see 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.150
 We later emerged from study 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.520
 which is a tactical wood in it enters 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.290
 in the easel here it already suffocates well 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.180
 more surgery, and that the staff at the 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.580
 often times do what the polls to 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.300
 Sometimes they're so cheap, it 's a preacher. 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.580
 clothes 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.680
 the employer of clothes who preached in his 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.470
 because they happen safe and 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.150
 vibration of the easel and the sound 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.830
 still soft for you to study 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.020
 night if you do not have surdina is 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.200
 tip for you to do with preachers of 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.150
 clothes look a little strange but it breaks the 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.940
 twig they can buy sullen and have 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.280
 arisen of iron that muffles much and it is only 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.560
 you can study at night to finally 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.350
 each visit to the channel 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.140
 of their violinist friends has a video 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.330
 Obs surdina it's good if I can give 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.730
 right or by a link below for you 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.980
 You go in there and give an assisted 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.480
 in this video and what I have to say 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:36.390
 For you people, please do not touch. 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.480
 So surmise in church if it is not for 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:43.050
 playing gets ugly people because they do not have to 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.090
 that I see I also play in the church 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.520
 sometimes I get to church I see dude 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.010
 with an emerging the orchestra 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.740
 once I've seen the guy playing 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.690
 church like lost wood people 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.090
 dreaming wood I searched the internet 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.650
 as this does not fit a piece of 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.040
 wood of this size almost the size of 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:05.250
 easel for you to play with 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.830
 sings in your church's orchestra 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.290
 so no explanation understood 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.230
 is ugly it is for those who do not know 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.400
 you might even draw attention but the 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.030
 people do this to get attention 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:21.030
 and put there everybody is talking civil 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.900
 He's got a deal - they're my god. 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.480
 from the sky 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.240
 We do not do it, it 's not ugly, it's okay. 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.440
 No, because I like the sound more. 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.390
 so lie 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.220
 no one likes to have the sound play a sound 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.170
 the lower it is for who will play sometimes 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.390
 on the road staff plays very strong until 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.100
 some churches for which there is a 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.110
 coming up I still keep file 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.250
 so there's no reason why we should 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.980
 any person any professional 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.760
 Anyone who knows a little bit 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.740
 more 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.360
 You'll know and then you'll pass. 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.300
 shame no one will come to you and 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.560
 Speak thus Look do not put you down 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.020
 Just for whoever wants, nobody will. 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.970
 to teach everyone is talking 1-0 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.520
 on that face my sky god covers 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.370
 coming up then this tip is on people 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.210
 do not use surdina if you do not need 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.610
 too tim 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:09.210
 It's good to watch the personal side video of 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.310
 pablo violinist friends he speaks well of 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.200
 each of the stores shows a 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.360
 Pretty good video, have a look there. 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.290
 you will know the sound of each surdina 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.660
 that makes 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.970
 It's good if you liked that I did not like it 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.350
 Did not like it, click did not like it. 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.430
 leave your comment by saying why 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:28.070
 did not you like it 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.070
 Thank you so much until the next
