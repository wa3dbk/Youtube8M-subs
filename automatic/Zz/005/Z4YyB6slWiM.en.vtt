 the morning when I am awake 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.460

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.090

 then I pack my makeup my daily 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.649
 products are simply in toilet bags 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.989

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.120
 bathroom i put the clothes here that i 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.320

 Normally I only do it in the evening 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.609
 weekends I pick up the morning 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.609

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.610
 and when I finish showering I pack my 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.740
 dress up and dress with today 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.690
 this checkered blouse from the sitecom 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.610
 with fashion point com that is really super 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.800
 comfortable sitting i have a house this 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.170
 dark blue jeans on the van 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.030
 piÃ¨ces and and we have super fancy 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.460
 those are just about that whole 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.740
 sit very nicely then I will prepare myself 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.120
 I always put some music on this on 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.000
 currently one of my favorite 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.720
 numbers and then it's time to up 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.860
 to make 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.690
 first I use one 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.000
 eyebrow pencil of the hema 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.010
 yes that color the eyebrows 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.300
 I don't really have a special technique for that 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.160
 but that makes the eyebrow something 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.479
 darker and I think that's one myself 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.160
 look nice then I will continue with my 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.410
 I currently use the eyeliner 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.960
 essence super fine eyeliner in black 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.400
 which I really enjoy working in 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.440
 it really just simply one 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.119
 line no dean or what they fuss then 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.130
 also because I often have to leave the house early 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.260
 and i just don't have time to get one 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.260
 make up very extensively 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.840
 the mascara that I use is this of the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.520
 leclercq also in black 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.710

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.700

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.040
 under my eyes applicator 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.990

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.990
 and finally I just got my hair 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.360

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.770

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.260

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.849
 and this is a very refreshing and 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.329
 airy scent that is really perfect for 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.329
 during the day 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.420

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.319
