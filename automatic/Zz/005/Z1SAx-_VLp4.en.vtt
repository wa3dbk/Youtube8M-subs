00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.919
 If you click on low 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.439
 so not that big 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.769
 it's a no 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.769
 however for all the others as 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.859

 You are that fast. 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:55.529
 it's very practical 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:57.059
 and soon 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:59.669
 the program will already be there 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:00.930
 in my computer 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.859

 the product - was purchased 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:09.539

 but you can put your hand in a document phase 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:15.489
 even the world 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.209
 marine 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.019
 super downloads to the end 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.149

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:23.559
 I already have my show with me 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:26.559

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.709
 when you open the post of 20% you count that the first in the first item o 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.409
 second and third 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.179

 You liked it so much, you put it on. 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.799
 a computer driving 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.799
 laying there 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.059
 in the life in which the name of the group appears 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:05.309
 your official civic name section of the second but do not need 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:09.069
 bet you want to save this program you choose here 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:13.539

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:17.249
 Let's try next month. 

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.650

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.889
 schematic of one of these modification dimensions 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:27.219

 team, there must be cuts in spending 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.800
 and this one like the one that tells the game I think it starts 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.749
 then you will not see that 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.749
 bmg until it starts to be recorded 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:50.740
 will start to be recorded 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.740
 is a very practical and simple curriculum 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.939
 so you record and follow me 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:00.409
