00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.850 
through on the first pass that just kind
of<00:02:43.420> put<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.450> slight<00:02:44.959> profile<00:02:45.410> in<00:02:45.620> there<00:02:45.740> we're

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
of put a slight profile in there we're

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.290 
of put a slight profile in there we're
going<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.040> come<00:02:46.220> back<00:02:46.340> here<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.790> take<00:02:47.120> off

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
going to come back here and take off

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.840 
going to come back here and take off
this<00:02:47.480> last<00:02:47.780> little<00:02:48.110> bit<00:02:48.410> here<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.920> make<00:02:49.820> a

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
this last little bit here to make a

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.330 
this last little bit here to make a
match<00:02:50.090> up<00:02:50.360> with<00:02:50.540> what<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.750> needed<00:02:50.990> but<00:02:51.380> I<00:02:51.620> have

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
match up with what I needed but I have

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.740 
match up with what I needed but I have
to<00:02:52.520> shoving<00:02:52.970> all<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.270> through<00:02:53.450> there<00:02:53.600> by

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
to shoving all that through there by

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.160 
to shoving all that through there by
hand

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
hand

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.740 
hand
I<00:02:54.290> bought<00:02:54.980> this<00:02:55.190> power<00:02:55.760> feeder<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.180> while<00:02:56.450> ago

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
I bought this power feeder a while ago

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.210 
I bought this power feeder a while ago
and<00:02:56.959> never<00:02:57.050> got<00:02:57.320> around<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.650> mounting<00:02:58.040> it<00:02:58.130> on

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
and never got around to mounting it on

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.210 
and never got around to mounting it on
here<00:02:58.489> so<00:02:58.519> I<00:02:58.760> just<00:02:58.820> went<00:02:59.090> ahead<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.330> mounted<00:02:59.750> it

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
here so I just went ahead and mounted it

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.300 
here so I just went ahead and mounted it
really<00:03:01.220> simple<00:03:01.580> you<00:03:02.000> just<00:03:02.030> need<00:03:02.209> a<00:03:03.160> tap<00:03:04.160> and

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
really simple you just need a tap and

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.910 
really simple you just need a tap and
die<00:03:04.400> just<00:03:04.790> drill<00:03:05.269> it<00:03:05.420> bolt<00:03:06.410> it<00:03:06.560> down<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.830> the

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
die just drill it bolt it down to the

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.130 
die just drill it bolt it down to the
top<00:03:07.100> here<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.550> that's<00:03:08.420> really<00:03:08.750> all<00:03:08.959> you<00:03:09.110> need

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
top here and that's really all you need

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.770 
top here and that's really all you need
to<00:03:09.350> do<00:03:09.500> I<00:03:09.709> mean<00:03:09.860> it's<00:03:10.010> super<00:03:10.130> easy<00:03:10.780> on/off

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
to do I mean it's super easy on/off

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.430 
to do I mean it's super easy on/off
forward<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:12.560> reverse<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:15.110> cool<00:03:15.410> thing

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
forward and reverse and the cool thing

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.050 
forward and reverse and the cool thing
about<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:15.950> power<00:03:16.070> feeder<00:03:16.370> now<00:03:16.640> you<00:03:16.700> can<00:03:16.970> just

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
about the power feeder now you can just

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.100 
about the power feeder now you can just
stick<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.390> lid<00:03:17.510> in<00:03:17.630> there<00:03:17.780> and<00:03:17.989> it<00:03:18.080> just

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
stick the lid in there and it just

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.199 
stick the lid in there and it just
pushes<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:18.620> through<00:03:18.739> really<00:03:19.670> even<00:03:19.940> it's<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.120> lot

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
pushes it through really even it's a lot

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.580 
pushes it through really even it's a lot
more<00:03:20.390> consistent<00:03:20.930> than<00:03:21.019> doing<00:03:21.230> it<00:03:21.290> by<00:03:21.410> hand

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
more consistent than doing it by hand

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.140 
more consistent than doing it by hand
and<00:03:21.830> a<00:03:21.860> whole<00:03:21.950> lot<00:03:22.130> less<00:03:22.310> work<00:03:22.580> so<00:03:22.850> let<00:03:22.970> me<00:03:23.030> go

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
and a whole lot less work so let me go

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.870 
and a whole lot less work so let me go
ahead<00:03:23.239> and<00:03:23.410> stuff<00:03:24.410> some<00:03:24.680> wood<00:03:25.190> through<00:03:25.519> the

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
ahead and stuff some wood through the

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:53.940 
ahead and stuff some wood through the
shaper<00:03:26.209> table<00:03:26.480> here<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.870> let<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:27.320> see<00:03:27.470> that

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.210 

okay<00:03:54.670> so<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.970> power<00:03:55.120> feeder<00:03:55.450> made<00:03:55.720> this

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
okay so the power feeder made this

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.580 
okay so the power feeder made this
incredibly<00:03:57.220> fast<00:03:57.490> I<00:03:57.989> want<00:03:58.989> to<00:03:59.140> show<00:03:59.319> you<00:03:59.380> this

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
incredibly fast I want to show you this

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.180 
incredibly fast I want to show you this
setup<00:03:59.890> here<00:04:00.220> works<00:04:00.459> really<00:04:01.060> well<00:04:01.420> in<00:04:02.349> the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
setup here works really well in the

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.070 
setup here works really well in the
video<00:04:03.430> I<00:04:03.489> shot<00:04:03.849> with<00:04:04.030> this<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.480> was<00:04:04.630> on<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.930> low

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
video I shot with this it was on the low

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.050 
video I shot with this it was on the low
speed<00:04:05.140> setting<00:04:05.920> I<00:04:06.069> subsequently<00:04:06.670> turned<00:04:06.910> it

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
speed setting I subsequently turned it

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.820 
speed setting I subsequently turned it
to<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.180> higher<00:04:07.420> speed<00:04:07.780> setting<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.349> it<00:04:08.440> moves

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
to the higher speed setting and it moves

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.890 
to the higher speed setting and it moves
probably<00:04:09.520> double<00:04:09.880> that<00:04:10.030> speed<00:04:10.360> we're<00:04:10.750> just

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
probably double that speed we're just

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.590 
probably double that speed we're just
rocked<00:04:11.290> through<00:04:11.590> it<00:04:11.739> really<00:04:12.100> quickly<00:04:12.600> really

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
rocked through it really quickly really

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.030 
rocked through it really quickly really
like<00:04:13.780> this<00:04:13.959> setup<00:04:14.230> I've<00:04:14.530> got<00:04:14.830> one<00:04:14.920> of<00:04:14.980> these

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
like this setup I've got one of these

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.250 
like this setup I've got one of these
magnetic<00:04:15.550> ones<00:04:15.730> or<00:04:15.970> magnetic<00:04:16.389> anti-kickback

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
magnetic ones or magnetic anti-kickback

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.920 
magnetic ones or magnetic anti-kickback
deals<00:04:17.769> here<00:04:18.160> or<00:04:18.340> feather<00:04:19.150> board<00:04:19.450> there<00:04:19.690> we<00:04:19.810> go

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
deals here or feather board there we go

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.830 
deals here or feather board there we go
I'll<00:04:20.200> spit<00:04:20.799> out<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:21.010> right<00:04:21.160> thing<00:04:21.190> but<00:04:22.090> it

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
I'll spit out the right thing but it

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.230 
I'll spit out the right thing but it
kind<00:04:23.050> of<00:04:23.200> positions<00:04:23.680> it<00:04:23.830> up<00:04:23.950> in<00:04:24.160> here<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:24.580> then

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
kind of positions it up in here and then

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.240 
kind of positions it up in here and then
the<00:04:25.450> the<00:04:25.750> way<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:25.960> rollers<00:04:26.320> are<00:04:26.530> on<00:04:26.770> here<00:04:27.100> it

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
the the way the rollers are on here it

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.950 
the the way the rollers are on here it
pushes<00:04:27.610> it<00:04:27.729> up<00:04:27.820> against<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.300> fence<00:04:28.540> and<00:04:28.780> just

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
pushes it up against the fence and just

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.900 
pushes it up against the fence and just
really<00:04:29.440> rocks<00:04:29.710> it<00:04:29.950> on<00:04:30.070> through<00:04:30.370> so<00:04:30.580> that<00:04:30.729> works

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
really rocks it on through so that works

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.050 
really rocks it on through so that works
out<00:04:31.060> really<00:04:31.270> well<00:04:32.010> but<00:04:33.010> yeah<00:04:33.700> we<00:04:33.880> made<00:04:34.030> a

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
out really well but yeah we made a

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.300 
out really well but yeah we made a
bucket<00:04:34.419> full<00:04:34.570> of<00:04:34.690> sawdust<00:04:35.110> here<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:35.500> her

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
bucket full of sawdust here and her

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.430 
bucket full of sawdust here and her
trash<00:04:36.580> can<00:04:36.820> full<00:04:37.000> of<00:04:37.090> sawdust<00:04:37.479> rather<00:04:37.720> it's

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
trash can full of sawdust rather it's

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.659 
trash can full of sawdust rather it's
been<00:04:38.590> a<00:04:38.620> long<00:04:38.800> day<00:04:38.979> I'm<00:04:39.160> not<00:04:39.280> really<00:04:39.460> talking

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
been a long day I'm not really talking

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.090 
been a long day I'm not really talking
very<00:04:39.940> well<00:04:40.120> but<00:04:40.300> I<00:04:40.330> think<00:04:40.419> we've<00:04:40.660> pretty<00:04:41.100> come

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
very well but I think we've pretty come

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.200 
very well but I think we've pretty come
pretty<00:04:42.370> close<00:04:42.639> there<00:04:42.910> to<00:04:43.030> matching<00:04:43.270> up<00:04:43.630> to<00:04:43.840> our

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
pretty close there to matching up to our

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.180 
pretty close there to matching up to our
original<00:04:46.210> siding<00:04:46.419> so<00:04:46.870> I'm<00:04:47.320> quite<00:04:47.889> happy<00:04:48.010> about

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
original siding so I'm quite happy about

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.570 
original siding so I'm quite happy about
