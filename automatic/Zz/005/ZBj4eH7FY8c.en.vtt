this<00:03:37.350> year<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.860> California<00:03:38.400> this<00:03:38.519> year<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:38.940> to

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
this year to California this year and to

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.140 
this year to California this year and to
New<00:03:39.810> York<00:03:40.019> and<00:03:40.290> then<00:03:41.190> I<00:03:41.250> looked<00:03:41.579> well<00:03:42.120> I

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
New York and then I looked well I

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.750 
New York and then I looked well I
thought<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:43.230> it's<00:03:43.410> like<00:03:43.650> that's<00:03:44.010> like<00:03:44.280> four

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
thought that it's like that's like four

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.660 
thought that it's like that's like four
three<00:03:45.660> of<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.870> four<00:03:46.109> main<00:03:46.440> corners<00:03:46.980> of

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
three of the four main corners of

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.900 
three of the four main corners of
America<00:03:48.209> so<00:03:48.450> I<00:03:48.480> should<00:03:48.750> probably<00:03:49.910> go

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
America so I should probably go

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.970
