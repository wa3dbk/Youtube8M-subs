 or the taquitos that I promised so much 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.840
 let's elaborate and you will see how easy it is 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.800
 is this fish is surely going to 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.050
 find in the tilapia supermarket 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.420
 flounder any white fillet that 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.120
 you go to the super it smells very 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.610
 important that it smells like sea that smells 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.980
 cool that does not smell strong good and that 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.290
 be good price buy what we are going to put 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:37.220
 a lemon cumin chili flakes 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.290
 powder see what a little bit of oil 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.510
 of olive and this is going to be our 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.090
 Marinated is not going to happen with the 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.390
 I eat it because then it is very strong and 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.989
 will overwhelm everything then we put the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.989
 fillets to marinate nothing more 10 minutes no 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.150
 too much time we cover it very well and 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:01.970
 we take it to the refrigerator here I have 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.890
 I already have some marinated filetitos 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.040
 what happened how it marinates good that 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.550
 it absorbs all the flavor then you know more 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.280
 rich at times maybe you think so 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.220
 strong the aroma and taste of fish 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.040
 if the marin we give that is attenuated then 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.150
 We put in a hot pan oil 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.180
 olive of course 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:30.510
 so well we distribute for the pan 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:34.970
 and we will put our steaks you 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:39.380
 we remove the most marinated 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.250
 there they are, I think two good 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.170
 well well 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.490
 the less marinated the better so that 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:49.070
 seal so that it is very good doradito 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.210
 well because he knows that golden brown what 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.430
 so much we like the taste of what 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:58.490
 caramelized this is the rich then 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.680
 to accompany this little fish in a 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.630
 of tacos we will make a sauce that 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.670
 surely you madam have the 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.990
 ingredients in your pantry in this 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.030
 moment we are going to put rich cooked beans 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:15.020
 the black for bay beans the one you 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:18.730
 want tomato without seeds if the plant 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:22.070
 excuse me let's put purple onion 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:27.380
 or cilantro 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:30.710
 let's put corn corn kernels all 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.570
 everything all chubby all and that is not left 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.900
 nothing that does not leave a trace that does not 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:39.230
 then we put here the sauce 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:43.510
 more colorful more tasty and more nutritious 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:48.900
 lady lots of protein lemon juice 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:52.360
 and leave this salsita this good rhyme 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:56.840
 then ready and do the salsita we are going to 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:59.650
 turn around our little filets 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.270
 with a spatula 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.270
 see how rich 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.569
 and it smells and tastes rich lady 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.580
 instead of using corn tortillas 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:14.189
 we are going to use corn tortilla with nopal 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.930
 if you get it in the super and it says 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:18.120
 that has a lot more fiber in it 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.789
 We regularly consume if you want 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.030
 buy is an option but tortilla 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:26.219
 regular corn then it is an option for 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.129
 that we increase the fiber in our 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:31.830
 saucer you will love it very well now 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:35.330
 what we are going to do is serve with 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:39.030
 side dishes we have avocado radish 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:42.330
 cilantro and this is going to be our 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:47.580
 partition now you know 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:49.390
 I'm going to take a bit of here from the most 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.720
 delgadito 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.720
 to make our rich taquitos 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.570
 A) Yes 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.330
 and this I'll turn to the 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:08.350
 tortilla I like a little golden 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.639
 and they do not charge you but also as raw 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:14.210
 I 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:16.810
 if you know chubby then we put the 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.810
 tortillas 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:26.500
 let's put a good steak 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:30.790
 roasted lady if chubby was already being 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:36.850
 then we put a little bit of salsita 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:40.300
 of bean well with corn lady chile 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:43.760
 lemon cilantro cited all a wonder 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:46.490
 ricura ricura then we put avocado 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:50.360

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:52.640
 avocado truth we put a little bit of 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.610
 radish that gives a lot of texture and very 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:07:00.680
 good taste and the spicy is already what 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:02.330
