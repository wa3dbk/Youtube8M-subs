00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.339 
have to bear with me I don't often do
tutorials<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.569> shooting<00:02:09.569> through<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
tutorials and shooting through the

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.680 
tutorials and shooting through the
camera<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.610> know<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.879> camera<00:02:12.239> round<00:02:12.360> my

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
camera is you know the camera round my

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.480 
camera is you know the camera round my
it's<00:02:12.930> kind<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.200> bit<00:02:13.320> tricky<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.190> we're<00:02:14.400> going

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
it's kind of a bit tricky so we're going

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.910 
it's kind of a bit tricky so we're going
to<00:02:14.550> go<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.230> both<00:02:16.230> loops<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.580> edge<00:02:17.880> stitch

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
to go and both loops of that edge stitch

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.980 
to go and both loops of that edge stitch
bring<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.010> up<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.400> hopefully<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:21.330> focus

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
bring it up I hopefully in focus

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.130 
bring it up I hopefully in focus
yeah<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:23.430> then<00:02:23.850> we're<00:02:24.240> going<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.510> do<00:02:24.810> another

pull through the loop on the hook then

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.490 
pull through the loop on the hook then

you can see the ridge there a little bit
okay<00:05:51.390> alright<00:05:51.870> so<00:05:52.110> now<00:05:52.440> we<00:05:52.919> come<00:05:53.130> to<00:05:53.430> joining

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
okay alright so now we come to joining

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.360 
okay alright so now we come to joining
the<00:05:54.150> corner<00:05:54.600> again<00:05:55.669> so<00:05:56.669> on<00:05:57.330> the<00:05:57.480> top<00:05:57.660> one<00:05:58.370> and

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
the corner again so on the top one and

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.250 
the corner again so on the top one and
on<00:05:59.610> your<00:05:59.790> completed<00:06:00.150> Matisse<00:06:00.600> what<00:06:00.780> you<00:06:00.900> do<00:06:01.050> is

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
on your completed Matisse what you do is

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.450 
on your completed Matisse what you do is
in<00:06:01.560> between<00:06:01.730> you<00:06:02.730> chain<00:06:03.120> one<00:06:04.130> so<00:06:05.130> what<00:06:05.340> we're

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
in between you chain one so what we're

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.830 
in between you chain one so what we're
going<00:06:05.550> to<00:06:05.610> do<00:06:05.790> this<00:06:06.030> time<00:06:06.270> is<00:06:06.330> we're<00:06:06.540> gonna<00:06:06.660> go

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
going to do this time is we're gonna go

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.950 
going to do this time is we're gonna go
into<00:06:07.320> that<00:06:07.350> chain<00:06:07.770> 1<00:06:08.390> and<00:06:09.390> we're<00:06:09.690> gonna<00:06:09.780> do<00:06:09.930> a

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
into that chain 1 and we're gonna do a

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:16.310 
into that chain 1 and we're gonna do a
slip<00:06:10.169> stitch<00:06:11.810> and<00:06:12.810> then<00:06:13.200> you<00:06:13.710> go<00:06:13.860> into<00:06:15.320> that

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
slip stitch and then you go into that

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.640 
slip stitch and then you go into that
first<00:06:16.770> stitch<00:06:17.100> and<00:06:18.470> do<00:06:19.470> a<00:06:19.710> slip<00:06:20.640> stitch<00:06:20.700> again

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
first stitch and do a slip stitch again

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.350 
first stitch and do a slip stitch again
so<00:06:22.650> we<00:06:22.890> slip<00:06:23.250> stitched<00:06:23.610> into<00:06:23.820> the<00:06:24.750> gap<00:06:26.360> into

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
so we slip stitched into the gap into

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.510 
so we slip stitched into the gap into
the<00:06:27.450> gap<00:06:27.600> there<00:06:27.960> and<00:06:28.200> into<00:06:28.830> that<00:06:28.860> first<00:06:29.310> stitch

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
the gap there and into that first stitch

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.510 
the gap there and into that first stitch
that<00:06:30.060> comes<00:06:30.270> down<00:06:30.560> before<00:06:31.560> we<00:06:31.590> go<00:06:31.979> ahead<00:06:32.130> and

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
that comes down before we go ahead and

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.970 
that comes down before we go ahead and
make

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
make

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:40.570 
make
that<00:06:34.370> second<00:06:35.180> stitch<00:06:36.220> into<00:06:37.750> our<00:06:38.750> apex<00:06:39.580> down

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
that second stitch into our apex down

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:48.730 
that second stitch into our apex down
through<00:06:41.270> one<00:06:41.540> round<00:06:45.310> through<00:06:46.310> to<00:06:47.740> round

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
through one round through to round

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
through one round through to round
through<00:06:49.700> two<00:06:50.140> okay<00:06:51.170> so<00:06:51.470> as<00:06:51.620> you<00:06:51.710> can<00:06:51.830> see<00:06:52.130> we've

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:52.760 
through two okay so as you can see we've

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.790 
through two okay so as you can see we've
got<00:06:53.030> a<00:06:53.270> fairly<00:06:54.080> solid<00:06:55.000> attachment<00:06:56.000> on<00:06:56.930> that

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 
got a fairly solid attachment on that

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.470 
got a fairly solid attachment on that
corner<00:06:58.220> there<00:06:58.430> you<00:06:59.420> know<00:06:59.570> you've<00:07:00.320> got<00:07:00.500> a<00:07:00.530> gap

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:01.480 
corner there you know you've got a gap

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.120 
corner there you know you've got a gap
because<00:07:02.480> of<00:07:02.510> your<00:07:02.750> apex<00:07:03.080> but<00:07:03.500> you<00:07:03.680> you<00:07:03.890> have<00:07:04.100> a

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.130 
because of your apex but you you have a

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.830 
because of your apex but you you have a
gap<00:07:04.340> on<00:07:04.550> all<00:07:04.700> of<00:07:04.850> them<00:07:04.970> because<00:07:05.120> of<00:07:05.300> the<00:07:05.480> apex

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 
gap on all of them because of the apex

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.590 
gap on all of them because of the apex
slightly<00:07:06.410> okay<00:07:07.400> alright<00:07:07.790> so<00:07:07.850> that's<00:07:08.420> the

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:08.600 
slightly okay alright so that's the

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.160 
slightly okay alright so that's the
first<00:07:08.840> side<00:07:09.170> joint<00:07:10.150> hopefully<00:07:11.170> fingers

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.170 
first side joint hopefully fingers

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.680 
first side joint hopefully fingers
crossed<00:07:12.350> that<00:07:12.620> really<00:07:13.220> that<00:07:13.310> helps<00:07:13.790> it's<00:07:14.540> not

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
crossed that really that helps it's not
