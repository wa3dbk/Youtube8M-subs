 monerÃ­as makes the sony smart band that 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.790
 we have here is the model sw 10 the 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.769
 Design is quite simple but it's fine 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.600
 because it is very discreet and pleasant to the 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.760
 touch even has a rough texture 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.220
 to keep you from slipping despite 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.320
 of sweat and you can also wet under 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.180
 the plastic band is the receiver the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.070
 which has LED indicators that 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.170
 they tell you what functions he is performing 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.030

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.040
 another band and has a button to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.840
 control its basic functions and 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.200
 it also has a usb slot for 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.329
 load it its load is pretty fast 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.770
 we tried it with the xperia z 2 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.829
 of sony but it works with any 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.410
 Android cellular to use it you must 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.820
 download the live blog app to your team 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.530
 that helps coordinate all the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.629
 physical activities that records the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.700
 band as the steps you take the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.530
 distance that you have run the time that 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.100
 you have biked the calories that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.410
 what else 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.120
 etcetera the application registers each 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.799
 aspect of your life so also 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.320
 remember the amount and date of the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.880
 photos that you take the music you heard 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.920
 the videos that you saw 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.719
 and how many hours do you sleep like 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.210
 you transport what video games that have 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.789
 traumatized et cetera in a few words is 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.649
 an automatic diary on your phone the 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.420
 app is compatible with maps 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.789
 google so that cyclists or 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.380
 Riders can check their routes one 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.659
 of the things that we liked the most is that 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.670
 the tape vibrates when you receive a message 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.649
 or call this is especially useful 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.840
 for the girls, they will never be lost 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.030
 You're welcome even if the phone is lost 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.280
 in the bag and not listen also 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.899
 emails will appreciate even the band 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.700
 vibrates if you get too far away from 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.399
 phone so you will not lose it so 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.080
 easy you can also use the smart 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.270
 band to take pictures without having to 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.280
 touch the cell phone or to overtake and 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.530
 pause the music with the simple touch of 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.569
 your fingers this is very practical when 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.670
 you're on the treadmill you run in the 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.280
 park or you're just going to the subway and 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.679
 you do not want anyone to see your phone without 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.240
 However, we had some problems to the 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.880
 time to synchronize it and get it 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.709
 do what we wanted in summary the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.269
 smartphone is a good gadget if you want 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.430
 an aid in your records of 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.829
 physical activity and goals is not so 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.810
 Exact like other gadgets to wear but 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.710
 that's why it's ideal for people who are not 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.340
 so nailed nor be so full 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.340
 all right
