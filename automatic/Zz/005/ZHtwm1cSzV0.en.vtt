00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
caught in between which will give it a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.899 
caught in between which will give it a
more<00:01:30.509> spiral<00:01:31.320> effect<00:01:31.799> which<00:01:32.100> that's<00:01:32.670> what

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
more spiral effect which that's what

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
way I just like the way the bubbles like

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.920 
way I just like the way the bubbles like

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.160 
I'm doing if you guys have this crown
you<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.030> always<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.479> something<00:01:42.659> different

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
you can always do something different

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.450 
you can always do something different
you<00:01:44.360> can<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.600> go<00:01:45.869> over<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> bubbles<00:01:47.130> and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
you can see I go over the bubbles and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.719 
you can see I go over the bubbles and
then<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:50.009> last<00:01:50.250> part<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.850> seems<00:01:51.090> like<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.360> don't

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.310 

and<00:01:56.729> then<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.479> kind<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.869> unravel

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and then you kind of have to unravel

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.010 
and then you kind of have to unravel
with<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.100> kind<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.460> curling<00:01:59.729> iron<00:02:00.020> and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
with this kind of curling iron and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.690 
with this kind of curling iron and
that's<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> kind<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.500> curl<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:02.100> gives<00:02:02.310> my<00:02:02.670> hair

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
that's the kind of curl it gives my hair

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.420 
that's the kind of curl it gives my hair
and<00:02:03.390> then<00:02:03.990> I'm<00:02:04.170> going<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.469> just<00:02:04.740> continue<00:02:04.920> this

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
and then I'm going to just continue this

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:18.890 
and then I'm going to just continue this
throughout<00:02:05.820> my<00:02:06.060> whole<00:02:06.240> hair

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900

curls it looks more natural that way I'm
just<00:02:35.050> gonna<00:02:35.230> go<00:02:35.620> move<00:02:35.860> on<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.280> other<00:02:36.459> side

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
just gonna go move on to the other side

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:45.860 
just gonna go move on to the other side
now

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.810 

and<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:47.350> like<00:02:47.560> using<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:48.160> little<00:02:48.430> bit<00:02:48.520> smaller

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
and I like using a little bit smaller

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.640 
and I like using a little bit smaller
sections<00:02:49.330> with<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.960> top<00:02:50.140> section<00:02:50.560> of<00:02:50.830> my<00:02:51.010> hair

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.960 

seems<00:02:56.650> like<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.010> curling<00:02:57.280> iron<00:02:57.370> also<00:02:57.670> is

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
seems like the curling iron also is

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.000 
seems like the curling iron also is
really<00:02:58.420> consistent<00:02:58.870> like<00:02:59.290> heat<00:02:59.590> throughout

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
really consistent like heat throughout

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.760 
really consistent like heat throughout
the<00:03:00.160> whole<00:03:00.310> thing<00:03:00.340> so<00:03:01.120> it's<00:03:01.270> not<00:03:01.420> like

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
the whole thing so it's not like

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.200 
the whole thing so it's not like
randomly<00:03:02.770> curly<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.610> then<00:03:03.760> randomly

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
randomly curly and then randomly

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.480 
randomly curly and then randomly
straight<00:03:04.870> which<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.770> it's<00:03:05.920> just<00:03:06.100> gonna<00:03:06.220> at

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
straight which and it's just gonna at

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.630 
straight which and it's just gonna at
random<00:03:06.970> if<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.720> goes<00:03:07.930> on<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.560> little<00:03:09.280> bubbles

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
random if it goes on the little bubbles

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.930

out now
and<00:03:27.110> kind<00:03:28.110> of<00:03:28.170> shake<00:03:28.440> out<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:29.340> curls<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:30.560> have

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.500 
and kind of shake out the curls I have
to<00:03:31.709> say<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:31.980> don't<00:03:32.250> like<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:32.970> for<00:03:33.240> curling

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
to say I don't like this for curling

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.460 
to say I don't like this for curling
your<00:03:33.900> bangs<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:34.770> think<00:03:35.160> it's<00:03:35.250> really<00:03:35.520> difficult

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
your bangs I think it's really difficult

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.900 
your bangs I think it's really difficult
but<00:03:37.470> that's<00:03:37.650> only<00:03:37.770> through<00:03:38.100> curly<00:03:38.340> bangs<00:03:38.610> so

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
but that's only through curly bangs so

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.370 
but that's only through curly bangs so
that<00:03:39.390> would<00:03:39.540> be<00:03:39.630> like<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.810> concern<00:03:40.380> whatsoever

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.559 

okay<00:03:46.380> so<00:03:46.440> that's<00:03:46.950> pretty<00:03:47.220> much<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.060> kind<00:03:48.480> of

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
okay so that's pretty much the kind of

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.479 
okay so that's pretty much the kind of
curls<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:49.140> this<00:03:49.350> curling<00:03:49.709> iron<00:03:50.010> will<00:03:50.310> give
