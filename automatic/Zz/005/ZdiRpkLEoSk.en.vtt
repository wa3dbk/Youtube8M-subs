but the base of my districts is so far

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.189 
but the base of my districts is so far

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
to the right or to the left it makes it

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.870 
to the right or to the left it makes it
difficult<00:05:34.440> for<00:05:34.710> us<00:05:34.889> to<00:05:35.039> negotiate<00:05:35.340> to<00:05:35.759> the

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
bad it is

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.360 
bad it is
we<00:05:39.240> had<00:05:39.479> a<00:05:39.509> district<00:05:40.289> in<00:05:40.409> Minnesota<00:05:41.039> that<00:05:41.340> I

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
we had a district in Minnesota that I

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.909 
we had a district in Minnesota that I
lived<00:05:41.759> in<00:05:42.060> I<00:05:42.319> lived<00:05:43.319> right<00:05:43.440> on<00:05:43.620> the

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
Mississippi River

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.390 
Mississippi River
now<00:05:45.719> the<00:05:45.779> Mississippi<00:05:46.620> River<00:05:46.860> is<00:05:46.979> a<00:05:47.099> big-ass

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
now the Mississippi River is a big-ass

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.029 
now the Mississippi River is a big-ass
River<00:05:48.000> you<00:05:48.750> know<00:05:48.840> it<00:05:48.960> divides<00:05:49.319> our<00:05:49.620> country

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
River you know it divides our country

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.200 
River you know it divides our country
almost<00:05:50.219> in<00:05:50.520> half<00:05:50.729> literally<00:05:51.529> yet<00:05:52.529> the<00:05:53.130> the

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
almost in half literally yet the the

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.700 
almost in half literally yet the the
congressional<00:05:54.210> district<00:05:54.779> covered<00:05:55.440> both

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
congressional district covered both

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.920 
congressional district covered both
sides<00:05:56.069> of<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.460> river<00:05:56.669> now<00:05:57.120> wouldn't<00:05:57.690> the

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
sides of the river now wouldn't the

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.260 
sides of the river now wouldn't the
river<00:05:58.169> be<00:05:58.440> a<00:05:58.469> natural<00:05:59.099> boundary<00:05:59.669> and<00:06:00.029> there

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
river be a natural boundary and there

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.760 
river be a natural boundary and there
wasn't<00:06:00.449> even<00:06:00.629> a<00:06:00.840> bridge<00:06:01.110> nearby

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
wasn't even a bridge nearby

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.580 
wasn't even a bridge nearby
so<00:06:02.490> you<00:06:02.550> had<00:06:02.729> to<00:06:02.849> drive<00:06:03.090> about<00:06:03.360> 10<00:06:03.719> or<00:06:03.870> 15<00:06:04.229> miles

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
so you had to drive about 10 or 15 miles

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.559 
so you had to drive about 10 or 15 miles

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569 
just to get to the other side of the

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:08.899 
just to get to the other side of the
district<00:06:07.080> to<00:06:07.469> find<00:06:07.500> a<00:06:07.860> bridge<00:06:08.069> to<00:06:08.400> get<00:06:08.550> over

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
district to find a bridge to get over

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.269 
district to find a bridge to get over
there<00:06:09.120> see<00:06:09.449> all<00:06:09.690> these<00:06:09.900> districts<00:06:10.560> are<00:06:10.740> set<00:06:11.099> up

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:11.279 
there see all these districts are set up

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:14.209 
there see all these districts are set up
by<00:06:11.639> the<00:06:11.699> Democrats<00:06:12.509> and<00:06:12.690> Republicans<00:06:13.379> so<00:06:14.039> that

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219 
by the Democrats and Republicans so that

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:15.920 
by the Democrats and Republicans so that
there's<00:06:14.400> no<00:06:14.580> competition<00:06:15.180> if<00:06:15.569> it's<00:06:15.810> a

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
there's no competition if it's a

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.050 
there's no competition if it's a
predominant<00:06:16.590> Republican<00:06:17.219> area<00:06:17.550> that's<00:06:17.879> a

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
predominant Republican area that's a

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.330 
predominant Republican area that's a
district<00:06:18.539> predominant<00:06:19.500> Democrat<00:06:20.009> that's<00:06:20.219> a

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
district predominant Democrat that's a

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.369 
district predominant Democrat that's a
district<00:06:20.699> they<00:06:21.029> never<00:06:21.360> divide<00:06:21.870> them<00:06:22.139> into

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:22.379 
district they never divide them into

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:25.010 
district they never divide them into
50/50<00:06:23.340> so<00:06:23.580> you'll<00:06:23.759> get<00:06:23.879> competition<00:06:24.690> that's

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
50/50 so you'll get competition that's

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.730 
50/50 so you'll get competition that's
why<00:06:25.379> you<00:06:25.440> see<00:06:26.009> the<00:06:26.849> Congress<00:06:27.599> with<00:06:28.050> the<00:06:28.080> 10%

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740

approval rating and yet 90% of them will

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.029 
approval rating and yet 90% of them will
get<00:06:32.460> reelected<00:06:32.969> because<00:06:33.750> it's<00:06:34.139> the<00:06:34.349> districts
