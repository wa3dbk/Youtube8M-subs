00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.930
 It seems that Disney is putting on 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.090
 stacks with your bet in the market of 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.010
 mobile applications or proof of it 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.599
 is the game where my water is going 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.599
 for its version 1.6 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.250
 where is my water is a game type 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.930
 puzzle for all audiences in which 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.189
 the goal is to make the water arrive 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.119
 up the crocodile's bathtub 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.250
 protagonist in the first screens 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.410
 It will be an easy task but as you 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.239
 let's go forward the obstacles that we 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.170
 we will find keep doing it every time 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.170
 more complicated 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.430
 to move the water we will have to draw 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.170
 the desired route through tunnels 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.150
 what have we done on the ground and 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.710
 taking advantage of the falling walls and no more 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.850
 obstacles to get to the gallery 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.850
 of forming and what are 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.770
 along the way we can also fill 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.840
 of water some rubber ducks that we 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.360
 will give more points at the cost of complicating a 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.460
 little more the clear solution so that the 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.500
 perfect match we must pick up 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.360
 all the ducks fill the bathtub and 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.350
 release hidden objects on the ground in 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.350
 the minimum possible time 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.280
 with the latest update we will have 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.900
 of more than 200 levels including several 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.040
 hidden that will keep us entertained 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.040
 for a long time 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.460
 the graphics are correct but without 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.350
 boasting and fluid dynamics is not 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.150
 too good the water behaves 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.220
 a strange way different than how 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.810
 would do in reality sometimes it seems 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.729
 too thick and it's hard to move 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.110
 but in others it is so fluid that we 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.110
 it will be hard to keep it where we want 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.390
 when the levels are wider than 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.180
 the screen shows a button 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.960
 slightly rudimentary displacement 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.479
 Missing the possibilities 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.340
 touch tablet can not 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.829
 zoom or have a general view of 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.690
 the whole map we 're not going to say it's a 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.160
 great setback but they are options that 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.670
 at this point they almost give 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.670
 supposed 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.989
 where is my water is a 10 in terms of 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.580
 originality and addiction a game that 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.530
 will have passed very good times to all the 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.720
 family and with a difficulty that 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.720
 adapts at any level all a success 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.670
 Y 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.640
 Y 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.640
 yes
