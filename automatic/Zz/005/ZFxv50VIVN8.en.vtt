impressed<00:03:18.920> with<00:03:19.100> this<00:03:19.220> album<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:20.209> me<00:03:20.390> that's

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
impressed with this album to me that's

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.300 
impressed with this album to me that's
not<00:03:20.780> really<00:03:21.080> what<00:03:21.170> it's<00:03:21.350> about<00:03:21.440> at<00:03:21.890> you<00:03:22.100> an

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
not really what it's about at you an

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.190 
not really what it's about at you an
average<00:03:22.700> listener<00:03:23.000> out<00:03:23.330> there<00:03:23.570> I<00:03:23.750> think<00:03:24.110> you

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
average listener out there I think you

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.870 
average listener out there I think you
should<00:03:24.350> have<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.500> different<00:03:24.920> attitude<00:03:25.070> with<00:03:25.670> it

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
should have a different attitude with it

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
abilities on in a recording I don't

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.129 
abilities on in a recording I don't
think<00:05:55.849> that<00:05:56.060> he<00:05:56.150> actually<00:05:56.330> shows<00:05:56.750> his<00:05:56.960> full

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
think that he actually shows his full

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.080 
think that he actually shows his full
potential<00:05:57.440> visibility's<00:05:58.159> here<00:05:58.490> and<00:05:58.729> i<00:05:58.909> think

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
potential visibility's here and i think

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.430 
potential visibility's here and i think
that<00:05:59.210> the<00:05:59.270> music<00:05:59.599> is<00:05:59.690> hindered<00:06:00.050> because<00:06:00.169> of

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
that the music is hindered because of

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.980 
that the music is hindered because of
that<00:06:00.560> it's<00:06:00.919> too<00:06:01.130> safe<00:06:01.370> yes<00:06:01.940> and<00:06:02.180> I<00:06:02.360> also<00:06:02.690> feel

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
that it's too safe yes and I also feel

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.570 
that it's too safe yes and I also feel
like<00:06:03.110> his<00:06:03.259> vocals<00:06:03.650> are<00:06:03.770> way<00:06:03.919> too<00:06:03.979> safe<00:06:04.310> there's

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
like his vocals are way too safe there's

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.670 
like his vocals are way too safe there's
almost<00:06:04.729> it's<00:06:05.419> almost<00:06:05.599> like<00:06:06.020> this<00:06:06.229> sit<00:06:06.560> that

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680
