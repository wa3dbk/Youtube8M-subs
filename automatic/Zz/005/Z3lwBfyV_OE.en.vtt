00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
you how you can achieve this nice shape

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.410 
you how you can achieve this nice shape
from<00:01:10.890> your<00:01:11.130> brushes<00:01:11.520> while<00:01:12.090> they're<00:01:12.240> drawing

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
from your brushes while they're drawing

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.780 
from your brushes while they're drawing
instead<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.410> this<00:01:13.710> shape<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.250> there<00:01:14.670> will<00:01:14.760> be

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
instead of this shape and there will be

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.580 
instead of this shape and there will be
a<00:01:14.880> couple<00:01:15.030> reasons<00:01:15.360> why<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.230> kind<00:01:16.440> of<00:01:16.500> a

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
a couple reasons why this is kind of a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.680 
a couple reasons why this is kind of a
good<00:01:16.740> idea<00:01:17.010> and<00:01:17.580> I'll<00:01:17.700> get<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.030> those<00:01:18.150> as<00:01:18.450> we're

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
good idea and I'll get to those as we're

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.900 
good idea and I'll get to those as we're
going<00:01:18.960> for<00:01:19.440> starters<00:01:19.920> though<00:01:20.160> it's<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.760> lot

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
going for starters though it's a lot

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.820 
going for starters though it's a lot
easier<00:01:20.940> to<00:01:21.390> work<00:01:21.540> with<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.960> brush<00:01:22.230> like<00:01:22.800> this

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
easier to work with this brush like this

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.310 
easier to work with this brush like this
then<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.760> this<00:01:24.120> it's<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.020> ends<00:01:25.230> up

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
then like this it's it's it ends up

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.930 
then like this it's it's it ends up
being<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.560> larger<00:01:25.920> brush<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.730> less

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
being a larger brush so I have less

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.900 
being a larger brush so I have less
control<00:01:27.150> than<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.530> also<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.550> I

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
control than I do with this also if I

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.910 
control than I do with this also if I
have<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.330> in<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.750> brush<00:01:30.960> belt<00:01:31.230> next<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.800> other

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.130 
have this in a brush belt next to other
brushes<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.760> one<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.660> to<00:01:33.720> do<00:01:33.870> this

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
brushes this one is going to do this

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.860 
brushes this one is going to do this

strength to it so it's a little bit
thicker<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.620> then<00:02:23.030> just<00:02:24.030> take<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.540> and

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
thicker and then just take that and

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.130 
thicker and then just take that and

you're just going to wrap it around the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.400 
you're just going to wrap it around the
handle<00:02:28.590> like<00:02:28.770> this<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:30.870> can<00:02:31.020> see<00:02:31.200> what<00:02:31.290> I'm

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.960 
handle like this you can see what I'm
doing<00:02:31.440> here<00:02:31.920> I'm<00:02:32.520> just<00:02:34.340> wrapping<00:02:35.340> around<00:02:35.700> like

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
doing here I'm just wrapping around like

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.449 
doing here I'm just wrapping around like
that<00:02:37.190> then<00:02:38.570> slide<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.630> up<00:02:39.980> it's<00:02:40.980> like<00:02:41.280> the

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
that then slide it up it's like the

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.280 
that then slide it up it's like the
simplest<00:02:41.820> thing<00:02:42.030> in<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.180> world<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.480> do<00:02:42.720> it

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
will be a little snug at the top the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.090 
will be a little snug at the top the
water<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.600> bristles<00:02:46.140> will<00:02:46.350> help<00:02:46.709> the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
water in the bristles will help the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.880 
water in the bristles will help the
tissue<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.760> stay<00:02:48.720> put<00:02:49.050> so<00:02:49.320> you<00:02:49.380> shouldn't<00:02:49.770> need

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
tissue to stay put so you shouldn't need

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.850 
tissue to stay put so you shouldn't need
to<00:02:49.950> tape<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.370> serve<00:02:50.580> rubber<00:02:50.730> band<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.209> then

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
to tape to serve rubber band and then

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.620 
to tape to serve rubber band and then
stick<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:52.890> in<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.130> glass<00:02:53.250> like<00:02:53.910> this<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.420> you

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
stick it in a glass like this and you

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.150 
stick it in a glass like this and you
can<00:02:54.660> dry<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.380> other<00:02:55.530> thing<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:55.769> this<00:02:55.980> is

can dry it the other thing that this is
going<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.430> do<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.750> actually<00:02:58.140> going<00:02:58.290> to

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
going to do is is actually going to

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.340 
going to do is is actually going to
allow<00:02:58.650> your<00:02:58.890> brushes<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.459> dry<00:02:59.780> down<00:03:00.780> like<00:03:01.110> this

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
instead of like this so water won't be

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.780 
instead of like this so water won't be
getting<00:03:04.080> into<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.350> handle<00:03:04.769> which<00:03:05.070> will<00:03:05.400> also

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
getting into the handle which will also

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.300 
getting into the handle which will also
help<00:03:05.970> prolong<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.690> life<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.170> brush<00:03:07.410> you<00:03:08.070> can

paper and I don't fold it in half for

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.050 
paper and I don't fold it in half for
this<00:04:20.280> one<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:20.669> just<00:04:21.660> wrap<00:04:22.079> up<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.350> brush<00:04:23.060> just

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
this one and just wrap up the brush just

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.920 
this one and just wrap up the brush just
like<00:04:24.300> this<00:04:24.539> imagining<00:04:25.440> that<00:04:25.650> this<00:04:25.800> is<00:04:26.010> wet

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.230 

there<00:04:29.650> you<00:04:29.800> go<00:04:30.009> just<00:04:30.789> like<00:04:30.910> that<00:04:31.199> and<00:04:32.880> then<00:04:33.880> all

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
there you go just like that and then all

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.890 
there you go just like that and then all
you<00:04:34.479> do<00:04:35.130> is<00:04:36.130> pop<00:04:36.400> it<00:04:36.610> in<00:04:36.699> here<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:40.000> then<00:04:40.660> set<00:04:40.870> it

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
you do is pop it in here and then set it

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.200 
you do is pop it in here and then set it
somewhere<00:04:41.500> and<00:04:41.979> it<00:04:42.400> will<00:04:42.520> dry<00:04:42.729> and<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.090> will

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
somewhere and it will dry and it will

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.779 
somewhere and it will dry and it will
stay<00:04:43.389> in<00:04:43.419> here<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:44.860> can<00:04:45.039> see<00:04:45.220> it's<00:04:45.430> not<00:04:45.580> going

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
stay in here you can see it's not going

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.550 
stay in here you can see it's not going
anywhere<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.389> gank<00:04:46.720> on<00:04:46.870> it'll<00:04:47.169> probably<00:04:47.320> pull

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
anywhere I gank on it'll probably pull

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.230 
anywhere I gank on it'll probably pull
out<00:04:47.680> but<00:04:47.949> and<00:04:48.190> not<00:04:48.460> only<00:04:48.580> will<00:04:48.759> it<00:04:48.910> keep<00:04:49.060> the

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
out but and not only will it keep the

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.409 
out but and not only will it keep the
water<00:04:49.479> from<00:04:50.110> getting<00:04:50.320> up<00:04:50.710> into<00:04:50.979> the<00:04:51.910> handle<00:04:52.270> of
