00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 that makes him hopefully you're fine 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.899
 today I make you a gradient so 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.970
 so in turquoise and a move like that 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.469
 with the NGO action that is just 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.110
 black and white glitter simply 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.110
 so is interested game it remains to the listened 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.720
 firstly right now I'm getting 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.820
 push the nails so I know that 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.500
 it's not for a very beautiful 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.670
 length what I have right now but 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.860
 that's exactly why I 'm getting 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.530
 a manicure a little further it 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.260
 will help me lengthen and tits 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.870
 stop fooling with then snatch 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.550
 then anything so that's why 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.129
 I make this machine this manicure 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.589
 today I make you the ranks 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.260
 I already did it I put you links 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.570
 in the bar at the bottom of the orders of 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.969
 graded that I did so I'm going to do 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.399
 a gradient of turquoise and mauve 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.609
 hallways that I use it's mega is 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.750
 of oneworld called golden year 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:12.640
 freshly so a turquoise green water 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.940
 mint blue mint variant then a move 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.300
 also a mobile at 2 and 6 called 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.130
 playdate so sealed to believe that 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.740
 I'm using for that I'm going to use for 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.830
 do my world and used games 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.369
 also a game but over a fingernail 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.630
 accents this is from kendy blacktop 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.680
 so it sounds like it's just 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.570
 just black and white glitter 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.520
 different shapes from this course 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.969
 polish the normal when I'm one of 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.189
 ranking 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.780
 I try to choose most of my 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.579
 two colors then use it as 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.700
 bottom layer eventually that I put 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.140
 on all the nail there here I would like it 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.960
 dissident the two so I'm not taking 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.479
 of exchange nothing for a white so that's 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.890
 target chlorine at 2 and 6 that's what 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.590
 I applied on everything but as I 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.740
 already applied my layer my layer of 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.049
 base so this is the scott bee 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.610
 egg proteins and 6 then jallet m 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.610
 white mount on all angles 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.849
 my bottom layer I finally put 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.150
 I put two layers for really 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.130
 to have something of the opa of strips 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.840
 so I apply and two shots I 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.440
 really had to let it be 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.940
 extremely well dry if not otherwise the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.980
 varnish like our father of often everything 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.060
 remove the basecoat so that's 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.849
 really not interesting 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.410
 so it's very very dry now I 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.080
 take my sponge am a sponge to 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.569
 cosmetics like that found in 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.630
 supermarket pharmacy a sponge 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.269
 as in latex are a little I was told 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.370
 that kitchen sponges it was 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.030
 possible to achieve with me I have 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.590
 never tried 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.900
 I really like sponges and 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.160
 cosmetics like that so I 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.260
 wet a little with water 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.910
 jelly it would just have to have a 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.090
 little unit in for as little as 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.950
 varnishes make it too much in the pages so 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.660
 like that 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.470
 the you determine in the background or wants 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.049
 the word opens the tourcoing i'm going to put 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.989
 the game puts the move in beautiful sweater 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.209
 turquoise at the top so I think if there 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.579
 think it's going to go like that so I put 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.859
 a fashion line on a line of 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.109
 turquoise father on top but varnish are 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.660
 here so I start with the move 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:32.510
 how was I doing a line I have 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.090
 still a great game anyway 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.290
 good and a good layer especially that the 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.290
 the sponge nothing you still 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:50.130
 really need both clans 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:56.250
 just feel important like that jallet 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:57.870
 tap on the nail with the pages for 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.090
 the moment it gives this here does not know it 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.230
 very dark but with the nail facing va 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.390
 become quite opaque 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.980
 so we continue on all the angles there 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.470
 Always put the varnish on each 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.470
 man every time between each layer 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.050
 I did my first birth so that 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.000
 gives something very flat but 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.160
 good as I tell you we'll put some 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.960
 more then it'll become a lot more 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.660
 opaque knows it except that the outline of 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.610
 the ong forgetting only knows it really needs 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.330
 to go clean after so I'm expecting more 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.729
 that it dries 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.220
 according to this kind now it's already 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.600
 sic so the kind is a little it's 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.039
 sure we do not have to hand over 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.470
 varnish on the mop each time 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:05:00.210
 would spend the sponge already gorged with varnish 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:05:02.580
 I'm still 1 m at the beginning 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.870
 sees really appear more it's the 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.800
 language to do it we're really going to 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.180
 see the degrade appear when we 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.380
 apply on the nail really have to go 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.570
 quickly do not press too hard 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.310
 really need when I say tap this is 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.680
 really next because otherwise in the air 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.479
 layers but I think 16 sees here 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.300
 but I have a little bit of white 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:27.539
 feels like I'm continuing like that so many 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.760
 layers that we need to have a good 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.930
 result 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.090
 left mammeri is always more beautiful 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.159
 that the right hand is normal I am 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.470
 right so I always have more done 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.270
 on TF1 the left hand but with the top 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.570
 coat it really helped to found 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.810
 chlorine together the cottage I was going 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.610
 put the key horns blatter 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.639
 optional sharks said I had you 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:56.099
 says who like these young man is 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:06:00.770
 sure dummies r so i believe in just 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.770
 a touch touches shorter finally 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.569
 I finished that's what it gives 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:13.630
 as I told you I put a top 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:14.500
 coat it helped a lot to provide 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.210
 together 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.120
 then it became all the lists or 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.229
 briand so that's it I like it a lot 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.090
 result I think it's a beautiful 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.550
 mixture of colors was wanted to see 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.940
 other tutorial so I put you the 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.169
 link down on the videos then that's it 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.919
 I hope it made more girls 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.430
 will be coming soon 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.430
 ciao
