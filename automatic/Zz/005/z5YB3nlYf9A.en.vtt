00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
quickly but basically what I'm trying to

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.150 
quickly but basically what I'm trying to
say<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.940> level<00:03:40.270> system<00:03:40.660> is<00:03:40.870> now

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
say is that the level system is now

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.770 
say is that the level system is now
exponentially<00:03:42.160> growing<00:03:42.520> as<00:03:42.850> once<00:03:43.210> again<00:03:43.510> so

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
exponentially growing as once again so

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.110 
exponentially growing as once again so
basically<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.980> higher<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.460> level<00:03:45.610> you<00:03:45.910> get

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
basically the higher the level you get

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.250 
basically the higher the level you get
to<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:47.860> high<00:03:48.010> up<00:03:48.250> you<00:03:48.460> are<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:49.480> more<00:03:49.690> mobs<00:03:50.050> or

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
to the high up you are the more mobs or

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.020 
to the high up you are the more mobs or
experience<00:03:50.800> you<00:03:50.890> will<00:03:50.980> need<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.460> get<00:03:51.820> to<00:03:52.000> the

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
experience you will need to get to the

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.120 
experience you will need to get to the
next<00:03:52.120> level<00:03:52.390> so<00:03:53.020> that<00:03:53.260> wasn't<00:03:53.860> a<00:03:53.890> very<00:03:54.010> good

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
next level so that wasn't a very good

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.810 
next level so that wasn't a very good
example<00:03:54.400> wasn't<00:03:55.150> no<00:03:55.270> it<00:03:55.450> wasn't<00:03:55.810> um<00:03:55.990> but<00:03:56.820> this

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
example wasn't no it wasn't um but this

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.250 
example wasn't no it wasn't um but this
is<00:03:58.030> you<00:03:58.210> know<00:03:58.330> this<00:03:58.360> is<00:03:58.660> just<00:03:58.870> great<00:03:59.020> because

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
is you know this is just great because

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.250 
is you know this is just great because
I'm<00:03:59.470> so<00:04:00.160> good<00:04:00.430> at<00:04:00.460> this<00:04:00.700> yeah<00:04:01.000> oh<00:04:01.180> yeah<00:04:01.600> XP<00:04:01.960> Wars

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
I'm so good at this yeah oh yeah XP Wars

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.460 
I'm so good at this yeah oh yeah XP Wars
yay<00:04:02.770> I<00:04:03.130> guess<00:04:03.540> but<00:04:04.540> as<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.720> can<00:04:04.840> see<00:04:05.050> it<00:04:05.200> gets

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
yay I guess but as you can see it gets

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.460 
yay I guess but as you can see it gets
slower<00:04:06.160> as<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:06.670> go<00:04:07.060> up<00:04:07.090> as<00:04:07.510> your<00:04:07.690> levels<00:04:08.050> go<00:04:08.290> up

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
slower as you go up as your levels go up

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.470 
slower as you go up as your levels go up
so<00:04:08.680> that's<00:04:09.160> something<00:04:09.550> interesting<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.270> note

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
so that's something interesting to note

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.660 
so that's something interesting to note
also<00:04:10.780> this<00:04:11.200> might<00:04:11.560> be<00:04:11.740> a<00:04:11.770> feature<00:04:12.070> or<00:04:12.220> a<00:04:12.340> bug

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
also this might be a feature or a bug

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.450 
also this might be a feature or a bug
but<00:04:12.910> if<00:04:13.510> you're<00:04:13.690> in<00:04:13.780> creative<00:04:14.290> mode<00:04:14.320> and<00:04:14.800> you

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
but if you're in creative mode and you

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.810 
but if you're in creative mode and you
hit<00:04:15.820> a<00:04:15.850> hostile<00:04:16.840> mob<00:04:17.340> that<00:04:18.340> wasn't<00:04:18.760> a<00:04:18.790> very

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
hit a hostile mob that wasn't a very

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.470 
hit a hostile mob that wasn't a very
good<00:04:19.000> example<00:04:19.920> if<00:04:20.920> it<00:04:21.220> doesn't<00:04:21.549> explode<00:04:22.000> after

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
good example if it doesn't explode after

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.170 
good example if it doesn't explode after
a<00:04:23.140> while<00:04:23.380> it<00:04:23.650> will<00:04:23.740> become<00:04:24.100> passive<00:04:24.370> again<00:04:24.970> and

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
a while it will become passive again and

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.630 
a while it will become passive again and
this<00:04:25.840> really<00:04:26.110> isn't<00:04:26.500> very<00:04:26.770> good<00:04:27.100> examples

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
this really isn't very good examples

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.120 
this really isn't very good examples
okay<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:28.090> if<00:04:28.870> that<00:04:28.930> guy<00:04:29.470> doesn't<00:04:29.680> explode

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
okay so if that guy doesn't explode

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.070 
okay so if that guy doesn't explode
after<00:04:30.430> a<00:04:30.670> while<00:04:30.910> he<00:04:31.150> will<00:04:31.180> just<00:04:31.480> stop<00:04:31.660> chasing

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
after a while he will just stop chasing

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.570 
after a while he will just stop chasing
me<00:04:32.110> like<00:04:32.380> this<00:04:32.560> so<00:04:32.800> i<00:04:32.830> can<00:04:32.950> just<00:04:33.220> approach<00:04:33.550> him

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
me like this so i can just approach him

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.520 
me like this so i can just approach him
once<00:04:33.910> again<00:04:34.180> now<00:04:34.690> this<00:04:34.870> may<00:04:35.110> just<00:04:35.140> be<00:04:35.440> a

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
once again now this may just be a

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.740 
once again now this may just be a
feature<00:04:35.770> for<00:04:36.100> creative<00:04:36.640> but<00:04:36.850> i<00:04:37.060> suspect<00:04:37.510> it's

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
feature for creative but i suspect it's

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.100 
feature for creative but i suspect it's
a<00:04:37.840> bug<00:04:38.110> so<00:04:38.500> I'm<00:04:38.880> speculate<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.090> man<00:04:40.450> and<00:04:40.810> that

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
a bug so I'm speculate and man and that

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.360 
a bug so I'm speculate and man and that
creeper<00:04:41.530> is<00:04:41.680> standing<00:04:42.040> on<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.220> wooden

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
creeper is standing on the wooden

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.640 
creeper is standing on the wooden
pressure<00:04:42.670> plate<00:04:42.970> I<00:04:43.240> guess<00:04:43.840> he's<00:04:44.080> very

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
pressure plate I guess he's very

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.310 
pressure plate I guess he's very
attracted<00:04:45.310> to<00:04:45.340> that<00:04:45.550> arrow<00:04:46.210> that<00:04:46.480> I<00:04:46.540> shot<00:04:46.870> but

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
attracted to that arrow that I shot but

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.570 
attracted to that arrow that I shot but
anyway<00:04:48.270> moving<00:04:49.270> on<00:04:50.050> ha<00:04:50.410> Moo<00:04:50.770> but<00:04:51.190> in<00:04:51.460> case

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
anyway moving on ha Moo but in case

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.670 
anyway moving on ha Moo but in case
you're<00:04:51.730> wondering<00:04:51.820> once<00:04:52.360> again<00:04:52.630> to<00:04:53.350> get<00:04:53.500> to

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
you're wondering once again to get to

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.670 
you're wondering once again to get to
level<00:04:53.890> 30<00:04:54.220> you<00:04:54.580> actually<00:04:55.000> need<00:04:55.680> 825

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
level 30 you actually need 825

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.070 
level 30 you actually need 825
experience<00:04:57.340> points<00:04:57.550> so<00:04:58.300> that's<00:04:58.600> just<00:04:58.750> some

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
experience points so that's just some

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.030 
experience points so that's just some
interesting<00:04:59.620> facts<00:04:59.920> now<00:05:00.520> a<00:05:00.550> few<00:05:00.820> bugs<00:05:01.420> is<00:05:01.780> that

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
interesting facts now a few bugs is that

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.650 
interesting facts now a few bugs is that
in<00:05:03.040> the<00:05:03.190> previous<00:05:03.400> few<00:05:03.730> snapshots<00:05:04.000> it<00:05:04.390> hasn't

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
in the previous few snapshots it hasn't

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.050 
in the previous few snapshots it hasn't
really<00:05:04.780> been<00:05:04.960> noticed<00:05:05.380> but<00:05:05.620> fire<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.430> lava<00:05:06.610> no

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
really been noticed but fire and lava no

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.180 
really been noticed but fire and lava no
longer<00:05:07.450> makes<00:05:07.720> sounds<00:05:08.200> which<00:05:08.320> is<00:05:08.500> kind<00:05:08.890> of<00:05:08.950> sad

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
longer makes sounds which is kind of sad

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.360 
longer makes sounds which is kind of sad
i<00:05:09.250> guess<00:05:09.670> but<00:05:10.320> slimes<00:05:11.320> can<00:05:11.680> have<00:05:12.070> their

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
i guess but slimes can have their

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.000 
i guess but slimes can have their
original<00:05:13.270> jumping<00:05:13.690> animation<00:05:14.230> apparently

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
original jumping animation apparently

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.950 
original jumping animation apparently
they<00:05:15.100> were<00:05:15.220> glitching<00:05:15.580> out<00:05:15.700> in<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.540> past<00:05:16.780> few

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
they were glitching out in the past few

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.350 
they were glitching out in the past few
snapshots<00:05:17.260> and<00:05:17.710> villagers<00:05:18.220> once<00:05:18.550> again<00:05:18.790> can

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
snapshots and villagers once again can

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.270 
snapshots and villagers once again can
make<00:05:19.570> the<00:05:19.720> baby<00:05:20.200> you<00:05:20.560> know<00:05:20.680> to<00:05:20.740> make<00:05:20.980> a<00:05:21.010> baby

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
make the baby you know to make a baby

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.490 
make the baby you know to make a baby
yeah<00:05:21.670> they<00:05:21.850> can<00:05:22.060> as<00:05:22.690> long<00:05:22.750> as<00:05:23.170> they<00:05:23.320> have<00:05:23.470> a

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
yeah they can as long as they have a

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
yeah they can as long as they have a
house<00:05:23.710> but<00:05:24.010> they<00:05:24.160> don't<00:05:24.400> there

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
house but they don't there

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.450 
house but they don't there
in<00:05:25.819> that<00:05:26.330> fence<00:05:26.569> thingy<00:05:27.139> on<00:05:27.620> a<00:05:27.680> tree<00:05:27.949> so<00:05:28.250> I

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
in that fence thingy on a tree so I

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.170 
in that fence thingy on a tree so I
guess<00:05:28.910> they're<00:05:29.300> not<00:05:29.479> in<00:05:29.660> mood<00:05:29.870> maybe<00:05:30.910> but<00:05:31.910> yes

creative mode and you try and repair
items<00:05:38.810> if<00:05:39.560> you<00:05:39.710> put<00:05:39.919> two<00:05:40.069> golden<00:05:40.490> holes<00:05:40.699> and

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:40.879 
items if you put two golden holes and

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.879 
items if you put two golden holes and
you<00:05:40.970> craft<00:05:41.300> it<00:05:41.569> and<00:05:41.840> you<00:05:42.080> you<00:05:42.409> know<00:05:42.470> just<00:05:42.680> let

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
you craft it and you you know just let

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.460 
you craft it and you you know just let
go<00:05:43.129> as<00:05:43.400> you<00:05:44.150> can<00:05:44.300> see<00:05:44.629> you<00:05:44.659> will<00:05:44.990> get<00:05:45.229> three

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
go as you can see you will get three

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.740 
go as you can see you will get three
golden<00:05:46.009> holes<00:05:46.220> so<00:05:46.400> it<00:05:46.430> sort<00:05:46.819> of<00:05:46.879> duplicated<00:05:47.599> or

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
golden holes so it sort of duplicated or

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.629 
golden holes so it sort of duplicated or
I<00:05:48.199> don't<00:05:48.530> know<00:05:48.650> one<00:05:48.889> and<00:05:49.039> a<00:05:49.099> half<00:05:49.129> said

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
I don't know one and a half said

I don't know one and a half said
whatever<00:05:50.090> you<00:05:50.150> want<00:05:50.270> to<00:05:50.360> say<00:05:50.539> I<00:05:50.780> guess<00:05:51.500> but

whatever you want to say I guess but

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.070 
whatever you want to say I guess but
yeah<00:05:54.280> it's<00:05:55.280> unbeautiful<00:05:55.580> tilled<00:05:56.060> soil<00:05:56.150> it<00:05:56.870> was

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
yeah it's unbeautiful tilled soil it was

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.409 
yeah it's unbeautiful tilled soil it was
about<00:05:57.379> here<00:05:57.710> by<00:05:57.860> guest<00:05:58.220> squids<00:05:58.699> are<00:05:58.970> deciding

about here by guest squids are deciding
to<00:05:59.599> be<00:05:59.810> pieces<00:06:00.590> of<00:06:00.740> poop<00:06:00.919> also<00:06:01.280> the

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
to be pieces of poop also the

to be pieces of poop also the
duplicating<00:06:02.000> glitch<00:06:02.210> only<00:06:02.479> works<00:06:02.630> when<00:06:02.960> you

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
duplicating glitch only works when you

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.040 
duplicating glitch only works when you
repair<00:06:03.590> items<00:06:03.770> but<00:06:04.250> you<00:06:04.370> can<00:06:04.580> easily<00:06:05.449> use<00:06:05.479> this

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
repair items but you can easily use this

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.379 
repair items but you can easily use this
to<00:06:06.319> exploit<00:06:06.770> you<00:06:07.009> know<00:06:07.130> diamond<00:06:07.550> pickaxes<00:06:08.120> but

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
to exploit you know diamond pickaxes but

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:10.420 
to exploit you know diamond pickaxes but
who<00:06:08.960> cares<00:06:09.259> about<00:06:09.500> that<00:06:09.710> when<00:06:09.949> you<00:06:10.069> got<00:06:10.250> the

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
who cares about that when you got the

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.749 
who cares about that when you got the
golden<00:06:11.240> hose<00:06:11.569> million<00:06:12.259> but<00:06:12.759> transportation

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 
golden hose million but transportation

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.809 
golden hose million but transportation
yes<00:06:14.419> there<00:06:14.750> let's<00:06:15.050> not<00:06:15.229> try<00:06:15.800> and<00:06:15.860> buy<00:06:16.759> the

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:16.819 
yes there let's not try and buy the

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:19.749 
yes there let's not try and buy the
saddle<00:06:17.330> and<00:06:17.449> and<00:06:17.630> the<00:06:18.080> water<00:06:18.289> boat<00:06:19.069> so<00:06:19.430> boats

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 
saddle and and the water boat so boats

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:22.450 
saddle and and the water boat so boats
is<00:06:20.150> now<00:06:20.419> easier<00:06:20.930> to<00:06:21.110> control<00:06:21.349> in<00:06:22.099> the<00:06:22.219> water

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
is now easier to control in the water

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.219 
is now easier to control in the water
having<00:06:23.300> squid<00:06:23.750> is<00:06:23.810> not<00:06:23.960> very<00:06:24.169> good

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:24.229 
having squid is not very good

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:27.189 
having squid is not very good
example<00:06:24.409> but<00:06:24.949> they<00:06:25.490> can<00:06:25.699> also<00:06:25.990> accelerate<00:06:26.990> and

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 
example but they can also accelerate and

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.719 
example but they can also accelerate and
when<00:06:27.379> the<00:06:27.530> full<00:06:27.830> speed<00:06:28.129> they<00:06:28.280> move<00:06:28.520> much

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
when the full speed they move much

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.820 
when the full speed they move much
faster<00:06:28.759> than<00:06:29.750> they<00:06:29.990> used<00:06:30.229> to<00:06:30.409> and<00:06:30.500> this

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
faster than they used to and this

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.050 
faster than they used to and this
obviously<00:06:31.099> wasn't<00:06:31.490> a<00:06:31.610> very<00:06:31.699> good<00:06:31.819> example

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
obviously wasn't a very good example

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.629 
obviously wasn't a very good example
because<00:06:32.630> that<00:06:33.110> was<00:06:33.229> about<00:06:33.409> two<00:06:34.069> meters<00:06:34.430> long

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 
because that was about two meters long

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.809 
because that was about two meters long
anyway<00:06:35.300> um<00:06:35.710> that's<00:06:36.710> pretty<00:06:37.009> much<00:06:37.190> it<00:06:37.250> I'm<00:06:37.789> very

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:37.819 
anyway um that's pretty much it I'm very

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:39.969 
anyway um that's pretty much it I'm very
proud<00:06:38.389> of<00:06:38.449> myself<00:06:38.719> for<00:06:39.050> having<00:06:39.259> covered<00:06:39.800> all

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
proud of myself for having covered all

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.120 
proud of myself for having covered all
this<00:06:40.729> and<00:06:41.110> hopefully<00:06:42.110> I<00:06:42.139> didn't<00:06:42.529> miss<00:06:42.740> out<00:06:42.889> on

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130 
this and hopefully I didn't miss out on

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.490 
this and hopefully I didn't miss out on
too<00:06:43.250> much<00:06:43.659> in<00:06:44.659> case<00:06:44.870> you're<00:06:45.080> wondering<00:06:45.169> I<00:06:45.440> do

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
too much in case you're wondering I do

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
too much in case you're wondering I do
know<00:06:45.830> that<00:06:45.969> 12w<00:06:46.969> 23b<00:06:47.930> has<00:06:48.500> just<00:06:48.800> came<00:06:49.039> out<00:06:49.250> I

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
know that 12w 23b has just came out I

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.180 
know that 12w 23b has just came out I
found<00:06:50.449> out<00:06:50.599> right<00:06:50.810> before<00:06:50.960> I<00:06:51.199> recorded<00:06:51.979> this

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
found out right before I recorded this

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.730 
found out right before I recorded this
but<00:06:52.580> basically<00:06:53.270> it's<00:06:53.509> just<00:06:53.719> an<00:06:53.870> only<00:06:54.199> bug<00:06:54.440> fix

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
but basically it's just an only bug fix
