00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.470
 Come on, people, let's get together. 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.260
 the ideas for making the car is a 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.240
 angel hair an angel hair that 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.509
 is that tool that we use 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.199
 tries this year to be terminated more 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.900
 cute and with a perfect finish 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:25.800
 You will need two pieces of 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.640
 roller paper or a paper Parana 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.420
 centimeter by six feeling only two 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.600
 small pieces and a small piece of 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.649
 centimeters turnovski centimeters 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.270
 length 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.629
 You're going to need this one here. 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.469
 a cutting board of precise cuts 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.500
 it has both vertical and 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.309
 horizontal one centimeter of each 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.379
 square and that 's these lines and that 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.229
 angles of 45 degrees and it is 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.900
 A year we'll need to 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.710
 do our angel hair 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.670
 anyone who does not have his board can take the 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:17.610
 compass and mark there the 45 degree angle 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.560
 and also do without any problem 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.170
 first you'll get the two 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:28.829
 little pieces of an inch by six 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:33.060
 take a centimeter put the glue and a 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.850
 these pieces here 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.409
 and I'm going to get the beijing here to have 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.820
 my reference 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.720
 so look, I'll put it on, let it dry 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:49.170
 then I dry what I 'm going to do 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.750
 count from top to bottom of my 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.220
 meeting three squares means 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.579
 three centimeters 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:01.320
 So I've started counting since the 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:07.200
 I found here then 12 33 centimeters 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:12.080
 and I'm going to get a little piece that has nine 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.870
 centimeters and I'll put it here 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.450
 so here it is three centimeters I go 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:24.230
 tell yourself 123 of it all 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:27.860
 three centimeters and I'll expect to dry 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.840
 This glue she glues very fast and I 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.630
 I live in Brasilia, so here I am. 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.380
 heat you're doing here today already 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.470
 dried out 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:42.040
 The next step is to take the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.040
 tips 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.440
 Look how nice it's getting, I got it. 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.490
 my'll just fit in again 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.010
 triangle that forms the 45 degree angle 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.590
 and vote a centimeter here where I 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:13.070
 I fit it and I'll get my metal ruler. 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:16.570
 I'll put here and fortress by side 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.570
 with the mother taking care of the government nÃ© 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:29.360
 often our work is to 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:31.790
 I find myself sandpaper and just to make the 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.440
 finish to stay in a kitchen but 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.840
 cute is ready 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.580
 looks like it 's simple and has the same effect 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:44.120
 that of acrylic today is wood 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:48.890
 and to be more cute than I did 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.709
 I took Durex and looks only Durex and chain 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.900
 in the angel's hair 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.950
 so I hope you have that yours 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.390
 have enjoyed 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:02.920
 joining our ideas and until the next 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.920
