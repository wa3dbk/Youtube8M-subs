00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.569
 after so many years getting hard 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.649
 criticism of the fans for the lack of 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.650
 news 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.599
 naruto shippuden ultimate ninja storm 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.059
 revolution has come, promising to change 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.470
 that we know from the series in the words of 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.350
 know connect 2 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.420
 the game would have improved gameplay 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.580
 new mechanics and all the names that 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.779
 You always wanted to control the most 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.760
 various forms 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.320
 but if you were expecting the game 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.599
 of the series 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.149
 We're sorry to inform you that you're 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.300
 of the extremely opposite case 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.850
 in short everything that the revolution does of 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.980
 good seems to sum up a little pleasure for 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.780
 biggest fans of the series 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.390
 this comes in the form of three stories 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.149
 never before presented in the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.670
 manga or naruto anime being they the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.520
 formation of akatsuki the history of 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.379
 friendship of such hashish south and hitachi and 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.379
 one of the missions of the team trained by 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.930
 renato at least here we can say that the 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.910
 quality at work is impressive 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.159
 all stories received treatment 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.500
 careful with the right anime scenes 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.119
 made especially for the game 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.040
 and even though they are not plots 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.720
 completely surprising is 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.430
 interesting to see the investment that was 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.220
 made for fans 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.500
 besides the gigantic cast of names 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.930
 really is available in the new naruto 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.790
 shippuden then if you wanted to have the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.610
 chance to control each location 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.390
 already shown in series a is its 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.310
 chance 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.770
 you can choose the original version or 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.689
 replayed by edu tensei or even play 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.950
 with the version of naruto that just 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.680
 learn to use radio in gum if it were 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.869
 Until then the game would go down to a thousand marvels 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.420
 but it does not take long for naruto shippuden 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.610
 ultimate ninja storm revolution shows 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.369
 exactly the same weaknesses as your 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.899
 predecessors in gameplay for example 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.540
 the improvements are practically 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.369
 imperceptible in battles you still 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.649
 still doing the same thing 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.869
 add a little chakra run up 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.060
 from the enemy I smashed the attack button until 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.490
 end the stroke sequence and use the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.500
 your special attack then repeat the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.349
 process until the sides win 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.480
 to further worsen the situation 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.110
 difference in the style of fight of good part 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.110
 of people 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.900
 we are very very small both 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.490
 that after a few battles you 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.620
 You even forget who you are. 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.370
 already controlling that the strategy for 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.250
 to win 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.500
 does not change anything between each shinobi nor 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.090
 even the new skill categories 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.370
 make a big difference here 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.950
 this is because the supreme July systems 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.440
 awakening impact as long as they bring 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.100
 changes in gameplay are no 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.380
 novelty in the series a 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.470
 now you can only select which 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.810
 of the modes to choose with your character 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.390
 we can not fail to comment, of course. 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.280
 case of the painful location that the 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.780
 suffered for the Brazilian public 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.360
 if before the tradition of the game was 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.640
 horrible now we can be happy in 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.080
 know that she is only suffering from 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.900
 less serious errors 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.239
 even so the grammatical failures still 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.820
 and 11 are noticeable and 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.370
 unfortunately the questionable translations 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.470
 of certain terms remain as the name of 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.209
 lots of character scams 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.040
 at least the mistake oxy pain and Rasi 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.040
 continue with their Japanese names 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.860
 ae 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.180
 the cool looks make up for an experience 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.940
 mediocre game 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.680
 Unfortunately it does not and it seems that this is the 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.500
 bigger problem and naruto shippuden 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.600
 ultimate ninja storm revolution and only 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.340
 is concerned about bringing that visual that 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.770
 we both love manga 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.540
 in the process he ends up forgetting that 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.530
 a fighting game is more than scenes 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.200
 beautifuls 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.010
 what matters is the gameplay 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.310
 interesting that offers us a 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.470
 experience as a result of the 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.290
 evolution is the summit of all 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.850
 problems we saw repeated 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.130
 exhaustively their predecessors 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.940
 combining the weakest title of the entire 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.010
 series 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.860
 It's a shame to think that the end of the adventure 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.490
 of our favorite ninja will be marked by 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.490
 such a title 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:50.400
 check out the full review on bj so the 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.400
