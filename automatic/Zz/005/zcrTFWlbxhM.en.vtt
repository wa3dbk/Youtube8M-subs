00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.279
 focus training answers today by answering 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.109
 to our rock follower 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.240
 eller is a follower of the approach 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.910
 always accompanies our posts is 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.740
 always discussing information 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.730
 exchanging ideas with the proper focus 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.320
 interesting 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.930
 and this question cast we'll 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.449
 approach today is also quite 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.340
 interesting enough it says 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.890
 respect to you we could involve 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.960
 different regions of the brachial principle 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.380
 when performing the different forms of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.510
 footprint in triceps napoli exercise 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.309
 High is what we are going to see today. 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.940
 follow the video I 'm sure 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.940
 You'll like it a lot 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.789
 well, as I wrote in the call 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.089
 of the video o and read put us the following 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:53.390
 accompanied by supine or 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.820
 pronounced in the sad exercise of thread 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.500
 triceps napoli on high there were conditions 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.719
 we work with an efficient 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.789
 lateral head or medial head 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.949
 Long triceps is what we 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.590
 let's look now in broad lines 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.110
 see how we 'll look at the 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.640
 or doubts in the 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.250
 interpretation of it right 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.069
 we will get into a positioning and 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.920
 let's perform triceps exercise 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:21.140
 napoli when carrying out a further 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.789
 triceps on the pulley we're looking good 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.130
 with a footprint for nothing 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.869
 to carry out this exercise the question 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.479
 Eln is a footprint for nothing. 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.940
 if we now make a footprint 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.429
 supinated while maintaining exactly the same 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.950
 positioning that we execute 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.479
 previously for footprint for nothing else 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.299
 now with a signed footprint ie 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.890
 operated nothing and I perform exactly 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.729
 the same stabilization positioning 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.789
 corporal 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.950
 the arm positioning and the extension of the 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.359
 elbow with the same amplitude of 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.520
 previous job 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:55.100
 well to answer this euro issue 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.700
 we have to stick to hands a bit in 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.740
 anatomical question of the elbow 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.289
 if we look at the upi issue 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.640
 and pronation that is not actually in the 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.799
 elbow joint 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.500
 then sup movement in the eurozone he 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.100
 does not occur at the elbow joint 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.000
 this movement is a radio that rotates around 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.130
 of the urn and the insertion of the whole triceps 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.640
 so that heard his tendon is in 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.140
 process in the ballot box, that is, if we 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.480
 use an anatomy strategy 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.060
 palpatória is what I am going to show now 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.579
 You can test this at the gym. 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.160
 will realize that the leco year 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.049
 or rather the urn and olé when the urn does not 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.970
 moved in the pna are information 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.400
 because as I said before who 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.250
 wheel who moves the movement 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.519
 supination pronation is the bone radio too 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.489
 I'll put my left index finger 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.349
 on the lesson in union and through 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.090
 tactile sensation this here a strategy 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.920
 I'm going to do the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.210
 supination movement and promotion 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.040
 if you realize 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.560
 No one is doing this tour. 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.770
 you will realize there is no 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.380
 the volume of the ballot box is not 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.720
 who is moving is 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.280
 the radio to do supination information 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.500
 then in this situation of inspiration and 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.840
 pronation palpating the range of the UN 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.700
 people can clearly see 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.850
 palpatory anatomy that there is no 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.970
 during the operations 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.070
 information and remember that any insertion 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.950
 of the triceps brachii is lateral head 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:31.850
 medial head the long head the insertion 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.550
 what is is related to the elbow 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.130
 it is done through a tendon that is 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.680
 connects to the olé as of the urn 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.200
 so watch out if we make the 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.890
 execution of the brachial triceps with footprint 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.320
 supinated or supinated footprint or 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.230
 there is no effect on the 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.260
 positioning of the triceps 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.740
 brachial will not be modified 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.380
 the anatomical position of the patient's 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.180
 triceps brachii when we think of 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.610
 elbow as we're done 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.850
 to make an anatomy strategy 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.280
 and we find that there is no 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.480
 movement of the urn when it was in 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.510
 your hospitalization 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.090
 I repeat the radio move and there is no 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.970
 brachial triceps connection with radio 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.190
 So, let's move this way again. 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.310
 to interpret well when we get 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.890
 climb up to swim 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.900
 moreover pronated and perform the exercise 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.450
 we have a court position 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.810
 here to what exactly the same 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.330
 execute but this supinated movement 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.000
 so by anatomy we can 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.970
 identify that there is no differentiated action 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.030
 the triceps brachii under these conditions 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.010
 now we have to understand well that 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:52.060
 Positions of the shoulder may 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.810
 change the modification of the heads 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.270
 especially the long head of the 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.400
 brachial principle because a portion of the 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.860
 articular brachial triceps and 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.530
 interacts with the joint 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.930
 of the shoulder in extension is also a is a 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.910
 muscle a long head muscle region 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.889
 brachial prince who produces 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.550
 extension 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.530
 pump then the execution of the exercise 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.379
 modifying the positioning of the shoulder 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.819
 this may change the efficiency for 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:20.830
 more or less 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.389
 of the triceps long head and have 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.889
 some degree of effect on the other 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.050
 heads of the hotel 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.240
 now the simple fact of changing the 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.960
 positioning between supinated and pronated 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.349
 for running the triceps thread in the round 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.569
 in high napoli high there is no modification 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.520
 of muscular work what there is like me 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:42.460
 said is if we modified the 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.069
 the gre final positioning position 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.250
 of the shoulder in this exercise 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:51.009
 Here is the answer and analysis to the 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.870
 eiler rock and other followers too 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.180
 who commented on the same dynamics of 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.860
 how these positions 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:01.060
 differentiates reads numerals by 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.979
 muscular attraction, mainly of 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.669
 long head of the brachial triceps I go 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:05.889
 comment 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.479
 in an upcoming program for you where we 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.389
 Let's take a look at an issue now. 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:12.400
 of this exercise as it was today. 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.860
 the discussion was anatomical we're going 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.039
 analyze some biomechanical issues and 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.529
 of active long head failure 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.150
 of the triceps brachii and also arms of 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:23.680
 lever during the execution of this 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.879
 exercise but this will stay then the 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.830
 next program 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:28.629
 we do an analysis on it 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.819
 exercise but now incorporating a 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:33.370
 biomechanical and physiological analysis of 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:34.330
 active headache deficiency 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.610
 hotel principle 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.139
 I hope you have enjoyed it one more time. 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.509
 I thank the trump 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.409
 share our videos that 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:43.449
 our material 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:46.060
 we have several followers doing this 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:47.680
 contributing to the dissemination of 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.919
 of the material has focus, we only have the 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.419
 thank you and thank you very much for 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:54.550
 So much publicity, thank you. 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:55.629
 It was worth it and until our next 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.879
 program 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:59.439
 until then the question of having a 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:01.240
 appropriate body development with the 

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:03.069
 Perfect body is also we can 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.129
 question what a perfect body would be 

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:06.969
 under these conditions but as he put it in the 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:09.520
 situation 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:10.260
 we interpret as a body in the fort 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.930
 well defined 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.690
 like Philip Freeman then these conditions 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.950
 we have to imagine that yes 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.530
 training for a good period of time 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.020
 We can command commands to train well. 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.420
 has done with the powder loading of 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:28.160
 training plus nutrition as well 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.160
 made well regulated
