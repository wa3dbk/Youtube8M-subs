you should be flicking more out off the
nose<00:01:02.940> rather<00:01:03.690> than<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.199> down<00:01:04.920> enough<00:01:05.250> this

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
nose rather than like down enough this

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.780

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.700 
side but there you go in that 360 flip
you<00:01:08.970> flicked<00:01:09.360> your<00:01:09.479> front<00:01:09.810> foot<00:01:09.869> straight<00:01:10.500> out

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710

practice cool so I always show this

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.399 
practice cool so I always show this
sequence<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.970> all<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.270> tricks<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.840> don't<00:01:43.259> know

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
sequence of all the tricks I don't know

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.950 
sequence of all the tricks I don't know
if<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.680> did<00:01:44.130> all<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.460> those<00:01:44.909> or<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.479> do<00:01:45.689> all<00:01:45.930> of

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
if you did all of those or can do all of

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.319 
if you did all of those or can do all of
those<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.799> if<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.159> can't<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.850> definitely

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
those but if you can't you definitely

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.450 
those but if you can't you definitely
should<00:01:48.600> learn<00:01:48.780> all<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.170> those<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.009> exact

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
should learn all of those in that exact

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.569 
should learn all of those in that exact
order<00:01:51.259> cool<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.619> one<00:01:52.920> thing<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.369> do<00:01:53.549> to

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
order cool so one thing you can do to

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.420 
order cool so one thing you can do to
help<00:01:53.880> with<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> 360<00:01:54.720> flips<00:01:55.049> as<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.680> put

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
help with the 360 flips as you can put

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.700 
help with the 360 flips as you can put
your<00:01:56.520> back<00:01:56.729> wheels<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.210> crack<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:58.079> suggest

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
your back wheels in a crack I suggest

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.950 
your back wheels in a crack I suggest
you<00:01:58.829> do<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.219> rolling<00:01:59.969> with<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> little<00:02:00.780> bit<00:02:00.930> of

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
you do it rolling with a little bit of

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.230 
you do it rolling with a little bit of
speed<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.350> think<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.829> easier<00:02:02.189> but<00:02:02.939> here's<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
speed I think it's easier but here's the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.310 
speed I think it's easier but here's the
foot<00:02:03.600> position<00:02:03.829> um<00:02:04.829> i<00:02:05.729> have<00:02:06.479> my<00:02:06.630> front<00:02:07.020> foot<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
foot position um i have my front foot a

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.830 
foot position um i have my front foot a
lot<00:02:07.649> more<00:02:08.250> forward<00:02:08.879> on<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.149> board<00:02:09.420> than<00:02:09.660> you

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
lot more forward on the board than you

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.660 
lot more forward on the board than you
do<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.050> notice<00:02:10.500> your<00:02:10.679> front<00:02:10.920> foot<00:02:10.979> was<00:02:11.280> kind<00:02:11.580> of

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
do I notice your front foot was kind of

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.250 
do I notice your front foot was kind of
more<00:02:12.150> towards<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.599> middle<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.020> very

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
more towards the middle and very

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.340 
more towards the middle and very
straight

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
straight

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.510 
straight
which<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.590> fine<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.040> when<00:02:15.190> you're<00:02:15.310> first

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
which is fine and when you're first

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.480 
which is fine and when you're first
starting<00:02:15.670> 360<00:02:16.630> flips<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.410> can<00:02:17.710> help<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.280> to

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
starting 360 flips that can help you to

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.630 
starting 360 flips that can help you to
get<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.790> full<00:02:19.050> rotation<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.920> rotation<00:02:20.950> of

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
get the full rotation the rotation of

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.420 
get the full rotation the rotation of
the<00:02:21.790> 360<00:02:22.480> not<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:22.930> much<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.560> rotation<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.310> the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
the 360 not so much the rotation of the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.450 
the 360 not so much the rotation of the
flick<00:02:24.790> but<00:02:25.660> yeah<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:25.810> generally<00:02:26.320> use<00:02:26.350> about<00:02:27.220> the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
flick but yeah I generally use about the

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.730 
flick but yeah I generally use about the
same<00:02:27.850> foot<00:02:28.600> position<00:02:29.050> with<00:02:29.170> my<00:02:29.350> front<00:02:29.650> foot

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
same foot position with my front foot

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.670 
same foot position with my front foot
that<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.100> do<00:02:30.190> for<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.610> kickflip<00:02:31.180> but<00:02:32.020> with<00:02:32.380> my

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
that I do for a kickflip but with my

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.700 
that I do for a kickflip but with my
back<00:02:32.980> foot<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.580> just<00:02:34.570> hang<00:02:34.810> my<00:02:35.020> toes<00:02:35.290> off<00:02:35.560> the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
back foot I just hang my toes off the

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.160 
back foot I just hang my toes off the
edge<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.190> board<00:02:36.490> there<00:02:36.790> just<00:02:37.600> enough<00:02:37.900> so

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
edge of the board there just enough so

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.370 
edge of the board there just enough so
that<00:02:38.200> when<00:02:38.830> I<00:02:38.890> give<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.880> scoop<00:02:40.300> I<00:02:40.570> can<00:02:41.110> really

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
that when I give that scoop I can really

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.300 
that when I give that scoop I can really
powerhouse<00:02:42.310> my<00:02:42.640> tail<00:02:42.940> around<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:44.470> all<00:02:44.890> the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
powerhouse my tail around so all the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.250 
powerhouse my tail around so all the
power<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.790> this<00:02:46.300> trick<00:02:46.510> is<00:02:46.540> coming<00:02:46.960> from<00:02:47.080> your

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
power and this trick is coming from your

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.470 
power and this trick is coming from your
back<00:02:47.500> foot<00:02:47.800> it's<00:02:48.070> all<00:02:48.370> in<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.790> scoop<00:02:49.210> and

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
back foot it's all in that scoop and

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.210 
back foot it's all in that scoop and
then<00:02:49.930> your<00:02:50.080> front<00:02:50.320> foot<00:02:50.380> is<00:02:50.620> just<00:02:50.860> hanging

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
then your front foot is just hanging

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.000 
then your front foot is just hanging
around<00:02:51.510> just<00:02:52.510> ready<00:02:52.990> to<00:02:53.200> catch<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.620> board<00:02:53.860> and

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
around just ready to catch the board and

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.820 
around just ready to catch the board and
put<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.340> down<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:54.730> land<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.180> roll<00:02:55.330> away<00:02:55.830> cool

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
put it down and land and roll away cool

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.810 
put it down and land and roll away cool
so<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.070> said<00:02:57.340> I'm<00:02:57.430> going<00:02:57.520> to<00:02:57.610> give<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:57.790> some

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
so I said I'm going to give you some

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.450 
so I said I'm going to give you some
pointers<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.750> things<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.350> practice<00:02:59.860> on<00:03:00.160> ways

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
pointers of things to practice on ways

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.760 
pointers of things to practice on ways
to<00:03:00.640> learn<00:03:01.600> this<00:03:01.840> trick<00:03:02.020> so<00:03:02.320> that's<00:03:02.590> what<00:03:02.710> I'm

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
to learn this trick so that's what I'm

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.980 
to learn this trick so that's what I'm
going<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:02.920> do<00:03:03.070> now<00:03:03.250> so<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.180> noticed<00:03:04.540> I'm<00:03:04.720> one<00:03:04.870> of

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
going to do now so I noticed I'm one of

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.900 
going to do now so I noticed I'm one of
them<00:03:05.110> you<00:03:05.620> stepped<00:03:06.130> off<00:03:06.310> with<00:03:06.490> your<00:03:06.640> back<00:03:06.880> foot

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
them you stepped off with your back foot

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.630 
them you stepped off with your back foot
and<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:08.050> flicked<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.500> quite<00:03:08.920> well<00:03:09.190> with<00:03:09.460> your

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
and you flicked it quite well with your

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.460 
and you flicked it quite well with your
front<00:03:09.910> foot<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.480> then<00:03:10.990> you<00:03:11.140> were<00:03:11.200> able<00:03:11.290> to

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
front foot and then you were able to

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.590 
front foot and then you were able to
catch<00:03:11.830> it<00:03:12.010> with<00:03:12.130> your<00:03:12.160> front<00:03:12.520> foot<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:12.820> put<00:03:13.480> it

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
catch it with your front foot and put it

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.780 
catch it with your front foot and put it
down<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:14.650> want<00:03:14.830> you<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.070> practice<00:03:15.310> that

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
down so I want you to practice that

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.720 
down so I want you to practice that
until<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.840> get<00:03:17.080> that<00:03:17.380> step<00:03:17.860> of<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.190> really

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
until you get that step of it really

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.390 
until you get that step of it really
really<00:03:19.120> really<00:03:19.330> really<00:03:19.510> down<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:21.100> I<00:03:21.160> want<00:03:21.310> you

above it and then when it accomplishes

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.310 
above it and then when it accomplishes
