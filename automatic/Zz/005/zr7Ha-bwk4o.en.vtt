00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.050 

so<00:00:01.230> this<00:00:01.350> is<00:00:01.500> a<00:00:01.530> good<00:00:01.740> way<00:00:01.890> of<00:00:01.920> getting<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.700> stock

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
so this is a good way of getting a stock

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.360 
so this is a good way of getting a stock
split<00:00:03.300> that's<00:00:03.810> what<00:00:04.529> I<00:00:04.560> like<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:04.980> call<00:00:05.009> the

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
split that's what I like to call the

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.810 
split that's what I like to call the
ripcord<00:00:05.790> technique<00:00:06.299> where<00:00:07.200> you<00:00:07.290> just<00:00:07.670> put<00:00:08.670> the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
ripcord technique where you just put the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.419 
ripcord technique where you just put the
stock<00:00:09.150> between<00:00:09.690> two<00:00:09.900> pieces<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.410> wood<00:00:10.710> high

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
stock between two pieces of wood high

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.910 
stock between two pieces of wood high
pressure<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.120> pull<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.540> on<00:00:12.660> through<00:00:12.920> works

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
pressure and pull it on through works

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.070 
pressure and pull it on through works
pretty<00:00:14.219> quickly<00:00:14.719> about<00:00:15.719> one<00:00:16.020> way<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.379> mini

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
pretty quickly about one way of mini

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.170 
pretty quickly about one way of mini
this<00:00:19.080> technique<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.619> pretty<00:00:19.770> simple<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:21.000> lay

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
this technique is pretty simple you lay

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.970 
this technique is pretty simple you lay
a<00:00:21.210> handful<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.779> stocks<00:00:22.170> parallel<00:00:22.800> with<00:00:22.949> each

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
a handful of stocks parallel with each

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.689 
a handful of stocks parallel with each
other<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.699> just<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.660> know<00:00:24.720> walks<00:00:25.080> down<00:00:25.350> them

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
other and just you know walks down them

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.099 
other and just you know walks down them
you're<00:00:26.699> limited<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.300> large<00:00:27.510> flat<00:00:27.630> surface

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
you're limited to a large flat surface

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.310 
you're limited to a large flat surface
but<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.250> very<00:00:29.400> respected<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.990> thing<00:00:31.199> to

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
but it is very respected one thing to

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.709 
but it is very respected one thing to
watch<00:00:31.470> out<00:00:31.710> for<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:32.340> not<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.940> cross<00:00:33.239> stocks

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
watch out for is not the cross stocks

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.400 
watch out for is not the cross stocks
too<00:00:34.079> much<00:00:34.320> as<00:00:34.590> those<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.399> be<00:00:35.460> areas<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.410> mess

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
too much as those can be areas that mess

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:47.720 
too much as those can be areas that mess
with<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> evenness<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.640> split<00:00:45.950> so<00:00:46.950> now

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
with the evenness of the split so now

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.450 
with the evenness of the split so now
we've<00:00:48.059> got<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.420> stock<00:00:48.660> split<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:50.010> got<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.309> go

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
we've got the stock split we got to go

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.660 
we've got the stock split we got to go
into<00:00:50.879> getting<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.780> fibers<00:00:52.770> removed<00:00:53.190> from<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
into getting the fibers removed from the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.229 
into getting the fibers removed from the
wood<00:00:53.820> inside<00:00:55.100> we<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.309> accomplish<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.180> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
wood inside we can accomplish this in a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.069 
wood inside we can accomplish this in a
couple<00:00:57.600> ways<00:00:57.859> one<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.480> open<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.840> split

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
couple ways one is to open up the split

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.830 
couple ways one is to open up the split
in<00:01:01.320> one<00:01:01.500> area<00:01:01.710> stick<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> stick<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.510> slide

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
in one area stick a stick in and slide

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.950 
in one area stick a stick in and slide
it<00:01:04.049> right<00:01:04.080> down<00:01:04.729> you<00:01:05.729> end<00:01:06.030> up<00:01:06.330> splitting<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
it right down you end up splitting the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.730 
it right down you end up splitting the
stock<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.560> half<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:09.930> might<00:01:10.170> also<00:01:10.470> just

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
stock in half and you might also just

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.550 
stock in half and you might also just
have<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.970> fibers<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.630> start<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.080> run<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
have the fibers just start to run and

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.130 
have the fibers just start to run and
peel<00:01:14.070> off<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.520> bark<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:15.450> then<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.900> peel<00:01:16.110> it

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
peel off the bark but then to peel it

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.109 
peel off the bark but then to peel it
off<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.530> stick<00:01:16.740> your<00:01:16.860> finger<00:01:17.220> right<00:01:17.549> between

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
off to stick your finger right between

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.960 
off to stick your finger right between
the<00:01:18.570> outer<00:01:18.780> bark<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:20.159> woody<00:01:20.400> part<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the outer bark and the woody part and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.440 
the outer bark and the woody part and
then<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.810> slide<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.409> through

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
then just slide it through

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.200 
then just slide it through
well<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.630> little<00:01:25.020> freeze-frame<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.979> there<00:01:26.210> but

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
well a little freeze-frame in there but

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.990 
well a little freeze-frame in there but
I<00:01:27.930> think<00:01:28.799> we'll<00:01:28.979> catch<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.460> take<00:01:29.700> one<00:01:29.880> more

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
I think we'll catch that take one more

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.740 
I think we'll catch that take one more
time<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.710> we'll<00:01:31.710> put<00:01:31.979> put<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> thumb<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.119> slide

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
time so we'll put put a thumb in slide

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.899 
time so we'll put put a thumb in slide
it<00:01:33.930> down<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.200> stock<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:35.189> that's<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.549> place<00:01:35.759> of

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
it down the stock and that's in place of

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.330 
it down the stock and that's in place of
the<00:01:36.000> stick<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:37.049> get<00:01:37.170> splinters<00:01:37.470> so

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
the stick but you can get splinters so

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.740 
the stick but you can get splinters so
it's<00:01:38.490> good<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.790> make<00:01:38.909> sure<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.360> split<00:01:39.630> is

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
it's good to make sure that the split is

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.149 
it's good to make sure that the split is
even<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.350> don't<00:01:40.500> get<00:01:40.590> splinters<00:01:40.860> right

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
even so you don't get splinters right

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.499 
even so you don't get splinters right
here<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.909> then<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.759> wanted<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.909> flatten<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
here and then and wanted to flatten it

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.999 
here and then and wanted to flatten it
out<00:01:45.680> so<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.920> got<00:01:47.159> all<00:01:47.369> nice<00:01:48.380> nice<00:01:49.380> four

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
out so that you got all nice nice four

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.630 
out so that you got all nice nice four
even<00:01:50.460> sections<00:01:51.140> crack<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.320> right<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:52.710> stick

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
even sections crack it right there stick

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.789 
even sections crack it right there stick
my<00:01:53.820> finger<00:01:54.240> between<00:01:54.899> them<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.380> slide<00:01:55.770> right

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
my finger between them and slide right

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.090 
my finger between them and slide right
through<00:01:56.479> you'll<00:01:57.479> be<00:01:57.840> able<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.680> know<00:01:58.710> you'll

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
through you'll be able you know you'll

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.719 
through you'll be able you know you'll
have<00:01:59.930> extra<00:02:00.930> fibers<00:02:01.350> left<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.520> wooden

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
have extra fibers left on the wooden

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.569 
have extra fibers left on the wooden
stocks<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:04.380> know<00:02:04.469> it's<00:02:04.649> very<00:02:04.920> dependent

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
stocks but you know it's very dependent

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.499 
stocks but you know it's very dependent
on<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.060> time<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.479> year<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.500> harvest<00:02:07.860> it

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
on the time of year that you harvest it

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.050 
on the time of year that you harvest it
in<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.810> end<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.890> fibers<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.370> don't<00:02:11.790> come

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
in the end the fibers that don't come

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.670 
in the end the fibers that don't come
off<00:02:12.379> are

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
off are

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.289 
off are
gonna<00:02:13.769> be<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:13.980> little<00:02:14.189> bit<00:02:14.430> short<00:02:14.730> anyway<00:02:15.060> and

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
gonna be a little bit short anyway and

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.750 
gonna be a little bit short anyway and
be<00:02:15.359> a<00:02:15.390> pain<00:02:15.659> in<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.840> ass<00:02:16.049> so<00:02:16.489> just<00:02:17.489> have<00:02:17.730> a

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
be a pain in the ass so just have a

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.520 
be a pain in the ass so just have a
bunch<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.269> you<00:02:18.629> know<00:02:18.780> if<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.109> are<00:02:19.260> very

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
bunch of you know if you are very

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.009 
bunch of you know if you are very
limited<00:02:20.489> on<00:02:20.819> materials<00:02:21.420> then<00:02:21.629> you<00:02:21.750> can<00:02:21.930> go

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
limited on materials then you can go

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.420 
limited on materials then you can go
back<00:02:22.049> and<00:02:22.439> crack<00:02:22.650> off<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.920> rest<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.340> the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
back and crack off the rest of the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.050 
back and crack off the rest of the
fibers<00:02:23.819> but<00:02:24.629> anyway<00:02:25.189> what<00:02:26.189> I'm<00:02:26.310> doing<00:02:26.609> here<00:02:26.909> is

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
fibers but anyway what I'm doing here is

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.020 
fibers but anyway what I'm doing here is
a<00:02:27.769> buffing<00:02:28.769> up<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:29.010> fibers<00:02:29.400> now<00:02:29.579> because<00:02:29.879> they

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
a buffing up the fibers now because they

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.259 
a buffing up the fibers now because they
have<00:02:30.120> an<00:02:30.209> outside<00:02:30.719> bar<00:02:30.989> can<00:02:31.139> inside<00:02:31.650> bark<00:02:31.920> in

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
have an outside bar can inside bark in

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.319 
have an outside bar can inside bark in
outside<00:02:33.269> bark<00:02:33.569> will<00:02:34.409> if<00:02:35.219> left<00:02:35.549> on<00:02:35.760> will<00:02:36.180> make

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
outside bark will if left on will make

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.470 
outside bark will if left on will make
it<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.569> little<00:02:36.840> bit<00:02:37.019> harder<00:02:37.409> to<00:02:37.439> roll<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:39.030> leave

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
it a little bit harder to roll and leave

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.959 
it a little bit harder to roll and leave
a<00:02:39.510> little<00:02:39.870> bit<00:02:40.079> of<00:02:40.189> loose<00:02:41.189> it'll<00:02:41.549> loosen<00:02:41.730> up

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969 
a little bit of loose it'll loosen up

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:43.520 
a little bit of loose it'll loosen up
the<00:02:42.120> string<00:02:42.450> basically<00:02:42.989> as<00:02:43.109> those<00:02:43.319> little

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
the string basically as those little

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.710 
the string basically as those little
pieces<00:02:43.829> get<00:02:44.250> worked<00:02:44.549> out<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.120> rope<00:02:45.450> and

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
pieces get worked out in the rope and

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.770 
pieces get worked out in the rope and
they<00:02:46.260> can<00:02:46.409> also<00:02:46.530> cut<00:02:46.889> into<00:02:47.159> the<00:02:47.280> fibers<00:02:47.669> so<00:02:47.909> it

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
they can also cut into the fibers so it

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.199 
they can also cut into the fibers so it
just<00:02:48.989> buff<00:02:49.200> them<00:02:49.379> up<00:02:49.500> really<00:02:49.709> good<00:02:49.980> now<00:02:50.970> we're

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
just buff them up really good now we're

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.149 
just buff them up really good now we're
going<00:02:51.389> to<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.720> stage<00:02:51.989> where<00:02:52.620> we<00:02:52.650> actually

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
going to the stage where we actually

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.190 
going to the stage where we actually
wrap<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.519> up<00:02:53.669> so<00:02:53.939> as<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.299> fold<00:02:54.629> it<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:54.959> half<00:02:54.989> so

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
wrap it up so as I fold it in half so

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.059 
wrap it up so as I fold it in half so
I've<00:02:55.530> got<00:02:55.680> two<00:02:55.859> bundles<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.519> I<00:02:57.329> just<00:02:57.599> spin<00:02:58.139> the

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
I've got two bundles and I just spin the

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.929 
I've got two bundles and I just spin the
top<00:02:59.959> bundle<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.189> for<00:03:02.189> me<00:03:02.310> it's<00:03:02.669> going

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
top bundle and for me it's going

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.530 
top bundle and for me it's going
probably<00:03:03.540> it's<00:03:03.810> spinning<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.319> away<00:03:04.950> from<00:03:05.189> me

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
probably it's spinning it away from me

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.539 
probably it's spinning it away from me
I<00:03:06.569> guess<00:03:07.109> I'm<00:03:07.260> wrapping<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.650> clockwise<00:03:07.950> and

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
I guess I'm wrapping it clockwise and

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.409 
I guess I'm wrapping it clockwise and
then<00:03:09.419> I'm<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:11.040> then<00:03:11.189> I'm<00:03:11.340> reverse<00:03:11.969> wrapping

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
then I'm and then I'm reverse wrapping

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.149 
then I'm and then I'm reverse wrapping
it<00:03:12.510> counterclockwise<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.469> to<00:03:13.530> spin<00:03:13.889> the<00:03:14.010> top

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
it counterclockwise so to spin the top

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.129 
it counterclockwise so to spin the top
one<00:03:14.400> clockwise<00:03:14.790> wrap<00:03:15.419> it<00:03:15.569> over<00:03:15.629> the<00:03:15.810> bottom

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
one clockwise wrap it over the bottom

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.080 
one clockwise wrap it over the bottom
one<00:03:16.260> counterclockwise<00:03:16.769> wrap<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.639> top<00:03:17.849> one

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
one counterclockwise wrap the top one

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.990 
one counterclockwise wrap the top one
clockwise<00:03:19.040> cross<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.280> over<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.699> bottom

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
clockwise cross it over to the bottom

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.439 
clockwise cross it over to the bottom
one

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
one

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.330 
one
counterclockwise<00:03:21.959> your<00:03:22.709> bottom<00:03:23.040> one<00:03:23.220> will

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
counterclockwise your bottom one will

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.879 
counterclockwise your bottom one will
keep<00:03:23.489> coming<00:03:23.849> to<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> top<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.659> you'll<00:03:25.620> just

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
keep coming to the top and you'll just

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.439 
keep coming to the top and you'll just
keep<00:03:26.099> doing<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.489> same<00:03:26.729> thing<00:03:27.000> but<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.329> just

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
keep doing the same thing but it just

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.809 
keep doing the same thing but it just
keeps<00:03:27.599> switching<00:03:27.930> bundles<00:03:28.470> each<00:03:28.560> time<00:03:28.829> you

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
keeps switching bundles each time you

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.069 
keeps switching bundles each time you
know<00:03:29.939> it<00:03:30.090> has<00:03:30.209> bundles<00:03:30.709> bundles<00:03:31.709> uh<00:03:32.750> I'll<00:03:33.750> show

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
know it has bundles bundles uh I'll show

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.990 
know it has bundles bundles uh I'll show
you<00:03:34.139> how<00:03:34.319> to<00:03:34.379> add<00:03:34.590> in<00:03:34.799> more<00:03:35.040> fibers<00:03:35.430> later<00:03:35.699> but

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
you how to add in more fibers later but

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.500 
you how to add in more fibers later but
this<00:03:36.180> is<00:03:36.359> the<00:03:36.479> basic<00:03:36.840> concentrate
