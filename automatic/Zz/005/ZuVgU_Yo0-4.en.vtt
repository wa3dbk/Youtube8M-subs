00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.750
 hello guys we are here once more with 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.150
 the real tips 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.799
 Today we are going to show you a new way 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.540
 to put their shoelaces on their shoes 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.969
 so they can adjust them adjust them 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.010
 more easily and so when they put it 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:22.199
 and take it off do not have so many 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.199
 problems since for example yesterday 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.230
 and after 30 minutes 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.790
 and now I have to remove them 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.270
 la noire and that's why today we're going to 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.729
 teach a new way to place your 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.119
 laces for tennis with this new 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.119
 shape 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.990
 I adjusted them 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.020
 and adjustments without problems 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.450
 and it is already 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.560
 to take away the 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.850
 good to mismatch 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.970
 and remove 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.400
 perfect and easier here we go 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.020
 once we have the tennis and the 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.830
 separate cords 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.830
 we divide 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.890
 the shorts in half 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.400
 then we put one of the ends for a 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.050
 side down, starting with 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.630
 put it on the bottom 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.630
 and we do the same with the other side 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.150
 we stretch them and now we start in each 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.720
 side 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.720
 to put 11 on the outside 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.300
 seeing that this is lawful 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.500
 and another inside 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.930
 one on the outside 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.450
 always on the same side 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.180
 when we get to last to last 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.690
 we leave that side and continue 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.690
 with the other 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.010
 and we do the same 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.950
 ok once we have it that way we start 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.950
 a between coursing our ropes 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.230
 very important that we get from 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.510
 top down 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.570
 because if not if we do it the other way around 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.210
 it will serve to unsettle us 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.970
 easily 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.970
 below it up and then below 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.099
 and so on 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.640
 with the rest of the shoes 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:12.930
 and there is already a very easy way to put 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.759
 its very original laces 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.759
 that can adjust and adjust 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.870
 quickly 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.680
 tatxan 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:30.939
