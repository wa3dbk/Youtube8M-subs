00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:17.640
 electricity has a source 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.520
 generated some electricity there 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.680
 electricity has a closed circuit 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.680
 needed to move 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.440
 but how it prefers electricity 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.440
 uses the consumer 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.430
 used is the electrical energy of 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.730
 the source 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.360
 the light ensures that the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.350
 battery 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.010
 will be empty over time 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.390
 this electrical energy is converted 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.220
 light and heat this is a light edge 6 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.460
 god i have here 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.410
 lamp of 12 volts it goes more light 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.410
 is yellow 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.439
 Hi 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:13.460
 light is on sixty bath because the 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.579
 lamp 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.880
 requires more energy than the source can 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.899
 therefore supplying has more power 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.110
 required 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:28.100
 this is expressed in watts 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.679
 mail what's on your lamp that's the more 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.159
 your source will have to deliver 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:36.049
 So the more light you want to send me to you 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.420
 will break 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.319
 here are the mass consumers 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.860
 large and small electrical appliances 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.360
 consume some energy many others 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.329
 few 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.170
 you can tell by the energy label of 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.829
 green 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.640
 very economical to a lot 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.369
 energy-wasting 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.719
 so we have a lot of consumers in it 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.360
 us going 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:06.399
 so what you never like when you get them 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.649
 do not need everything you waste energy 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:17.200
 That's all that you now look just like you 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:17.200
 room leaves cover
