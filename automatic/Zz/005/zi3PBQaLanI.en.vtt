 the natural postures of the doll 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.510
 thus avoiding injuries after

 intensive days of competitive game 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.140
 Its attractive and aggressive design comes with

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.090
 first of all we found an armor

 with hydrophobic coating 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.090
 Anti-skid to combat 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.369
 accumulation of heat and sweat in 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.320
 intense contact areas have added a 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.729
 anti-fingerprint coating on everything 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.549

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.479
 braided anti knots 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.810
 and anti shock very resistant its weight is 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.420
 145 grams and is also equipped with 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.130
 five weights of 36 grams each with 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.960
 which we can customize the weight of 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.960
 mouse and find the perfect balance 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.000
 for a better use the lid has a 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.679
 magnet closure very nice forgetting 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.750
 completely those covers with complicated 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.920
 closing tabs that hinders the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.920
 placement of the weights 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.820

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.530
 being able to use them indistinctly without 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.360
 import what computer we use has 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.690

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.870
 dizzying maneuvers with a 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.150
 millisecond response speed 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.980
 which we can change during the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.330
 game thanks to its three leds 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.310
 tepic indicators 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.990

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.040
 bright colored or any other 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.870

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.150
 the internal software will detect what 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.320
 type of surface is sliding and 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.200
 will adapt to give the best 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.270
