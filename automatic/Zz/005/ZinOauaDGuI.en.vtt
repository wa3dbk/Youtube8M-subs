00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
where I do my let's play on I haven't

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.240 
where I do my let's play on I haven't
been<00:03:04.170> uploading<00:03:04.350> much<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.770> this<00:03:04.860> but<00:03:05.040> as<00:03:05.130> you

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
been uploading much to this but as you

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.060 
been uploading much to this but as you
can<00:03:05.340> see<00:03:05.750> this<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:07.080> what<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.410> looks<00:03:07.620> like<00:03:07.680> so

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
can see this is what it looks like so

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.550 
can see this is what it looks like so
you<00:03:08.360> may<00:03:09.360> say<00:03:09.600> just<00:03:09.810> looks<00:03:09.960> lighter<00:03:10.260> but

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
you may say just looks lighter but

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.660 
you may say just looks lighter but
really<00:03:10.800> if<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:10.920> look<00:03:11.010> at<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.220> lighting<00:03:11.580> and

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
really if you look at the lighting and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.820 
really if you look at the lighting and
stuff<00:03:11.820> it's<00:03:12.090> not<00:03:12.360> just<00:03:12.420> lighter<00:03:13.080> blocks<00:03:13.560> it's

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
stuff it's not just lighter blocks it's

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.140 
stuff it's not just lighter blocks it's
out<00:03:13.920> what<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.130> case<00:03:14.280> they<00:03:14.490> would<00:03:14.670> just<00:03:14.880> change

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
out what the case they would just change

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.970 
out what the case they would just change
the<00:03:15.330> terrain<00:03:15.510> file<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.320> make<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.620> textures

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
the terrain file and make the textures

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.880 
the terrain file and make the textures
lighter<00:03:17.640> but<00:03:18.420> they<00:03:18.900> actually<00:03:19.320> changed<00:03:19.650> all

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
lighter but they actually changed all

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.770 
lighter but they actually changed all
the<00:03:20.100> files<00:03:20.370> inside<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.120> technically<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:21.750> a

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
the files inside so technically it is a

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.970 
the files inside so technically it is a
mod<00:03:22.850> them<00:03:23.850> as<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.300> can<00:03:24.330> see<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.960> wood<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.710> don't

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
mod them as you can see the wood I don't

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.410 
mod them as you can see the wood I don't
know<00:03:26.040> all<00:03:26.310> these<00:03:26.460> I<00:03:26.670> think<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.090> tortures

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
know all these I think that tortures

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.270 
know all these I think that tortures
look<00:03:27.510> really<00:03:27.660> nice<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.020> water<00:03:28.290> looks<00:03:28.950> so

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
look really nice in the water looks so

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.280 
look really nice in the water looks so
cool<00:03:29.580> how<00:03:30.240> like<00:03:30.270> stuff<00:03:30.630> shines<00:03:30.930> straight

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
cool how like stuff shines straight

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.960 
cool how like stuff shines straight
through<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.680> looks<00:03:31.980> awesome<00:03:32.490> awesome<00:03:32.700> awesome

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970

and<00:03:35.640> look<00:03:35.910> at<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.480> water<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:37.170> think<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.590> look<00:03:37.710> so

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
and look at the water I think I look so

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.960 
and look at the water I think I look so
cool<00:03:38.040> actually<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.370> hell<00:03:38.490> of<00:03:38.610> Oh<00:03:38.670> we'll<00:03:38.880> go

cool actually the hell of Oh we'll go
back<00:03:39.090> down<00:03:39.270> and<00:03:39.300> look<00:03:39.570> at<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.780> river<00:03:39.990> that

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
back down and look at the river that

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.950 
back down and look at the river that
I've<00:03:41.070> built<00:03:41.400> myself<00:03:41.580> it's<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.150> man-made<00:03:42.420> River

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
I've built myself it's a man-made River

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.160 
I've built myself it's a man-made River
I<00:03:43.260> like<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.130> do<00:03:44.220> my<00:03:44.340> rivers<00:03:44.580> that<00:03:44.730> way<00:03:45.170> alright

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
I like to do my rivers that way alright

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.990 
I like to do my rivers that way alright
so<00:03:46.350> as<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:46.560> can<00:03:46.620> see<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:47.160> just<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.580> don't<00:03:47.850> know

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
so as you can see it just I don't know

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.210 
so as you can see it just I don't know
you<00:03:48.900> may<00:03:49.050> you<00:03:49.200> may<00:03:49.230> have<00:03:49.440> had<00:03:49.590> opinions<00:03:49.890> and

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
you may you may have had opinions and

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.770 
you may you may have had opinions and
think<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:50.520> does<00:03:50.670> not<00:03:50.940> look<00:03:51.180> better<00:03:51.420> but<00:03:51.690> I

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
think this does not look better but I

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.690 
think this does not look better but I
think<00:03:51.990> this<00:03:52.050> works<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.320> lot<00:03:52.560> better<00:03:52.700> than

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
think this works a lot better than

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.210 
think this works a lot better than
default<00:03:54.210> of<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.510> game<00:03:54.720> um<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.860> doesn't<00:03:56.010> of

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
default of the game um it doesn't of

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.650 
default of the game um it doesn't of
course<00:03:56.430> have<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.640> reflective<00:03:57.120> surface<00:03:57.450> like

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
course have the reflective surface like

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.130 
course have the reflective surface like
PC<00:03:58.050> shaders<00:03:58.380> but<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.800> would<00:03:58.920> be<00:03:58.950> to<00:04:00.140> lag

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
PC shaders but that would be to lag

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.650 
PC shaders but that would be to lag
intensive<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:02.060> yes<00:04:03.060> as<00:04:03.240> you<00:04:03.360> can<00:04:03.450> see<00:04:03.630> uh

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
intensive and yes as you can see uh

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.420 
intensive and yes as you can see uh
let's<00:04:04.170> try<00:04:04.320> my<00:04:04.440> render<00:04:04.680> distance<00:04:04.710> up<00:04:05.130> it<00:04:05.280> does

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
let's try my render distance up it does

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.570 
let's try my render distance up it does
cause<00:04:05.670> some<00:04:05.700> more<00:04:06.030> lag<00:04:06.240> because<00:04:07.020> it<00:04:07.800> is<00:04:07.920> it<00:04:08.400> is

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
cause some more lag because it is it is

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.090 
cause some more lag because it is it is
seriously<00:04:08.970> better<00:04:09.420> shaders<00:04:09.870> then<00:04:10.230> um<00:04:10.440> the

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
seriously better shaders then um the

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.860 
seriously better shaders then um the
default<00:04:11.610> game<00:04:11.850> and<00:04:12.240> I<00:04:12.390> think<00:04:12.600> this<00:04:12.690> would<00:04:12.840> work

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
default game and I think this would work

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.380 
default game and I think this would work
with<00:04:13.140> any<00:04:13.260> texture<00:04:13.650> pack<00:04:13.800> you<00:04:13.920> have<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.390> so

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
with any texture pack you have to so

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.370 
with any texture pack you have to so
that<00:04:15.510> would<00:04:15.600> be<00:04:15.690> really<00:04:15.900> cool<00:04:16.020> to<00:04:16.109> see<00:04:16.200> I

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
that would be really cool to see I

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.630 
that would be really cool to see I
haven't<00:04:16.770> actually<00:04:16.859> seen<00:04:17.040> what<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.430> looks

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
haven't actually seen what that looks

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.830 
haven't actually seen what that looks
like<00:04:17.760> let's<00:04:17.970> head<00:04:18.120> on<00:04:18.150> over<00:04:18.270> to<00:04:18.540> another

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
like let's head on over to another

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.610 
like let's head on over to another
survival<00:04:19.290> world

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
survival world

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.840 
survival world
I<00:04:19.710> think<00:04:19.890> this<00:04:20.010> one's<00:04:20.130> at<00:04:20.250> night<00:04:20.460> so<00:04:20.640> we<00:04:20.670> can

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
I think this one's at night so we can

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.130 
I think this one's at night so we can
check<00:04:21.030> out<00:04:21.150> what<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.359> one<00:04:21.450> see<00:04:21.600> this<00:04:21.720> looks

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
check out what that one see this looks

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.830 
check out what that one see this looks
like<00:04:22.320> yeah<00:04:23.040> so<00:04:23.880> I'm<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.180> torturer<00:04:24.480> looks<00:04:24.660> so

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
like yeah so I'm the torturer looks so

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.520 
like yeah so I'm the torturer looks so
cool

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
cool

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.960 
cool
you<00:04:25.890> can't<00:04:26.100> tell<00:04:26.310> too<00:04:26.550> much<00:04:26.730> of<00:04:26.880> it

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
you can't tell too much of it

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.280 
you can't tell too much of it
indifference<00:04:27.600> it's<00:04:27.750> mainly<00:04:27.900> just<00:04:28.050> like<00:04:28.230> a

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
indifference it's mainly just like a

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.460 
indifference it's mainly just like a
light<00:04:29.750> change<00:04:30.750> to<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:30.990> game<00:04:31.170> if<00:04:31.290> you<00:04:31.320> look

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
light change to the game if you look

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.900 
light change to the game if you look
over<00:04:31.650> here<00:04:31.680> this<00:04:31.980> looks<00:04:32.100> so<00:04:32.310> cool<00:04:32.490> look<00:04:32.730> at<00:04:32.820> the

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
over here this looks so cool look at the

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.300 
over here this looks so cool look at the
doors<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:34.050> torch<00:04:34.350> is<00:04:34.500> shining<00:04:34.830> on<00:04:34.920> them<00:04:35.040> and

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
doors the torch is shining on them and

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.980 
doors the torch is shining on them and
I'll<00:04:35.669> tell<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:35.910> what<00:04:36.060> this<00:04:36.180> looks<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:36.690> much

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
I'll tell you what this looks so much

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.670 
I'll tell you what this looks so much
better<00:04:37.229> in<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:37.770> game

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
better in the game

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.430 
better in the game
so<00:04:39.460> even<00:04:40.360> if<00:04:40.449> you<00:04:40.540> don't<00:04:40.690> think<00:04:40.810> you<00:04:41.020> like<00:04:41.139> it<00:04:41.199> I

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
so even if you don't think you like it I

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.719 
so even if you don't think you like it I
bet<00:04:41.710> if<00:04:41.949> I<00:04:42.070> were<00:04:42.190> you<00:04:42.280> I'd<00:04:42.430> go<00:04:42.520> ahead<00:04:42.639> and

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
bet if I were you I'd go ahead and

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.760 
bet if I were you I'd go ahead and
download<00:04:42.850> it<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:43.210> give<00:04:43.360> it<00:04:43.389> a<00:04:43.509> try<00:04:43.740> because<00:04:44.740> I

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
download it and give it a try because I

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.620 
download it and give it a try because I
didn't<00:04:45.220> when<00:04:45.460> I<00:04:45.520> watched<00:04:45.699> the<00:04:45.790> video<00:04:46.030> on<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:46.300> um

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
didn't when I watched the video on it um

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.999 
didn't when I watched the video on it um
or<00:04:46.900> when<00:04:47.080> I<00:04:47.110> saw<00:04:47.350> like<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:47.590> pictures<00:04:47.889> and

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
or when I saw like the pictures and

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.010 
or when I saw like the pictures and
stuff<00:04:48.100> of<00:04:48.310> it<00:04:48.460> I<00:04:48.639> thought<00:04:49.270> that<00:04:49.600> it<00:04:49.810> really

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
stuff of it I thought that it really

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.090 
stuff of it I thought that it really
wasn't<00:04:50.139> that<00:04:50.259> good<00:04:50.440> but<00:04:50.500> I<00:04:50.680> thought<00:04:50.800> I'd<00:04:50.949> try

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
wasn't that good but I thought I'd try

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.650 
wasn't that good but I thought I'd try
it<00:04:51.160> out<00:04:51.250> for<00:04:51.340> myself<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:51.970> did<00:04:52.210> like<00:04:52.419> it<00:04:52.449> a

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
it out for myself and I did like it a

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.120 
it out for myself and I did like it a
lot<00:04:52.870> so<00:04:53.229> you<00:04:53.289> may<00:04:53.500> not<00:04:53.620> like<00:04:53.770> it<00:04:53.800> from<00:04:53.979> the

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130
