hi guys it's Adam and in this story I'm
going<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.810> show<00:00:03.990> you<00:00:04.020> how<00:00:04.290> we<00:00:04.350> can<00:00:04.759> export<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:06.060> 3d

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
going to show you how we can export a 3d

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.589 
going to show you how we can export a 3d
model<00:00:06.750> object<00:00:07.109> from<00:00:07.410> blender<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:08.069> unity

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
model object from blender to unity

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.129 
model object from blender to unity
without<00:00:09.599> having<00:00:10.260> an<00:00:10.410> issue<00:00:10.559> with<00:00:11.090> rotation

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
without having an issue with rotation

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.749 
without having an issue with rotation
that<00:00:13.139> mostly<00:00:13.889> most<00:00:14.099> cases<00:00:14.400> when<00:00:14.670> you're

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
that mostly most cases when you're

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.269 
that mostly most cases when you're
trying<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.440> export<00:00:16.440> an<00:00:16.529> object<00:00:16.830> from<00:00:16.980> blender

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
trying to export an object from blender

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.750 
trying to export an object from blender
to<00:00:17.430> unity<00:00:17.760> you're<00:00:18.359> going<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.570> find<00:00:18.810> out<00:00:18.960> that

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
to unity you're going to find out that

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.300 
to unity you're going to find out that
the<00:00:20.760> unity<00:00:21.449> will<00:00:21.660> have<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> different<00:00:22.410> rotation

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the unity will have a different rotation

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.779 
the unity will have a different rotation
is<00:00:23.400> going<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.640> be<00:00:23.699> either<00:00:23.869> 270<00:00:24.869> or<00:00:24.990> minus<00:00:25.350> 90

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
is going to be either 270 or minus 90

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.730 
is going to be either 270 or minus 90
degrees<00:00:26.789> which<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.060> snap<00:00:27.480> minus<00:00:27.810> 19<00:00:28.170> 270<00:00:28.680> is

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
degrees which is snap minus 19 270 is

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.519 
degrees which is snap minus 19 270 is
exactly<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> same<00:00:29.369> value<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.109> if<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.380> are

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
exactly the same value and if you are

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.520 
exactly the same value and if you are
actually<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:32.309> know<00:00:32.340> working<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> very

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
actually you know working on a very

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.799 
actually you know working on a very
basic<00:00:34.550> object<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.090> don't<00:00:36.540> have<00:00:36.690> an

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
basic object and you don't have an

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.750 
basic object and you don't have an
animation<00:00:37.200> or<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.920> not<00:00:37.950> planning<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.640> add

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
animation or you do not planning to add

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.040 
animation or you do not planning to add
any<00:00:39.030> script<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.739> object<00:00:40.739> inside<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> unity

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
any script this object inside the unity

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.299 
any script this object inside the unity
that's<00:00:43.050> fine<00:00:43.910> but<00:00:44.910> if<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.270> are<00:00:45.329> trying<00:00:45.660> to

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
that's fine but if you are trying to

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.709 
that's fine but if you are trying to
create<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> script<00:00:47.700> let's<00:00:48.059> say<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.450> want<00:00:48.629> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
create a script let's say we want to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.549 
create a script let's say we want to
rotate<00:00:49.050> our<00:00:49.289> object<00:00:49.940> on<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.149> Y<00:00:51.480> aces<00:00:51.989> or<00:00:52.199> Z

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
rotate our object on the Y aces or Z

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.209 
rotate our object on the Y aces or Z
aces<00:00:53.070> we're<00:00:53.969> going<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> find<00:00:54.420> out<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.219> for

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
aces we're going to find out is that for

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.479 
aces we're going to find out is that for
any<00:00:56.309> Z<00:00:56.879> aces<00:00:57.360> will<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.780> Y<00:00:58.079> aces<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.710> unity<00:00:59.129> or

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
any Z aces will be Y aces in unity or

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.599 
any Z aces will be Y aces in unity or
other<00:00:59.730> way<00:00:59.940> around<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:01.320> will<00:01:01.559> cause<00:01:01.890> an

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
other way around and that will cause an

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.920 
other way around and that will cause an
issue<00:01:03.049> okay<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.500> show<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.540> what<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.570> mean<00:01:06.869> by

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
issue okay so to show you what I mean by

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.750 
issue okay so to show you what I mean by
saying<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.740> we're<00:01:07.920> gonna<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.220> an<00:01:08.369> issue<00:01:08.520> of

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
saying that we're gonna have an issue of

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.690 
saying that we're gonna have an issue of
the<00:01:08.850> rotation<00:01:09.330> I'm<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.549> export<00:01:11.549> this

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the rotation I'm going to export this

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.539 
the rotation I'm going to export this
object<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.869> created<00:01:13.290> before<00:01:13.680> simply<00:01:14.159> free

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
object that I created before simply free

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.770 
object that I created before simply free
cubes<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.600> added<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.680> UV<00:01:17.369> as<00:01:17.610> well<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.750> are

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
cubes I added a UV as well so we are

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.440 
cubes I added a UV as well so we are
going<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.350> find<00:01:19.619> out<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:21.000> unity<00:01:21.360> we

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
going to find out that we in unity we

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.050 
going to find out that we in unity we
want<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:21.840> exactly<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> same<00:01:22.759> layout<00:01:23.759> as

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
want to have exactly the same layout as

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.670 
want to have exactly the same layout as
in<00:01:24.450> blender

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
in blender

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.400 
in blender
file<00:01:27.220> export<00:01:29.640> Autodesk<00:01:30.640> FBX<00:01:31.180> that's<00:01:32.020> the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
file export Autodesk FBX that's the

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.170 
file export Autodesk FBX that's the
correct<00:01:33.040> path<00:01:33.310> let's<00:01:34.030> just<00:01:34.210> call<00:01:34.390> it<00:01:34.420> cube<00:01:34.720> FBX

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
correct path let's just call it cube FBX

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.390 
correct path let's just call it cube FBX
make<00:01:37.180> sure<00:01:37.390> that<00:01:37.570> we<00:01:38.230> have<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.470> same<00:01:38.680> default

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
make sure that we have the same default

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.180 
make sure that we have the same default
values<00:01:39.790> so<00:01:40.030> restore<00:01:40.390> defaults<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:42.130> are

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
values so restore defaults and we are

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.600 
values so restore defaults and we are
going<00:01:42.550> to<00:01:42.760> export<00:01:43.090> on<00:01:43.300> a<00:01:43.330> selected<00:01:43.810> object

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
going to export on a selected object

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.890 
going to export on a selected object
scale<00:01:45.610> one<00:01:45.790> is<00:01:45.940> okay<00:01:46.210> I<00:01:46.240> leave<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.600> default

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
scale one is okay I leave the default

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.880 
scale one is okay I leave the default
values<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.880> export<00:01:48.880> now<00:01:49.870> go<00:01:50.110> back<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.470> unity

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
values and export now go back to unity

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.520 
values and export now go back to unity
and<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:53.710> have<00:01:53.830> cube<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:55.050> quite<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.080> fall<00:01:56.320> as<00:01:56.440> you

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
and we have cube and quite a fall as you

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:04.620 
and we have cube and quite a fall as you
can<00:01:56.650> see<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.840> arm<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:03.250> up<00:02:03.490> is<00:02:04.030> not<00:02:04.330> up

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
can see the arm the up is not up

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.440 
can see the arm the up is not up
actually<00:02:05.320> so<00:02:05.590> I'm<00:02:06.310> going<00:02:06.550> to<00:02:06.640> just<00:02:06.970> drag<00:02:07.240> and

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
actually so I'm going to just drag and

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.680 
actually so I'm going to just drag and
drop<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.720> object<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:09.729> very<00:02:09.910> small<00:02:10.209> so<00:02:10.510> we<00:02:10.540> are

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
drop the object is very small so we are

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.930 
drop the object is very small so we are
going<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:11.170> change<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.160> scale<00:02:12.340> factor<00:02:12.760> by

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
going to change the scale factor by

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.580 
going to change the scale factor by
clicking<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.540> cube<00:02:14.110> object<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.950> set<00:02:15.160> one<00:02:15.670> and

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
clicking the cube object and set one and

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.420 
clicking the cube object and set one and
apply<00:02:21.900> ok<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:22.959> as<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.290> can<00:02:23.440> see<00:02:23.500> everything

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
apply ok so as you can see everything

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.860 
apply ok so as you can see everything
looks<00:02:24.459> fine<00:02:25.000> but<00:02:26.220> rotation<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.600> minus<00:02:28.600> 90

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
looks fine but rotation is minus 90

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.460 
looks fine but rotation is minus 90
degrees<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:30.280> have<00:02:31.120> something<00:02:31.540> cube<00:02:31.780> root

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
degrees so I have something cube root

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.229 
degrees so I have something cube root
this<00:02:32.680> one<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:34.180> if<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.630> have<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:34.930> static<00:02:35.380> object

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
this one so if you have a static object

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.100 
this one so if you have a static object
it's<00:02:37.239> perfect

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
it's perfect

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.509 
it's perfect
I<00:02:38.230> mean<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:38.769> don't<00:02:38.860> have<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.130> really<00:02:39.280> worry

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
I mean you don't have to really worry

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.410 
I mean you don't have to really worry
about<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:40.170> because<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:43.090> know<00:02:43.120> if<00:02:43.330> you're

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
about it because you know if you're

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.970 
about it because you know if you're
going<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.780> put<00:02:43.989> an<00:02:44.080> object<00:02:44.200> somewhere<00:02:44.769> and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
going to put an object somewhere and

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.070 
going to put an object somewhere and
play<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.160> game<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:49.269> can<00:02:49.420> see<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.690> this<00:02:49.900> is<00:02:50.050> a

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
play the game you can see that this is a

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.300 
play the game you can see that this is a
static<00:02:50.410> object<00:02:50.500> there's<00:02:50.890> no<00:02:51.010> there's<00:02:51.280> no

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
static object there's no there's no

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.880 
static object there's no there's no
animation<00:02:51.700> there's<00:02:52.060> no<00:02:52.410> scripts<00:02:53.410> attach<00:02:53.709> this

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
animation there's no scripts attach this

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.370 
animation there's no scripts attach this
object<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:54.880> it's<00:02:55.060> perfectly<00:02:55.420> fine<00:02:55.630> but<00:02:55.959> let's

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
object so it's perfectly fine but let's

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.610 
object so it's perfectly fine but let's
find<00:02:56.920> out<00:02:57.100> what's<00:02:57.610> going<00:02:57.820> to<00:02:57.850> happen<00:02:58.620> even

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
find out what's going to happen even

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.680 
find out what's going to happen even
going<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.130> add<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.310> script<00:03:00.790> that<00:03:00.940> rotates<00:03:01.420> this

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
going to add a script that rotates this

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:09.040 
going to add a script that rotates this
object<00:03:02.380> on<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.830> Y<00:03:03.010> ASIS

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.690 

you<00:03:10.050> can<00:03:10.230> just<00:03:10.560> simply<00:03:10.770> drag<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.280> drop<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.580> on

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
you can just simply drag and drop it on

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.620 
you can just simply drag and drop it on
there<00:03:11.880> on<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.860> cube<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.310> we<00:03:15.240> have<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.390> tighter

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
there on the cube and we have a tighter

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.090 
there on the cube and we have a tighter
and<00:03:16.730> by<00:03:17.730> default<00:03:18.150> if<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.830> will<00:03:19.830> open<00:03:19.950> the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
and by default if you will open the

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.350 
and by default if you will open the
rotator<00:03:21.080> I'm<00:03:22.340> planning<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.370> rotate<00:03:24.209> this

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
rotator I'm planning to rotate this

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.440 
rotator I'm planning to rotate this
object<00:03:24.680> by<00:03:25.730> 5<00:03:26.730> degrees<00:03:27.060> every<00:03:27.959> second<00:03:28.380> on<00:03:29.450> the

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
object by 5 degrees every second on the

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.130 
object by 5 degrees every second on the
Y<00:03:30.900> ASIS<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.760> x<00:03:33.209> is<00:03:33.900> 0<00:03:34.290> Y<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.550> my<00:03:36.540> rotate<00:03:36.870> speed

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
Y ASIS so x is 0 Y is my rotate speed

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.710 
Y ASIS so x is 0 Y is my rotate speed
which<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.319> 5<00:03:37.819> multiplied<00:03:38.819> times<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.390> Delta

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
which is 5 multiplied times of Delta

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.380 
which is 5 multiplied times of Delta
time<00:03:39.900> which<00:03:40.110> means<00:03:40.640> regardless<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:41.910> how<00:03:42.180> many

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
time which means regardless of how many

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.110 
time which means regardless of how many
frames<00:03:42.600> per<00:03:42.840> second<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.200> haven't<00:03:43.530> seen<00:03:43.970> it<00:03:44.970> will

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
frames per second I haven't seen it will

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.240 
frames per second I haven't seen it will
always<00:03:45.300> be<00:03:45.540> 1<00:03:45.720> second<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:47.720> Z<00:03:48.720> value<00:03:49.290> 0<00:03:49.709> so

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
always be 1 second and Z value 0 so

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.650 
always be 1 second and Z value 0 so
let's<00:03:50.430> play<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.730> game<00:03:51.410> or<00:03:52.410> scene<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.660> this

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
let's play the game or scene and this

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.080 
let's play the game or scene and this
exactly<00:03:55.140> not<00:03:55.380> what<00:03:55.410> we<00:03:55.739> are<00:03:55.769> we<00:03:56.160> are<00:03:56.459> expecting

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
exactly not what we are we are expecting

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.750 
exactly not what we are we are expecting
to<00:03:57.269> see<00:03:57.620> we<00:03:58.620> were<00:03:58.709> expecting<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.310> see<00:03:59.430> this

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
to see we were expecting to see this

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.570 
to see we were expecting to see this
object<00:04:00.030> rotating<00:04:01.019> on<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.380> Y<00:04:01.590> what<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.370> want<00:04:02.519> to

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
object rotating on the Y what I want to

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.710 
object rotating on the Y what I want to
show<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:02.790> as<00:04:02.880> well<00:04:04.700> so<00:04:05.700> we<00:04:06.030> have<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.420> global

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
show you as well so we have a global

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.400 
show you as well so we have a global
value<00:04:07.200> here<00:04:07.440> so<00:04:07.860> it's<00:04:08.160> our<00:04:08.280> global<00:04:09.410> rotation

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
value here so it's our global rotation

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.870 
value here so it's our global rotation
Isis<00:04:10.920> so<00:04:11.430> by<00:04:12.000> default<00:04:12.299> in<00:04:12.600> unity<00:04:12.959> global<00:04:13.880> the

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
Isis so by default in unity global the

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.500 
Isis so by default in unity global the
green<00:04:15.180> arrow<00:04:16.079> is<00:04:16.739> why<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:19.049> red<00:04:19.290> one<00:04:19.530> is<00:04:19.769> X<00:04:20.070> and

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
green arrow is why the red one is X and

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.140 
green arrow is why the red one is X and
blue<00:04:21.510> one<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:22.079> so<00:04:23.070> if<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.400> switch<00:04:23.880> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
blue one is that so if I switch the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.180 
blue one is that so if I switch the
local<00:04:24.510> as<00:04:25.200> you<00:04:25.260> can<00:04:25.530> see<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.740> local<00:04:25.950> means

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
local as you can see the local means

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.120 
local as you can see the local means
that's<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.580> Aces<00:04:27.240> on<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.840> cube<00:04:28.500> object<00:04:28.710> and

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
that's the Aces on the cube object and

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.310 
that's the Aces on the cube object and
as<00:04:29.550> you<00:04:29.640> can<00:04:29.760> see<00:04:29.820> they<00:04:30.750> are<00:04:30.780> completely

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
as you can see they are completely

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.950 
as you can see they are completely
different<00:04:31.500> so<00:04:32.270> you<00:04:33.270> can<00:04:33.419> see<00:04:33.570> that<00:04:33.690> there's<00:04:33.870> a

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
different so you can see that there's a

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.469 
different so you can see that there's a
90<00:04:35.090> minus<00:04:36.090> 90<00:04:36.419> degrees<00:04:37.430> difference<00:04:38.430> so<00:04:39.150> if<00:04:39.330> I

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
90 minus 90 degrees difference so if I

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.340 
90 minus 90 degrees difference so if I
just<00:04:40.169> say<00:04:40.350> 0<00:04:40.650> actually<00:04:41.340> matches<00:04:42.030> so<00:04:42.990> local

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
just say 0 actually matches so local

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.980 
just say 0 actually matches so local
access<00:04:44.190> much<00:04:44.610> is<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:44.880> global<00:04:45.150> axis<00:04:45.450> so<00:04:45.720> if<00:04:45.870> I

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
access much is the global axis so if I

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.650 
access much is the global axis so if I
play<00:04:46.470> it<00:04:46.500> once<00:04:46.860> again<00:04:48.650> it<00:04:49.650> rotates<00:04:50.130> as<00:04:50.660> we

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
play it once again it rotates as we

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.710 
play it once again it rotates as we
expect<00:04:52.080> it<00:04:52.229> to<00:04:52.260> be<00:04:52.440> so<00:04:52.770> it's<00:04:53.610> perfect<00:04:54.090> almost

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
expect it to be so it's perfect almost

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.659 
expect it to be so it's perfect almost
but<00:04:55.910> so<00:04:56.910> as<00:04:57.090> you<00:04:57.180> can<00:04:57.330> see<00:04:57.570> it<00:04:57.900> looks<00:04:58.140> ok

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
but so as you can see it looks ok

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.219 
but so as you can see it looks ok
rotation<00:04:59.669> looks<00:04:59.820> fine<00:05:00.120> but<00:05:00.750> we<00:05:00.930> have<00:05:01.050> another

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
rotation looks fine but we have another

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.219 
rotation looks fine but we have another
problem<00:05:01.470> we<00:05:01.710> have<00:05:01.800> a<00:05:01.860> problem<00:05:02.220> with<00:05:02.370> au<00:05:03.360> is<00:05:03.660> not

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
problem we have a problem with au is not

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.230 
problem we have a problem with au is not
on<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.560> top<00:05:04.740> so<00:05:04.950> our<00:05:05.190> up<00:05:05.630> phase<00:05:06.630> is<00:05:06.930> not<00:05:08.240> over

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
on the top so our up phase is not over

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.920 
on the top so our up phase is not over
here<00:05:09.710> so<00:05:10.850> that's<00:05:11.850> the<00:05:12.060> one<00:05:12.390> of<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.600> reason<00:05:12.870> why

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
here so that's the one of the reason why

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.430 
here so that's the one of the reason why
I<00:05:13.020> decided<00:05:13.350> to<00:05:13.610> you<00:05:14.610> know<00:05:14.700> create<00:05:15.000> a<00:05:15.440> instead

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
I decided to you know create a instead

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
I decided to you know create a instead
of<00:05:16.530> creating<00:05:16.860> a<00:05:16.950> simple<00:05:17.190> cube<00:05:17.789> without<00:05:18.090> an<00:05:18.300> ax

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
of creating a simple cube without an ax

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.400 
of creating a simple cube without an ax
without<00:05:20.300> NM<00:05:21.670> textures<00:05:22.670> wouldn't<00:05:23.510> be<00:05:23.630> you

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
without NM textures wouldn't be you

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.220 
without NM textures wouldn't be you
wouldn't<00:05:24.650> be<00:05:24.710> able<00:05:24.950> to<00:05:25.040> see<00:05:25.270> or<00:05:26.270> half<00:05:26.840> way<00:05:27.050> down

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
wouldn't be able to see or half way down

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.200 
wouldn't be able to see or half way down
here<00:05:27.530> but<00:05:27.740> now<00:05:28.130> obviously<00:05:28.700> we<00:05:28.850> have<00:05:29.000> some

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
here but now obviously we have some

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.540 
here but now obviously we have some
issue<00:05:29.360> here<00:05:29.630> we<00:05:30.320> have<00:05:30.440> to<00:05:30.560> go<00:05:30.740> back<00:05:30.980> to<00:05:31.160> blender

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
issue here we have to go back to blender

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.700 
issue here we have to go back to blender
and<00:05:33.160> the<00:05:34.160> best<00:05:34.340> way<00:05:34.490> to<00:05:34.520> do<00:05:34.760> Oh<00:05:35.410> what<00:05:36.410> you<00:05:36.530> might

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
and the best way to do Oh what you might

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.170 
and the best way to do Oh what you might
find<00:05:36.860> a<00:05:37.010> better<00:05:37.160> way<00:05:37.370> but<00:05:37.550> actually<00:05:38.030> that

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
find a better way but actually that

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.540 
find a better way but actually that
works<00:05:38.420> good<00:05:38.930> for<00:05:39.020> me<00:05:39.260> so<00:05:39.530> change<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.370> rotation

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
works good for me so change the rotation

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.140 
works good for me so change the rotation
to<00:05:41.030> minus<00:05:41.330> 90<00:05:41.630> degrees<00:05:42.310> and<00:05:43.310> now<00:05:43.820> we<00:05:43.880> have<00:05:44.030> to

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
to minus 90 degrees and now we have to

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.790 
to minus 90 degrees and now we have to
apply<00:05:44.390> this<00:05:44.510> rotation<00:05:45.140> so<00:05:45.530> press<00:05:45.890> ctrl<00:05:46.340> I

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
apply this rotation so press ctrl I

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.520 
apply this rotation so press ctrl I
rotation<00:05:48.800> and<00:05:49.550> now<00:05:50.000> export<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:50.900> object<00:05:51.350> once

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
rotation and now export the object once

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.070 
rotation and now export the object once
again<00:05:52.120> so<00:05:53.120> out<00:05:53.360> of<00:05:53.540> the<00:05:53.660> X<00:05:55.660> select<00:05:56.660> object

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
again so out of the X select object

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.610 
again so out of the X select object
exactly<00:05:57.410> the<00:05:57.650> same<00:05:57.800> as<00:05:57.920> before<00:05:58.010> cube<00:05:59.620> export

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
exactly the same as before cube export

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:09.570 
exactly the same as before cube export
FBX<00:06:04.300> so<00:06:05.300> voila<00:06:05.630> now<00:06:06.620> we<00:06:06.680> have<00:06:07.010> rotation<00:06:07.580> 0<00:06:08.300> 0<00:06:09.020> 0

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
FBX so voila now we have rotation 0 0 0

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:16.450 
FBX so voila now we have rotation 0 0 0
we<00:06:10.580> have<00:06:12.940> the<00:06:13.940> texture<00:06:14.660> is<00:06:14.750> facing<00:06:15.460> good

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
we have the texture is facing good

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.320 
we have the texture is facing good
direction<00:06:16.870> once<00:06:17.870> we<00:06:18.050> play<00:06:18.860> the<00:06:19.040> same<00:06:19.250> we<00:06:20.150> can

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
direction once we play the same we can

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.240 
direction once we play the same we can
see<00:06:20.510> that<00:06:20.690> the<00:06:21.230> object<00:06:21.380> is<00:06:21.680> rotating<00:06:22.070> on<00:06:22.130> a

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
see that the object is rotating on a

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.200 
see that the object is rotating on a
good<00:06:22.430> scale<00:06:24.310> so<00:06:25.310> thanks<00:06:25.610> for<00:06:25.670> watching<00:06:25.760> and

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
good scale so thanks for watching and

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.840 
good scale so thanks for watching and
see<00:06:26.510> you<00:06:26.600> next<00:06:26.630> time
