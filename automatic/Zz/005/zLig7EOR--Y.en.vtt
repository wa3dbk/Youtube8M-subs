on<00:00:12.509> one<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.780> my<00:00:12.840> videos<00:00:13.230> asking<00:00:14.070> about<00:00:14.929> which

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
on one of my videos asking about which

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.840 
on one of my videos asking about which
type<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.260> cars<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.890> use<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.430> multiplayer

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
type of cars to use in multiplayer

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.529 
type of cars to use in multiplayer
racing<00:00:19.160> which<00:00:20.160> would<00:00:20.340> also<00:00:20.490> apply<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.910> career

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
racing which would also apply to career

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.080 
racing which would also apply to career
races<00:00:21.930> as<00:00:22.080> well<00:00:22.670> basically<00:00:23.670> just<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.880> lot<00:00:24.060> of

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
races as well basically just a lot of

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.500 
races as well basically just a lot of
traffic<00:00:24.300> other<00:00:24.750> cars<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.260> contend<00:00:25.590> with<00:00:25.650> and

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
traffic other cars to contend with and

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.939 
traffic other cars to contend with and
he<00:00:27.510> wanted<00:00:27.689> me<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.840> give<00:00:28.050> suggestions<00:00:28.529> for

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
he wanted me to give suggestions for

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.640 
he wanted me to give suggestions for
classes<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.490> B<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.119> C<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:30.990> thought<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.439> would

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
classes a B and C so I thought I would

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.670 
classes a B and C so I thought I would
start<00:00:31.800> one<00:00:31.949> video<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.279> with<00:00:32.579> Class<00:00:32.850> C<00:00:33.180> and

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
start one video here with Class C and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.610 
start one video here with Class C and
work<00:00:34.680> my<00:00:34.860> way<00:00:35.040> up<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.610> some<00:00:36.090> other<00:00:36.239> videos<00:00:36.630> so

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
work my way up in some other videos so

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.310 
work my way up in some other videos so
I'm<00:00:37.710> going<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.040> filter<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:39.210> I'm<00:00:40.170> gonna

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
I'm going to filter this and I'm gonna

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.880 
I'm going to filter this and I'm gonna
go<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.530> my<00:00:40.640> c<00:00:41.640> class<00:00:42.230> go<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> bottom<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.860> my

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
go to my c class go to the bottom of my

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.889 
go to my c class go to the bottom of my
c<00:00:44.160> class<00:00:44.430> here<00:00:44.670> i<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> few<00:00:45.239> cars<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.750> see

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
c class here i have a few cars and see

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.779 
c class here i have a few cars and see
that<00:00:46.140> i<00:00:46.170> haven't<00:00:46.469> built<00:00:46.590> out<00:00:46.829> yet<00:00:47.070> i<00:00:47.340> think

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
that i haven't built out yet i think

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.580 
that i haven't built out yet i think
those<00:00:48.059> are<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.270> dock<00:00:48.870> right<00:00:49.079> now<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.469> one

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
those are just dock right now that one

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.930 
those are just dock right now that one
might<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.950> couple<00:00:50.250> things<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:50.820> not

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
might have a couple things on it but not

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.660 
might have a couple things on it but not
done<00:00:51.770> so<00:00:52.770> basically<00:00:53.010> what<00:00:53.190> i<00:00:53.219> want<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.610> i

done so basically what i want to do is i
want<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.850> talk<00:00:53.940> about<00:00:54.059> which<00:00:54.360> cars<00:00:55.110> i<00:00:55.469> would

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
want to talk about which cars i would

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.340 
want to talk about which cars i would
suggest<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.449> these<00:00:57.449> aren't<00:00:57.750> always<00:00:58.050> exactly

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
suggest and these aren't always exactly

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.299 
suggest and these aren't always exactly
the<00:00:59.039> cars<00:00:59.280> that<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.239> need<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.199> win<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.160> type

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the cars that you need to win the type

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.189 
the cars that you need to win the type
of<00:01:02.460> races<00:01:02.730> i'm<00:01:02.820> going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> talk<00:01:03.180> about<00:01:03.329> but

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
of races i'm going to talk about but

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.350 
of races i'm going to talk about but
it's<00:01:04.350> those<00:01:04.559> type<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.430> configurations<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
it's those type of configurations and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.570 
it's those type of configurations and
those<00:01:06.510> type<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.900> cars<00:01:07.110> which<00:01:08.040> i'm<00:01:08.220> talking

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
those type of cars which i'm talking

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.760 
those type of cars which i'm talking
about<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> multiplayer<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.409> career

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
about and in a multiplayer and career

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.530 
about and in a multiplayer and career
there's<00:01:11.189> basically<00:01:11.580> three<00:01:11.670> types<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.240> tracks

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
there's basically three types of tracks

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.679 
there's basically three types of tracks
so<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:14.400> three<00:01:14.580> types<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.850> tracks<00:01:15.090> at<00:01:15.299> least<00:01:15.509> i

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
so the three types of tracks at least i

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.120 
so the three types of tracks at least i
label<00:01:16.350> them<00:01:16.470> as<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.490> number<00:01:18.150> one<00:01:18.299> would<00:01:18.509> be<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
label them as is a number one would be a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.289 
label them as is a number one would be a
turning<00:01:20.130> type<00:01:20.310> track<00:01:20.610> which<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.850> more<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.180> a

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
turning type track which is more of a

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.990 
turning type track which is more of a
handling<00:01:21.780> track<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.619> never<00:01:22.860> really<00:01:23.100> has<00:01:23.400> an

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
handling track that never really has an

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.969 
handling track that never really has an
opportunity<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.810> hit<00:01:25.020> any<00:01:25.170> kind<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.439> top<00:01:25.619> speed

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
opportunity to hit any kind of top speed

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.660 
opportunity to hit any kind of top speed
so<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.240> might<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.960> like<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:29.009> road<00:01:29.369> olanna

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
so that might be like the road olanna

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.760 
so that might be like the road olanna
short<00:01:30.090> or<00:01:30.360> something<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.200> that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
short or something like that and that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.319 
short or something like that and that
would<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.130> case<00:01:32.280> where<00:01:32.610> there<00:01:33.150> would<00:01:33.299> be

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
would be the case where there would be

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.050 
would be the case where there would be
no<00:01:33.659> true<00:01:33.990> real<00:01:34.380> long<00:01:34.560> straightaway<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.820> might

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
no true real long straightaway you might

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.539 
no true real long straightaway you might
hit<00:01:36.270> about<00:01:36.450> 110<00:01:37.140> 120<00:01:37.770> miles<00:01:37.920> an<00:01:38.070> hour<00:01:38.189> but<00:01:38.490> you

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
hit about 110 120 miles an hour but you

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.819 
hit about 110 120 miles an hour but you
don't<00:01:38.820> really<00:01:39.000> need<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.240> car<00:01:39.470> that<00:01:40.470> goes<00:01:40.650> much

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
don't really need a car that goes much

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.160 
don't really need a car that goes much
faster<00:01:41.100> than<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.479> do<00:01:42.689> need<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.930> car

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
faster than that but you do need a car

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.929 
faster than that but you do need a car
that<00:01:43.200> does<00:01:43.530> handle<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.189> carries<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> lot<00:01:44.820> of

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
that does handle and carries a lot of

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.260 
that does handle and carries a lot of
speed<00:01:45.210> brakes<00:01:45.750> quickly<00:01:46.670> able<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.759> recover<00:01:48.060> in

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
speed brakes quickly able to recover in

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.429 
speed brakes quickly able to recover in
a<00:01:48.360> mid<00:01:48.570> corner<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:51.570> basically<00:01:52.079> he's<00:01:52.229> going<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
a mid corner and basically he's going to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.380 
a mid corner and basically he's going to
have<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> little<00:01:52.860> bit<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.100> speed<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:53.909> mostly

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
have a little bit of speed but mostly

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.690 
have a little bit of speed but mostly
handling<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.890> kind<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.219> suggestion

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
handling and in that kind of suggestion

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.980 
handling and in that kind of suggestion
here<00:01:56.909> i<00:01:57.149> would<00:01:57.299> probably<00:01:58.040> put<00:01:59.040> within<00:01:59.250> my<00:01:59.520> cars

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
here i would probably put within my cars

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.740 
here i would probably put within my cars
probably<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.380> Ford<00:02:02.340> Escort<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.909> couple<00:02:03.689> of

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
probably this Ford Escort a couple of

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.940 
probably this Ford Escort a couple of
different<00:02:03.960> things<00:02:04.079> about<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.409> cars<00:02:04.680> all

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
different things about this cars all

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.679 
different things about this cars all
wheel<00:02:05.100> drive<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.060> get<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.570> good

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
wheel drive so I get a really good

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.130 
wheel drive so I get a really good
launch

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
launch

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.650 
launch
you<00:02:07.560> see<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.799> have<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> 7-3<00:02:08.399> launch<00:02:08.670> there<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.179> have

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
you see I have a 7-3 launch there I have

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.020 
you see I have a 7-3 launch there I have
pretty<00:02:09.869> decent<00:02:09.959> acceleration<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.819> have

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
pretty decent acceleration and I have

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.400 
pretty decent acceleration and I have
good<00:02:12.270> speed<00:02:12.330> but

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
good speed but

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.540 
good speed but
the<00:02:13.620> biggest<00:02:13.800> number<00:02:14.040> there<00:02:14.310> you're<00:02:14.430> gonna

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
the biggest number there you're gonna

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.430 
the biggest number there you're gonna
see<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:14.970> handling<00:02:15.600> number<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
see is the handling number and the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.620 
see is the handling number and the
breaking<00:02:16.800> number<00:02:17.070> as<00:02:17.190> well<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:18.240> this<00:02:18.390> car<00:02:18.600> is

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
breaking number as well so this car is

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.420 
breaking number as well so this car is
going<00:02:18.960> to<00:02:19.050> stop<00:02:19.260> real<00:02:19.470> quick<00:02:19.500> continue<00:02:20.250> to

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
going to stop real quick continue to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.850 
going to stop real quick continue to
hold<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.730> speed<00:02:20.970> through<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.270> turns<00:02:21.480> and

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
hold the speed through the turns and

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.410 
hold the speed through the turns and
make<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.890> run<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.610> front<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:23.970> if<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.150> get<00:02:24.300> out

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
make a run to the front and if I get out

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.780 
make a run to the front and if I get out
front<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.840> just<00:02:25.020> run<00:02:25.200> laps<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.830> continue<00:02:26.640> to

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
front I just run laps and continue to

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.330 
front I just run laps and continue to
run<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.150> way<00:02:27.500> other<00:02:28.500> cars<00:02:28.770> are<00:02:29.040> pretty<00:02:29.130> good

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
run that way other cars are pretty good

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.740 
run that way other cars are pretty good
for<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.520> would<00:02:29.760> probably<00:02:29.880> be<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.210> integra

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
for that would probably be the integra

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.590 
for that would probably be the integra
if<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.560> have<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.800> set<00:02:31.980> up<00:02:32.010> for<00:02:32.070> handling<00:02:32.600> and

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
if you have it set up for handling and

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.540 
if you have it set up for handling and
this<00:02:33.750> BMW<00:02:34.080> is<00:02:34.410> not<00:02:34.560> too<00:02:34.770> bad<00:02:34.920> either<00:02:35.070> but<00:02:35.370> you

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
this BMW is not too bad either but you

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.040 
this BMW is not too bad either but you
can<00:02:35.580> see<00:02:35.790> I'm<00:02:35.910> going<00:02:36.150> down<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.660> handling

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
can see I'm going down and handling

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.520 
can see I'm going down and handling
numbers<00:02:37.350> pretty<00:02:37.590> far<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.970> Toyota<00:02:39.600> gt86<00:02:40.110> is

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
numbers pretty far this Toyota gt86 is

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.680 
numbers pretty far this Toyota gt86 is
kind<00:02:40.710> of<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.860> hybrid<00:02:41.070> car<00:02:41.490> and<00:02:42.360> I'll<00:02:42.480> talk<00:02:42.660> about

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
kind of a hybrid car and I'll talk about

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.880 
kind of a hybrid car and I'll talk about
that<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.020> little<00:02:43.110> bit<00:02:43.290> more<00:02:43.440> here<00:02:43.620> when<00:02:43.710> I<00:02:43.770> talk

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
that a little bit more here when I talk

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.070 
that a little bit more here when I talk
about<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.160> second<00:02:44.520> track<00:02:44.730> it's<00:02:45.450> kind<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.720> kind

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
about the second track it's kind of kind

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.500 
about the second track it's kind of kind
of<00:02:46.200> tracks<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.820> second<00:02:48.120> kind<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.300> track

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
of tracks so the second kind of track

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.860 
of tracks so the second kind of track
that<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.720> see<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.410> going<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.710> be<00:02:49.770> a<00:02:49.860> mostly

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
that I see is going to be a mostly

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.970 
that I see is going to be a mostly
turning<00:02:51.870> type<00:02:52.020> of<00:02:52.170> track<00:02:52.350> or<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> handling

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
turning type of track or a handling

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.280 
turning type of track or a handling
track<00:02:53.220> but<00:02:53.910> then<00:02:54.060> has<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.300> straightaway<00:02:54.840> or<00:02:55.110> two

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
track but then has a straightaway or two

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.510 
track but then has a straightaway or two
or<00:02:55.590> maybe<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:56.630> wider<00:02:57.630> sweeping<00:02:58.260> turn<00:02:59.220> that

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
or maybe a wider sweeping turn that

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.660 
or maybe a wider sweeping turn that
allows<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.030> maintain<00:03:00.660> speed<00:03:01.670> there's

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
allows you to maintain speed there's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.340 
allows you to maintain speed there's
several<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.330> these<00:03:03.480> tracks<00:03:03.810> out<00:03:03.990> there<00:03:04.170> this

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
several of these tracks out there this

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.750 
several of these tracks out there this
is<00:03:04.470> actually<00:03:04.770> probably<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.160> majority<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.640> the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
is actually probably the majority of the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.670 
is actually probably the majority of the
tracks

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
tracks

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.870 
tracks
there's<00:03:07.680> probably<00:03:07.830> be<00:03:08.100> quite<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.310> few<00:03:08.460> turning

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
there's probably be quite a few turning

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.340 
there's probably be quite a few turning
tracks<00:03:09.150> handling<00:03:09.690> tracks<00:03:09.930> but<00:03:10.080> there's<00:03:10.260> gonna

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
tracks handling tracks but there's gonna

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.720 
tracks handling tracks but there's gonna
be<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.500> lot<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.710> these<00:03:10.890> tracks<00:03:11.190> as<00:03:11.370> well<00:03:11.520> where

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
be a lot of these tracks as well where

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.310 
be a lot of these tracks as well where
you<00:03:11.760> need<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.030> little<00:03:12.210> bit<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.420> top<00:03:12.630> speed<00:03:12.960> and

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
you need a little bit of top speed and

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.800 
you need a little bit of top speed and
in<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.070> case<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.580> would<00:03:15.150> use<00:03:15.300> something<00:03:15.540> like

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
in that case I would use something like

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.870 
in that case I would use something like
that<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.110> have<00:03:16.260> here<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:16.710> hybrid<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.190> Toyota

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
that I have here this hybrid the Toyota

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.480 
that I have here this hybrid the Toyota
gt86<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:19.260> actually<00:03:19.590> has<00:03:19.800> a<00:03:19.830> pretty<00:03:20.100> decent

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
gt86 it actually has a pretty decent

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.400 
gt86 it actually has a pretty decent
amount<00:03:20.550> of<00:03:20.730> speed<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.300> it<00:03:21.840> has<00:03:22.080> pretty<00:03:22.350> good

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
amount of speed and it has pretty good

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.120 
amount of speed and it has pretty good
handling<00:03:22.920> still<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.760> good<00:03:23.880> acceleration<00:03:25.130> the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
handling still a good acceleration the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.220 
handling still a good acceleration the
BMW<00:03:26.730> again<00:03:26.940> is<00:03:27.090> another<00:03:27.360> really<00:03:27.570> good<00:03:27.750> car<00:03:27.990> for

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
BMW again is another really good car for

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.350 
BMW again is another really good car for
that<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:29.220> get<00:03:29.370> some<00:03:29.520> good<00:03:29.550> speed<00:03:29.910> out<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.120> it

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
that you get some good speed out of it

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.260 
that you get some good speed out of it
yet<00:03:30.990> it<00:03:31.230> handles<00:03:31.740> so<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:32.670> need<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:32.970> be<00:03:33.060> able<00:03:33.150> to

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
yet it handles so you need to be able to

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.600 
yet it handles so you need to be able to
carry<00:03:33.540> speed<00:03:34.050> through<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.440> turns<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:35.310> keep<00:03:35.459> up

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
carry speed through the turns to keep up

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.980 
carry speed through the turns to keep up
with<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.850> other<00:03:36.000> at<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.180> handling<00:03:36.570> cars<00:03:36.750> but

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
with the other at the handling cars but

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.080 
with the other at the handling cars but
then<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.200> also<00:03:37.350> need<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.770> speed<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.790> stay<00:03:38.970> in

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
then you also need the speed to stay in

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.350 
then you also need the speed to stay in
front<00:03:39.300> of<00:03:39.360> them<00:03:39.450> in<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.660> straightaways<00:03:40.110> and

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
front of them in the straightaways and

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.150 
front of them in the straightaways and
I'll<00:03:42.360> put<00:03:42.540> these<00:03:42.630> tunes<00:03:42.900> out<00:03:43.080> here<00:03:43.350> as<00:03:43.800> well

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
I'll put these tunes out here as well

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.800 
I'll put these tunes out here as well
and<00:03:44.520> I'll<00:03:44.610> tell<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.180> which<00:03:45.270> ones<00:03:45.450> I<00:03:45.510> do<00:03:45.570> that

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
and I'll tell you which ones I do that

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.260 
and I'll tell you which ones I do that
I'll<00:03:45.959> do<00:03:46.380> that<00:03:46.500> before<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.830> leave<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.550> then

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
I'll do that before I leave and then

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.510 
I'll do that before I leave and then
there's<00:03:48.450> going<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.600> be<00:03:48.770> the<00:03:49.770> really<00:03:50.280> fast

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
there's going to be the really fast

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.040 
there's going to be the really fast
tracks<00:03:50.910> they're<00:03:51.209> gonna<00:03:51.300> have<00:03:51.480> really<00:03:51.870> long

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
tracks they're gonna have really long

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.990 
tracks they're gonna have really long
straightaways<00:03:52.620> there<00:03:53.310> are<00:03:53.580> quite<00:03:53.880> a<00:03:53.910> few

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
straightaways there are quite a few

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.170 
straightaways there are quite a few
those<00:03:54.330> type<00:03:54.570> of<00:03:54.690> tracks<00:03:54.870> here<00:03:55.850> where<00:03:56.850> you<00:03:56.970> can

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
those type of tracks here where you can

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.000 
those type of tracks here where you can
use<00:03:57.390> your<00:03:57.570> top<00:03:57.780> speed<00:03:57.989> and<00:03:58.350> you<00:03:58.590> need<00:03:58.770> to<00:03:58.890> have

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
use your top speed and you need to have

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.920 
use your top speed and you need to have
the<00:03:59.130> top<00:03:59.310> speed<00:03:59.610> because<00:04:00.270> if<00:04:00.510> your<00:04:00.630> car<00:04:00.900> is

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
the top speed because if your car is

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.280 
the top speed because if your car is
limited<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.680> 120<00:04:02.550> 130<00:04:02.910> miles<00:04:03.239> an<00:04:03.360> hour<00:04:03.510> you're

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
limited to 120 130 miles an hour you're

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.470 
limited to 120 130 miles an hour you're
gonna<00:04:04.410> lose<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.680> lot<00:04:04.950> of<00:04:04.980> distance<00:04:05.520> in<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.940> long

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
gonna lose a lot of distance in the long

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.860 
gonna lose a lot of distance in the long
straightaways<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:08.300> this<00:04:09.300> one<00:04:09.480> again<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:09.840> a

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
straightaways and this one again is a

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.410 
straightaways and this one again is a
pretty<00:04:10.110> decent<00:04:10.470> hybrid<00:04:10.739> car<00:04:10.950> this<00:04:11.420> Toyota

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
pretty decent hybrid car this Toyota

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.330 
pretty decent hybrid car this Toyota
gt86<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:13.380> still<00:04:13.530> has<00:04:13.650> some<00:04:13.800> pretty<00:04:13.950> good<00:04:14.010> speed

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
gt86 it still has some pretty good speed

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.640 
gt86 it still has some pretty good speed
but<00:04:15.180> you're<00:04:15.510> still<00:04:15.720> gonna<00:04:15.900> want<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.109> go<00:04:16.200> even<00:04:16.470> a

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
but you're still gonna want to go even a

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.159 
but you're still gonna want to go even a
little<00:04:16.680> bit<00:04:17.130> faster<00:04:17.520> than<00:04:17.549> that<00:04:17.700> so<00:04:18.690> up<00:04:18.930> here

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
little bit faster than that so up here

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.409 
little bit faster than that so up here
at<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.410> top<00:04:19.590> of<00:04:19.859> my<00:04:20.370> P<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:20.580> have<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:20.970> couple<00:04:21.299> of

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
at the top of my P I have a couple of

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.690 
at the top of my P I have a couple of
cars<00:04:21.570> that<00:04:21.690> are<00:04:21.810> pretty<00:04:22.200> fast<00:04:22.560> as<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:23.130> top<00:04:23.430> speed

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
cars that are pretty fast as a top speed

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.550 
cars that are pretty fast as a top speed
and<00:04:23.910> still<00:04:24.090> have<00:04:24.180> good<00:04:24.300> acceleration<00:04:24.930> this

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
and still have good acceleration this

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.170 
and still have good acceleration this
rx-7<00:04:26.310> is<00:04:26.370> one<00:04:26.550> of<00:04:26.640> them

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
rx-7 is one of them

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.570 
rx-7 is one of them
you<00:04:27.360> can<00:04:27.479> see<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.780> speed<00:04:28.050> is<00:04:28.229> 6.2<00:04:28.740> on<00:04:29.039> that<00:04:29.220> and

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
you can see the speed is 6.2 on that and

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.740 
you can see the speed is 6.2 on that and
it's<00:04:29.940> going<00:04:30.090> to<00:04:30.150> have<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.270> little<00:04:30.509> bit<00:04:30.570> more

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
it's going to have a little bit more

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.390 
it's going to have a little bit more
horsepower<00:04:30.900> than<00:04:31.470> most<00:04:31.740> of<00:04:31.889> the<00:04:31.979> other<00:04:32.130> cars

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
horsepower than most of the other cars

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.520 
horsepower than most of the other cars
it's<00:04:33.180> still<00:04:33.360> good<00:04:33.509> acceleration<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:34.289> still<00:04:34.500> a

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
it's still good acceleration and still a

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.700 
it's still good acceleration and still a
pretty<00:04:34.770> decent<00:04:35.070> launch<00:04:35.930> this<00:04:36.930> one's<00:04:37.169> also<00:04:37.500> a

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
pretty decent launch this one's also a

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.610 
pretty decent launch this one's also a
very<00:04:38.250> quick<00:04:38.490> car<00:04:38.729> and<00:04:39.259> the<00:04:40.259> nice<00:04:40.410> thing<00:04:40.440> about

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
very quick car and the nice thing about

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.310 
very quick car and the nice thing about
having<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:41.070> all-wheel<00:04:41.370> drive<00:04:41.580> is<00:04:41.789> it<00:04:41.940> still

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
having the all-wheel drive is it still

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.710 
having the all-wheel drive is it still
breaks<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:43.620> handles<00:04:43.949> pretty<00:04:44.130> well<00:04:44.479> but<00:04:45.479> again

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
breaks and handles pretty well but again

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.330 
breaks and handles pretty well but again
you<00:04:45.930> need<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.229> acceleration<00:04:46.949> you<00:04:47.039> need<00:04:47.220> that

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.070 
you need that acceleration you need that
launch<00:04:47.580> you<00:04:47.820> need<00:04:48.060> that<00:04:48.210> speed<00:04:48.539> to<00:04:48.570> stay<00:04:48.990> in

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
launch you need that speed to stay in

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.600 
launch you need that speed to stay in
front<00:04:49.229> of<00:04:49.380> people<00:04:49.620> and<00:04:49.889> to<00:04:50.070> make<00:04:50.190> those<00:04:50.370> top

the<00:06:17.550> c-class<00:06:17.970> and<00:06:18.360> in<00:06:18.870> future<00:06:19.080> videos<00:06:19.169> I'm

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
the c-class and in future videos I'm

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.899 
the c-class and in future videos I'm
going<00:06:19.710> to<00:06:19.770> go<00:06:19.860> ahead<00:06:20.009> and<00:06:20.130> move<00:06:20.280> up<00:06:20.490> to<00:06:20.520> the<00:06:20.759> B

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:20.909 
going to go ahead and move up to the B

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:23.089 
going to go ahead and move up to the B
class<00:06:21.180> and<00:06:21.570> then<00:06:21.780> my<00:06:22.349> last<00:06:22.530> one<00:06:22.710> will<00:06:22.889> be<00:06:22.979> the
