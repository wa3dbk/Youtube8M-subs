pretty thin now am I a toss-up no I

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.810 
pretty thin now am I a toss-up no I
don't<00:00:39.900> think<00:00:39.990> so<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.040> do<00:00:41.190> believe<00:00:41.640> is

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
don't think so but what I do believe is

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.670 
don't think so but what I do believe is
just<00:00:42.000> stretching<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> dough<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> little<00:00:43.140> bit<00:00:43.500> I

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
just stretching the dough a little bit I

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.410 
just stretching the dough a little bit I
flop<00:00:44.130> throwing<00:00:44.640> up<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.910> here<00:00:45.000> i<00:00:45.090> think<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.360> a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
flop throwing up and here i think is a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.660 
flop throwing up and here i think is a
bit<00:00:45.570> more<00:00:45.720> of<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.900> show<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.740> i<00:00:47.070> don't
