00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.050 
they're there but I don't really care so
hit<00:02:10.960> okay<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.530> as<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.100> can<00:02:12.310> see<00:02:12.490> we<00:02:12.640> have<00:02:12.820> our

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
hit okay and as you can see we have our

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.670 
hit okay and as you can see we have our
model<00:02:13.810> imported<00:02:14.200> here<00:02:14.430> but<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:16.630> can<00:02:16.960> see<00:02:17.380> that

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
model imported here but you can see that

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.400 
model imported here but you can see that
we<00:02:18.070> have<00:02:18.280> Arctic<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.030> giggin<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:20.080> want<00:02:20.290> to

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
we have Arctic and giggin so you want to

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.950 
we have Arctic and giggin so you want to
delete<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:21.010> article<00:02:21.610> Tyrael<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.570> Arctic

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
delete the article Tyrael in the Arctic

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.610 
delete the article Tyrael in the Arctic
model<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.530> we<00:02:23.710> only<00:02:24.010> have<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:25.440> gigan<00:02:26.440> as

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
model so that we only have the gigan as

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.700 
model so that we only have the gigan as
you<00:02:26.980> can<00:02:27.130> see<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.490> not<00:02:27.670> with<00:02:28.600> this<00:02:28.720> texture<00:02:29.080> but

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
you can see is not with this texture but

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.370 
you can see is not with this texture but
that's<00:02:29.890> what<00:02:30.160> we're<00:02:30.370> going<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.700> do<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.630> so

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
that's what we're going to do that so

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.290 
that's what we're going to do that so
first<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.160> all<00:02:33.250> remove<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.760> reflection

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
first of all remove the reflection

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.060 
first of all remove the reflection
because<00:02:34.480> counter-strike<00:02:35.470> models<00:02:35.860> don't

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
because counter-strike models don't

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.280 
because counter-strike models don't
reflect<00:02:36.400> obviously<00:02:37.210> and<00:02:37.390> remove<00:02:38.140> the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
reflect obviously and remove the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.320 
reflect obviously and remove the
specular<00:02:38.770> because<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.820> don't<00:02:40.000> want<00:02:40.120> them<00:02:40.210> to

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
specular because you don't want them to

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.350 
specular because you don't want them to
look<00:02:40.420> like<00:02:40.480> plastic<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.580> next<00:02:42.820> thing<00:02:43.330> that

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
look like plastic so the next thing that

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.510 
look like plastic so the next thing that
you<00:02:43.570> have<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.810> do<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.050> go<00:02:44.200> into<00:02:44.290> color<00:02:44.530> texture

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
you have to do is go into color texture

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.170 
you have to do is go into color texture
and<00:02:45.690> select<00:02:46.690> getting<00:02:46.990> edn<00:02:47.380> base<00:02:47.590> yeah<00:02:48.550> now

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
and select getting edn base yeah now

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.660 
and select getting edn base yeah now
who's<00:02:49.480> important<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.200> as<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:51.040> can<00:02:51.160> see<00:02:51.220> we

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
who's important and as you can see we

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.580 
who's important and as you can see we
have<00:02:51.880> our<00:02:52.030> model<00:02:52.390> imported<00:02:53.020> with<00:02:53.230> all<00:02:53.440> the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
have our model imported with all the

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.580 
have our model imported with all the
textures<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:54.340> all<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:55.180> basic<00:02:55.660> stuff<00:02:55.930> so

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
textures and all that basic stuff so

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.510 
textures and all that basic stuff so
this<00:02:56.890> was<00:02:57.730> how<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.030> import<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.630> model<00:02:59.520> to

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
this was how to import the model to

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.030 
this was how to import the model to
cinema<00:03:00.850> 4d<00:03:01.030> including<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.810> texture<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:02.830> now

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
cinema 4d including the texture so now

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.170 
cinema 4d including the texture so now
we're<00:03:03.370> going<00:03:03.520> to<00:03:03.610> make<00:03:03.910> how<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.840> import<00:03:06.120> how<00:03:07.120> to

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
we're going to make how to import how to

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.949 
we're going to make how to import how to
import<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.720> model<00:03:08.200> into<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:08.980> map<00:03:09.220> that's<00:03:10.209> kinda

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
import the model into a map that's kinda

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.280 
import the model into a map that's kinda
that's<00:03:11.650> not<00:03:11.950> too<00:03:12.130> hard<00:03:12.370> but<00:03:12.580> it's<00:03:13.480> kind<00:03:14.200> of

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
that's not too hard but it's kind of

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.690 
that's not too hard but it's kind of
hard<00:03:14.470> if<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:14.680> don't<00:03:14.860> know<00:03:14.950> what<00:03:15.100> to<00:03:15.250> work<00:03:15.459> with

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
hard if you don't know what to work with

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.140 
hard if you don't know what to work with

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
can see if we try to move him he'll be

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.780 
can see if we try to move him he'll be
right<00:03:53.110> on<00:03:53.140> this<00:03:53.350> place<00:03:53.560> again<00:03:53.800> so<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:54.459> can't

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
right on this place again so you can't

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.940 
right on this place again so you can't
move<00:03:55.000> in<00:03:55.209> and<00:03:55.450> that's<00:03:56.320> why<00:03:56.860> you

and<00:04:00.770> no<00:04:01.090> so<00:04:02.090> another<00:04:02.510> object<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:03.080> you're<00:04:03.230> going

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
and no so another object so you're going

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.949 
and no so another object so you're going
to<00:04:03.410> press<00:04:04.160> shift<00:04:04.190> and<00:04:04.910> select<00:04:05.420> all<00:04:05.780> these

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
to press shift and select all these

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.890 
to press shift and select all these
three<00:04:06.230> I'm<00:04:07.220> going<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.550> objects<00:04:08.030> group<00:04:08.390> objects

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
three I'm going to objects group objects

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.470 
three I'm going to objects group objects
and<00:04:09.280> now<00:04:10.280> you<00:04:10.340> see<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:10.849> we<00:04:11.000> have<00:04:11.150> a<00:04:11.180> null

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
and now you see that we have a null

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.940 
and now you see that we have a null
object<00:04:11.660> you<00:04:12.080> can<00:04:12.230> call<00:04:12.440> it<00:04:12.560> whatever<00:04:12.709> you<00:04:12.860> want

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
object you can call it whatever you want

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.820 
object you can call it whatever you want
to<00:04:13.430> call<00:04:13.550> it<00:04:13.730> giggin<00:04:14.360> and<00:04:14.989> now<00:04:15.170> as<00:04:15.410> you<00:04:15.530> can<00:04:15.680> see

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
to call it giggin and now as you can see

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.590 
to call it giggin and now as you can see
we<00:04:16.010> can't<00:04:16.250> move<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.609> you<00:04:17.209> know

long<00:04:19.730> um<00:04:21.100> let's<00:04:22.100> I<00:04:22.400> think<00:04:22.760> he's<00:04:22.850> actually<00:04:23.000> on

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
long um let's I think he's actually on

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.510 
long um let's I think he's actually on
the<00:04:23.270> ground<00:04:23.480> now<00:04:23.690> yeah<00:04:23.960> he<00:04:24.169> is<00:04:24.200> so<00:04:24.889> if<00:04:25.160> we

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
the ground now yeah he is so if we

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.180 
the ground now yeah he is so if we
render<00:04:25.790> him<00:04:26.090> would<00:04:26.810> be<00:04:26.840> like<00:04:27.080> I<00:04:27.410> believe<00:04:28.010> I<00:04:28.130> can

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
render him would be like I believe I can

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.780 
render him would be like I believe I can
