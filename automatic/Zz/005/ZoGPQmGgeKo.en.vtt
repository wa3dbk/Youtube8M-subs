I want to explain three things related

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.480 
I want to explain three things related
to<00:00:02.879> mouse<00:00:03.179> settings<00:00:03.750> so<00:00:04.259> you<00:00:04.830> know<00:00:05.100> what<00:00:05.370> they

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
to mouse settings so you know what they

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.570 
to mouse settings so you know what they
mean<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.120> how<00:00:06.180> they<00:00:06.629> affect<00:00:06.960> your<00:00:07.020> gaming

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
mean and how they affect your gaming

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.970 
mean and how they affect your gaming
first<00:00:08.580> thing<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:09.000> need<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.240> know<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.840> that

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
first thing you need to know is that

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
first thing you need to know is that
higher<00:00:10.980> dpi<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:12.150> better<00:00:12.599> if<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.290> have<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:14.040> mouse

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
higher dpi is better if you have a mouse

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.810 
higher dpi is better if you have a mouse
driver<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.660> will<00:00:15.870> allow<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.410> set<00:00:16.949> higher

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
driver that will allow you to set higher

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.519 
driver that will allow you to set higher
dpi<00:00:18.480> please<00:00:19.109> do<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.910> in<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.390> case<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.990> can<00:00:22.289> set

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
dpi please do so in this case I can set

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.259 
dpi please do so in this case I can set
my<00:00:22.769> dpi<00:00:23.189> up<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:24.289> 3,500<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.529> do<00:00:26.279> not<00:00:26.519> want<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.970> set

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
my dpi up to 3,500 I do not want to set

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.999 
my dpi up to 3,500 I do not want to set
it<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.449> 400<00:00:28.170> because<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.560> pro<00:00:29.099> gamer<00:00:29.340> does<00:00:29.670> so

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
it to 400 because a pro gamer does so

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.959 
it to 400 because a pro gamer does so
higher<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.040> always<00:00:32.700> better<00:00:32.940> here<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.570> why

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
higher is always better here is why

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.860 
higher is always better here is why
higher<00:00:35.969> dpi<00:00:36.630> means<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.250> resolution<00:00:38.870> at

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
higher dpi means that the resolution at

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.889 
higher dpi means that the resolution at
which<00:00:40.770> your<00:00:41.129> mouse<00:00:41.309> sensory<00:00:41.850> course<00:00:42.450> movement

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
which your mouse sensory course movement

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.540 
which your mouse sensory course movement
is<00:00:43.370> higher<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:45.059> case<00:00:45.410> 3,200<00:00:46.410> has<00:00:46.680> eight

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
is higher in this case 3,200 has eight

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.040 
is higher in this case 3,200 has eight
times<00:00:48.059> more<00:00:48.239> resolution<00:00:49.850> this<00:00:50.850> means<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.629> if

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
times more resolution this means that if

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.290 
times more resolution this means that if
you<00:00:52.440> move<00:00:53.100> your<00:00:53.460> mouse<00:00:53.809> by<00:00:54.809> 0.6<00:00:55.590> millimeters

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
you move your mouse by 0.6 millimeters

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.590 
you move your mouse by 0.6 millimeters
let's<00:00:57.300> imagine<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.109> 0.6<00:00:58.500> millimeters

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
let's imagine this is 0.6 millimeters

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.650 
let's imagine this is 0.6 millimeters
the<00:01:00.600> 400<00:01:01.320> P<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.500> mouse<00:01:01.859> sensor<00:01:02.280> will<00:01:02.489> senses<00:01:03.449> as

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the 400 P I mouse sensor will senses as

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.370 
the 400 P I mouse sensor will senses as
one<00:01:04.530> signal<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.549> centers<00:01:06.090> one<00:01:06.840> signal<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
game the 3200 dpi sensor will send eight

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.160 
game the 3200 dpi sensor will send eight
signals<00:01:12.619> to<00:01:13.619> your<00:01:13.950> game<00:01:14.420> which<00:01:15.420> means<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:16.020> is

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
signals to your game which means it is

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.100 
signals to your game which means it is
eight<00:01:16.650> times<00:01:17.040> as<00:01:17.400> accurate<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.479> also<00:01:18.689> means

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
eight times as accurate it also means

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.450 
eight times as accurate it also means
that<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.860> move<00:01:20.130> your<00:01:21.060> mouse<00:01:22.220> it<00:01:23.220> will

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
that you can move your mouse it will

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.469 
that you can move your mouse it will
detect<00:01:23.790> much<00:01:24.240> smaller<00:01:24.750> mouse<00:01:25.140> movements<00:01:26.479> in

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
detect much smaller mouse movements in

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.950 
detect much smaller mouse movements in
this<00:01:27.750> case<00:01:28.020> around<00:01:28.590> point<00:01:29.630> zero<00:01:30.630> eight

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
this case around point zero eight

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.319 
this case around point zero eight
millimeters<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.369> minimum<00:01:32.850> movement<00:01:33.000> of

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
millimeters is the minimum movement of

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.520 
millimeters is the minimum movement of
the<00:01:33.509> mouse<00:01:33.720> required<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:35.159> order<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
the mouse required in order for the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.289 
the mouse required in order for the
sensor<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.710> detect<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> mouse<00:01:38.850> moment

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
sensor to detect this as a mouse moment

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.770 
sensor to detect this as a mouse moment
so<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.689> brings<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.409> more<00:01:41.310> accuracy<00:01:42.119> special

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
so this brings you more accuracy special

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.630 
so this brings you more accuracy special
than<00:01:42.960> your<00:01:43.079> zoom<00:01:43.350> deal<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.890> with<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> sniper

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
than your zoom deal with with a sniper

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.569 
than your zoom deal with with a sniper
rifle<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:46.500> aspects<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.310> game

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
rifle but in all aspects of the game

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.889 
rifle but in all aspects of the game
this<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.439> higher<00:01:49.770> dpi<00:01:50.220> settings<00:01:50.899> means

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
this and the higher dpi settings means

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.649 
this and the higher dpi settings means
in<00:01:52.259> haste<00:01:53.450> pointer<00:01:54.500> precision<00:01:55.500> your<00:01:55.890> your<00:01:56.659> you

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
in haste pointer precision your your you

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.319 
in haste pointer precision your your you
know<00:01:57.750> crosshair<00:01:58.229> precision<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.579> always<00:02:00.149> use

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
know crosshair precision so always use

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.020 
know crosshair precision so always use
the<00:02:00.509> higher<00:02:00.689> setting

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
the higher setting

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.109 
the higher setting
how<00:02:03.990> does<00:02:04.230> sensitivity<00:02:05.180> work<00:02:06.180> here<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:08.119> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
how does sensitivity work here so and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.240 
how does sensitivity work here so and
since<00:02:09.360> its<00:02:09.600> sensitivity<00:02:10.170> tells<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.490> game<00:02:13.250> by

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
since its sensitivity tells the game by

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.930 
since its sensitivity tells the game by
how<00:02:14.640> much<00:02:14.910> should<00:02:15.570> it<00:02:15.600> move<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.920> cursor<00:02:17.460> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
how much should it move the cursor the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.150 
how much should it move the cursor the
crosshair<00:02:18.540> when<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.960> detects<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.590> movement

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
crosshair when it detects a movement

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.240 
crosshair when it detects a movement
so<00:02:20.730> let's<00:02:21.630> say<00:02:21.870> your<00:02:22.230> four<00:02:22.680> hundred<00:02:22.800> dpi

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
so let's say your four hundred dpi

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.170 
so let's say your four hundred dpi
sensitivity<00:02:24.180> is<00:02:25.020> at<00:02:25.350> two<00:02:25.740> this<00:02:26.550> means<00:02:26.880> that

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
sensitivity is at two this means that

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.220 
sensitivity is at two this means that
when<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.540> move<00:02:27.750> your<00:02:28.200> mouse<00:02:28.500> by<00:02:30.110> point<00:02:31.110> zero

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
when you move your mouse by point zero

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.120 
when you move your mouse by point zero
point<00:02:31.890> six<00:02:32.370> millimeters<00:02:33.260> your<00:02:34.260> game<00:02:34.950> will

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
point six millimeters your game will

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.400 
point six millimeters your game will
translate<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.850> into<00:02:36.150> two<00:02:36.480> units<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:37.080> the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
translate this into two units of the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.530 
translate this into two units of the
moments<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.920> crosshair<00:02:39.320> because<00:02:40.520> your<00:02:41.540> 3200

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
moments of crosshair because your 3200

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.810 
moments of crosshair because your 3200
dpi<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.959> mouse<00:02:43.350> sensitivity<00:02:44.930> needs<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.440> be

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
dpi a mouse sensitivity needs to be

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.740 
dpi a mouse sensitivity needs to be
eight<00:02:47.820> times<00:02:48.360> lower<00:02:49.170> if<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.280> want<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:51.450> game

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
eight times lower if you want the game

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.020 
eight times lower if you want the game
to<00:02:51.780> translate<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.830> into<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.430> same<00:02:53.670> amount

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
to translate this into the same amount

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.880 
to translate this into the same amount
of<00:02:54.180> movement<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.920> as<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.850> can<00:02:57.030> see<00:02:57.150> here<00:02:57.890> these

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
of movement so as you can see here these

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.699 
of movement so as you can see here these
two<00:02:58.950> settings<00:02:59.580> will<00:02:59.880> produce<00:03:00.540> equal<00:03:01.200> amount

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
two settings will produce equal amount

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.890 
two settings will produce equal amount
of<00:03:04.040> crosshair<00:03:05.040> movement<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:05.940> obviously<00:03:06.630> this

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
of crosshair movement but obviously this

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.420 
of crosshair movement but obviously this
one<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.410> eight<00:03:07.860> times<00:03:08.160> or<00:03:08.550> as<00:03:08.760> precise<00:03:10.430> the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
one is eight times or as precise the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
one is eight times or as precise the
poll<00:03:11.730> rate<00:03:12.030> should<00:03:12.870> all<00:03:13.230> also<00:03:14.130> always<00:03:14.730> be<00:03:15.000> set

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
poll rate should all also always be set

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.170 
poll rate should all also always be set
to<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.810> highest<00:03:16.380> number<00:03:16.860> available<00:03:17.519> in<00:03:17.700> this

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
to the highest number available in this

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.810 
to the highest number available in this
case<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.780> have<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.530> ability<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:20.190> set<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.459> poll

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
case I have the ability to set a poll

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.310 
case I have the ability to set a poll
rate<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:22.550> 1000<00:03:23.550> this<00:03:24.090> means<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:25.050> will

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
rate to 1000 this means that it will

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.210 
rate to 1000 this means that it will
update<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:27.450> mouse<00:03:27.989> sensor<00:03:28.380> information<00:03:28.680> to

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
update the mouse sensor information to

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.070 
update the mouse sensor information to
the<00:03:29.340> game<00:03:29.550> a<00:03:29.850> thousand<00:03:30.810> times<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.200> second<00:03:31.709> the

the game a thousand times a second the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.960 
the game a thousand times a second the
this<00:03:34.080> then<00:03:34.470> means<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.459> maximum<00:03:35.880> amount

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
this then means that the maximum amount

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.240 
this then means that the maximum amount
of<00:03:36.299> light<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:39.560> after<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.590> move<00:03:40.890> my<00:03:41.040> mouse

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
of light that after I move my mouse

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.580 
of light that after I move my mouse
there<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.880> maximum<00:03:42.269> amount<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.930> lag<00:03:43.110> will<00:03:43.410> be

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
there the maximum amount of lag will be

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.840 
there the maximum amount of lag will be
one<00:03:43.860> millisecond<00:03:44.610> if<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.420> have<00:03:45.660> 500<00:03:46.850> update

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
one millisecond if you have 500 update

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.600 
one millisecond if you have 500 update
rate<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.600> maximum<00:03:49.230> amount<00:03:49.799> of<00:03:50.010> like<00:03:50.160> it's<00:03:50.400> 2

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
rate the maximum amount of like it's 2

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.460 
rate the maximum amount of like it's 2
milliseconds<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:52.850> 125<00:03:53.850> it<00:03:54.630> means<00:03:54.930> that

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
milliseconds and the 125 it means that

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.920 
milliseconds and the 125 it means that
your<00:03:55.799> movement<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.880> mouse<00:03:57.180> movement<00:03:57.510> will

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
your movement the mouse movement will

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.979 
your movement the mouse movement will
lag<00:03:58.350> up<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.980> 8<00:03:59.250> milliseconds<00:04:00.030> this<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:00.540> the

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
lag up to 8 milliseconds this is the

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.949 
lag up to 8 milliseconds this is the
difference<00:04:01.410> between<00:04:02.120> kill<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.390> being<00:04:03.630> killed

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
difference between kill and being killed

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.530 
difference between kill and being killed
in<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.290> game<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:05.030> this<00:04:06.030> does<00:04:06.239> not<00:04:06.360> affect

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
in a game so this does not affect

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.690 
in a game so this does not affect
sensitivity<00:04:07.410> in<00:04:07.620> any<00:04:07.890> way<00:04:08.070> in<00:04:08.340> just<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.940> faster

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.350 

the<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:12.180> lag<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:13.220> you<00:04:14.220> always<00:04:14.580> want<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.120> have

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
the the lag and you always want to have

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.259 
the the lag and you always want to have
this<00:04:15.540> as<00:04:15.780> high<00:04:16.079> as<00:04:16.290> possible

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
this as high as possible

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.060 
this as high as possible
the<00:04:18.269> third<00:04:18.600> misconception<00:04:19.049> is<00:04:19.620> about<00:04:20.040> a

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
the third misconception is about a

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.340 
the third misconception is about a
window<00:04:20.459> settings<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.810> window<00:04:22.079> small

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
window settings so the window small

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.780 
window settings so the window small
settings<00:04:23.330> normally<00:04:24.330> reflect<00:04:24.810> just<00:04:25.790> movement

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
settings normally reflect just movement

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.830 
settings normally reflect just movement
of<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.210> mouse<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:28.250> windows<00:04:29.250> so<00:04:30.030> when<00:04:30.389> I<00:04:30.419> have

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
of the mouse and windows so when I have

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.870 
of the mouse and windows so when I have
the<00:04:31.680> mouse<00:04:32.690> DPI<00:04:33.690> settings<00:04:34.080> -<00:04:34.440> very<00:04:34.680> high<00:04:34.950> in<00:04:35.700> my

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
the mouse DPI settings - very high in my

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.620 
the mouse DPI settings - very high in my
mouth<00:04:36.180> driver<00:04:36.600> I<00:04:37.370> need<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.669> have<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.300> windows

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
mouth driver I need to have the windows

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.470 
mouth driver I need to have the windows
sensitivity<00:04:40.590> set<00:04:40.889> to<00:04:41.160> low<00:04:41.370> because<00:04:41.730> otherwise

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
sensitivity set to low because otherwise

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.350 
sensitivity set to low because otherwise
my<00:04:43.139> mouse<00:04:43.380> would<00:04:43.710> move<00:04:43.919> and<00:04:44.490> crazy<00:04:44.880> and<00:04:45.270> it

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
my mouse would move and crazy and it

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.920 
my mouse would move and crazy and it
wouldn't<00:04:45.600> would<00:04:46.020> not<00:04:46.169> be<00:04:46.350> controllable<00:04:47.900> so<00:04:48.900> I

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
wouldn't would not be controllable so I

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.750 
wouldn't would not be controllable so I
set<00:04:49.320> it<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.590> low<00:04:50.240> like<00:04:51.240> this<00:04:51.419> usually<00:04:52.580> in<00:04:53.580> the

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
set it to low like this usually in the

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.719 
set it to low like this usually in the
game<00:04:53.970> this<00:04:54.180> does<00:04:54.419> not<00:04:54.600> matter<00:04:54.900> because

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
game this does not matter because

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.490 
game this does not matter because
normally<00:04:56.729> you<00:04:56.790> will<00:04:56.910> have<00:04:57.180> raw<00:04:57.450> input<00:04:58.050> to<00:04:58.229> on

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
normally you will have raw input to on

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.860 
normally you will have raw input to on
and<00:04:58.860> then<00:04:58.979> this<00:04:59.130> is<00:04:59.310> on<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.850> windows<00:05:00.360> setting

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
and then this is on the windows setting

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:11.920 
and then this is on the windows setting
is<00:05:01.190> completely<00:05:02.450> ignored<00:05:04.220> so<00:05:05.780> in<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.960> game

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:18.980 

normally<00:05:14.180> if<00:05:15.180> this<00:05:15.540> was<00:05:15.810> set<00:05:16.320> to<00:05:16.770> OFF<00:05:17.840> which<00:05:18.840> is

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
normally if this was set to OFF which is

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.380 
normally if this was set to OFF which is
something<00:05:19.229> you<00:05:19.680> usually<00:05:20.070> don't<00:05:20.400> want<00:05:20.490> to<00:05:20.760> do

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.950 

now<00:05:24.390> it<00:05:24.600> would<00:05:24.840> reflect<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:27.180> windows<00:05:27.510> setting

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
now it would reflect the windows setting

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.400 
now it would reflect the windows setting
so<00:05:28.650> if<00:05:28.800> I<00:05:28.950> said<00:05:29.250> it's<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.580> fast

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.830 

in<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.010> game<00:05:35.190> it<00:05:35.370> also<00:05:35.460> becomes<00:05:36.240> very<00:05:36.360> very

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
in the game it also becomes very very

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.880 
in the game it also becomes very very
fast<00:05:37.170> but<00:05:38.010> you<00:05:38.520> only<00:05:38.670> think<00:05:39.270> I<00:05:39.420> need<00:05:39.600> to<00:05:39.630> do<00:05:40.140> and

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:48.320 

turn<00:05:43.890> it<00:05:44.130> off<00:05:45.350> or<00:05:46.350> turn<00:05:46.770> turn<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.550> raw<00:05:47.730> input
