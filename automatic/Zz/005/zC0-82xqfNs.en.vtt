are you doing and this is the pipe let
me<00:00:21.720> see<00:00:21.869> if<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.080> can<00:00:22.260> get<00:00:23.510> here<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.600> go

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.530 

okay<00:00:34.870> and<00:00:35.140> these<00:00:35.530> are<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:35.980> rises<00:00:36.730> this

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
okay and these are the rises this

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.880 
okay and these are the rises this
happens<00:00:38.050> to<00:00:38.290> be<00:00:38.320> about<00:00:38.950> a<00:00:39.210> 24<00:00:40.210> inch<00:00:40.450> riser<00:00:40.960> now

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
happens to be about a 24 inch riser now

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.090 
happens to be about a 24 inch riser now
as<00:00:42.130> you<00:00:42.310> can<00:00:42.490> see<00:00:42.550> it's<00:00:43.540> got<00:00:43.930> the<00:00:44.230> coupling

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
as you can see it's got the coupling

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.010 
as you can see it's got the coupling
from<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.490> factory<00:00:46.000> it's<00:00:46.330> called<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.720> stab

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
from the factory it's called a stab

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.400 
from the factory it's called a stab
coupling<00:00:47.650> and<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:49.390> can<00:00:49.540> see<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.840> grease<00:00:50.080> in

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
coupling and you can see the grease in

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.490 
coupling and you can see the grease in
there<00:00:50.650> waiting<00:00:51.100> to<00:00:51.340> accept<00:00:51.730> the<00:00:51.880> pipe<00:00:52.120> and<00:00:52.500> it

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
there waiting to accept the pipe and it

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.310 
there waiting to accept the pipe and it
could<00:00:53.740> goes<00:00:53.950> from<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.490> coupling<00:00:55.030> back<00:00:55.930> to<00:00:56.200> the

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
could goes from the coupling back to the

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.800 
could goes from the coupling back to the
SDR<00:00:56.710> 11<00:00:57.340> and<00:00:57.960> converts<00:00:58.960> into<00:01:00.239> steel<00:01:01.239> from<00:01:01.660> the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
thread at the top that you can screw a

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.800 
thread at the top that you can screw a
union<00:01:09.160> or<00:01:09.340> an<00:01:09.460> elbow<00:01:09.640> on<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:10.270> go<00:01:10.390> into<00:01:10.570> the

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
union or an elbow on and go into the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.600 
union or an elbow on and go into the
house<00:01:11.020> or<00:01:11.440> of<00:01:11.560> a<00:01:11.650> valve<00:01:11.950> or<00:01:12.190> whatever<00:01:12.460> you're

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
house or of a valve or whatever you're

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.270 
house or of a valve or whatever you're
going<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:12.790> do<00:01:13.060> and<00:01:13.360> as<00:01:13.990> you<00:01:14.110> can<00:01:14.260> see<00:01:14.320> as<00:01:14.740> a<00:01:14.770> sign

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
going to do and as you can see as a sign

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.240 
going to do and as you can see as a sign
do<00:01:15.550> not<00:01:15.729> bury<00:01:16.240> a<00:01:16.360> blow<00:01:16.840> this<00:01:17.110> line<00:01:17.410> so<00:01:18.010> this

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
do not bury a blow this line so this

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.249 
do not bury a blow this line so this
would<00:01:18.490> be<00:01:18.640> sticking<00:01:19.060> up<00:01:19.150> out<00:01:19.330> of<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.509> grass<00:01:19.900> to

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
would be sticking up out of the grass to

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.609 
would be sticking up out of the grass to
here<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:21.400> would<00:01:21.670> put<00:01:21.880> you<00:01:22.000> 18<00:01:22.600> inches<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:23.259> 20

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
here that would put you 18 inches to 20

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.550 
here that would put you 18 inches to 20
inches<00:01:23.650> deep<00:01:24.220> which<00:01:24.490> is<00:01:24.670> code<00:01:25.060> for<00:01:25.170> gas<00:01:26.170> line

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
inches deep which is code for gas line

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.310 
inches deep which is code for gas line
all<00:01:27.460> right<00:01:27.670> so<00:01:28.000> these<00:01:28.180> are<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.570> Rises<00:01:29.140> you

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
all right so these are the Rises you

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.460 
all right so these are the Rises you
would<00:01:29.470> buy<00:01:29.650> two<00:01:29.680> of<00:01:30.009> these<00:01:30.660> one<00:01:31.660> for<00:01:31.990> one<00:01:32.229> end

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
would buy two of these one for one end

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.550 
would buy two of these one for one end
then<00:01:33.400> you<00:01:33.550> connect<00:01:33.940> your<00:01:34.090> gas<00:01:34.360> line<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:35.080> it

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
then you connect your gas line and it

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.100 
then you connect your gas line and it
I've<00:01:35.680> wanted<00:01:36.160> the<00:01:36.340> other<00:01:36.520> end<00:01:36.910> where<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:37.900> pool

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
I've wanted the other end where the pool

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.660 
I've wanted the other end where the pool
heat<00:01:38.350> is<00:01:38.530> going<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.800> be<00:01:38.920> one<00:01:39.159> for<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.400> meter

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
heat is going to be one for the meter

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.580 
heat is going to be one for the meter
and<00:01:39.940> against<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.540> house<00:01:40.720> close<00:01:41.080> to<00:01:41.260> the<00:01:41.350> meter

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
and against the house close to the meter

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
and against the house close to the meter
one<00:01:42.460> very<00:01:42.940> close<00:01:43.330> to<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.780> pool<00:01:43.990> heater<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.800> of

one very close to the pool heater and of

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.360 
one very close to the pool heater and of
course<00:01:45.909> this<00:01:46.180> pipe<00:01:46.800> inserts<00:01:47.800> into<00:01:48.100> this

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
course this pipe inserts into this

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.820 
course this pipe inserts into this
coupling<00:01:48.940> if<00:01:49.180> I<00:01:49.900> can't<00:01:50.200> do<00:01:50.320> it<00:01:50.470> here<00:01:50.680> because

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
coupling if I can't do it here because

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.640 
coupling if I can't do it here because
it's<00:01:51.280> extremely<00:01:51.850> hard<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.090> do<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:53.229> take<00:01:53.470> the

it's extremely hard to do you take the
pipe<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.190> you<00:01:54.400> insert<00:01:54.850> it<00:01:55.030> in<00:01:55.180> it's<00:01:55.390> called<00:01:55.600> a

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
pipe and you insert it in it's called a

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.510 
pipe and you insert it in it's called a
stab<00:01:55.900> coupling<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.440> you'll<00:01:56.860> push<00:01:57.100> it<00:01:57.280> till<00:01:57.400> it

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
stab coupling and you'll push it till it

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.760 
stab coupling and you'll push it till it
goes<00:01:57.610> all<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:57.820> way<00:01:58.030> in<00:01:58.240> there<00:01:58.840> was<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.050> chamfer

it cleans the inside and the outside and
it<00:02:12.910> burns<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.540> down<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.019> makes<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.350> small

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
it burns it down and makes it small

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.060 
it burns it down and makes it small
almost<00:02:14.830> like<00:02:15.070> a<00:02:15.100> bullet<00:02:15.640> tip<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.959> chamfers<00:02:17.799> it

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
almost like a bullet tip it chamfers it

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.199 
almost like a bullet tip it chamfers it
inside<00:02:18.519> and<00:02:18.730> outside<00:02:19.080> makes<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.290> very<00:02:20.500> easy<00:02:21.209> to

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
inside and outside makes it very easy to

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.060 
inside and outside makes it very easy to
insert<00:02:22.930> into<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:23.709> stab<00:02:24.100> coupling<00:02:25.890> which<00:02:26.890> it

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
insert into this stab coupling which it

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.910 
insert into this stab coupling which it
goes<00:02:27.280> right<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:27.850> there<00:02:28.060> it's<00:02:28.900> very<00:02:29.290> hard<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.709> do

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
goes right in there it's very hard to do

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.949 
goes right in there it's very hard to do
but<00:02:30.130> once<00:02:30.310> you're<00:02:30.489> done<00:02:30.640> it's<00:02:30.940> done<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.420> just

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
but once you're done it's done it just

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.860 
but once you're done it's done it just
pushes<00:02:32.230> in<00:02:32.590> about<00:02:32.890> two<00:02:33.160> inches<00:02:33.549> and<00:02:33.820> that's<00:02:34.570> it

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
pushes in about two inches and that's it

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.160 
pushes in about two inches and that's it
you're<00:02:35.049> done<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.850> course<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:37.209> didn't<00:02:37.810> do<00:02:37.989> it

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
you're done of course I didn't do it

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.479 
you're done of course I didn't do it
because<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:38.560> don't<00:02:38.739> have<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:38.920> champion<00:02:39.310> tool

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
because I don't have the champion tool

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.729 
because I don't have the champion tool
down<00:02:39.700> here<00:02:39.970> but<00:02:40.570> that's<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:41.110> so<00:02:41.350> I'm<00:02:41.530> going<00:02:41.709> to

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
down here but that's it so I'm going to

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.470 
down here but that's it so I'm going to
draw<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.130> on<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.340> board<00:02:42.370> fiea<00:02:42.849> we're<00:02:43.270> going<00:02:43.390> to

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
draw it on the board fiea we're going to

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.710 
draw it on the board fiea we're going to
go

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
go

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.080 
go
for<00:02:43.930> drawing<00:02:44.490> well<00:02:45.490> whether<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:45.850> be<00:02:45.970> an

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
for drawing well whether it be an

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.420 
for drawing well whether it be an
absolute<00:02:46.420> gas<00:02:46.570> pool<00:02:46.810> heater<00:02:47.080> or<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.710> detached

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
absolute gas pool heater or a detached

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.860 
absolute gas pool heater or a detached
garage<00:02:48.580> we're<00:02:49.090> going<00:02:49.240> to<00:02:49.300> run<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.480> guess<00:02:49.660> like

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
garage we're going to run the guess like

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.270 
garage we're going to run the guess like
two<00:02:50.020> or<00:02:50.140> anything<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.710> you're<00:02:50.920> going<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.160> run

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
two or anything that you're going to run

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.030 
two or anything that you're going to run
an<00:02:51.430> underlying<00:02:52.000> gas<00:02:52.330> line<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.660> they<00:02:53.650> don't<00:02:53.860> run

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
an underlying gas line to they don't run

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.630 
an underlying gas line to they don't run
gas<00:02:54.250> lines<00:02:54.520> above<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.850> ground<00:02:55.180> anymore<00:02:55.510> I

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
gas lines above the ground anymore I

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.220 
gas lines above the ground anymore I
guess<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:57.850> could<00:02:58.150> if<00:02:58.300> you<00:02:58.420> wanted<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:59.020> but

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
guess you could if you wanted to but

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.840 
guess you could if you wanted to but
people<00:02:59.380> trip<00:02:59.800> over<00:03:00.250> them<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.490> it's<00:03:00.610> kind<00:03:00.820> of

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
people trip over them and it's kind of

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.550 
people trip over them and it's kind of
difficult<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.360> do<00:03:01.570> so<00:03:01.780> pretty<00:03:02.350> much

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
difficult to do so pretty much

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.760 
difficult to do so pretty much
everything's<00:03:03.040> underground<00:03:03.550> now
