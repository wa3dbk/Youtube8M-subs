00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:19.619
 to sign up 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.850
 after five years adding content to the episode of rhinitis is a step 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.539
 up on the 3 stickers 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.440
 the promises was one day even more options for pension activities 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.950
 lie a unique freedom to create that personalizes 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.480
 to a selic that affirmed that in the last degree of potential he had 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.480
 do not be too 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.480
 but the competence of the developers can 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.290
 still sign up for a game that privileges veterans of the franchise 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.690
 leaving aside the new 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.360
 and yes of the three can be considered the quotation of the fans of the team 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.990
 the developers made a point of stressing while driving the car 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.510
 because I was listening to the criticisms and suggestions 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.260
 the amateur documentary 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.150
 and this is very noticeable 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.450
 in practice this translates into the possibility of personalizing 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.850
 just about everything 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.920
 people 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.510
 or good objects for decoration 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.540
 vision systems now I am much more versatile intuitive 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.710
 the element common to all of them and copper wiring ground 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.620
 of the various prefabricated patterns 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.960
 you can catch any of them that change their settings 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.170
 instead of cutting and sewing for the decision to the injured client when 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.200
 created where you want 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.550
 or even share with friends that the community of players this 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.730
 also applies to heads bovespa and even other elements of house decoration 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.520
 as wallpaper 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.440
 Until then the game mechanics and 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.180
 allowing the capital 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.240
 hired as the best mayor 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.090
 later all this material can be sent to the online community 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.980
 cartoon officer 3 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.890
 so other users will be left alone in this 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.660
 how many other people 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.010
 Not only that 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.520
 the photos and videos per minute in the joke 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.279
 being that of those three curriculum discs of videos practical it in collective 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.389
 when the repressive action begins 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:14.489
 I have no problem, Jacques. 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.299
 everything is still alive said 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.299
 the main differences were due to the size of the environment 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.549
 no more restricted to the house the world gives closed 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.609
 and it is a new system of ambitions 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.349
 with regard to the Senate, imagine that now the complete deck contained in the 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.719
 playing field being so more options of places to visit activities 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.729
 to participate 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:38.169
 people with whom you interact who already know the series take this letter but 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:42.009
 those who are coming now and may have trouble managing everything I 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:46.559
 I can then present your reformulated version of the desire system and 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:50.729
 ambitions of the syndicate now they have characteristics that 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:54.999
 defining unique personalities for each one based on this who stipulates 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.999
 maximum sales targets for each industry 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.499
 goals - appears all the time as if they were people were harmed calls 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:05.319
 causes of the problem 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.489
 the interesting practical system was judged justice 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.510
 British police investigate the possibility of suicide 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:18.109
 the visual has noticeable improvements mainly in the effects of light and 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.079
 shadow definition of people leaves early on account of which of cartoon 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.079
 of artist's drawings must be a matter of 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.329
 are not exaggerated. 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.669
 the outside environments present difficulties even frightened I'm more 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:34.909

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.450
 sinister this is a game that defined successful mechanics of sinister and 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:42.449
 would be presented with numerous new possibilities of personalization 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.799
 Content Distribution 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.519
 longtime fans have found yet another game experience has made has 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.519
 been characteristic the innovator throughout the day 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.209
 unfortunately this has a price and happens to be blood 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.909
 yet decisions are attractive enough to convince much 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.779
 those who find it difficult to dedicate themselves to the end
