how<00:00:19.920> would<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.160> suggest<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:21.000> best<00:00:21.420> split<00:00:21.810> up

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
how would you suggest to best split up

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.980 
how would you suggest to best split up
ad<00:00:22.199> campaigns<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.369> split<00:00:23.970> test<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.539> know<00:00:24.779> this

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
ad campaigns and split test I know this

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.140 
ad campaigns and split test I know this
is<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.470> different<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:25.949> each<00:00:26.010> person

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
is going to be different for each person

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.330 
is going to be different for each person
an<00:00:27.150> example<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.990> how<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.320> do<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.010> how

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
an example of how you do it and how

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.820 
an example of how you do it and how
often<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.970> make<00:00:30.150> changes<00:00:30.570> would<00:00:31.320> sure<00:00:31.650> be

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
often you make changes would sure be

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.150 
often you make changes would sure be

I<00:00:35.370> tell<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> biggest<00:00:37.170> failures

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
I tell you one of the biggest failures

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.459 
I tell you one of the biggest failures
that<00:00:37.920> advertisers<00:00:38.579> make<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.480> they<00:00:39.780> fail<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
that advertisers make is they fail to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.040 
that advertisers make is they fail to
split<00:00:41.070> test<00:00:41.399> adequately<00:00:42.090> they<00:00:42.570> stop<00:00:42.899> at

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
split test adequately they stop at

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.229 
split test adequately they stop at
making<00:00:43.410> one<00:00:43.620> ad<00:00:43.860> they<00:00:44.219> stopped<00:00:44.550> making<00:00:45.059> two

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
making one ad they stopped making two

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.569 
making one ad they stopped making two
ads<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.020> thing<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.649> can't<00:00:46.980> make<00:00:47.160> too<00:00:47.430> many

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
ads the thing is you can't make too many

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.970 
ads the thing is you can't make too many
ads<00:00:47.940> when<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.660> split<00:00:48.899> test<00:00:49.230> create<00:00:49.739> as<00:00:49.829> many

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
ads when you split test create as many

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.069 
ads when you split test create as many
variations<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.510> see<00:00:51.660> what<00:00:51.809> works

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
variations as you can to see what works

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.020 
variations as you can to see what works
and<00:00:52.320> what<00:00:52.410> doesn't<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.489> here<00:00:53.670> are<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.760> five

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
and what doesn't so here are the five

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.569 
and what doesn't so here are the five
things<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.629> suggest<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.440> i<00:00:55.860> actually<00:00:56.160> do

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
things that I suggest that i actually do

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.510 
things that I suggest that i actually do
number<00:00:57.090> one<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.629> shouldn't<00:00:58.140> surprise<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.739> use

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
number one it shouldn't surprise you use

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.610 
number one it shouldn't surprise you use

do this they'll create one campaign and

ends up focusing your budget and only a

neglecting vast majority of them now

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.679 
neglecting vast majority of them now
this<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:37.920> Facebook<00:01:38.490> optimizing<00:01:39.240> those<00:01:39.390> ads

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
this is Facebook optimizing those ads

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.350 
this is Facebook optimizing those ads
however<00:01:40.409> I'd<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:41.009> see<00:01:41.280> those<00:01:41.759> ads<00:01:42.030> run<00:01:42.329> a

however I'd like to see those ads run a

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.940 
however I'd like to see those ads run a
little<00:01:42.540> bit<00:01:42.720> longer<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.259> i<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.439> see<00:01:43.619> whether

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
little bit longer so i can see whether

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.100 
little bit longer so i can see whether
or<00:01:44.070> not<00:01:44.159> they<00:01:44.280> truly<00:01:44.610> do<00:01:44.759> work<00:01:45.000> or<00:01:45.240> not<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.930> one

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
way to force this to happen is to create

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.600 
way to force this to happen is to create
multiple<00:01:48.540> campaigns<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.710> fewer<00:01:50.100> ads<00:01:50.310> within
