bit<00:00:20.279> deeper<00:00:20.609> in<00:00:20.730> depth<00:00:21.170> so<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.680> needs<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.340> pull

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
bit deeper in depth so it needs a pull

pretty good on the label designs scroll
page<00:00:32.180> so<00:00:33.180> I'm<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.480> go<00:00:33.570> ahead<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.870> filled

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
page so I'm going to go ahead and filled

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.440 
page so I'm going to go ahead and filled
it<00:00:34.230> up<00:00:34.320> real<00:00:34.559> quick<00:00:35.780> and<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:38.239> I'm<00:00:39.239> going<00:00:39.420> to

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
it up real quick and then I'm going to

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.010 
it up real quick and then I'm going to
add<00:00:40.700> 1/2<00:00:41.700> cup<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:42.000> water<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> bottom<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.870> it

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
add 1/2 cup of water to the bottom of it

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:57.319 
add 1/2 cup of water to the bottom of it
I<00:00:45.800> think<00:00:52.460> they<00:00:53.460> feel<00:00:53.610> too<00:00:53.850> much<00:00:55.460> but<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
I think they feel too much but it's the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.040 
I think they feel too much but it's the
bottom<00:00:57.629> that's<00:00:57.750> touching<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:59.809> maybe<00:01:00.809> just

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
bottom that's touching it so maybe just

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.160 
bottom that's touching it so maybe just
a<00:01:01.079> little<00:01:01.109> too<00:01:01.440> much<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.510> under<00:01:03.899> half<00:01:04.049> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
a little too much so just under half a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.289 
a little too much so just under half a
cup<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.439> water<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.680> guess<00:01:07.520> so<00:01:08.520> that's<00:01:09.030> probably

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
cup of water I guess so that's probably

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.230 
cup of water I guess so that's probably
good<00:01:09.479> set<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.170> handle<00:01:10.470> here<00:01:10.820> tech<00:01:11.820> tip<00:01:11.970> kind<00:01:12.180> of

a<00:02:45.070> hiking<00:02:45.220> trip<00:02:45.460> this<00:02:45.670> is<00:02:45.760> kind<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:45.970> small

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
a hiking trip this is kind of small

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.550 
a hiking trip this is kind of small
especially<00:02:46.450> if<00:02:46.690> I<00:02:46.750> cut<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.050> handle<00:02:47.350> off<00:02:47.440> I

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
especially if I cut the handle off I

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.090 
especially if I cut the handle off I
think<00:02:47.740> of<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:47.890> good<00:02:48.010> grade<00:02:48.280> in<00:02:48.460> my<00:02:48.580> backpack<00:02:48.820> so

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
think of a good grade in my backpack so

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.990 
think of a good grade in my backpack so
it<00:02:51.100> might<00:02:51.280> even<00:02:51.400> replace<00:02:51.940> both<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:53.820> like<00:02:54.820> to

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
it might even replace both I like to

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.830 
it might even replace both I like to
flip<00:02:55.150> pancakes

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
flip pancakes

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.890 
flip pancakes
perfect<00:02:56.500> size<00:02:56.680> for<00:02:56.710> pancakes<00:02:57.310> just<00:02:57.750> give<00:02:58.750> them

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
perfect size for pancakes just give them

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.450 
perfect size for pancakes just give them
a<00:02:58.990> little<00:02:59.020> bit<00:02:59.260> deeper<00:02:59.650> which<00:03:00.100> would<00:03:00.250> be<00:03:00.340> good

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
a little bit deeper which would be good

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.870 
a little bit deeper which would be good
for<00:03:00.610> pancakes<00:03:01.000> still<00:03:01.650> but<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:02.680> think<00:03:02.890> still<00:03:03.160> be

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
for pancakes still but I think still be

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.550 
for pancakes still but I think still be
good<00:03:03.970> enough<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.240> use<00:03:04.420> for<00:03:04.630> a<00:03:04.660> small<00:03:04.960> sauce<00:03:05.290> pot

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
good enough to use for a small sauce pot

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.820 
good enough to use for a small sauce pot
on<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:05.890> side<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.190> was<00:03:06.460> doing<00:03:06.670> some<00:03:06.790> sauce<00:03:06.970> I

on the side I was doing some sauce I

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.690

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.480 
because when you poach an egg a little
bit<00:05:24.020> of<00:05:24.110> water<00:05:24.259> gets<00:05:24.410> underneath<00:05:24.740> of<00:05:24.949> it<00:05:25.009> it

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
bit of water gets underneath of it it

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.469 
bit of water gets underneath of it it
helps<00:05:25.789> it<00:05:25.849> separate<00:05:26.270> off<00:05:26.419> the<00:05:26.630> panel<00:05:27.199> better

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
helps it separate off the panel better

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:34.600 
helps it separate off the panel better
so<00:05:32.440> just<00:05:33.440> a<00:05:33.470> little<00:05:33.530> more<00:05:33.680> done<00:05:33.889> than<00:05:33.919> that<00:05:34.190> top

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
so just a little more done than that top

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.820 
so just a little more done than that top
feet<00:05:35.229> nice<00:05:36.229> and<00:05:36.289> done

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
feet nice and done

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.550 
feet nice and done
I<00:05:37.569> don't<00:05:38.569> want<00:05:38.690> me<00:05:38.810> hopes<00:05:39.020> to<00:05:39.139> be<00:05:39.229> done<00:05:39.380> but<00:05:39.500> I

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
I don't want me hopes to be done but I

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.689 
I don't want me hopes to be done but I
do<00:05:39.680> like<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:39.949> whites<00:05:40.160> tall<00:05:41.650> so<00:05:42.650> it's<00:05:43.460> a<00:05:43.520> few

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
do like the whites tall so it's a few

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.460 
do like the whites tall so it's a few
minutes<00:05:43.910> seconds<00:05:44.180> here<00:05:44.330> goes<00:05:45.080> pretty<00:05:45.229> quick

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
minutes seconds here goes pretty quick

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.860 
minutes seconds here goes pretty quick
with<00:05:45.710> only<00:05:46.009> a<00:05:46.099> half<00:05:46.220> a<00:05:46.310> cup<00:05:46.460> of<00:05:46.490> water<00:05:46.780> bring<00:05:47.780> it

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
with only a half a cup of water bring it

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.529 
with only a half a cup of water bring it
to<00:05:47.990> a<00:05:48.020> boil<00:05:48.229> quick<00:05:48.669> and<00:05:49.669> actually<00:05:50.150> I'm<00:05:50.270> going

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
to a boil quick and actually I'm going

00:05:50.539 --> 00:06:05.590 
to a boil quick and actually I'm going
to<00:05:50.660> lessen<00:05:50.870> 1/2<00:05:51.229> cup<00:05:51.440> of<00:05:51.590> water

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.960 

seems<00:06:06.500> wrong<00:06:06.770> you<00:06:07.100> see<00:06:07.280> on<00:06:07.370> camera<00:06:07.580> the<00:06:07.760> scenes

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
seems wrong you see on camera the scenes

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:18.040 
seems wrong you see on camera the scenes
rolling<00:06:08.180> out<00:06:14.620> looks<00:06:15.620> perfect<00:06:16.040> so<00:06:16.280> now<00:06:17.050> the

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
rolling out looks perfect so now the

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.390 
rolling out looks perfect so now the
tricky<00:06:18.350> part<00:06:18.530> is<00:06:20.050> at<00:06:21.050> the<00:06:21.200> time<00:06:21.380> as<00:06:22.100> I<00:06:22.220> how<00:06:22.370> I

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
tricky part is at the time as I how I

tricky part is at the time as I how I
used<00:06:22.640> earlier<00:06:22.840> and<00:06:23.840> inside<00:06:24.170> out<00:06:24.290> I<00:06:25.180> need<00:06:26.180> a
