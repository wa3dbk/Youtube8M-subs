00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the Arkham burst probably coming around

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.209 
the Arkham burst probably coming around
the<00:00:36.270> release<00:00:36.540> date<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.840> batman<00:00:37.770> arkham<00:00:37.920> knight

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
so there is no release say too when this

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.360 
so there is no release say too when this
movie<00:00:40.350> will<00:00:40.500> come<00:00:40.649> out<00:00:40.770> but<00:00:40.920> I'm<00:00:41.040> guessing

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
movie will come out but I'm guessing

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
release date of Arkham Knight hopefully

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.799 
release date of Arkham Knight hopefully
before<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.250> get<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.579> a

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
before just so we can get like a

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.389 
before just so we can get like a
continuation<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> story<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.620> time

right<00:01:57.060> off<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.360> bat<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.780> think<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.110> should<00:01:58.290> add

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
right off the bat I think you should add

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.679 
right off the bat I think you should add
the<00:01:58.680> villains<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.219> there<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.329> also<00:02:00.540> think

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the villains in there and I also think

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.600 
the villains in there and I also think
you<00:02:00.840> should<00:02:00.930> add<00:02:01.049> skins<00:02:01.530> I'm<00:02:01.829> guessing<00:02:02.369> it's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
you should add skins I'm guessing it's

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.789 
you should add skins I'm guessing it's
going<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.909> be<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> same<00:02:03.420> type<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.079> skin<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:04.590> see

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
going to be the same type of skin we see

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.800 
going to be the same type of skin we see
in<00:02:04.890> Arkham<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.759> sold<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.090> Arkham<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:06.600> if

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
in Arkham like I sold in Arkham but if

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.359 
in Arkham like I sold in Arkham but if
there<00:02:07.200> are<00:02:07.350> kind<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:07.829> different<00:02:08.220> types

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
there are kind of like different types

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.130 
there are kind of like different types
of<00:02:08.489> skins<00:02:08.819> but<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.209> obviously<00:02:09.780> get<00:02:09.959> an

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
of skins but you to obviously get an

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.540 
of skins but you to obviously get an
assault<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.560> Arkham<00:02:10.770> skins<00:02:11.280> pack

assault on Arkham skins pack

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.550 
assault on Arkham skins pack
back<00:02:11.640> before<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.510> know<00:02:12.540> Harley<00:02:13.080> Quinn<00:02:13.320> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
back before you know Harley Quinn the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.860 
back before you know Harley Quinn the
penguin<00:02:14.040> if<00:02:14.310> Bane<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.420> video<00:02:15.630> game

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
penguin if Bane is in this video game

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.690 
penguin if Bane is in this video game
which<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.110> probably<00:02:16.410> will<00:02:16.800> then<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:17.550> get<00:02:17.670> to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.430 
which you probably will then we get to

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.840

Deathstroke<00:03:02.220> but<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.610> think<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.210> sold<00:03:03.660> on<00:03:03.750> Arkham

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
Deathstroke but I think a sold on Arkham

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.170 
Deathstroke but I think a sold on Arkham
DLC<00:03:04.470> pack<00:03:04.680> would<00:03:04.860> sell<00:03:05.130> pretty<00:03:05.400> good<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.850> I

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
DLC pack would sell pretty good and I

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.310

definitely buy it so let me just list

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.510

the<00:03:09.300> possible<00:03:09.870> abilities<00:03:10.140> they<00:03:10.890> could<00:03:11.100> do<00:03:11.280> for

the possible abilities they could do for

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.210 
the possible abilities they could do for
you<00:03:12.060> know<00:03:12.180> having<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.600> solo<00:03:12.840> Arkham<00:03:13.170> DLC<00:03:13.620> one

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
you have a whole pack where you get a

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.920 
you have a whole pack where you get a
say<00:03:16.800> a<00:03:16.830> Harley<00:03:17.280> Quinn<00:03:17.489> skin<00:03:17.850> Batman<00:03:18.600> skiing

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
say a Harley Quinn skin Batman skiing

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.560 
say a Harley Quinn skin Batman skiing
Catwoman<00:03:19.650> skin<00:03:19.890> like<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.160> simple<00:03:20.970> skins<00:03:21.300> pack

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
Catwoman skin like a simple skins pack

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.479 
Catwoman skin like a simple skins pack
which<00:03:21.870> are<00:03:22.080> wouldn't<00:03:22.650> be<00:03:22.709> surprised<00:03:23.010> they<00:03:23.250> did

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
which are wouldn't be surprised they did

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.030 
which are wouldn't be surprised they did
and<00:03:23.730> that's<00:03:24.420> only<00:03:24.600> guessing<00:03:25.080> if<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.410> skins<00:03:25.739> or

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
and that's only guessing if the skins or

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.650 
and that's only guessing if the skins or
the<00:03:26.340> character<00:03:26.730> skins<00:03:26.880> will<00:03:27.090> be<00:03:27.209> different<00:03:27.420> in

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
the character skins will be different in

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.090 
the character skins will be different in
the<00:03:27.750> movie<00:03:28.020> which<00:03:28.410> they<00:03:28.620> probably<00:03:28.860> won't

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
the movie which they probably won't

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.440 
the movie which they probably won't
because<00:03:29.310> it's<00:03:29.459> in<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.670> universe<00:03:30.090> but<00:03:30.330> they

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
because it's in the universe but they

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.790 
because it's in the universe but they
could<00:03:30.660> have<00:03:30.780> like<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:30.959> different<00:03:31.290> look<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.530> them

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
could have like a different look to them

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.290 
could have like a different look to them
you<00:03:32.310> know<00:03:32.430> we<00:03:32.550> got<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.790> batman<00:03:33.120> animated

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
you know we got the batman animated

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.870 
you know we got the batman animated
series<00:03:33.930> skin<00:03:34.860> so<00:03:35.280> maybe<00:03:35.430> we'll<00:03:35.580> get<00:03:35.670> something

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
series skin so maybe we'll get something

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.550 
series skin so maybe we'll get something
that<00:03:36.060> like<00:03:36.239> that<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:36.989> look<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:37.320> looks

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
that like that so look it looks

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.600 
that like that so look it looks
different<00:03:37.709> but<00:03:37.980> it's<00:03:38.130> still<00:03:38.220> kind<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.489> like

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
different but it's still kind of like
