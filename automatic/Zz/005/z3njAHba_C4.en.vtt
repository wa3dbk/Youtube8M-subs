 I had a lot of pancake parcels already 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.800

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.930

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.420

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.400
 the seller is generally well done fast 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:11.060
 went to the operational here look 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.370
 beats tour such shorter headphones 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.909
 Now we will open them to check how they are 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.909
 they will work 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.730
 how much will they work for us 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:27.130
 well because we still can not know so 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:32.330
 this all opens up such a package 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:36.050
 big sound so everything is in english 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.540
 written so we have boxes 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.310
 box so tacky that the assembly 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:47.270
 it is not so hot 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:49.490
 Look then he is here crumpled here 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.870
 so it means it opens with us 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:57.860
 what is here that opens here 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:02.860
 This is what here opens. 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:06.250
 headphones here are these headphones 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.390
 here it means that we put the seller 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:16.220
 here the seller put us brochures glasses 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:18.870
 some kind of sticker incomprehensible sticker 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.430
 so here something is written all on 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:27.180
 English and Chinese so in this 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:31.410
 Brochure we have English English so 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.920
 But it is to see that there are some more 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.440
 options are headphones and all products 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.520
 from doctor dre 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.800
 so smell already smells of Chinese 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:48.150
 it smells like a whale that 's somehow 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:58.950
 lightly done so this is some kind 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:03:02.489
 incomprehensible case headphones themselves so 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:08.250
 transparent headphones for some reason it seems like 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:10.459
 must be metal so case 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.530
 under headphones 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:20.910
 case we see spare 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:25.470
 rubber seals so here that 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:28.380
 see here we see some things for 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:33.120
 mounts on the ear that lily feels is not 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:37.829
 I can understand more and more nothing in the box 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:41.120
 there is no box no more so 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.120
 unwinding the headphones 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.980
 These are the headphones 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.099
 so they have there 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:09.930
 so we look assembly all dangles rattles 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:12.989
 does not cause trust so well we will check 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:19.639
 Now let's hear how they will sound 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.639
 us so their ears 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:30.780
 No, this is something I think is not what 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:45.770
 I expected from them so where are we here 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:45.770
 open music to play music 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.520
 reproduces 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:33.470
 so sound sound I do not know so we have 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:39.140
 there is a microphone 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.140
 I think they even ring a little somehow 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.850
 In short, what's wrong and not the headphones, in my opinion 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:52.380
 this 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:54.390
 worth so much and were not know here is 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.720
 The video turned out for us in my opinion 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:00.000
 waste of money on this music 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.420
 link to the seller I will give a look all 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.420
 bye Bye
