00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hey people here because she says times with 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.109
 a short intro video to diablo 3 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.870
 I got one last night 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.799
 My buddy has information per us 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.490
 redbook posts that blizzard that 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.880
 complete auction house so both the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.830
 real money auction house and the gold 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.220
 Remove auction to house from the game 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.170
 would like to reason with that yes 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.570
 that's more in the game 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.809
 when monster is about to knock and 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.690
 cool things to find instead 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.530
 instead of always in the auction house around 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.219
 collect and look for items 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.930
 yes my opinion or the comments 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.610
 I do not quite understand that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.629
 many people are happy a few 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.149
 people so many people are happy 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.760
 stop that the auction house come out 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.940
 the real money auction house comes out and 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:06.299
 are the opinion that thus the itself 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:10.290
 whole game changed so believe in themselves 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.619
 I just because not because only because 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.909
 diablo 3 then the real money or 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.640
 regardless of whether it is real money or gold 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.790
 because there is no auction house there anymore 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.360
 that does not matter that does not matter 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.820
 difference 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.240
 only now we have that again 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.280
 effect that people stop then 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.070
 external platforms act that we 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.060
 will then be up again without end items 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.540
 ebay we will find 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.270
 or people use such pages 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.170
 like luther or my side i 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.829
 have made 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.899
 ludweiler point net to your items to 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.360
 trade for me it is or for such 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.850
 Of course, this is natural, of course 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.149
 positive that then blizzard the real money 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.259
 or the gold auction house out again 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.520
 skin because of course because of such 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.289
 benefit from it 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.030
 Of course, it gets paid because 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.689
 People still want their items 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.840
 train 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:10.030
 So that's not really for me 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.650
 I guess so personally I think that 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.510
 that absolutely nothing brings this 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.680
 gold auction house real money auction house 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.360
 close 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.269
 I think that's it too 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.360
 another, the people must again 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.470
 unsafe or 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.000
 especially when it comes to real money opponents 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.730
 if people then on ebay their items 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.959
 buy or sell and then stop 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.510
 maybe even decided 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.069
 that was actually my opinion 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.680
 after over the blizzard auction house 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:40.299
 Reliably solved now well so 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.359
 I do not think it's a big upgrade 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.890
 is not a big change and yes me 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.890
 I would be interested in what your 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.230
 opinion is am not so listen now 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.250
 now is not like the others when all 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.079
 I look at the comments below 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.299
 read through then keep relative therefore 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:59.049
 many of these many people these 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.739
 decision I can not understand 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.620
 current 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.600
 well, ok, yes, I wanted you again 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.410
 Let's get rid of you shortly this evening 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.120
 tell 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.739
 come now even actively rare to 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.239
 to make video I have to look like 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.150
 I can do it because I'm up to date 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.760
 So a lot of work does not have to work 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.620
 on the pc but work properly 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.010
 it is also right work here 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.239
 yes not so stored here we see 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.100
 us on a live streamings i know 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.560
 now it's time to get hatun 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.560
 continue to gamble until then your macedo
