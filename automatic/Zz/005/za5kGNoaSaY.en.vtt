 hey craters as they are waiting now 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.140
 We are having a great time and good guys 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.390
 this time they see you contracting a 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.400
 new script mode for minecraft and 0.11 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.800
 point xy good guys this time you 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.440
 I have been bringing the elemental mod 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.150
 creepers omo creepers mod and good guys 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.640
 before you comment on the video saying 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.800
 eye me lewis from other youtubers me what 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.390
 they recorded dislike if you guys already know that 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.579
 several youtubers already recorded this mode 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.010
 but essentially they brought you what 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.110
 that would be 5 clippers and then I'll come 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.910
 bringing what would be more than 5 clippers 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.260
 that's how we can see here in the 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.940
 inventory I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.760
 different creepers guys from different 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.730
 types of materials and different 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.430
 types of strength type can be said 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.129
 well and well here we can see that we have 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.570
 the different types now this is easy 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.579
 of taking out guys is easy to take the 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.200
 clippers we do not have to put in the cne 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.730
 and what would be the its and all that type 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.439
 of things at the end of the video I'm going to 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.330
 leave what would be the command so that 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.830
 you can get all the clippers and good 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.580
 let's start here we have what 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.830
 it would be him 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.750
 electric or the equipment commissioned that 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.420
 we can see that it has a green texture 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.370
 with blue and then nothing has only one 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.410
 exploitation a little bigger than what 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.090
 that will be the normal clipper here we have 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.830
 what would be the fire clipper this 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.900
 When you walk, you leave what you 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.880
 It would be traces of fire and good when 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.000
 it explodes because I do not think it leaves fire like that 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.160
 that we're going to be apparently follows 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.770
 good when they explode in front of you 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.970
 If you crisis add fire, although we have 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.250
 what stretches that by water the 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.890
 Water clipper has a blue texture and 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.700
 as its because it is guardians for good 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.890
 explosion 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.659
 as his is like a man because he has 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.880
 the rusty blue texture so well 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.280
 nothing we go with what would be the clipper 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.899
 troll the cri but what would it be then 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.039
 well this I think that basically you 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.320
 I will point to the end because it is very 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.899
 troll and I really do not like that 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.579
 ruin the video so in the end what 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.250
 there is here we have what would be the 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.380
 armor creever this clip is 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.549
 quite difficult to command since as 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.229
 we can see is a cri but with the 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.420
 diamond armor but when I 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.129
 we kill gives us what would be the armor 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.349
 of diamond and has a bang 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:18.950
 pretty big or we will continue for 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:21.110
 here ok let's go why why and why 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.510
 good guys before continuing we're going to 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.829
 see if this video reaches 500 likes me 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.420
 I know we can get guys since the 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.880
 latest videos are reaching more than 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.590
 500 likes or up to 500 likes and the truth 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.390
 that all that support is very much appreciated 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.130
 guys besides you can also 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.349
 Share the video with your friends in your 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.420
 social networks and then nothing we continue 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.950
 because we have the golf team with the 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.660
 tripod combustion what it does is that 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.760
 when he walks he will leave woodson to his 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.480
 surroundings is like this when walking leaves it 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.370
 like a boston mouse and when it explodes 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.019
 It leaves you lake bag so we're going to 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.120
 take them out again with the next 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.980
 command boys point is not diagonal 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.709
 clippers and we put here is for nerds 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.719
 gay let's give it here and how can we 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.459
 see says there creepers debris we're going to 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.620
 give it here and it says you have all the 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.629
 clippers spoilers ok we are going to 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.879
 put here with what we keep going 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:16.290
 with the sixth point he was for 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.299
 here we have what would be the clipper of 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.980
 gravel is a common and common crime only 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.780
 that has the texture of the gravel is what 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.760
 only one that changes you and does not have any 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.010
 functionality over here we have the clip 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.780
 for dad or potatoes we have the 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.849
 tripod those of what would be dad or 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.040
 possessed and good have the texture of what 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.139
 that stretches a potato around here we have 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.819
 the extreme clipper this creepers what 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.349
 happens is that it is very fast that's why 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.599
 use ends and be careful 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.129
 when they approach him around here we have 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.599
 what would the lava clipper be 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.079
 lava clipper has what would be a 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.480
 texture like that of lava type fried 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.700
 ok and good guys be careful what 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.409
 that follows their worlds since the clippers 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.870
 appear in what would be the different 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:56.239
 types of worlds that you 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.150
 so let's continue here this is 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.950
 lava and we have the penultimate clip because 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.959
 is that of terrassa this kripper has the 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.090
 texture of like grass type and not 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.040
 has no functionality so 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.590
 we go with the last one that will be the troll 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.480
 the troll what he has is that when the 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.299
 we exploit mandala to what would be the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.980
 sky like the 1 of the now good I do not 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.229
 He sent heaven but that's basically 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.120
 what would be the mod and then nothing link 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.880
 of download in the description without any 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.470
 type of play or something like that and then nothing but 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.990
