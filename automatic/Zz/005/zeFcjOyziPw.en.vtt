something which is a little bit taboo
still<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.370> don't<00:00:14.429> think<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:15.000> should<00:00:15.150> be

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
still and I don't think it should be

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.349 
still and I don't think it should be
taboo<00:00:16.170> but<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.830> kind<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.279> ears<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.850> this<00:00:18.240> is

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
feeling and to also a bit of a story

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.919 
feeling and to also a bit of a story
that's<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:29.400> happen<00:00:29.789> fairly<00:00:30.119> recently<00:00:30.630> for

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
that's just happen fairly recently for

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.810 
that's just happen fairly recently for
me<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.349> figured<00:00:31.740> well<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> pretty

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
me and I figured well this is a pretty

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.790 
me and I figured well this is a pretty
good<00:00:32.969> basis<00:00:33.300> for<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.540> video<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.770> can

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
good basis for a video so we can

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.260 
good basis for a video so we can
actually<00:00:35.010> start<00:00:35.370> talking<00:00:35.820> about<00:00:35.910> this

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
actually start talking about this

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.360 
actually start talking about this
instead<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.719> pretending<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.620> doesn't<00:00:38.010> exist

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
instead of pretending it doesn't exist

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.069 
instead of pretending it doesn't exist
so<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.149> thing<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.570> would<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.960> talk

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
so the thing that I would like to talk

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.500 
so the thing that I would like to talk
about<00:00:40.260> today<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.980> depression<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.180> more

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
about today is depression and more

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.200 
about today is depression and more
specifically<00:00:43.079> really<00:00:43.590> acne<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.579> depression

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
specifically really acne and depression

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.340 
specifically really acne and depression
because<00:00:46.520> getting<00:00:47.660> depression<00:00:48.660> when<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.140> have

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
because getting depression when you have

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.170 
because getting depression when you have
really<00:00:49.800> really<00:00:49.829> bad<00:00:50.129> skin<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> think<00:00:50.820> is

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
really really bad skin I think is

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.790 
really really bad skin I think is
something<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.750> fairly<00:00:51.989> common<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.739> think

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
something that is fairly common I think

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.049 
something that is fairly common I think
part<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> reason<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.730> people<00:00:53.789> don't

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
part of the reason that people don't

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.299 
part of the reason that people don't
talk<00:00:54.420> about<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.079> because<00:00:55.110> acne<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.070> so

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
talk about it is because acne is so

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.520 
talk about it is because acne is so
physical<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.960> don't<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.260> talk<00:00:58.469> about

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
physical but we don't really talk about

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.000 
physical but we don't really talk about
the<00:00:59.370> other<00:00:59.789> levels<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.570> acne<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.140> terms<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.710> how

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the other levels of acne in terms of how

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.119 
the other levels of acne in terms of how
it<00:01:02.160> affects<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.699> mentally<00:01:03.270> or<00:01:03.960> emotionally

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
it affects you mentally or emotionally

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.590

I feel like I'm not normal just want to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.139 
I feel like I'm not normal just want to
put<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.170> out<00:02:01.290> there<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.799> getting<00:02:02.549> acne<00:02:02.969> is

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
put it out there that getting acne is

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.690 
put it out there that getting acne is
very<00:02:03.810> normal

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
very normal

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.109 
very normal
so<00:02:05.330> common<00:02:05.900> on<00:02:06.110> a<00:02:06.170> personal<00:02:06.799> level<00:02:06.830> I<00:02:07.369> think

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
so common on a personal level I think

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.729 
so common on a personal level I think
this<00:02:08.300> has<00:02:08.539> definitely<00:02:08.959> affected<00:02:09.020> me<00:02:09.470> at

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
this has definitely affected me at

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.460 
this has definitely affected me at
different<00:02:10.580> stages<00:02:10.970> in<00:02:11.000> my<00:02:11.180> life<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:11.660> far<00:02:11.870> yes

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
different stages in my life so far yes

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.740 
different stages in my life so far yes
so<00:02:12.830> far<00:02:13.099> I'm<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.459> bit<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.819> realist<00:02:14.239> I<00:02:14.420> don't

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
so far I'm a bit of a realist I don't

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.699 
so far I'm a bit of a realist I don't
think<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.380> something<00:02:15.620> that's

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
think that this is something that's

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.100 
think that this is something that's
going<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.099> go<00:02:16.220> away<00:02:16.340> overnight<00:02:16.630> also<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:17.930> just

going to go away overnight also I just
want<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.530> make<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.680> distinction<00:02:19.130> that<00:02:19.550> what<00:02:20.450> I'm

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
want to make a distinction that what I'm

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.610 
want to make a distinction that what I'm
talking<00:02:20.900> about<00:02:20.989> right<00:02:21.200> now

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
talking about right now

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.820 
talking about right now
it<00:02:21.920> can<00:02:22.220> cause<00:02:22.880> chronic<00:02:23.480> depression<00:02:23.840> acne<00:02:24.560> can

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
it can cause chronic depression acne can

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.199 
it can cause chronic depression acne can
cause<00:02:25.459> that<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:26.180> occur<00:02:27.100> within<00:02:28.100> a<00:02:28.310> person<00:02:28.940> and

cause that to occur within a person and

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.490 
cause that to occur within a person and

if you are feeling chronic depression I

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.930 
if you are feeling chronic depression I
would<00:02:33.500> suggest<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.069> try<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.370> get<00:02:34.640> help

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
but I know that I'm not the right person

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.330 
but I know that I'm not the right person

to be telling anybody that and it's not

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.800 
to be telling anybody that and it's not
something<00:02:40.550> that<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.819> can<00:02:40.970> switch<00:02:41.180> on<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.660> off

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
something that you can switch on and off

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.690 
something that you can switch on and off
what<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.290> have<00:02:42.709> is<00:02:43.010> not<00:02:43.220> chronic<00:02:43.549> depression
