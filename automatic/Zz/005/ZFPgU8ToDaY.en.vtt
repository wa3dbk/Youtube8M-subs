door closed works when I hit it what's

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.100 
door closed works when I hit it what's
weird<00:03:58.620> is<00:03:58.800> both<00:03:59.040> elevators<00:03:59.820> are<00:04:00.150> exactly<00:04:00.870> the

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
weird is both elevators are exactly the

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.370 
weird is both elevators are exactly the
same

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
same

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.670 
same
they're<00:04:02.040> usually<00:04:02.280> mirror<00:04:03.000> opposite<00:04:03.810> when

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
they're usually mirror opposite when

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:27.140 
they're usually mirror opposite when
they're<00:04:04.890> side-by-side<00:04:06.200> but<00:04:07.200> these<00:04:07.440> aren't

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.469 

and<00:04:27.300> there<00:04:27.930> it<00:04:28.020> goes<00:04:29.240> those<00:04:30.240> are<00:04:30.389> the

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
and there it goes those are the
