00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.800
 hey i hope you are alright i am 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.200
 I would like to thank you a little bit about mine 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.940
 experience with the almond oil tell what 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.650
 I bought myself a few weeks ago 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.869
 is also the mitbekommen believes 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.160
 Mr. Holm saw because I have linked 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.039
 you then you can still the talk 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.109
 Just click in and see my have 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.460
 bought too recently and I say 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.430
 you only times why I times me 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.600
 ever bought as had showed 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.730
 The first reason was that my serum was what I was 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.040
 for some, they are and they are used 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.670
 have so donate moisture and 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.380
 Moisture no longer includes the moisture 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.950
 I included moisture 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:50.399
 I had inflicted my art 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.190
 that seems to be sensation counting 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.989
 from as the fans yes I have 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.809
 actually used for the moisture 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.230
 I lock in my hair 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.690
 have given 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.030
 and after I trade my second 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.350
 have opened times I hold that 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.819
 she gave it after I stop my 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.689
 Hanover has donated moisture as 

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:12.920
 but he always says the moisture 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.990
 not a donated one donated 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.729
 included as it is 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.469
 has done before or really should 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.849
 after that were still on the 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.579
 dry side and something I have to 

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:24.810
 then just sometimes a little board 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.119
 dressed that just does not have anymore 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.130
 worked adjusts now 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.929
 for a while it may be that products 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.810
 who previously thought good for easy 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:36.599
 then sometime not work anymore 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.729
 comfort the second reason is the following 

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:42.810
 I was on 10 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.310
 actually mixed with olive oil and me 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.529
 can not and no longer wants to have so 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.880
 I just can not smell it anymore 

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:50.579
 i just do not like the smell and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.380
 then when I have the mix in mine 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.799
 head skin and stop happened 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.239
 I found the smell so unpleasant 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.329
 and I do not know if that's enough 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:01.859
 theirs occurred but when others one 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.479
 they may even be closer 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.740
 even if that 's opposite 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.140
 unpleasant as a whole 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.069
 Taste it whether you like it or not 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.430
 but as such I like to eat it with me 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.720
 others were cooked but i could 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.410
 just do not even take revenge on me 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.300
 something else because otherwise what the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.640
 The scalp will no longer be with the oil then 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.420
 My suitcases dry and we want to stop 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.330
 not anymore 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.680
 and that's why I got that too 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:37.080
 has to overtake then with mine until 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:39.569
 Half of the half of the oil and oil 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.940
 yes what is found is quite good now 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.530
 My suitcase is well accepted that way 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.690
 I researched a bit and 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.760
 found the almond oil and good for that 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.640
 Hair growth should be because it is 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.100
 both promotes and accelerates and 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.959
 is to prevent the end and the h 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.590
 the fatty acids are bringing new sheen 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.110
 help 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.430
 if that is now my hair to faster 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.980
 growth I can not judge 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.510
 because all the time I smoothed with it 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.459
 I am also told to follow the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.390
 to do the next part but that has 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.030
 yes then see if i have my next one 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.910
 relax whether the oil is now too 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.769
 has a new gloss helped in any case 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.900
 my hair has such a nice shine 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.579
 get through and not now 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.640
 only if you just smell it fresh 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.590
 also really days after I used 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.540
 that it now every time so one for 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.519
 a goal in and I do that 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.410
 in the meantime every few days 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.450
 second day at the time makes it easy 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.940
 really so partially moisture 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.069
 donate and the moisture is so good 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.150
 1 he does not close every day that 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.670
 you have to make my hair 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.160
 legal second day and which 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:48.540
 advantages what often happens then 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.950
 but you still have this great 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.670
 beautiful, of course, such a beautiful course 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.340
 something totally fake by this fake 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.950
 eg by hartz iv gets 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.200
 you shine so you get on it 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.629
 every case really very nice 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.280
 I'm really happy though 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.080
 One more thing is that you only the 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.349
 makes hair really supple 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.769
 so i can get my hair meanwhile 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.849
 a maximum of twice a week so 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.080
 once in a while when i look at the 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.419
 then wash your hair in between 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.370
 someday, depending on what I'm wearing 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.660
 and that was what he really was 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.880
 only with my fingers through the 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.250
 Hair is not really super light 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.720
 by what is not easy with me 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.700
 has been really thick especially if 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.880
 my hair really regrown like that 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.460
 thick approach but have the wrong 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.400
 Just to make it really enjoyable years 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.410
 be characterized as the hand 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.680
 suppleness because that's what it is 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.330
 the sportiness so donated and 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.789
 because it is so easy 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.910
 It does not need that fast 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:53.000
 the hair absorbs the oil really well and 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.979
 this does not create an oil layer around the 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.139
 So hair was very close to the hair 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.610
 understandably I do not hope so much 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.840
 very happy with that you stay that way 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.600
 definitely a solid component 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.090
 my routine and very important is still 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.410
 that you do not pick sweet almond oil 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:14.389
 that's not mad that's the opposite 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.710
 from sweet bitter or deep the bitter 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.720
 almonds are the sweet almonds over 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.210
 The bitter almond is an ethereal one 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.320
 oil needs the sweetness of your hair 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.270
 I am in any case complacent 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.849
 with the oil that stays in any case 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.440
 fits exist have a kind of tina and 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.960
 what would she still use so many 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.760
 her also the almond oil if so how to 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.370
 This can actually be done in condition 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.090
 but I have not yet 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.740
 tried out otherwise what you use so 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.010
 happy actually wanted for 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.520
 But cheers try everything to his 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.950
 Time 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.000
 I hope the helpful could do something 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.590
 take it with you 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.349
 I wish you a nice day 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:55.510
 or a nice evening good night and 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:55.510
 See you in my next video
