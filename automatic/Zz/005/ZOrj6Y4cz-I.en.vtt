picture<00:01:18.340> of<00:01:18.370> them<00:01:18.610> sitting<00:01:19.000> 50<00:01:19.390> feet<00:01:19.600> away

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
picture of them sitting 50 feet away

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.420 
picture of them sitting 50 feet away
you're<00:01:20.260> going<00:01:20.380> to<00:01:20.440> show<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:20.800> to<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.010> cops<00:01:21.160> a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
you're going to show that to the cops a

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.220 
you're going to show that to the cops a
game<00:01:21.580> or<00:01:21.790> whoever<00:01:22.150> and<00:01:22.360> correct<00:01:22.960> that<00:01:23.080> issue

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
game or whoever and correct that issue

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.750 
game or whoever and correct that issue
also<00:01:23.770> for<00:01:24.100> surveillance<00:01:24.340> if<00:01:24.580> you<00:01:24.640> got

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
also for surveillance if you got

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.830 
also for surveillance if you got
something<00:01:24.880> stupid<00:01:25.240> around<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.480> house<00:01:25.630> it's

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
something stupid around the house it's

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.450 
something stupid around the house it's
another<00:01:25.900> way<00:01:26.260> kind<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:26.830> put<00:01:26.950> that<00:01:27.070> camera<00:01:27.250> out

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
another way kind of put that camera out

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.950 
another way kind of put that camera out
is<00:01:27.580> there<00:01:27.760> as<00:01:27.910> bait<00:01:28.420> they<00:01:28.630> think<00:01:28.840> they<00:01:28.930> got

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
is there as bait they think they got

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.270 
is there as bait they think they got
something<00:01:29.410> but<00:01:29.500> guess<00:01:29.650> what<00:01:29.800> you<00:01:29.980> got<00:01:30.130> there

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
something but guess what you got there

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.010 
something but guess what you got there
pitcher<00:01:30.580> next<00:01:31.210> we're<00:01:31.360> going<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.540> cover<00:01:31.720> why

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
pitcher next we're going to cover why

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.880 
pitcher next we're going to cover why
the<00:01:32.740> teeny<00:01:33.040> w<00:01:33.340> has<00:01:33.580> no<00:01:33.850> trigger<00:01:34.030> time<00:01:34.890> trigger

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
the teeny w has no trigger time trigger

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.160 
the teeny w has no trigger time trigger
time<00:01:36.190> guys<00:01:36.880> I<00:01:37.180> tell<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.510> what<00:01:37.540> this<00:01:37.810> is<00:01:37.960> one<00:01:38.080> of

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
time guys I tell you what this is one of

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.570 
time guys I tell you what this is one of
the<00:01:38.230> most<00:01:38.320> important<00:01:38.800> factors<00:01:39.160> before<00:01:39.340> you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
the most important factors before you

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.550 
the most important factors before you
run<00:01:39.760> out<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:40.030> buy<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.150> trail<00:01:40.450> camera<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:41.290> spy

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
run out and buy a trail camera the spy

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.430 
run out and buy a trail camera the spy
point<00:01:41.830> teeny<00:01:42.070> w<00:01:42.540> eliminated<00:01:43.540> trigger<00:01:43.930> speed<00:01:44.260> I

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
point teeny w eliminated trigger speed I

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.520 
point teeny w eliminated trigger speed I
tell<00:01:45.010> you<00:01:45.100> why<00:01:45.310> they<00:01:45.910> put<00:01:46.120> two<00:01:46.420> sensors<00:01:46.930> motion

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
tell you why they put two sensors motion

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.130 
tell you why they put two sensors motion
detector<00:01:47.890> sensors<00:01:48.280> at<00:01:48.430> 70<00:01:49.180> degrees<00:01:49.210> on<00:01:49.780> each

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
detector sensors at 70 degrees on each

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.560 
detector sensors at 70 degrees on each
side<00:01:50.410> of<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:50.650> camera<00:01:50.890> what's<00:01:51.460> that<00:01:51.610> do<00:01:51.820> soon

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
side of the camera what's that do soon

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.990 
side of the camera what's that do soon
as<00:01:52.720> that<00:01:52.840> detectors<00:01:53.620> tripped<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:54.100> allows<00:01:54.850> the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
as that detectors tripped it allows the

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.060 
as that detectors tripped it allows the
camera<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.330> turn<00:01:55.600> one<00:01:55.840> immediately<00:01:56.260> get<00:01:56.920> the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
camera to turn one immediately get the

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.040 
camera to turn one immediately get the
five<00:01:57.280> zone<00:01:57.520> sensor<00:01:57.940> system<00:01:58.240> ready<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:58.690> it

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
five zone sensor system ready and it

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.840 
five zone sensor system ready and it
allows<00:01:59.350> it<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.590> trigger<00:01:59.890> when<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.430> animals

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
allows it to trigger when that animals

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.670 
allows it to trigger when that animals
and<00:02:00.970> center<00:02:01.330> frame<00:02:01.570> exactly<00:02:02.200> what<00:02:02.350> you<00:02:02.470> want

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
and center frame exactly what you want

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.500 
and center frame exactly what you want
you<00:02:03.159> may<00:02:03.310> think<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.760> camera<00:02:04.060> that<00:02:04.180> you<00:02:04.300> have

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
you may think the camera that you have

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.960 
you may think the camera that you have
is<00:02:04.780> working<00:02:05.440> well<00:02:05.650> ask<00:02:05.860> yourself<00:02:06.220> this<00:02:06.400> do<00:02:06.850> you

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
is working well ask yourself this do you

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.820 
is working well ask yourself this do you
have<00:02:07.120> it<00:02:07.270> on<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.420> bait<00:02:07.630> pile<00:02:07.870> do<00:02:08.319> you<00:02:08.409> have<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:08.739> on

have it on a bait pile do you have it on

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.800 
have it on a bait pile do you have it on
a<00:02:08.890> mineral<00:02:09.220> site<00:02:09.429> that's<00:02:10.240> a<00:02:10.360> different<00:02:10.690> animal

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
a mineral site that's a different animal

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.760 
a mineral site that's a different animal
because<00:02:11.200> what<00:02:11.350> you're<00:02:11.440> doing<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:11.710> you're

one of my favorite settings I tell you
what<00:02:31.500> guys<00:02:31.770> you<00:02:32.310> put<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:32.580> camera<00:02:32.970> on<00:02:33.240> time

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
what guys you put that camera on time

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.810 
what guys you put that camera on time
lapse<00:02:33.780> what<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.530> does<00:02:34.710> is<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.010> disables<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
lapse what it does is it disables the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.550 
lapse what it does is it disables the
motion<00:02:36.180> detectors<00:02:36.600> allows<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.230> camera<00:02:37.500> to

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
motion detectors allows that camera to

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.320
