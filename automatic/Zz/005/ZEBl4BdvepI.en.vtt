skylake and realsense now this happens

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.469 
skylake and realsense now this happens
quickly<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:26.520> believe<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> view

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
quickly and I believe this is a view

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.210 
quickly and I believe this is a view
into<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.869> future<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.500> all<00:01:28.530> need<00:01:29.040> to

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
into the future that we all need to

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.670 
into the future that we all need to
think<00:01:29.490> about<00:01:29.750> and<00:01:30.750> what<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> opportunities

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
think about and what the opportunities

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.490 
think about and what the opportunities
are<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.820> see<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.390> system<00:01:33.689> it's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
are you can see in this system it's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.179 
are you can see in this system it's
currently<00:01:34.979> locked<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:36.290> blocked<00:01:37.290> out<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.860> all

currently locked and blocked out and all
I<00:01:38.220> need<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.150> I'm<00:01:39.390> going<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.540> walk<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.990> put

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
I need to do is I'm going to walk up put

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.410 
I need to do is I'm going to walk up put
my<00:01:40.530> face<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.920> front<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.310> within<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.240> a

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
my face in front of it within a just a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.539 
my face in front of it within a just a
few<00:01:42.659> seconds<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.259> will<00:01:43.500> unlock<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.159> I'll<00:01:44.399> be

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
few seconds it will unlock and I'll be

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:53.160 
few seconds it will unlock and I'll be
in<00:01:44.670> computing<00:01:46.759> that's<00:01:47.759> all<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.090> took

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.720 

and<00:01:53.620> it<00:01:53.710> happened<00:01:54.070> so<00:01:54.340> quick<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:56.290> it's<00:01:57.130> it's

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
and it happened so quick that it's it's

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.820 
and it happened so quick that it's it's
not<00:01:57.910> a<00:01:57.970> cumbersome<00:01:58.570> process<00:01:58.600> yet<00:01:59.410> it's<00:01:59.590> my

not a cumbersome process yet it's my

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.250 
not a cumbersome process yet it's my
secure<00:02:00.280> face<00:02:00.580> if<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.660> walk<00:02:01.870> up<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:02.110> that

system and try and do that same thing
right<00:02:04.660> now

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
right now

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.750 
right now
it<00:02:06.160> will<00:02:06.280> never<00:02:06.370> happen<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.979> with<00:02:09.190> real<00:02:09.430> sense

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
it will never happen and with real sense

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.310 
it will never happen and with real sense
you<00:02:09.940> could<00:02:10.090> walk<00:02:10.210> up<00:02:10.420> with<00:02:10.540> a<00:02:10.600> picture<00:02:11.020> of<00:02:11.050> me

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
you could walk up with a picture of me

you could walk up with a picture of me
and<00:02:11.760> try<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:12.880> do<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.360> it'll<00:02:13.810> never

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
and try and do that and it'll never

and try and do that and it'll never
happen<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.570> where<00:02:16.750> we<00:02:16.870> believe

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
happen this is where we believe

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.260 
happen this is where we believe
competing<00:02:17.770> is<00:02:17.890> headed<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.180> the

competing is headed this is the

opportunity<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:22.930> believe<00:02:22.960> we<00:02:23.440> can<00:02:23.590> use

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
opportunity I believe we can use

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.560 
opportunity I believe we can use
together<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.520> innovate<00:02:24.910> on<00:02:24.940> as<00:02:25.360> we<00:02:25.780> go<00:02:25.930> forward

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
together to innovate on as we go forward

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.570 
together to innovate on as we go forward
there's<00:02:28.570> a<00:02:28.660> lot<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:28.990> other<00:02:29.140> uses<00:02:29.740> for<00:02:30.220> real

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
there's a lot of other uses for real

together<00:03:55.120> with<00:03:55.450> JD<00:03:55.660> comm<00:03:56.049> so<00:03:56.440> Brian<00:03:56.680> like<00:03:56.860> you

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
together with JD comm so Brian like you

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.789 
together with JD comm so Brian like you
said<00:03:57.160> JD<00:03:57.430> comm<00:03:57.940> is<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.209> huge<00:03:58.780> company<00:03:59.230> they<00:03:59.560> ship

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
said JD comm is a huge company they ship

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.270 
said JD comm is a huge company they ship
three<00:04:00.340> million<00:04:00.940> boxes<00:04:01.450> every<00:04:02.170> day<00:04:02.319> and<00:04:02.590> they

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
three million boxes every day and they

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.400 
three million boxes every day and they
currently<00:04:03.580> think<00:04:04.480> it<00:04:04.600> takes<00:04:04.780> about<00:04:04.930> three

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
currently think it takes about three

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.790 
currently think it takes about three
minutes

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
minutes

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.250 
minutes
to<00:04:06.340> measure<00:04:06.550> a<00:04:06.640> box<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.210> put<00:04:07.660> that<00:04:07.780> into<00:04:08.050> the

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
to measure a box and put that into the

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.660 
to measure a box and put that into the
system<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.950> if<00:04:09.100> you're<00:04:09.220> doing<00:04:09.340> that<00:04:09.550> many

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
system and if you're doing that many

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.670 
system and if you're doing that many
boxes<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.150> day<00:04:10.300> that's<00:04:10.840> thousands<00:04:11.590> of

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
boxes a day that's thousands of

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.830 
boxes a day that's thousands of
man-hours<00:04:12.090> every<00:04:13.090> single<00:04:13.480> day

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
man-hours every single day

man-hours every single day
well<00:04:14.200> with<00:04:14.740> realsense<00:04:15.130> we<00:04:15.490> can<00:04:15.640> really

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
well with realsense we can really

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.850 
well with realsense we can really
shorten<00:04:16.060> that<00:04:16.239> time<00:04:16.450> from<00:04:16.720> three<00:04:16.959> minutes<00:04:17.350> to

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:17.860 
shorten that time from three minutes to

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.979 
shorten that time from three minutes to
about<00:04:18.040> five<00:04:18.250> seconds<00:04:18.700> so<00:04:18.760> here<00:04:19.600> I'm<00:04:19.840> gonna

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
about five seconds so here I'm gonna

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.090 
about five seconds so here I'm gonna
show<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.110> if<00:04:20.170> we<00:04:20.230> can<00:04:20.350> measure<00:04:20.440> some<00:04:20.709> boxes

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
show you if we can measure some boxes

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
couple of those you can see we've

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.860 
couple of those you can see we've
captured<00:04:35.470> all<00:04:35.950> this<00:04:36.910> all<00:04:37.120> this<00:04:37.300> information

here measured them already in less than
a<00:04:40.750> minute<00:04:41.170> but<00:04:42.160> it<00:04:42.280> goes<00:04:42.400> beyond<00:04:42.700> that<00:04:42.850> we<00:04:43.000> can

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
a minute but it goes beyond that we can

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.840 
a minute but it goes beyond that we can
also<00:04:43.300> take<00:04:43.630> all<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:44.020> information<00:04:44.590> and

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
also take all the information and

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.370 
also take all the information and
calculate<00:04:45.850> how<00:04:46.030> much<00:04:46.180> space<00:04:46.450> it's<00:04:47.110> going<00:04:47.320> to

calculate how much space it's going to

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.350 
calculate how much space it's going to
take<00:04:47.470> in<00:04:47.650> our<00:04:47.770> warehouse<00:04:47.950> in<00:04:48.370> our<00:04:48.820> trucks<00:04:49.150> or

in<00:04:49.690> our<00:04:49.780> shipping<00:04:49.990> containers<00:04:50.470> so<00:04:50.860> we've<00:04:50.980> not

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
in our shipping containers so we've not

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.130 
in our shipping containers so we've not
only<00:04:51.220> save<00:04:51.610> tons<00:04:51.790> of<00:04:51.940> time<00:04:52.000> we've<00:04:52.690> made<00:04:52.870> the

only save tons of time we've made the
whole<00:04:53.500> thing<00:04:53.860> much<00:04:54.130> more<00:04:54.160> efficient<00:04:54.790> that's

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
whole thing much more efficient that's

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.000 
whole thing much more efficient that's
fantastic<00:04:56.050> I<00:04:56.140> mean<00:04:56.290> you<00:04:56.380> could<00:04:56.530> just<00:04:56.560> imagine

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
fantastic I mean you could just imagine

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.890 
fantastic I mean you could just imagine
the<00:04:57.370> efficiency<00:04:57.880> improvement<00:04:58.420> not<00:04:58.510> only<00:04:58.570> in

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
the efficiency improvement not only in

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.930 
the efficiency improvement not only in
people's<00:04:59.260> time<00:04:59.530> as<00:04:59.710> you<00:04:59.800> said<00:05:00.040> but<00:05:00.670> just<00:05:00.700> think

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
people's time as you said but just think

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.400 
people's time as you said but just think
about<00:05:01.090> even<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.420> efficiency<00:05:01.930> of<00:05:02.050> loading

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
about even the efficiency of loading

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.010 
about even the efficiency of loading
your<00:05:02.500> trucks<00:05:02.560> and<00:05:03.270> maximizing<00:05:04.270> the<00:05:04.300> amount<00:05:04.900> of

your trucks and maximizing the amount of
capacity<00:05:05.530> you<00:05:05.650> can<00:05:05.680> put<00:05:05.950> in<00:05:06.070> your<00:05:06.190> trucks<00:05:06.430> that

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
capacity you can put in your trucks that

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.190 
capacity you can put in your trucks that
you<00:05:06.700> go<00:05:06.820> out<00:05:06.850> on<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.120> road<00:05:07.300> exactly<00:05:07.990> that's

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
you go out on the road exactly that's

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.559 
you go out on the road exactly that's
great<00:05:08.560> Chuck<00:05:08.770> thank<00:05:09.040> you<00:05:09.130> very<00:05:09.280> much

this<00:05:15.169> is<00:05:15.319> just<00:05:15.589> one<00:05:15.919> example<00:05:16.189> of<00:05:16.939> how<00:05:17.839> the

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:17.899 
this is just one example of how the

ways with intel realsense technology now

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:26.799 
ways with intel realsense technology now
we've<00:05:24.889> come<00:05:25.189> a<00:05:25.219> long<00:05:25.339> way<00:05:25.789> with<00:05:25.999> realsense<00:05:26.539> and

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:26.809 
we've come a long way with realsense and

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:29.829 
we've come a long way with realsense and
i<00:05:27.050> thought<00:05:27.229> i<00:05:27.289> would<00:05:27.409> give<00:05:27.649> you<00:05:27.709> just<00:05:28.839> some

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:29.839 
i thought i would give you just some

i thought i would give you just some
feeling<00:05:30.349> for<00:05:30.559> what<00:05:30.770> we've<00:05:30.979> done<00:05:31.009> here

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
feeling for what we've done here

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.209 
feeling for what we've done here
this<00:05:32.569> is<00:05:32.779> the<00:05:32.899> real<00:05:33.050> sense<00:05:33.379> camera<00:05:33.889> that<00:05:34.099> we

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
this is the real sense camera that we

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:38.049 
this is the real sense camera that we
all<00:05:34.399> know<00:05:34.729> and<00:05:35.089> have<00:05:35.179> seen<00:05:35.209> before<00:05:35.689> and<00:05:37.059> is

00:05:38.049 --> 00:05:38.059 
all know and have seen before and is

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:39.909 
all know and have seen before and is
what's<00:05:38.270> been<00:05:38.539> in<00:05:38.689> most<00:05:38.959> of<00:05:39.229> the<00:05:39.319> systems<00:05:39.709> that

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
what's been in most of the systems that

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.519 
what's been in most of the systems that
we've<00:05:40.039> been<00:05:40.219> demoing<00:05:41.080> but<00:05:42.080> what<00:05:42.229> I<00:05:42.259> want<00:05:42.469> to

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:42.529 
we've been demoing but what I want to

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:44.019 
we've been demoing but what I want to
show<00:05:42.679> you<00:05:42.740> now<00:05:42.979> for<00:05:43.309> the<00:05:43.399> first<00:05:43.580> time<00:05:43.879> in

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
show you now for the first time in

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:46.749 
show you now for the first time in
public<00:05:44.209> is<00:05:44.659> the<00:05:44.990> new<00:05:45.139> realsense<00:05:45.619> camera<00:05:46.099> that

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
public is the new realsense camera that

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.399 
public is the new realsense camera that
we're<00:05:46.879> implementing<00:05:47.330> into<00:05:47.749> systems<00:05:48.169> this

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409 
we're implementing into systems this

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:50.619 
we're implementing into systems this
year<00:05:48.770> and<00:05:49.550> what<00:05:49.669> you<00:05:49.789> see<00:05:50.029> when<00:05:50.240> I<00:05:50.270> hold<00:05:50.479> them

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:50.629 
year and what you see when I hold them

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:52.329 
year and what you see when I hold them
up<00:05:50.779> next<00:05:51.080> to<00:05:51.169> each<00:05:51.259> other<00:05:51.409> is<00:05:51.680> it's<00:05:51.860> about<00:05:52.069> half

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:52.339 
up next to each other is it's about half

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:56.260 
up next to each other is it's about half
the<00:05:52.580> size<00:05:52.819> as<00:05:53.409> the<00:05:54.409> previous<00:05:54.439> version<00:05:54.830> and<00:05:55.550> if

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
the size as the previous version and if

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.239 
the size as the previous version and if
you<00:05:56.360> could<00:05:56.509> see<00:05:56.659> in<00:05:56.779> thickness<00:05:57.199> it's<00:05:57.860> probably

00:05:58.239 --> 00:05:58.249 
you could see in thickness it's probably

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:00.510 
you could see in thickness it's probably
less<00:05:58.369> than<00:05:58.430> half<00:05:58.669> the<00:05:59.089> thickness<00:05:59.479> as<00:05:59.659> well

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
less than half the thickness as well

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.969 
less than half the thickness as well
okay<00:06:01.719> now<00:06:02.719> what<00:06:02.869> this<00:06:03.050> provides<00:06:03.439> is<00:06:03.949> the

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
okay now what this provides is the

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.489 
okay now what this provides is the
ability<00:06:04.129> put<00:06:04.669> it<00:06:04.759> in<00:06:04.879> two<00:06:04.999> form<00:06:05.240> factors<00:06:05.499> like

00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:06.499 
ability put it in two form factors like

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.230 
ability put it in two form factors like
these<00:06:06.709> tablets<00:06:07.219> that<00:06:07.459> Chuck<00:06:07.699> and<00:06:07.849> I<00:06:07.909> were<00:06:07.939> just

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
these tablets that Chuck and I were just

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.509 
these tablets that Chuck and I were just
showing<00:06:08.419> you<00:06:10.689> with<00:06:11.689> much<00:06:11.930> better<00:06:12.519> thermal

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:13.519 
showing you with much better thermal

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:16.059 
showing you with much better thermal
much<00:06:13.999> better<00:06:14.409> performance<00:06:15.409> and<00:06:15.619> much<00:06:15.800> better

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:16.069 
much better performance and much better

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:20.949 
much better performance and much better
form<00:06:16.729> factors<00:06:17.709> but<00:06:19.059> it's<00:06:20.059> also<00:06:20.330> opening<00:06:20.809> up

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:20.959 
form factors but it's also opening up

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:24.219 
form factors but it's also opening up
new<00:06:21.559> opportunities<00:06:21.589> in<00:06:22.430> form<00:06:22.699> factor<00:06:23.149> and<00:06:23.659> so

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:24.229 
new opportunities in form factor and so

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:26.469 
new opportunities in form factor and so
I'm<00:06:24.319> going<00:06:24.469> to<00:06:24.529> show<00:06:24.709> you<00:06:24.769> here<00:06:25.069> today<00:06:25.099> for<00:06:25.759> the

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
I'm going to show you here today for the

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:32.679

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:32.689 
first time in public a phone using intel

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:36.730 
first time in public a phone using intel
realsense<00:06:33.849> so<00:06:34.849> now<00:06:35.050> you'll<00:06:36.050> be<00:06:36.199> able<00:06:36.289> to<00:06:36.529> move

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
realsense so now you'll be able to move

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.319 
realsense so now you'll be able to move
not<00:06:37.279> only<00:06:37.629> with<00:06:38.629> a<00:06:38.930> tablet<00:06:39.649> or<00:06:39.800> PC<00:06:40.699> or<00:06:40.729> two<00:06:41.149> and

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:41.329 
not only with a tablet or PC or two and

00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:44.079 
not only with a tablet or PC or two and
one<00:06:41.479> with<00:06:41.779> real<00:06:41.990> sense<00:06:42.289> but<00:06:43.249> a<00:06:43.279> phone<00:06:43.579> as<00:06:43.849> well

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:44.089 
one with real sense but a phone as well

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:47.319 
one with real sense but a phone as well
with<00:06:44.930> that<00:06:45.079> same<00:06:45.379> real<00:06:45.649> sense<00:06:45.949> capability<00:06:46.639> so

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:47.329 
with that same real sense capability so

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:50.199 
with that same real sense capability so
you<00:06:47.419> can<00:06:47.629> imagine<00:06:48.430> the<00:06:49.430> efficiency<00:06:50.059> and<00:06:50.149> the

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:50.209 
you can imagine the efficiency and the

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:53.199 
you can imagine the efficiency and the
opportunities<00:06:51.019> and<00:06:51.439> the<00:06:51.969> options<00:06:52.969> for

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:53.209 
opportunities and the options for

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:55.619 
opportunities and the options for
innovation<00:06:53.809> that<00:06:53.839> we<00:06:54.110> have<00:06:54.349> moving<00:06:54.769> together

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:55.629 
innovation that we have moving together

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:58.899 
innovation that we have moving together
what<00:06:56.629> types<00:06:56.899> of<00:06:57.079> things<00:06:57.139> we<00:06:57.529> can<00:06:57.740> do<00:06:57.949> in<00:06:58.759> the

00:06:58.899 --> 00:06:58.909 
what types of things we can do in the

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:02.019 
what types of things we can do in the
real<00:06:59.149> world<00:06:59.419> both<00:06:59.869> industrial<00:07:00.199> and<00:07:01.029> gaming

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:02.029 
real world both industrial and gaming

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:06.609 
real world both industrial and gaming
and<00:07:02.709> just<00:07:03.709> about<00:07:03.919> everything<00:07:04.490> we<00:07:04.969> do<00:07:05.469> when<00:07:06.469> we

00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:06.619 
and just about everything we do when we

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:08.499 
and just about everything we do when we
move<00:07:06.919> that<00:07:07.219> kind<00:07:07.490> of<00:07:07.639> innovation<00:07:07.789> and<00:07:08.360> got

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:08.509 
move that kind of innovation and got

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:12.550 
move that kind of innovation and got
kind<00:07:08.749> of<00:07:08.899> function<00:07:09.469> to<00:07:09.740> this<00:07:09.949> form<00:07:10.279> factor
