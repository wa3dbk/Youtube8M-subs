00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:20.170 
and then I'm just going to start back
combing<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:13.060> tops<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:14.409> side

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:35.950 

so<00:02:21.180> now<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.390> know<00:02:24.410> push<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.560> out<00:02:32.690> like<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:34.260> I

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
so now I know push it out like that I

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.430 
so now I know push it out like that I
mean<00:02:37.070> it's<00:02:38.070> obviously<00:02:38.760> not<00:02:39.330> as<00:02:39.480> backcombed<00:02:40.110> as

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
mean it's obviously not as backcombed as

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.360 
mean it's obviously not as backcombed as
I<00:02:40.590> usually<00:02:41.070> have<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.460> um<00:02:42.440> but<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.710> still<00:02:44.070> got

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
I usually have it um but it's still got

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.960 
I usually have it um but it's still got
that<00:02:44.730> volume<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:46.430> then<00:02:47.430> I'm<00:02:47.640> just<00:02:47.730> going<00:02:47.910> to

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
that volume to it then I'm just going to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.840 
that volume to it then I'm just going to
do<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.240> other<00:02:48.420> side<00:02:48.570> as<00:02:48.870> well<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.790> think

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
do the other side as well and I think

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.890 
do the other side as well and I think
I'm<00:02:54.120> gonna<00:02:54.300> tuck<00:02:54.770> this<00:02:55.770> bit<00:02:56.480> behind<00:02:57.480> my<00:02:57.690> ear

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
I'm gonna tuck this bit behind my ear

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.450 
I'm gonna tuck this bit behind my ear
because<00:02:58.380> it's<00:02:58.560> getting<00:02:58.770> on<00:02:58.890> my<00:02:58.920> nose

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
because it's getting on my nose

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:06.170 
because it's getting on my nose
and<00:03:00.090> then<00:03:00.930> Sam<00:03:01.680> again<00:03:01.890> pushed<00:03:02.460> out<00:03:04.940> my<00:03:05.940> heads

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
and then Sam again pushed out my heads

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.090 
and then Sam again pushed out my heads
getting<00:03:06.300> on<00:03:06.540> my<00:03:06.630> nerves<00:03:06.840> too<00:03:07.050> just<00:03:07.200> washed<00:03:07.470> it

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.230 
top layer where there's a backbone
properly<00:03:13.020> when<00:03:13.170> I've<00:03:13.290> just<00:03:13.320> washed<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:14.240> then

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
properly when I've just washed it then

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.650 
properly when I've just washed it then
I'm<00:03:15.570> just<00:03:15.690> going<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.960> get<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.200> back<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:18.630> just
