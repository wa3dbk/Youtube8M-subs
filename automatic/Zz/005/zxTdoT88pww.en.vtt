00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.230
 good what's up guys welcome a 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:06.330
 time more to my channel I'm gripper and we're 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.370
 back in call of duty us warfare what 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.110
 that I bring you today is my best game in 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.820
 team duel the time it is a 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.010
 pretty good game with a streak 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.809
 important that good if we compare it 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.820
 with a game in any other call 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.650
 of duty would be a normal game pulling 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.510
 to good but good in this call of duty 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.430
 you know it costs a lot drawn 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.140
 good games and good for you 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.730
 makes the truth a good departure 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.380
 you are going to see now mega pulls 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.119
 awesome that I hit the call of 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.700
 duty and here will be the first tachÃ¡n 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.770
 frozen screen because I do not know 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.300
 you guys know it's the worst thing if you 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.790
 you find an enemy face in that 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.500
 Busting moment you why because 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.300
 individual pulls are not 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.940
 collectives if you hit you has pulled you 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.219
 stuck to you end you can shoot 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.960
 to the enemy but at another time it would be 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.969
 a lot of chance that you expect a pull 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.250
 the two at the same time the pulls as I say 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.840
 They are the same and if the pull hits you 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.070
 he has stuck it to you only I do not know if 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.310
 you understand, I think I explain and if not 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.870
 well, good 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.120
 I have done everything I could to 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.370
 do to explain anything to me as you see 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.740
 I'm taking the aca in here I do not know 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.240
 call here twelve riff that changes the 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.770
 name this already with a mess of names of 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.720
 the weapons that each weapon has a name 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.460
 even if it is the same or nothing if the 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.920
 you have improved you change the name so 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.320
 it's simply the best I think the 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.560
 here 12 riff is the best one goes up a point 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.930
 of damage takes you away I think one of driving 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.910
 and two ammunition but that's what 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.680
 You solve it by putting the simple charger 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.600
 expanded if you do not put the charger 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.700
 expanded you stay with the 22 charger 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.160
 bullets if you put it expanded you'll see 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.140
 as the charger is 33 bullets 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.180
 there you are, you see, I just recharged 33 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.560
 bullets it 's almost as if I took it away 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.869
 extended charger what happens is that 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.460
 you have one more point of damage for putting him 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.500
 the loader expanded the truth is that it is 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.300
 quite pretty good to me I love 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.950
 in this game of saying that despite 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.380
 the pulls the connection was going pretty 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.750
 Well the game was very decent 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.640
 following this I made 40 casualties in 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.130
 I duel for teams guys but I'm so 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.960
 extremely delayed not recording it for 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.300
 who not only creates after his life 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.530
 I suppose the good record and I will upload it more 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.200
 ahead 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.659
 in team idol and will leave at 40 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.459
 you will see the 40 and well then I would like 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.680
 have raised the other game also already 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.630
 that are 40 casualties and hit me a few tugs 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.490
 of the host the times I die was for 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.530
 those medicine pulls streak of 20 me 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.060
 they were implacable and good because he was 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.100
 pretty good but in my opinion this 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.110
 starting is better so I'm happy 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.600
 of having been able to record it even though they kill me 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.920
 for being asshole I get very very very 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.959
 nervous 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.640
 in life I think I had put 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.100
 so nervous to make me a streak in 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.690
 call of duty since good good if with 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.700
 the magnum move that I made in the modern 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.160
 warfare 3 a video that incidentally he 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.870
 he burst a lot, I think he had a thousand 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.670
 likes but this the ex or is a 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.080
 barbarity guys it was amazing 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.340
 Awesome 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.040
 well at the beginning of the first 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.290
 it made me nervous obviously but when 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.000
 I was carrying about 150 more or something 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.920
 style the nerves disappeared but 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.900
 completely it did not make me nervous anymore 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.580
 for nothing, unless it was 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.980
 using a rare weapon as it can be 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.230
 the magnum the usp of a sniper 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.780
 something like that you know and good 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.370
 currently I have been touching the 800 maps or 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.530
 be 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.110
 my nerves as if I roll a hue 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.879
 come on, it's hard to get a love but 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.530
 my nerves are as if you take me out 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.060
 in Huawei that simple 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.620
 As you can see right now, I have a run of 20 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.440
 here I was already dying I was shaking 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.540
 the hands could not think well the 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.220
 movements I notice that they were going fatal 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.260
 I have to get used to doing more 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.540
 gusts of these because if I do not I can not 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.819
 control nerves guys I'll need 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.730
 luck to draw a DNA in this game 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.040
 since my nerves are killing me now 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.200
 as I say I need luck to get it out 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.700
 because he did not control the nerves if I have 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.680
 I'm lucky you guys 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.319
 currently with my ability for 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.060
 nerves could not I think it's like that in 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.760
 a fair game where you do not have 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.530
 no luck could not get the lacquer 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.269
 Gary to guys would misdirect any 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.769
 thing here you see how they kill me for 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.150
 take the stairs 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.400
 I should have stuck a mega jump 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.159
 but as I saw two enemies on the map 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.599
 up I did not want to make the leap from the ex 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.310
 I brought because you already know that they appear 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.299
 in minimap I do not have the advantage of 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.459
 hide it 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.470
 so if I had seen good one 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.959
 shit streak of 22 vais to see how 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.370
 finished the game with a 29 2 the truth 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.720
 is that it is a good result 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.700
 just like the game is pretty good 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.769
 that is to say that this very night 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.780
 tonight when I was playing that I 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.910
 I made this game all the games that 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.650
 I played I ended up with more than 30 casualties in 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.290
 team duel a few scores 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.690
 pretty good and as I say finish 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.360
 with this 29 2 is also a game of 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.460
 38 casualties and another 40 as I said 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.919
 above looks very well is that I 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.270
 noticed noted as I have improved as 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.280
 player the truth is that I 'm moving 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.780
 better on the map and I'm controlling 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.400
 much better this new call of duty 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.919
 that the truth lately I am 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.870
 happening much better playing it does not give me 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.000
 so many problems but that is to say 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.240
 that there are times that is unbearable guys 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.160
 tomorrow I will upload a video in which I 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.590
 I will stay in everything I speak as I would say 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.330
 someone that I know because good and what 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.639
 you will see and you will see it is little thin 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.250
 because guys is awesome the 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.620
 cheats that there are jerks that glue 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.810
 this and the server crashes that it has 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.940
 the gallo light and server falls guys 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.070
 falls you can not play for several 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.620
 hours because the gentlemen have been 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.300
 dropped the server good simply these 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.610
 guys, I hope you liked the 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.500
 video that you support with a good line 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.729
