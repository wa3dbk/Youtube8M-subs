sort of make a jungle survival island

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.340 
sort of make a jungle survival island
that<00:00:22.910> would<00:00:23.090> be<00:00:23.240> amazing<00:00:23.540> and<00:00:23.930> you<00:00:24.110> guys

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
me know about it and as you see the seed

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.120 
me know about it and as you see the seed
is<00:00:29.660> on<00:00:29.810> the<00:00:29.930> screen<00:00:30.200> and<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.650> seed<00:00:30.890> will<00:00:30.980> be<00:00:31.070> in

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
is on the screen and the seed will be in

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.290 
is on the screen and the seed will be in
the<00:00:31.189> description<00:00:31.610> as<00:00:31.730> well<00:00:31.910> as<00:00:32.029> all<00:00:32.180> the

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
the description as well as all the

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.120 
the description as well as all the
coordinates<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:32.900> stuff<00:00:33.079> that<00:00:33.200> I<00:00:33.230> found<00:00:33.470> but

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
coordinates and stuff that I found but

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.120 
coordinates and stuff that I found but
anyway<00:00:34.880> as<00:00:35.120> you<00:00:35.270> see<00:00:35.510> we<00:00:36.050> have<00:00:36.079> a<00:00:36.530> jungle

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
anyway as you see we have a jungle

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.450 
anyway as you see we have a jungle
island<00:00:37.850> which<00:00:38.660> is<00:00:38.690> awesome<00:00:39.380> and<00:00:39.950> as<00:00:40.100> you<00:00:40.250> see

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
island which is awesome and as you see

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.370 
island which is awesome and as you see
it's<00:00:40.640> not<00:00:40.730> too<00:00:40.850> big<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:41.690> it's<00:00:41.780> not<00:00:41.900> too<00:00:42.050> small

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
it's not too big and it's not too small

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.840 
it's not too big and it's not too small
I<00:00:42.530> think<00:00:42.560> it's<00:00:42.830> the<00:00:42.920> perfect<00:00:43.160> size<00:00:43.520> for<00:00:43.820> a

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
I think it's the perfect size for a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.090 
I think it's the perfect size for a
survival<00:00:44.420> island<00:00:44.720> and<00:00:45.050> actually<00:00:45.770> right<00:00:45.920> here

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
survival island and actually right here

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.990

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
all the coordinates all I did pretty

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.880 
all the coordinates all I did pretty
much<00:00:53.030> I<00:00:53.300> found<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:53.630> end<00:00:53.780> portal<00:00:54.110> but<00:00:54.650> what<00:00:54.860> I

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
much I found the end portal but what I

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.070 
much I found the end portal but what I
did<00:00:55.190> was<00:00:55.370> I<00:00:55.430> actually<00:00:55.850> went<00:00:56.210> to<00:00:56.330> each<00:00:56.510> Island

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
did was I actually went to each Island

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.490 
and and left a description of what they
are<00:00:59.450> so<00:00:59.720> if<00:00:59.780> you<00:00:59.840> check<00:00:59.990> in<00:01:00.080> the<00:01:00.140> description

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
are so if you check in the description

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.870 
are so if you check in the description
to<00:01:00.560> see<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.770> coordinates<00:01:01.160> for<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.490> islands

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
to see the coordinates for the islands

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.539 
to see the coordinates for the islands
and<00:01:01.970> what<00:01:02.270> each<00:01:02.480> Island<00:01:02.960> is<00:01:03.170> now<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:04.129> reason<00:01:04.309> I

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
and what each Island is now the reason I

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.190 
and what each Island is now the reason I
did<00:01:04.699> that<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:05.030> i<00:01:05.059> didn't<00:01:05.360> find<00:01:05.659> like<00:01:06.020> you<00:01:06.140> know

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
did that and i didn't find like you know

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.420 
did that and i didn't find like you know
where<00:01:06.320> diamonds<00:01:06.799> are<00:01:06.890> now<00:01:07.009> that<00:01:07.130> stuff<00:01:07.280> is

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
where diamonds are now that stuff is

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.370 
where diamonds are now that stuff is
because<00:01:07.970> that's<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.330> fun<00:01:08.600> in<00:01:08.780> a<00:01:08.930> survival

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
because that's the fun in a survival

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.780 
because that's the fun in a survival
island<00:01:09.650> if<00:01:09.860> I<00:01:09.920> told<00:01:10.159> you<00:01:10.250> everything<00:01:10.340> once

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
island if I told you everything once

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.640 
island if I told you everything once
then<00:01:11.270> it<00:01:11.420> wouldn't<00:01:11.600> be<00:01:11.689> that<00:01:11.869> fun<00:01:12.049> but<00:01:12.259> having

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
then it wouldn't be that fun but having

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.980 
then it wouldn't be that fun but having
a<00:01:12.920> survival<00:01:13.400> island<00:01:13.790> you<00:01:14.479> know<00:01:14.539> sort<00:01:14.929> of

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
a survival island you know sort of

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.200 
a survival island you know sort of
challenge<00:01:15.530> then<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:16.340> can<00:01:16.520> do<00:01:16.609> it<00:01:16.729> now<00:01:16.880> one<00:01:17.119> of

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
challenge then you can do it now one of

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.569 
challenge then you can do it now one of
the<00:01:17.270> actual<00:01:17.659> nice<00:01:18.170> places<00:01:18.560> to<00:01:18.710> go<00:01:19.009> is<00:01:19.189> actually

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
the actual nice places to go is actually

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.539 
the actual nice places to go is actually
right<00:01:19.759> here<00:01:19.789> now<00:01:20.539> this<00:01:21.140> those<00:01:22.039> coordinates

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
right here now this those coordinates

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.830 
right here now this those coordinates
right<00:01:22.640> there<00:01:22.820> we're<00:01:23.060> just<00:01:23.179> gonna<00:01:23.299> hop<00:01:23.509> under

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
right there we're just gonna hop under

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.340 
right there we're just gonna hop under
water

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
water

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.260 
water
this<00:01:24.649> actually<00:01:24.920> leads<00:01:25.399> to<00:01:25.670> an<00:01:25.759> abandoned

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
this actually leads to an abandoned

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.419 
this actually leads to an abandoned
mineshaft<00:01:26.450> which<00:01:26.869> actually<00:01:27.259> lead<00:01:27.499> to<00:01:28.009> I<00:01:28.039> think

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
mineshaft which actually lead to I think

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.459 
mineshaft which actually lead to I think
a<00:01:28.490> ravine<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:28.880> some<00:01:29.240> other<00:01:29.390> big<00:01:29.990> cage<00:01:30.289> that

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
a ravine and some other big cage that

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:31.690 
a ravine and some other big cage that
you<00:01:30.560> can<00:01:30.710> explore<00:01:30.979> to<00:01:31.159> actually<00:01:31.460> get<00:01:31.549> some

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
you can explore to actually get some

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.489 
you can explore to actually get some
starter<00:01:32.060> materials<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:32.810> some<00:01:32.960> starter<00:01:33.170> items

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499 
starter materials and some starter items

I also recommend some other seats for me
so<00:01:58.399> I<00:01:58.459> could<00:01:58.639> check<00:01:58.789> them<00:01:58.969> out<00:01:59.060> now<00:01:59.450> here<00:01:59.659> we

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
so I could check them out now here we

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.199 
so I could check them out now here we
have<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.289> end<00:02:00.560> portal<00:02:01.130> so<00:02:01.579> as<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:01.819> see<00:02:01.999> those

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
have the end portal so as you see those

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:03.550 
have the end portal so as you see those
are<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.359> coordinates<00:02:02.630> of<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.990> origins<00:02:03.439> is<00:02:03.530> in

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
are the coordinates of the origins is in

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.139 
are the coordinates of the origins is in
the<00:02:03.679> way<00:02:03.829> but<00:02:04.280> there<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:04.459> go<00:02:04.579> there<00:02:04.759> are<00:02:04.909> the

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
the way but there you go there are the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.309 
the way but there you go there are the
coordinates<00:02:05.539> for<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:05.749> EM<00:02:05.840> portal<00:02:06.109> so<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:06.229> go

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
coordinates for the EM portal so you go

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.879 
coordinates for the EM portal so you go
check<00:02:06.529> that<00:02:06.679> out

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:06.889 
check that out

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:09.999 
check that out
um<00:02:07.569> and<00:02:08.569> then<00:02:08.720> actually<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.140> last<00:02:09.590> thing<00:02:09.800> I'm

there's actually three mushroom islands

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:31.890 
there's actually three mushroom islands
like<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.150> said<00:02:31.329> they'll<00:02:31.569> be<00:02:31.659> in<00:02:31.840> the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
like I said they'll be in the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.509 
like I said they'll be in the
description<00:02:32.349> you<00:02:32.439> go<00:02:32.560> check<00:02:32.769> those<00:02:32.920> out<00:02:33.069> but

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
description you go check those out but

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.739 
description you go check those out but
if<00:02:33.790> we're<00:02:33.969> just<00:02:33.999> gonna<00:02:34.239> head<00:02:34.359> straight<00:02:34.719> over

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:34.749 
if we're just gonna head straight over

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:36.149 
if we're just gonna head straight over
here<00:02:34.930> that's<00:02:35.170> actually<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.560> desert<00:02:36.069> island

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
here that's actually a desert island

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.099 
here that's actually a desert island
which<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.549> probably<00:02:36.909> the<00:02:37.120> best<00:02:37.540> island<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:38.019> go

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
which is probably the best island to go

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.660 
which is probably the best island to go
to<00:02:38.290> besides<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.980> jungle<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.400> get<00:02:39.519> some
