right<00:00:52.530> which<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.190> thought<00:00:53.730> was<00:00:53.910> pretty<00:00:53.969> pointed

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
right which I thought was pretty pointed

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.290

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
just set this poor thing up to get

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.909 
just set this poor thing up to get
slaughtered<00:05:51.630> we're<00:05:52.630> assuming<00:05:52.990> it's<00:05:53.320> only<00:05:53.620> one

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
slaughtered we're assuming it's only one

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.040 
slaughtered we're assuming it's only one
now<00:05:54.610> that<00:05:54.849> we<00:05:55.030> now<00:05:55.240> that<00:05:55.300> I<00:05:55.450> think<00:05:55.510> about<00:05:55.780> it<00:05:55.990> I

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
now that we now that I think about it I

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.300 
now that we now that I think about it I
mean<00:05:56.080> because<00:05:56.320> there<00:05:56.470> is<00:05:56.620> there<00:05:56.889> was<00:05:57.099> that

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
mean because there is there was that

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.300 
mean because there is there was that
shot<00:05:57.550> of<00:05:57.789> it<00:05:57.910> actually<00:05:58.360> getting<00:05:58.599> hit<00:05:59.349> which

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
shot of it actually getting hit which

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.610 
shot of it actually getting hit which
looks<00:06:00.789> to<00:06:00.970> me<00:06:01.120> like<00:06:01.150> a<00:06:01.330> pickup<00:06:01.780> later<00:06:02.110> and<00:06:02.440> so

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
looks to me like a pickup later and so

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.250 
looks to me like a pickup later and so
that<00:06:02.770> would<00:06:02.919> mean<00:06:03.729> more<00:06:04.210> than<00:06:04.270> one<00:06:04.419> animal<00:06:05.080> and

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
that would mean more than one animal and

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.560 
that would mean more than one animal and
now<00:06:05.440> that<00:06:05.650> I<00:06:05.680> I'm<00:06:05.979> you<00:06:06.460> know<00:06:06.580> I'm<00:06:06.820> looking<00:06:07.419> at

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
now that I I'm you know I'm looking at

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.540 
now that I I'm you know I'm looking at
it<00:06:07.719> you<00:06:07.990> know<00:06:08.020> look<00:06:08.469> I'm<00:06:08.830> not<00:06:09.070> with<00:06:09.219> the<00:06:09.340> idea

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
it you know look I'm not with the idea

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.310 
it you know look I'm not with the idea
that<00:06:09.640> it's<00:06:09.789> a<00:06:09.849> snuff<00:06:10.120> film<00:06:10.150> right<00:06:10.479> people<00:06:11.200> go

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320
