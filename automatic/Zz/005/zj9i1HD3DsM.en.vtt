00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.099
 as she is yes 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.970
 hello to all wrestlers c6 nex fate 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.830
 today I am going to present you a 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.940
 new glitch on battlefield 3 that will 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.230
 allow yourself and well to do 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.210
 several things at once 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.590
 and yes so things that we that we 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.900
 we'll see a little later in the 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.940
 video I'm going to explain to you directly 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.710
 the manipulation to follow for power and 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.570
 well done this famous goal 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.360
 so firstly you have to have a 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.860
 weapon with a beep is so it's very 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.050
 simple you head anywhere 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.059
 on the map you lie down you ask 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.320
 your foot ball and that's where the 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.050
 manipulation is going to be a bit complicated 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.570
 you will have to start next 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.930
 exit the start menu and give a shot of 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.930
 knife 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.360
 so for me it'll be on ps3 it's going 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.619
 so be start game ferron and very quickly 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.450
 I'm stabbing right after 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.430
 if all goes well you will see and 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.050
 as soon as your but your weapon goes 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.509
 disappear and when you will try 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.310
 to actually get up your vision is going 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.580
 stay where you did the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.290
 manipulation but your body is going to get it 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.550
 move normally on the map as 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.899
 you can see it on the mini map 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.300
 which is at the bottom left 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.400
 as you see my view remain 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.700
 static while my body my 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.619
 character moves him and well elsewhere 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.540
 on the map but you do not see yourself 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.430
 not only is it worth to allies and your enemies 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.380
 and see your body move well 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.380
 just see to the plane that is lying 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.980
 so what are you going to tell me 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.940
 serves to make this famous manipulation 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.980
 Well, I'll explain it to you 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.480
 now this manipulation once 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.370
 that you have realized you are going 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.840
 to be able to point you towards an enemy 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.650
 so I remind you that you have to 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.310
 help the minimap to move the 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.750
 better possible 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.880
 so you head to the night and 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.740
 you go the side so if everything happens 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.630
 well you'll see you're going to be 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.090
 hoard bring to where he enemies 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.310
 and suddenly and well you will see 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.730
 the animation of the cut so be able to kill 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.980
 the enemy 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.560
 once it's good there it will be again 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.790
 more buggy you will see it if you 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.440
 try to plug the vision towards the 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.690
 left to the right it will be blocked 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.500
 as if you were still with your 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.540
 ball feet and you will see your sight 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.640
 normal if you change weapons by 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.650
 against there the glitch is fucked must 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.800
 really you keep the knife 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.360
 in hand and so in truth your body 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.670
 will be a little further compared to 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.780
 your view I explain myself example if you 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.270
 go around a building 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.720
 you will see that your view goes one 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.880
 skewer and quite a lot of wall is 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.800
 normal since your body actually 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.530
 is a little further in front of you it's 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.209
 for that, try to navigate with the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.590
 mini card 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.920
 so that's one of the first 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.840
 possibilities that this glitch that this 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.840
 manipulation offers you 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.090
 so we will see the last 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.950
 opportunity this gi joe offers then 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.110
 you will do the manipulation as 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.240
 at the beginning of the video I deliberately made 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.720
 take a map where there is a descent 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.220
 ie height difference so you go 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.200
 do the manipulation and you go to 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.210
 listened to your enemy I did it on purpose 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.970
 to go far enough for for you to see 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.870
 how much teleportation and fast 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.780
 is impressive 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.760
 so once you have left your 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.830
 your enemy you 're going to be heading and 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.600
 well down the slope down the 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.100
 slope down the hill call it 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.770
 as you want and so you go 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.550
 see that your view she will stay at 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.230
 same place and where you did 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.450
 you have side of the enemy ie 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.670
 if you advance as you go down you 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.120
 will see your view that remains at the same 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.400
 level 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.660
 on the other hand, your body is down to him 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.820
 and well and so 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.320
 and so if you go down even more 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.090
 you will see that you are going to be very 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.310
 very high in the air with your sight 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.040
 is what is really really 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.930
 impressive so here it was 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.270
 last characteristic of this glitch 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.800
 I hope that this one will have pleased you 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.840
