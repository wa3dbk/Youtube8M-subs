with the whole hair growth I kind of got

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.219 
with the whole hair growth I kind of got
over<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> little<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.390> know<00:01:27.509> long<00:01:27.780> hair<00:01:27.990> face

over the little you know long hair face

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.140 
over the little you know long hair face
but<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> still<00:01:29.189> want<00:01:29.369> my<00:01:29.400> hair<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.729> go<00:01:29.880> fast

another one of these actually I do have

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.530 
another one of these actually I do have
it's<00:02:56.100> just<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.640> it's<00:02:56.760> still<00:02:57.030> taking

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
it's just that it's still taking

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.270 
it's just that it's still taking
consistency<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.590> doesn't<00:02:58.890> come<00:02:59.040> up<00:02:59.160> to

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
consistency that it doesn't come up to

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.699 
consistency that it doesn't come up to
the<00:02:59.370> pump<00:02:59.610> so<00:03:00.420> what<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.600> do<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:01.170> remove<00:03:01.560> the

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
the pump so what I do is is remove the

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.020 
the pump so what I do is is remove the
top<00:03:01.920> and

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.350 

I<00:03:08.090> think<00:03:09.069> that<00:03:10.069> should<00:03:10.370> be<00:03:10.430> good<00:03:10.550> a<00:03:11.000> little<00:03:11.120> bit

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
I think that should be good a little bit

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.660 
I think that should be good a little bit
more

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.270 

okay<00:03:14.940> that's<00:03:15.270> good

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
okay that's good

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.300 
okay that's good
