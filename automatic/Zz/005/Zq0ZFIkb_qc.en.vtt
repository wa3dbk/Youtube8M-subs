difference<00:03:33.970> it<00:03:34.120> actually<00:03:34.329> differently

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
difference it actually differently

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.979 
difference it actually differently
changes<00:03:35.470> your<00:03:35.620> hair<00:03:35.799> color<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:36.780> it's<00:03:37.780> not

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
changes your hair color and it's not

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.699 
changes your hair color and it's not
actually<00:03:38.380> this<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.840> PNA<00:03:40.840> isn't<00:03:41.290> that<00:03:41.440> like

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
actually this the PNA isn't that like

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.410 
actually this the PNA isn't that like
awful<00:03:42.130> smell<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:42.519> there's<00:03:42.880> actually<00:03:43.180> quite<00:03:43.299> a

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
awful smell and there's actually quite a

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.720 
awful smell and there's actually quite a
smells<00:03:43.810> quite<00:03:43.930> nice<00:03:44.200> like<00:03:44.620> there's<00:03:45.190> not<00:03:45.430> that

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
smells quite nice like there's not that

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.789 
smells quite nice like there's not that
much<00:03:45.910> of<00:03:46.209> an<00:03:46.329> ammonia<00:03:46.690> smell<00:03:47.049> so<00:03:47.320> I<00:03:47.350> could<00:03:47.650> say

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
much of an ammonia smell so I could say

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.380 
much of an ammonia smell so I could say
so<00:03:47.859> it's<00:03:48.160> pretty<00:03:48.579> bearable<00:03:49.120> when<00:03:49.269> you're

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
so it's pretty bearable when you're

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.789 
so it's pretty bearable when you're
putting<00:03:49.630> it<00:03:49.750> in<00:03:49.780> your<00:03:49.930> hair<00:03:50.200> you're<00:03:50.500> not<00:03:50.650> like

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
putting it in your hair you're not like

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.720 
putting it in your hair you're not like
oh<00:03:50.980> this<00:03:51.400> is<00:03:51.519> gross<00:03:51.850> kind<00:03:52.239> of<00:03:52.359> thing<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:53.730> yeah

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
oh this is gross kind of thing and yeah

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.210 
oh this is gross kind of thing and yeah
I<00:03:55.090> think<00:03:55.239> cons<00:03:55.690> about<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.140> is<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.829> fact<00:03:56.980> that<00:03:57.100> a

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
I think cons about it is the fact that a

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.340 
I think cons about it is the fact that a
kind<00:03:57.430> of<00:03:57.489> stings<00:03:57.820> your<00:03:58.000> scalp<00:03:58.329> and<00:03:58.600> also<00:03:59.109> I

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
kind of stings your scalp and also I

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.009 
kind of stings your scalp and also I
feel<00:03:59.680> like<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:01.000> didn't<00:04:01.299> actually<00:04:01.390> last

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
feel like it didn't actually last

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.990 
feel like it didn't actually last
overly<00:04:02.769> that<00:04:03.040> long<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.549> my

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
overly that long and my

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.090 
overly that long and my
but<00:04:04.870> I<00:04:04.900> think<00:04:05.140> this<00:04:05.440> is<00:04:05.590> more<00:04:05.800> or<00:04:05.890> less<00:04:05.920> the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
but I think this is more or less the

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.190 
but I think this is more or less the
same<00:04:06.280> color<00:04:06.550> as<00:04:06.730> might<00:04:06.970> here<00:04:07.420> before<00:04:07.840> I<00:04:07.870> dyed

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
same color as might here before I dyed

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.490 
same color as might here before I dyed
it<00:04:08.410> now<00:04:08.590> so<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:10.000> has<00:04:10.450> stayed<00:04:10.720> on<00:04:10.750> a<00:04:10.930> bit<00:04:11.230> but

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
it now so it has stayed on a bit but

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.530 
it now so it has stayed on a bit but
it's<00:04:11.680> also<00:04:11.860> just<00:04:12.220> quite<00:04:12.520> like<00:04:12.730> washed<00:04:13.090> out<00:04:13.360> and

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
it's also just quite like washed out and

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.750 
it's also just quite like washed out and
stuff<00:04:13.810> so<00:04:14.020> I<00:04:14.050> differently<00:04:14.800> recommend<00:04:15.610> if

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
stuff so I differently recommend if

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.300 
stuff so I differently recommend if
you're<00:04:15.910> going<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.420> a<00:04:16.450> diet<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:17.470> use<00:04:17.920> color

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
you're going to a diet to use color

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.210 
you're going to a diet to use color
protectant<00:04:19.030> shampoo<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:19.900> not<00:04:20.079> just<00:04:20.320> wash

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
protectant shampoo and not just wash

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.530 
protectant shampoo and not just wash
your<00:04:21.250> hair<00:04:21.549> every<00:04:21.730> day<00:04:21.880> because<00:04:22.090> I<00:04:22.210> do<00:04:22.270> that

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
your hair every day because I do that

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.510 
your hair every day because I do that
which<00:04:22.750> is<00:04:22.780> pretty<00:04:23.020> bad<00:04:23.200> for<00:04:23.410> my<00:04:23.500> hair<00:04:23.710> but<00:04:24.340> I've

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
which is pretty bad for my hair but I've

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.180 
which is pretty bad for my hair but I've
really<00:04:24.790> orderly<00:04:25.090> here<00:04:25.360> no<00:04:25.870> no<00:04:26.110> choice<00:04:26.500> but

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
really orderly here no no choice but

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.800 
really orderly here no no choice but
yeah<00:04:27.400> so<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:28.090> would<00:04:28.300> definitely<00:04:28.450> recommend

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
yeah so I would definitely recommend

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.590 
yeah so I would definitely recommend
this<00:04:29.290> from<00:04:30.040> people<00:04:30.850> that<00:04:30.970> have<00:04:31.150> never<00:04:31.330> died

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
this from people that have never died

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.850 
this from people that have never died
there<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.080> actually<00:04:32.380> want<00:04:32.650> to<00:04:32.710> see<00:04:32.800> the

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
there and actually want to see the

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.500 
there and actually want to see the
difference<00:04:33.190> or<00:04:33.370> for<00:04:33.640> people<00:04:33.910> that<00:04:34.030> have<00:04:34.270> dyed

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
difference or for people that have dyed

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.730 
difference or for people that have dyed
their<00:04:34.720> hair<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:35.020> haven't<00:04:35.500> seen<00:04:35.620> the

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
their hair and haven't seen the

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.520 
their hair and haven't seen the
difference<00:04:36.130> I<00:04:36.400> probably<00:04:37.210> think<00:04:37.540> I<00:04:37.750> will<00:04:38.020> be

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
difference I probably think I will be

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.080 
difference I probably think I will be
using

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
using

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.020 
using
Donaire<00:04:40.090> again<00:04:40.690> pretty<00:04:41.140> Polti<00:04:41.830> sorry<00:04:42.220> because

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
Donaire again pretty Polti sorry because

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.360 
Donaire again pretty Polti sorry because
but<00:04:43.870> actually<00:04:44.320> you<00:04:44.650> see<00:04:44.890> a<00:04:44.920> color<00:04:45.160> difference

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
but actually you see a color difference

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.250 
but actually you see a color difference
and<00:04:45.820> I<00:04:46.090> think<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.390> conditioner<00:04:46.840> is<00:04:46.930> pretty

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
and I think the conditioner is pretty

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.050 
and I think the conditioner is pretty
good<00:04:47.620> it<00:04:48.160> actually<00:04:48.280> makes<00:04:48.610> your<00:04:48.730> hair<00:04:48.910> feel

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
good it actually makes your hair feel

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.700 
good it actually makes your hair feel
really<00:04:49.330> nice<00:04:49.480> I<00:04:49.780> wish<00:04:49.900> they<00:04:50.050> gave<00:04:50.230> me<00:04:50.380> more<00:04:50.620> of

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750
