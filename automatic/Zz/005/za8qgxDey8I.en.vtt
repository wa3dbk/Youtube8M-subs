00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
in any water substance mixes it will

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.729 
in any water substance mixes it will

little bit of milky looking stuff on the
dipstick<00:03:42.049> if<00:03:42.439> you<00:03:43.220> do<00:03:43.430> constant<00:03:44.239> short<00:03:44.840> trips

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:45.229 
dipstick if you do constant short trips

dipstick if you do constant short trips
you<00:03:45.859> don't<00:03:46.069> get<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.430> car<00:03:46.669> driving<00:03:47.150> 30<00:03:47.419> minutes

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
you don't get the car driving 30 minutes

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.020 
you don't get the car driving 30 minutes
at<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:47.989> time<00:03:48.199> you'll<00:03:48.949> see<00:03:49.220> more<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:49.489> more<00:03:49.790> that

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
at a time you'll see more and more that

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.689 
at a time you'll see more and more that
stuff<00:03:50.269> buildup<00:03:50.720> on<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.049> dipstick<00:03:51.409> too<00:03:51.799> so

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
stuff buildup on the dipstick too so

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.360 
stuff buildup on the dipstick too so
it's<00:03:53.000> not<00:03:53.239> a<00:03:53.659> bad<00:03:54.049> head<00:03:54.319> gasket<00:03:54.889> it's<00:03:55.040> just

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
it's not a bad head gasket it's just

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.039 
it's not a bad head gasket it's just
condensation<00:03:56.150> that<00:03:56.329> hadn't<00:03:57.019> been<00:03:57.049> burned<00:03:57.409> off

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
condensation that hadn't been burned off

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.140 
condensation that hadn't been burned off
the<00:04:00.049> most<00:04:00.259> common<00:04:00.739> head<00:04:00.949> gasket<00:04:01.519> issue<00:04:01.790> is

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
the most common head gasket issue is

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.830 
the most common head gasket issue is
when<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:03.019> water<00:04:03.590> gets<00:04:04.459> into<00:04:04.759> the<00:04:05.150> oil<00:04:05.419> and

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
when the water gets into the oil and

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.939 
when the water gets into the oil and
that<00:04:06.799> fluid<00:04:07.430> of<00:04:07.819> water<00:04:08.659> is<00:04:08.989> getting<00:04:09.530> past<00:04:10.090> the

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
that fluid of water is getting past the

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.619 
that fluid of water is getting past the
cylinder<00:04:12.949> walls<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.669> it's<00:04:14.209> getting<00:04:14.509> in<00:04:14.599> the

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
cylinder walls and it's getting in the

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.770 
cylinder walls and it's getting in the
piston<00:04:15.169> area<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:15.889> when<00:04:16.549> coolant<00:04:17.239> or<00:04:17.389> water

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
piston area and when coolant or water

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.349 
piston area and when coolant or water
gets<00:04:18.229> into<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.620> piston<00:04:18.859> area<00:04:19.400> and<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:19.940> piston

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
gets into the piston area and the piston

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.200 
gets into the piston area and the piston
comes<00:04:20.599> up<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:21.049> it<00:04:21.199> fires<00:04:21.500> makes<00:04:22.370> an<00:04:22.520> explosion

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
comes up and it fires makes an explosion

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.659 
comes up and it fires makes an explosion
anything<00:04:24.050> in<00:04:24.289> there<00:04:24.529> gets<00:04:24.770> forced<00:04:25.250> out<00:04:25.400> of<00:04:25.430> the

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
anything in there gets forced out of the

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:26.730 
anything in there gets forced out of the
tailpipe

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
tailpipe

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.550 
tailpipe
so<00:04:26.860> do<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.280> have<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.490> lot<00:04:27.729> of<00:04:27.759> smoke<00:04:28.240> like<00:04:28.569> white

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
so do you have a lot of smoke like white

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.370 
so do you have a lot of smoke like white
smoke<00:04:30.039> coming<00:04:30.340> out<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.150> tailpipe<00:04:31.419> that<00:04:32.110> means

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
smoke coming out the tailpipe that means

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.710 
smoke coming out the tailpipe that means
you<00:04:32.530> have<00:04:32.680> a<00:04:32.710> constant<00:04:33.400> stream<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.729> coolant<00:04:34.539> or

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
you have a constant stream of coolant or

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.390 
you have a constant stream of coolant or
water<00:04:34.990> getting<00:04:35.470> into<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.770> piston<00:04:36.220> area

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
water getting into the piston area

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.999 
water getting into the piston area
that's<00:04:37.090> a<00:04:37.330> head<00:04:37.509> gasket<00:04:37.720> problem<00:04:38.319> another

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
that's a head gasket problem another

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.909 
that's a head gasket problem another
instance<00:04:39.669> is<00:04:39.849> sometimes<00:04:40.539> the<00:04:41.169> head<00:04:41.410> gasket

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
instance is sometimes the head gasket

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.510 
instance is sometimes the head gasket
breach<00:04:42.360> causes<00:04:43.360> water<00:04:43.690> and<00:04:44.080> oil<00:04:44.470> to<00:04:44.889> mix<00:04:45.190> and

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
breach causes water and oil to mix and

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.730 
breach causes water and oil to mix and
it<00:04:46.000> doesn't<00:04:46.389> get<00:04:46.569> over<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:47.259> piston<00:04:47.710> chamber

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
it doesn't get over the piston chamber

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.029 
it doesn't get over the piston chamber
and<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:48.970> get<00:04:49.210> water<00:04:49.479> in<00:04:49.810> your<00:04:50.110> oil<00:04:50.410> or<00:04:50.770> coolant

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
and you get water in your oil or coolant

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.460 
and you get water in your oil or coolant
in<00:04:51.400> your<00:04:51.550> oil<00:04:51.819> which<00:04:52.509> is<00:04:52.539> not<00:04:52.900> good<00:04:53.169> for<00:04:53.380> the

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
in your oil which is not good for the

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.409 
in your oil which is not good for the
moving<00:04:53.800> parts<00:04:54.190> of<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.400> motor<00:04:54.759> the<00:04:55.090> motor

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
moving parts of the motor the motor

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.700 
moving parts of the motor the motor
needs<00:04:55.630> oil<00:04:56.410> in<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:56.949> lot<00:04:57.130> of<00:04:57.160> parts<00:04:57.490> not<00:04:58.120> the

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
needs oil in a lot of parts not the

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.040 
needs oil in a lot of parts not the
diluted<00:04:59.710> down<00:04:59.979> oil<00:05:00.250> mixed<00:05:01.060> with<00:05:01.090> coolant<00:05:01.539> so

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
diluted down oil mixed with coolant so

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.870 
diluted down oil mixed with coolant so
that<00:05:02.199> will<00:05:02.349> cause<00:05:02.530> engine<00:05:03.159> wear<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:03.610> could

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
that will cause engine wear and could

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.309 
that will cause engine wear and could
cause<00:05:04.090> your<00:05:04.240> engine<00:05:04.389> to<00:05:04.569> lock<00:05:04.840> up<00:05:05.050> because

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319 
cause your engine to lock up because

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.920 
cause your engine to lock up because
it's<00:05:05.530> got<00:05:05.729> coolant<00:05:06.729> or<00:05:06.880> water<00:05:07.210> going<00:05:07.690> into

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
it's got coolant or water going into

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.740 
it's got coolant or water going into
passages<00:05:08.650> that<00:05:08.860> should<00:05:09.099> have<00:05:09.340> only<00:05:09.550> oil<00:05:10.060> so

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
passages that should have only oil so

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.529 
passages that should have only oil so
that<00:05:11.500> would<00:05:11.740> be<00:05:11.889> a<00:05:11.919> head<00:05:12.220> gasket<00:05:12.400> issue<00:05:12.849> the

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
that would be a head gasket issue the

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.249 
that would be a head gasket issue the
third<00:05:13.840> and<00:05:14.139> final<00:05:14.349> head<00:05:15.069> gasket<00:05:15.610> issue<00:05:15.849> is

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
third and final head gasket issue is

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:21.689 
third and final head gasket issue is
when<00:05:17.880> the<00:05:18.880> explosion<00:05:19.840> of<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.259> piston<00:05:20.800> causes

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
when the explosion of the piston causes

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.010 
when the explosion of the piston causes
that<00:05:21.880> in<00:05:22.120> combustion<00:05:23.020> air<00:05:23.490> to<00:05:24.490> slip<00:05:25.030> by<00:05:25.419> the

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
that in combustion air to slip by the

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.399 
that in combustion air to slip by the
head<00:05:26.289> gasket<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:27.069> slide<00:05:27.819> into<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.930> coolant

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
head gasket and slide into the coolant

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.890 
head gasket and slide into the coolant
chamber<00:05:29.830> when<00:05:30.520> you<00:05:30.669> have<00:05:30.909> that<00:05:31.180> movement<00:05:31.509> of

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
chamber when you have that movement of

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.820 
chamber when you have that movement of
the<00:05:32.199> compressed<00:05:32.710> air<00:05:32.860> getting<00:05:33.490> into<00:05:33.849> the

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
the compressed air getting into the

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.459 
the compressed air getting into the
coolant<00:05:35.830> chambers<00:05:36.310> it<00:05:36.550> will<00:05:37.120> force<00:05:37.539> coolant

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:38.469 
coolant chambers it will force coolant

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:41.790 
coolant chambers it will force coolant
out<00:05:38.620> of<00:05:38.889> the<00:05:39.370> motor<00:05:40.349> normally<00:05:41.349> through<00:05:41.680> the

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
out of the motor normally through the

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.040 
out of the motor normally through the
radiator<00:05:42.340> or<00:05:42.669> through<00:05:43.060> the<00:05:43.150> expansion<00:05:43.780> tank

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
radiator or through the expansion tank

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.480 
radiator or through the expansion tank
or<00:05:44.289> somewhere<00:05:44.830> and<00:05:45.599> your<00:05:46.599> motor<00:05:47.020> will<00:05:47.949> force

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
or somewhere and your motor will force

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.240 
or somewhere and your motor will force
the<00:05:48.909> water<00:05:49.120> out<00:05:49.479> somewhere<00:05:50.259> then<00:05:50.830> it<00:05:50.979> will<00:05:51.099> run

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
the water out somewhere then it will run

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.399 
the water out somewhere then it will run
out<00:05:51.460> of<00:05:51.490> water<00:05:51.789> then<00:05:52.389> it<00:05:52.509> will<00:05:52.599> overheat<00:05:53.169> and

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:53.409 
out of water then it will overheat and

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:55.709 
out of water then it will overheat and
crack<00:05:54.130> a<00:05:54.159> block<00:05:54.580> or<00:05:54.880> something<00:05:55.360> else<00:05:55.509> like

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:55.719 
crack a block or something else like

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:58.020 
crack a block or something else like
that<00:05:55.750> so<00:05:56.650> basically<00:05:56.949> there's<00:05:57.490> three<00:05:57.580> type<00:05:58.000> of

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
that so basically there's three type of

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.390 
that so basically there's three type of
head<00:05:58.300> gasket<00:05:58.719> issues<00:05:59.110> so<00:05:59.440> if<00:05:59.680> you're<00:06:00.219> not

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
head gasket issues so if you're not

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.540 
head gasket issues so if you're not
losing<00:06:00.819> all<00:06:00.969> your<00:06:01.150> coolant<00:06:01.509> somewhere<00:06:02.130> or<00:06:03.130> you

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
losing all your coolant somewhere or you

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.909 
losing all your coolant somewhere or you
don't<00:06:03.819> have<00:06:04.090> a<00:06:04.330> lot<00:06:04.900> of<00:06:04.930> white<00:06:05.229> smoke<00:06:05.409> coming

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
don't have a lot of white smoke coming

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.010 
don't have a lot of white smoke coming
out<00:06:06.039> to<00:06:06.190> tailpipe<00:06:06.699> after<00:06:07.240> the<00:06:07.360> cards<00:06:07.719> warmed

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
out to tailpipe after the cards warmed

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.159 
out to tailpipe after the cards warmed
up<00:06:08.199> or<00:06:09.190> you<00:06:09.430> don't<00:06:09.669> have<00:06:09.909> that<00:06:10.180> light

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
up or you don't have that light

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.240 
up or you don't have that light
chocolate<00:06:11.979> you<00:06:12.969> know<00:06:13.150> or<00:06:13.419> cream<00:06:14.289> coffee<00:06:14.770> look

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
chocolate you know or cream coffee look

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.909 
chocolate you know or cream coffee look
in<00:06:15.520> your<00:06:16.180> oil<00:06:16.419> you<00:06:16.960> probably<00:06:17.440> don't<00:06:17.710> have<00:06:17.800> a

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
in your oil you probably don't have a

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.459 
in your oil you probably don't have a
head<00:06:18.190> gasket<00:06:18.370> the<00:06:19.090> if<00:06:19.599> you're<00:06:19.870> real<00:06:20.080> concerned

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:20.469 
head gasket the if you're real concerned

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:22.050 
head gasket the if you're real concerned
about<00:06:20.590> the<00:06:20.889> stuff<00:06:21.130> on<00:06:21.340> the<00:06:21.430> dipstick<00:06:21.819> tube

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
about the stuff on the dipstick tube

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.570 
about the stuff on the dipstick tube
take<00:06:22.659> the<00:06:22.840> car<00:06:23.050> for<00:06:23.319> a<00:06:23.349> long<00:06:23.530> drive<00:06:23.860> maybe

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
take the car for a long drive maybe

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.850 
take the car for a long drive maybe
thirty<00:06:25.000> minutes<00:06:25.389> or<00:06:25.539> an<00:06:25.630> hour<00:06:25.750> then<00:06:26.440> check<00:06:26.740> the

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
thirty minutes or an hour then check the

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.520 
thirty minutes or an hour then check the
dipstick<00:06:27.069> see<00:06:27.550> how<00:06:27.729> it<00:06:27.789> looks<00:06:28.090> or<00:06:28.659> simply

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
dipstick see how it looks or simply

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.820 
dipstick see how it looks or simply
drain<00:06:29.949> the<00:06:30.310> oil<00:06:30.340> out<00:06:30.969> of<00:06:31.060> the<00:06:31.449> motor<00:06:31.750> into<00:06:32.680> an

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
drain the oil out of the motor into an

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.379 
drain the oil out of the motor into an
oil<00:06:33.069> pan<00:06:33.400> if<00:06:33.639> it's<00:06:34.210> nice<00:06:34.479> dark<00:06:35.139> black<00:06:35.740> oil<00:06:36.389> then

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:37.389 
oil pan if it's nice dark black oil then

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.129 
oil pan if it's nice dark black oil then
you're<00:06:37.599> fine<00:06:37.839> if<00:06:38.139> it's<00:06:38.830> light<00:06:39.190> like

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
you're fine if it's light like

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:42.709 
you're fine if it's light like
coffee<00:06:40.409> with<00:06:40.889> a<00:06:40.919> lot<00:06:41.280> of<00:06:41.430> cream<00:06:41.699> in<00:06:41.909> it<00:06:41.939> then

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:42.719 
coffee with a lot of cream in it then

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:45.529 
coffee with a lot of cream in it then
you<00:06:42.840> have<00:06:42.990> coolant<00:06:43.530> getting<00:06:44.159> into<00:06:44.490> your<00:06:44.699> boil

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
you have coolant getting into your boil

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.809 
you have coolant getting into your boil
so<00:06:45.960> that's<00:06:46.889> all<00:06:47.039> I<00:06:47.129> got<00:06:47.280> to<00:06:47.400> say<00:06:47.430> about<00:06:47.580> that

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 
so that's all I got to say about that

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:50.540 
so that's all I got to say about that
I'll<00:06:48.180> shoot<00:06:48.629> a<00:06:48.719> little<00:06:48.870> video<00:06:49.650> of<00:06:50.039> the<00:06:50.249> hit<00:06:50.430> in

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
I'll shoot a little video of the hit in
