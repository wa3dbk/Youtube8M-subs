cool<00:00:12.750> features<00:00:13.230> on<00:00:13.259> there<00:00:13.910> so<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.150> general

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
cool features on there so the general

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.970 
cool features on there so the general
consensus<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.230> at<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.250> moment<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:18.000> can't

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
consensus is that at the moment we can't

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.720 
consensus is that at the moment we can't
search<00:00:19.980> for<00:00:20.010> restaurants<00:00:20.570> businesses<00:00:21.570> or

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
search for restaurants businesses or

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.849 
search for restaurants businesses or
locations<00:00:23.730> using<00:00:24.510> Siri<00:00:25.050> because<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.710> has

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
locations using Siri because that has

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.759 
locations using Siri because that has
been<00:00:26.130> set<00:00:26.490> up<00:00:26.519> yet<00:00:26.779> well<00:00:27.779> I've<00:00:28.199> found<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.619> way

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
been set up yet well I've found a way

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.290 
been set up yet well I've found a way
around<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.849> probably<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
around that and this is probably the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.720 
around that and this is probably the
first<00:00:30.500> discovery<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> way<00:00:31.859> around<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.399> so

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
first discovery of the way around it so
