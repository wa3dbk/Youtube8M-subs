00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.580 

the<00:00:12.000> question<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.719> probably<00:00:12.990> more<00:00:13.139> related<00:00:13.559> to

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
the question is probably more related to

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.470 
the question is probably more related to
osteosarcoma<00:00:14.429> because<00:00:14.969> that's<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.269> one<00:00:15.389> that

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
osteosarcoma because that's the one that

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.420 
osteosarcoma because that's the one that
everybody<00:00:15.719> talks<00:00:16.020> about<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:17.310> know

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
everybody talks about and you know

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.769 
everybody talks about and you know
looking<00:00:17.880> at<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.480> data<00:00:19.460> subjectively<00:00:20.779> you

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
looking at the data subjectively you

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.509 
looking at the data subjectively you
know<00:00:21.869> there<00:00:22.170> did<00:00:22.410> seem<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.769> be<00:00:22.890> something<00:00:23.160> to

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
know there did seem to be something to

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.179 
know there did seem to be something to
it<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:24.140> you<00:00:25.140> know<00:00:25.230> some<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.619> these<00:00:25.740> guys<00:00:25.949> were

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
it that you know some of these guys were

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.859 
it that you know some of these guys were
going<00:00:26.369> six<00:00:27.000> seven<00:00:27.210> months<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.630> finally

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
going six seven months and finally

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.570 
going six seven months and finally
getting<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.199> annotation<00:00:28.710> right<00:00:28.980> afterwards

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
getting the annotation right afterwards

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.769 
getting the annotation right afterwards
within<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.849> month<00:00:30.090> or<00:00:30.179> two<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.599> now<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
within a month or two that now the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.370 
within a month or two that now the
cancer<00:00:31.320> spread<00:00:32.360> but<00:00:33.360> what<00:00:33.870> they<00:00:34.020> did<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.350> they

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
cancer spread but what they did is they

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.040 
cancer spread but what they did is they
get<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> small<00:00:35.040> pilot<00:00:36.000> study<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.750> think<00:00:36.960> it

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
get a small pilot study and I think it

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.479 
get a small pilot study and I think it
was<00:00:37.170> out<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.320> Colorado<00:00:37.590> State<00:00:38.129> I'm<00:00:38.250> not<00:00:38.370> really

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
was out of Colorado State I'm not really

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.910 
was out of Colorado State I'm not really
sure<00:00:38.610> who<00:00:38.940> did<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.469> they<00:00:40.469> only<00:00:40.590> looked<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
sure who did it they only looked in a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.250 
sure who did it they only looked in a
handful<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.399> dogs<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.910> leaves<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.180> 15<00:00:42.629> or<00:00:42.660> 20

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
handful of dogs it leaves like 15 or 20

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.920 
handful of dogs it leaves like 15 or 20
dogs<00:00:43.410> where<00:00:43.829> they<00:00:44.010> purposely<00:00:44.640> delayed<00:00:45.300> an

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
dogs where they purposely delayed an

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.520 
dogs where they purposely delayed an
amputation<00:00:46.440> which<00:00:47.219> has<00:00:47.430> its<00:00:47.700> kind<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.090> ethical

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
amputation which has its kind of ethical

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.069 
amputation which has its kind of ethical
issues<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.190> itself<00:00:50.780> because<00:00:51.780> you're

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
issues in it of itself because you're

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.049 
issues in it of itself because you're
purposely<00:00:52.739> denying<00:00:53.219> them<00:00:53.520> something<00:00:53.910> that's

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
purposely denying them something that's

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.700 
purposely denying them something that's
going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.270> fix<00:00:54.480> their<00:00:54.719> pain<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.590> you're

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
going to fix their pain and you're

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.650 
going to fix their pain and you're
risking<00:00:56.129> fracture<00:00:56.579> or<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.910> know<00:00:57.000> very<00:00:57.449> being

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
risking fracture or you know very being

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.590 
risking fracture or you know very being
acutely<00:00:58.140> horribly<00:00:58.980> uncomfortable<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.670> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
acutely horribly uncomfortable but the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.510 
acutely horribly uncomfortable but the
vacationer<00:01:01.350> they<00:01:01.469> did<00:01:01.649> were<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:02.010> early<00:01:02.340> things

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
vacationer they did were on early things

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.460 
vacationer they did were on early things
specifically<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.239> either<00:01:03.870> couldn't<00:01:04.290> afford

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
specifically that either couldn't afford

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.380 
specifically that either couldn't afford
or<00:01:04.710> didn't<00:01:04.920> want<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.309> amputation<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.270> they

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
or didn't want the amputation so they

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.570 
or didn't want the amputation so they
specifically<00:01:06.960> followed<00:01:07.380> those<00:01:07.500> guys<00:01:07.770> out<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
specifically followed those guys out and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.250 
specifically followed those guys out and
in<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.060> pilot<00:01:09.450> study<00:01:09.689> there<00:01:09.900> was<00:01:10.020> no

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
in that pilot study there was no

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.250 
in that pilot study there was no
difference<00:01:11.270> whether<00:01:12.270> they<00:01:12.600> delayed<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
difference whether they delayed the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.890 
difference whether they delayed the
amputation<00:01:14.010> or<00:01:14.189> did<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.939> didn't<00:01:15.630> seem<00:01:15.780> to

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
amputation or did in it didn't seem to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.969 
amputation or did in it didn't seem to
have<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> bearing<00:01:16.439> ponza<00:01:17.070> spread<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.780> know

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
have a bearing ponza spread but you know

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.770 
have a bearing ponza spread but you know
there<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> lot<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.520> talk<00:01:20.820> about<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.720> I

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
there is a lot of talk about it and I

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.260 
there is a lot of talk about it and I
don't<00:01:21.960> think<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.939> the<00:01:23.939> hundred

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
don't think that we have the hundred

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.300 
don't think that we have the hundred
percent<00:01:24.600> answer<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.530> certainly<00:01:25.830> based<00:01:26.130> on

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
percent answer but certainly based on

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.789 
percent answer but certainly based on
what<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.580> know<00:01:26.759> today<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:28.049> doesn't<00:01:28.320> seem<00:01:28.650> to

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
what we know today it doesn't seem to

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.760 
what we know today it doesn't seem to
hold<00:01:28.950> water

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
hold water

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.810 
hold water
you<00:01:31.770> know<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.100> certainly<00:01:32.250> hasn't<00:01:32.580> been

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
you know and it certainly hasn't been

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:41.690 
you know and it certainly hasn't been
our<00:01:32.970> experience<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:40.220> Colorado<00:01:41.220> right<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:41.520> is

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
our experience I Colorado right now is

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.899 
our experience I Colorado right now is
doing<00:01:42.350> research<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.649> high<00:01:44.369> intensity

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
doing research on high intensity

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.969 
doing research on high intensity
radiation<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.049> type<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.259> tumor<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.890> we

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
radiation for this type of tumor and we

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.320 
radiation for this type of tumor and we
said<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.280> they<00:01:47.399> don't<00:01:47.580> generally<00:01:47.729> respond

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
said that they don't generally respond

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.510 
said that they don't generally respond
to<00:01:48.420> radiation<00:01:48.930> well<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.950> might<00:01:50.159> not<00:01:50.190> be

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
to radiation well that might not be

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.300 
to radiation well that might not be
totally<00:01:50.789> true<00:01:51.330> because<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.409> call<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> places

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
totally true because I call a places

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.740 
totally true because I call a places
like<00:01:53.460> Colorado<00:01:53.610> they<00:01:54.149> can<00:01:54.299> do<00:01:54.420> what's<00:01:54.600> called

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
like Colorado they can do what's called

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.070 
like Colorado they can do what's called
stereotactic<00:01:55.500> radiation<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:57.810> know<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
stereotactic radiation and you know the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.190 
stereotactic radiation and you know the
thoughts<00:01:58.320> were<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.860> let's<00:01:59.250> give<00:01:59.460> them<00:02:00.200> pain

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
thoughts were is let's give them pain

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.840 
thoughts were is let's give them pain
alleviating<00:02:01.799> radiation<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.460> let's<00:02:02.580> do<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.759> in

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
alleviating radiation but let's do it in

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.969 
alleviating radiation but let's do it in
Windows<00:02:03.179> rather<00:02:03.509> than<00:02:03.750> them<00:02:04.080> coming<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.500> you

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
Windows rather than them coming in you

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.320 
Windows rather than them coming in you
know<00:02:05.009> once<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.460> week<00:02:05.550> for<00:02:05.670> four<00:02:05.819> weeks<00:02:05.880> kind<00:02:06.270> of

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
know once a week for four weeks kind of

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.529 
know once a week for four weeks kind of
thing<00:02:06.740> but<00:02:07.740> what<00:02:07.950> they<00:02:08.130> found<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:09.239> good

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
thing but what they found is that a good

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.090 
thing but what they found is that a good
percentage<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:10.140> those<00:02:10.259> dogs<00:02:10.590> something<00:02:10.979> like

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
percentage of those dogs something like

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.680 
percentage of those dogs something like
sixty<00:02:11.489> percent<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.970> mean<00:02:12.120> I'm<00:02:12.209> not<00:02:12.330> totally

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
sixty percent I mean I'm not totally

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.600 
sixty percent I mean I'm not totally
sure<00:02:12.959> on<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.560> exact<00:02:13.830> number<00:02:14.130> but<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.519> know

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
sure on the exact number but you know

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.729 
sure on the exact number but you know
more<00:02:15.330> than<00:02:15.480> half<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.870> dogs<00:02:16.110> were<00:02:16.319> making<00:02:16.620> it

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
more than half the dogs were making it

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.190 
more than half the dogs were making it
out<00:02:16.830> long-term<00:02:17.299> right<00:02:18.299> now<00:02:18.390> at<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.660> radiation

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
out long-term right now at the radiation

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.720 
out long-term right now at the radiation
should<00:02:19.410> probably<00:02:19.920> actually<00:02:20.069> read<00:02:20.549> that

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
should probably actually read that

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.640 
should probably actually read that
radical<00:02:21.360> new<00:02:21.510> wave<00:02:21.720> helping<00:02:22.170> control<00:02:22.380> the

radical new wave helping control the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.070 
radical new wave helping control the
cancer<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.400> what<00:02:23.880> those<00:02:24.060> animals<00:02:24.630> are<00:02:24.840> now

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
cancer and what those animals are now

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.559 
cancer and what those animals are now
losing<00:02:25.319> out<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:26.040> not<00:02:26.250> fracture<00:02:26.880> filet<00:02:27.209> or

way to completely leave late the pain

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.910 
way to completely leave late the pain
short<00:02:46.100> of<00:02:46.160> taking<00:02:46.400> leg<00:02:46.970> off<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.560> know<00:02:48.680> yes

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
short of taking leg off so you know yes

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.590 
short of taking leg off so you know yes
we<00:02:49.130> can<00:02:49.280> radiate<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.850> we<00:02:49.940> can<00:02:50.060> put<00:02:50.180> in<00:02:50.270> one<00:02:50.360> meds

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
we can radiate it we can put in one meds

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.120 
we can radiate it we can put in one meds
you<00:02:50.900> know<00:02:50.990> we<00:02:51.080> can<00:02:51.230> do<00:02:51.320> quite<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.680> few<00:02:51.800> things

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
you know we can do quite a few things

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.470 
you know we can do quite a few things
that<00:02:52.340> can<00:02:52.460> make<00:02:52.490> them<00:02:52.760> feel<00:02:52.970> pretty<00:02:53.270> darn<00:02:53.420> good

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
that can make them feel pretty darn good

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.050 
that can make them feel pretty darn good
but<00:02:54.410> there's<00:02:54.830> no<00:02:55.010> way<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.250> take<00:02:55.490> all<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:55.820> pain

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
but there's no way to take all that pain

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.640 
but there's no way to take all that pain
away<00:02:56.180> from<00:02:56.570> them<00:02:56.750> with<00:02:57.020> they<00:02:57.170> have<00:02:57.290> that<00:02:57.470> leg

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
away from them with they have that leg

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.520 
away from them with they have that leg
intact<00:02:58.100> so<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.420> know<00:02:59.540> what<00:02:59.750> you're<00:02:59.930> risking

intact so you know what you're risking

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.550 
intact so you know what you're risking
by<00:03:01.190> keeping<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.670> leg<00:03:01.850> intact<00:03:02.270> is<00:03:02.600> chronic

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
by keeping the leg intact is chronic

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.200 
by keeping the leg intact is chronic
pain<00:03:03.740> you<00:03:04.070> know<00:03:04.160> they're<00:03:04.340> uncomfortable<00:03:04.610> and

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
pain you know they're uncomfortable and

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.290 
pain you know they're uncomfortable and
we<00:03:05.450> can<00:03:05.600> fix<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:06.370> what<00:03:07.370> you're<00:03:07.520> also<00:03:07.700> risking

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
we can fix it what you're also risking

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.270 
we can fix it what you're also risking
is<00:03:08.480> yeah<00:03:08.750> right<00:03:09.080> luck<00:03:09.320> of<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.470> draw<00:03:09.620> they<00:03:10.040> step

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
is yeah right luck of the draw they step

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.100 
is yeah right luck of the draw they step
on<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:10.520> wrong<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:10.850> fractures<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:11.510> that's<00:03:11.810> as

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
on it wrong it fractures and that's as

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.340 
on it wrong it fractures and that's as
bad<00:03:12.320> as<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:12.710> gets<00:03:13.270> animals<00:03:14.270> the<00:03:14.960> other<00:03:15.110> aspect

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
bad as it gets animals the other aspect

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.770 
bad as it gets animals the other aspect
of<00:03:15.770> it<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:15.950> historically<00:03:16.640> one<00:03:17.570> of<00:03:17.690> the

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
of it is historically one of the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.450 
of it is historically one of the
thoughts<00:03:17.960> was<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.590> longer<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.010> cancer<00:03:19.400> is

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
thoughts was the longer the cancer is

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.040 
thoughts was the longer the cancer is
there<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.850> more<00:03:20.000> time<00:03:20.210> it<00:03:20.240> has<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.720> spread

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
there the more time it has to spread

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.920 
there the more time it has to spread
well<00:03:21.890> even<00:03:22.160> that's<00:03:22.460> being<00:03:22.850> challenged<00:03:23.540> lately

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
well even that's being challenged lately

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.820 
well even that's being challenged lately
and<00:03:24.410> it<00:03:24.950> may<00:03:25.220> be<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:26.750> case<00:03:26.990> that<00:03:27.320> if<00:03:27.650> the

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
and it may be the case that if the

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.350 
and it may be the case that if the
cancer<00:03:28.070> is<00:03:28.190> going<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.490> spread<00:03:28.670> by<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.090> time

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
cancer is going to spread by the time

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.270 
cancer is going to spread by the time
they<00:03:29.480> diagnose<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:29.930> already<00:03:30.530> has<00:03:30.710> and<00:03:31.100> it<00:03:31.160> may

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
they diagnose it already has and it may

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.100 
they diagnose it already has and it may
not<00:03:31.430> necessarily<00:03:31.580> have<00:03:32.000> anything<00:03:32.240> to<00:03:32.870> do<00:03:32.990> with

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
not necessarily have anything to do with

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.190 
not necessarily have anything to do with
the<00:03:33.200> time<00:03:33.410> that<00:03:33.770> the<00:03:33.980> primary<00:03:34.340> tumors<00:03:34.910> there

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
the time that the primary tumors there

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.710 
the time that the primary tumors there
nobody<00:03:36.200> knows<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.800> that's<00:03:37.340> why<00:03:37.630> medicine<00:03:38.630> is

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
nobody knows and that's why medicine is

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.650 
nobody knows and that's why medicine is
really<00:03:39.260> interesting<00:03:39.860> and<00:03:40.280> challenging<00:03:41.120> just

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
really interesting and challenging just

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.690 
really interesting and challenging just
because<00:03:42.100> right<00:03:43.100> when<00:03:43.130> we<00:03:43.370> think<00:03:43.550> we

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
because right when we think we

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.699 
because right when we think we
understand<00:03:44.180> okay<00:03:44.900> this<00:03:45.080> is<00:03:45.200> how<00:03:45.320> it<00:03:45.500> worked

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
understand okay this is how it worked

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.350 
understand okay this is how it worked
this<00:03:45.860> out<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.310> weight<00:03:46.520> cantor's<00:03:47.000> behaved

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
this out the weight cantor's behaved

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.510 
this out the weight cantor's behaved
over<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:47.870> last<00:03:48.020> 10<00:03:48.290> years<00:03:48.560> all<00:03:49.250> of<00:03:49.430> a<00:03:49.489> sudden

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
over the last 10 years all of a sudden

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.370 
over the last 10 years all of a sudden
somebody<00:03:50.150> asked<00:03:50.360> a<00:03:50.420> different<00:03:50.540> question<00:03:50.780> and

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
somebody asked a different question and

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.970 
somebody asked a different question and
it's<00:03:51.470> like<00:03:51.560> whoa

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.040
