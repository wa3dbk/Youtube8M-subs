will be what's called building technique
and<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:42.000> build<00:02:42.180> technique<00:02:42.810> what<00:02:43.110> that

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
and to build technique what that

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.860 
and to build technique what that
generally<00:02:43.830> means<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.420> actual

exercises that is goal number one goal
number<00:03:04.500> two<00:03:04.680> would<00:03:05.489> be<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.819> develop<00:03:06.120> playing

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
number two would be to develop playing

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.949 
number two would be to develop playing
by<00:03:07.019> ear<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.620> playing<00:03:08.459> by<00:03:08.700> ear<00:03:08.959> basically

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
by ear and playing by ear basically

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.289 
by ear and playing by ear basically
allows<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.680> hear<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:10.980> piece<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.549> to<00:03:12.120> learn

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
allows you to hear a piece and to learn

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.110 
allows you to hear a piece and to learn
how<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.630> play<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:13.079> quickly<00:03:13.380> goal<00:03:14.310> number<00:03:14.340> three

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
how to play it quickly goal number three

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.470 
how to play it quickly goal number three
is<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.870> understand<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:17.340> deven<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:17.970> develop

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
is to understand to deven to develop

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.009 
is to understand to deven to develop
chords<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.200> patterns<00:03:19.980> on<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.609> piano<00:03:20.989> you<00:03:21.989> can

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
chords and patterns on the piano you can

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.960 
chords and patterns on the piano you can
think<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.620> chords<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.220> patterns<00:03:23.730> as

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
think of chords and patterns as

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.900 
think of chords and patterns as
basically<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.959> building<00:03:25.470> blocks<00:03:25.829> of<00:03:26.130> music

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
basically the building blocks of music

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.199 
basically the building blocks of music
all<00:03:27.090> music<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.930> built<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.530> based<00:03:28.889> on<00:03:29.209> chords

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
all music is built and based on chords

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.050 
all music is built and based on chords
and<00:03:30.420> patterns<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:31.920> if<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.579> ability

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
and patterns so if you have the ability

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.180 
and patterns so if you have the ability
to<00:03:33.090> manipulate<00:03:33.569> chords<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.799> play<00:03:35.010> with

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
to manipulate chords and to play with

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.670 
to manipulate chords and to play with
chords<00:03:35.579> properly<00:03:36.209> you'll<00:03:36.870> be<00:03:37.109> able<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.530> play

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
chords properly you'll be able to play

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.360 
chords properly you'll be able to play
anything<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:39.660> fourth<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.739> fourth<00:03:40.980> goal

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
anything and the fourth the fourth goal

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.780 
anything and the fourth the fourth goal
is<00:03:41.639> to<00:03:42.090> be<00:03:42.209> able<00:03:42.359> to<00:03:42.630> read<00:03:42.930> music<00:03:43.440> well<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:44.100> to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
is to be able to read music well and to

is to be able to read music well and to
be<00:03:44.910> able<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.269> improvise<00:03:45.720> on<00:03:46.290> those<00:03:47.100> chords

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
be able to improvise on those chords

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.599 
be able to improvise on those chords
that<00:03:47.639> we<00:03:47.700> discussed<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.389> stage<00:03:48.690> three<00:03:49.459> we<00:03:50.459> are

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
that we discussed in stage three we are

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.789 
that we discussed in stage three we are
going<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.819> develop<00:03:51.060> these<00:03:51.420> goals<00:03:51.840> all<00:03:52.170> at<00:03:52.650> the

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
going to develop these goals all at the

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.420 
going to develop these goals all at the
same<00:03:53.040> time<00:03:53.420> now<00:03:54.420> most<00:03:54.989> of<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.470> levels<00:03:55.650> there

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
same time now most of the levels there

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.059 
same time now most of the levels there
will<00:03:56.579> be<00:03:56.760> some<00:03:57.030> theory<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.690> some<00:03:58.380> playing<00:03:58.709> and

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
will be some theory and some playing and

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.120 
will be some theory and some playing and
so<00:03:59.970> all<00:04:00.209> that<00:04:00.540> is<00:04:00.690> needed<00:04:00.930> for<00:04:01.380> this<00:04:01.620> program

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
so all that is needed for this program

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.000 
so all that is needed for this program
is<00:04:02.340> going<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:03.030> be<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.180> regular<00:04:03.389> piano<00:04:03.930> or<00:04:04.290> just<00:04:04.889> a

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
is going to be a regular piano or just a

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.089 
is going to be a regular piano or just a
piano<00:04:05.190> keyboard<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:06.120> then<00:04:06.870> 15<00:04:07.440> minutes<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:07.920> day

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
piano keyboard and then 15 minutes a day

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.400 
piano keyboard and then 15 minutes a day
of<00:04:08.250> your<00:04:08.400> time<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.090> if<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:09.599> can't<00:04:09.870> make<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.109> day

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
of your time and if you can't make a day

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.229 
of your time and if you can't make a day
that's<00:04:10.709> perfectly<00:04:11.190> fine<00:04:11.280> you<00:04:11.579> just<00:04:11.760> do<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.209> the

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
that's perfectly fine you just do it the

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.390 
that's perfectly fine you just do it the
next<00:04:12.480> day<00:04:12.720> so<00:04:13.530> we'll<00:04:13.739> go<00:04:13.889> through<00:04:13.919> it<00:04:14.220> and

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
next day so we'll go through it and

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.009 
next day so we'll go through it and
you'll<00:04:14.519> be<00:04:14.639> able<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.970> through<00:04:15.419> this<00:04:15.569> program

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
you'll be able to through this program

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.199 
you'll be able to through this program
be<00:04:16.229> able<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.590> go<00:04:17.130> over<00:04:17.430> lessons<00:04:17.849> again<00:04:18.150> and

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
be able to go over lessons again and

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.580 
be able to go over lessons again and
again<00:04:18.419> if<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:18.930> wish<00:04:19.079> if<00:04:19.260> you've<00:04:19.410> missed
