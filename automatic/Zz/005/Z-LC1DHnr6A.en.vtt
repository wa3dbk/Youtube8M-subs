up the spark arrestor you see just pull
it<00:00:16.980> out<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:18.860> it's<00:00:19.860> significantly<00:00:20.610> louder<00:00:20.820> I

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
it out and it's significantly louder I

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.830 
it out and it's significantly louder I
wouldn't<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.520> it<00:00:23.550> though<00:00:23.760> like<00:00:24.060> I'm<00:00:24.510> gonna<00:00:24.690> put

wouldn't do it though like I'm gonna put
it<00:00:24.930> back<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.230> after<00:00:26.000> because<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.029> seems<00:00:27.330> that

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
kind of I don't know stalls but I don't

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.549 
kind of I don't know stalls but I don't
want<00:00:34.140> anything<00:00:34.290> bad<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.559> come<00:00:34.860> from<00:00:35.129> this<00:00:35.790> so

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
I'm just going to do it the purpose of

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.889 
I'm just going to do it the purpose of

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
this video so yeah alright so this is

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:57.030 
this video so yeah alright so this is
what<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.079> looks<00:00:46.230> like<00:00:47.090> come<00:00:48.090> into<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.329> shop

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:12.480 

put<00:00:58.040> this<00:01:00.640> screws<00:01:06.190> so<00:01:10.930> you're<00:01:11.930> taking<00:01:12.290> it<00:01:12.380> off

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
put this screws so you're taking it off

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.920 
put this screws so you're taking it off
it's<00:01:13.490> really<00:01:13.550> hard<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:13.970> get<00:01:14.060> out<00:01:14.210> because<00:01:14.780> the

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
it's really hard to get out because the

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.600 
it's really hard to get out because the
little<00:01:15.200> fins<00:01:15.410> at<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.620> end<00:01:15.770> it's<00:01:16.370> what<00:01:16.490> you

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
little fins at the end it's what you

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.050 
little fins at the end it's what you
need<00:01:16.760> to<00:01:16.850> do<00:01:17.000> is<00:01:19.210> lift<00:01:20.260> this<00:01:21.260> whole<00:01:21.530> thing<00:01:22.060> we

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
need to do is lift this whole thing we

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.080 
need to do is lift this whole thing we
can<00:01:23.210> pull<00:01:23.420> it<00:01:23.510> up<00:01:23.630> like<00:01:23.930> that<00:01:25.000> because<00:01:26.000> the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
can pull it up like that because the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:02:12.700 
can pull it up like that because the
fins<00:01:26.330> will<00:01:26.450> get<00:01:26.540> stuck<00:01:26.810> back<00:01:27.320> in<00:01:27.380> there

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.550 

but<00:02:13.710> as<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.100> can<00:02:14.250> see<00:02:14.310> if<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:15.140> go<00:02:16.140> right<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.470> the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
but as you can see if I go right to the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:25.950 
but as you can see if I go right to the
bar

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.740 

so<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:27.040> don't<00:02:27.760> think<00:02:27.910> it's<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.360> best<00:02:28.510> thing<00:02:28.630> to

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
so I don't think it's the best thing to

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.820 
so I don't think it's the best thing to
have<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.050> over<00:02:29.170> but<00:02:31.050> there's<00:02:32.050> also<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.530> piece

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
have it over but there's also this piece

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.059 
have it over but there's also this piece
here<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.370> just<00:02:34.030> found<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.720> on<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.350> gravel

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
here I just found it on the gravel

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.540 
here I just found it on the gravel
outside<00:02:37.110> there<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.890> it's<00:02:39.610> two<00:02:40.180> pieces<00:02:41.550> very

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
outside there and it's two pieces very

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.910 
outside there and it's two pieces very
thin<00:02:43.000> metal<00:02:43.320> so<00:02:44.320> you<00:02:44.350> want<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.590> be<00:02:44.650> very

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
thin metal so you want to be very

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.230 
thin metal so you want to be very
careful<00:02:45.370> with<00:02:45.430> this<00:02:45.820> if<00:02:45.910> you're<00:02:46.000> taking

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
careful with this if you're taking

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:59.850 
careful with this if you're taking
this<00:02:46.300> apart<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.880> goes<00:02:50.010> right<00:02:58.739> so<00:02:59.739> I'm<00:02:59.830> just

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
this apart and it goes right so I'm just

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.640 
this apart and it goes right so I'm just
going<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.100> leave<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.280> like<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:01.170> where<00:03:02.170> where

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
going to leave it like that where where

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.550 
going to leave it like that where where
it<00:03:02.709> was<00:03:02.860> so<00:03:03.820> don't<00:03:04.000> lose<00:03:04.090> it

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
it was so don't lose it

00:03:04.560 --> 00:04:19.680 
it was so don't lose it
cuz<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:05.620> didn't<00:03:05.800> even<00:03:05.890> know<00:03:06.070> it<00:03:06.130> was<00:03:06.190> there

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.159 

nice<00:04:20.720> I<00:04:21.730> don't<00:04:22.730> refer<00:04:22.940> my<00:04:23.090> tires<00:04:23.330> off<00:04:23.600> so<00:04:23.870> just

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
nice I don't refer my tires off so just

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.610 
nice I don't refer my tires off so just
a<00:04:25.130> little<00:04:25.190> Burnett

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
a little Burnett

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.180 
a little Burnett
noticed<00:04:27.620> an<00:04:27.800> increase<00:04:28.400> in<00:04:28.580> ad<00:04:28.760> power<00:04:29.200> like<00:04:30.200> was

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
noticed an increase in ad power like was

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.680 
noticed an increase in ad power like was
with<00:04:31.400> my<00:04:31.580> bike<00:04:32.260> but<00:04:34.210> there<00:04:35.210> was<00:04:35.330> a<00:04:35.360> bit<00:04:35.540> of<00:04:35.630> a

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
with my bike but there was a bit of a

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.570 
with my bike but there was a bit of a
decrease<00:04:36.080> I<00:04:36.320> think<00:04:36.590> an<00:04:36.889> acceleration<00:04:37.690> so<00:04:38.690> the

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
decrease I think an acceleration so the

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.830 
decrease I think an acceleration so the
acceleration<00:04:40.580> was<00:04:41.150> I<00:04:41.270> think<00:04:41.480> hit<00:04:41.600> a<00:04:41.630> bit

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
acceleration was I think hit a bit

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.140 
acceleration was I think hit a bit
because<00:04:42.620> I<00:04:42.770> didn't<00:04:42.950> notice<00:04:43.220> that<00:04:43.250> it<00:04:43.730> lagged

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
because I didn't notice that it lagged

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.500 
because I didn't notice that it lagged
when<00:04:44.450> I<00:04:44.510> put<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.169> throttle<00:04:45.350> to<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.560> bar<00:04:46.060> so<00:04:47.060> I

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
when I put the throttle to the bar so I

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.420 
when I put the throttle to the bar so I
guess<00:04:48.169> if<00:04:48.500> you're<00:04:48.620> going<00:04:48.710> to<00:04:48.830> do<00:04:48.980> this<00:04:49.130> you

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
guess if you're going to do this you

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.560 
guess if you're going to do this you
won't<00:04:49.550> love<00:04:49.730> bike<00:04:50.000> and<00:04:50.300> get<00:04:50.450> a<00:04:50.530> mbrp<00:04:51.530> silencer

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
won't love bike and get a mbrp silencer

00:04:52.570 --> 00:05:00.220 
won't love bike and get a mbrp silencer
which<00:04:53.570> is<00:04:53.720> what<00:04:53.900> I'll<00:04:53.990> do<00:04:54.169> a<00:04:58.960> camera<00:04:59.960> first

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
which is what I'll do a camera first

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.700 
which is what I'll do a camera first
