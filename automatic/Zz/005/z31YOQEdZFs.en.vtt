00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.000
 hello guys how good today I come to 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.100
 see them a little bit about games are worth the 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.310
 I'm thinking about the games 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.260
 that I am going to buy from always 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:31.990
 as new games start coming out and 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.320
 well first of all I have the black ops 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.600
 which is a game that I did not know if I was going to 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.640
 get a lot of attention before seeing 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.790
 the trailers and some people's gameplay 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.200
 that has gone up and now I have many 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.050
 I always feel the same when I 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.940
 they came out as I say with me well I do not know 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.230
 I do not know if I liked it I do not know if such 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.629
 because I'm very hooked to the 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.730
 previous and then at the end I'm with the 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.199
 hot always waiting for it to come out 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.390
 The truth is that I did not expect 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.390
 it was a game that I was going to like 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.840
 many things that I had heard but that 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.680
 watch them the videos that are hanging by 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.030
 internet and others 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.060
 and it has caught my attention 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.860
 I think I'm going to like it enough 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.400
 like to go buy better first day 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.030
 like crazy and I do not know if you guys 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.830
 you buy me of course yes 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.619
 to people who ask me if I 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.880
 I will buy for xbox or ps3 because I think that 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.270
 in principle I'm going to buy it for 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.130
 ps3 which is what I use the most but not 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.430
 I discard anything to buy it for 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.100
 xbox so that when we play all 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.430
 together so I can play also in this 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.910
 video game console 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.800
 what do you think the soft edge I played 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.140
 the first one and I loved it and the truth is 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.510
 that I have enough desire to that game 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.280
 I do not know what you think, I hope that I 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.890
 go jce saying your yours 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.560
 opinions and your little things is worth another 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.030
 existential doubt that I have is the cifa 13 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.440
 that my friends of the clan of this edition 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.240
 I had the film complete to buy you the 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.330
 end under patera prosthesis up close I do not know 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.140
 what the truth is that at 12 it is given 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.500
 pretty good but I have to say it 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.030
 I've played with them but it's not a game 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.850
 that I got hooked like the shooter though 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.430
 I love football is the sport 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.540
 what I like most and I'm super fanatical 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.830
 of soccer 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.180
 I leave you with the doubt of which team I am and 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.800
 good but it's not the same to see it 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.780
 play it not and it's also that they get caught 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.400
 some pisses so great that I say 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.890
 why am I going to play these rest and 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.410
 we're going to end up hitting I do not go out and 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.140
 I always but I say love and 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.150
 peace and goodness and then I get 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.400
 like crazy, you will tell me 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.939
 what I really love are the eggs 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.189
 of fight go go fabric yes I already know the 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:55.799
 fighting games that I vent a lot 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.030
 with them and I have in mind the tec 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.490
 intact 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.620
 than the previous ones that is that played 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.569
 the truth is that it hooks you very much 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.780
 I get very angry they have also flown 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.550
 controls and those things for with my 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.680
 room every time they have played but 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.680
 but they are games that entertain me 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.750
 bunch and that I like I do not know about it 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.870
 what do you think about you recommend me games 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.739
 of hosts as I say that I love 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.280
 and we'll see, it's worth it now 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.160
 I have to tell you that I bought a 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.470
 super computer cucumber 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.250
 I bought myself a lot better than the 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.860
 I had I'm super happy guys 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.780
 to edit videos to render more 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.580
 fast has a good super processor 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.830
 the fact is that it is a spaceship 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.310
 I'm very happy and it's hard for me to play 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.310
 games 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.570

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.130
 battlefield to grow is an authentic 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.830
 last you can not imagine that 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.780
 graphics that good definition is 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.580
 incredible voucher they are not paying me for 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.890
 do this is what providers that I 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.610
 I was amazed at the difference there 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:12.090
 between playing it on a video game console 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.680
 and playing it in started is amazing the 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.450
 truth is quite cost me to 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.880
 principle by the keyboard and the mouse already 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.959
 I'm not playing a lot of pc games 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:25.020
 although I have not played for a while 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.330
 much I said enough to the devil 2 not 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.520
 I know if you know him it was a season 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:36.099
 also at the age of empires 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.099
 some of you will know what I'm talking about 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:44.550
 and good now when the devil came out 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:47.580
 I bought it also and what happens 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.460
 coincided with my entry into 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.990
 YouTube and the truth is that it is not 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.730
 I have played that game all that I have 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.580

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:00.129
