if

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.830 

a<00:02:42.599> scroll<00:02:43.409> page<00:02:44.480> method<00:02:45.480> which<00:02:45.659> seems<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:47.840> well

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
a scroll page method which seems to well

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.320 
a scroll page method which seems to well
make<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.709> look<00:02:49.950> continues<00:02:50.519> I'm<00:02:50.730> not<00:02:51.180> too

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
make it look continues I'm not too

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.830 
make it look continues I'm not too
convinced<00:02:51.569> of<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:55.129> and<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:57.360> thumbnail

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
convinced of that and the thumbnail

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:17.720 
convinced of that and the thumbnail
overview<00:02:58.500> which<00:02:59.000> looks<00:03:00.000> quite<00:03:00.269> nice

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.840 

ok

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.220 

let's<00:03:22.540> go<00:03:22.840> back<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.560> single<00:03:24.360> page<00:03:25.360> and<00:03:26.050> I

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
let's go back to the single page and I

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.320 
let's go back to the single page and I
think<00:03:26.470> there's<00:03:26.710> one<00:03:26.980> more<00:03:27.340> section<00:03:27.640> left<00:03:28.000> the

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
think there's one more section left the

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:35.640 
think there's one more section left the
tools<00:03:32.070> which<00:03:33.070> is<00:03:33.370> a<00:03:33.610> slide<00:03:33.910> show<00:03:34.210> as<00:03:34.510> well<00:03:34.780> you

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
tools which is a slide show as well you

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.760 
tools which is a slide show as well you
can<00:03:35.890> go<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:36.880> a<00:03:37.030> page<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:37.900> if<00:03:38.050> it's<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.320> comic<00:03:38.620> book

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
can go to a page so if it's a comic book

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.030 
can go to a page so if it's a comic book
I<00:03:38.890> think<00:03:39.100> that<00:03:39.280> would<00:03:39.430> work<00:03:39.460> and<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:41.680> can<00:03:41.860> also

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
I think that would work and you can also

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.240 
I think that would work and you can also
set<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.580> boot<00:03:42.940> splash<00:03:43.630> screen<00:03:44.190> from<00:03:45.190> the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
set the boot splash screen from the

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.970 
set the boot splash screen from the
image<00:03:45.610> browser<00:03:45.880> I<00:03:46.420> think<00:03:47.290> that's<00:03:47.500> pretty<00:03:47.770> much

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
image browser I think that's pretty much

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.150 
image browser I think that's pretty much
it<00:03:48.040> thank<00:03:48.970> you
