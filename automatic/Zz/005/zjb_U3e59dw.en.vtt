were a predator trying to eat them they
will<00:02:44.430> produce<00:02:44.639> this<00:02:44.910> substance<00:02:45.299> it's

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
will produce this substance it's

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.390 
will produce this substance it's
extremely<00:02:46.410> poisonous<00:02:46.560> it's<00:02:47.010> full<00:02:47.250> of

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
something called Bufo toxins and they're

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.220 
something called Bufo toxins and they're
special<00:02:50.579> to<00:02:50.880> choads<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.450> they're<00:02:51.660> really

Schwartz cough has been working on a new
trap<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.849> specifically<00:03:00.450> targets

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
trap that specifically targets

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.229 
trap that specifically targets
reproductive<00:03:01.709> females<00:03:01.919> and<00:03:02.730> increases<00:03:03.209> a

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
reproductive females and increases a

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.589 
reproductive females and increases a
capture<00:03:03.720> rate<00:03:03.870> by<00:03:04.230> up<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.500> 300%<00:03:05.329> what<00:03:06.329> it<00:03:06.450> does

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
capture rate by up to 300% what it does

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.330 
capture rate by up to 300% what it does
is<00:03:06.780> two<00:03:06.930> things<00:03:07.079> it<00:03:07.260> has<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.470> light<00:03:07.739> on<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.130> side

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
is two things it has a light on the side

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.069 
is two things it has a light on the side
of<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.579> which<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.819> can<00:03:08.940> see<00:03:09.150> here<00:03:09.389> and<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.840> call

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
of it which you can see here and a call

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.900 
of it which you can see here and a call
which<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.799> hear<00:03:11.040> right<00:03:11.459> now

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
which you can hear right now

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.599 
which you can hear right now
the<00:03:12.419> light<00:03:12.630> attracts<00:03:13.079> insects<00:03:13.590> which<00:03:14.069> is<00:03:14.280> food

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
the light attracts insects which is food

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.370 
the light attracts insects which is food
for<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.849> toads<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.810> attracts<00:03:16.139> both

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
for the toads and that attracts both

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.620 
for the toads and that attracts both
males<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.859> females<00:03:16.950> into<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.700> traps<00:03:17.940> the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
males and females into the traps the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.839 
males and females into the traps the
innovative<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.620> new<00:03:19.799> part<00:03:20.099> of<00:03:20.160> this<00:03:20.280> trap<00:03:20.579> is

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
innovative and new part of this trap is

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.420 
innovative and new part of this trap is
that<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:21.450> also<00:03:21.660> produces<00:03:22.290> sound<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.190> has

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
that it also produces sound so this has

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.640 
that it also produces sound so this has
speakers<00:03:23.849> on<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.389> the<00:03:24.810> speaker's<00:03:25.200> produce

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
speakers on it and the speaker's produce

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.920 
speakers on it and the speaker's produce
a<00:03:25.919> call<00:03:26.250> but<00:03:26.669> male<00:03:26.879> toads<00:03:27.239> make<00:03:27.419> to<00:03:27.660> attract

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
a call but male toads make to attract

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.020 
a call but male toads make to attract
females<00:03:28.319> into<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.799> trap<00:03:29.010> so<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.220> we<00:03:29.459> capture

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
females into the trap so that we capture

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.150 
females into the trap so that we capture
females<00:03:30.720> with<00:03:30.959> eggs<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.440> remove<00:03:31.889> them<00:03:32.070> from

eggs female in fib Ian's in general are

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.370 
eggs female in fib Ian's in general are
quite<00:03:35.549> choosy

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
quite choosy

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.900 
quite choosy
they<00:03:36.500> don't<00:03:36.710> like<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.070> call<00:03:37.220> of<00:03:37.370> any<00:03:37.520> old<00:03:37.670> male

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910

they like the call to be sort of

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:47.040 
they like the call to be sort of
deep-voiced<00:03:44.980> it's<00:03:45.980> really<00:03:46.190> like<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.370> bit<00:03:46.550> of<00:03:46.580> a

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
deep-voiced it's really like a bit of a

so<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.780> toads<00:04:06.050> were<00:04:06.380> originally<00:04:06.740> introduced

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
so the toads were originally introduced

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.500 
so the toads were originally introduced
the<00:04:07.250> Queensland<00:04:07.760> but<00:04:08.030> then<00:04:08.180> over<00:04:08.360> time

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
the Queensland but then over time

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.360 
the Queensland but then over time
they've<00:04:09.110> steadily<00:04:09.620> moved<00:04:09.860> and<00:04:10.070> they've<00:04:10.190> moved

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
they've steadily moved and they've moved

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.950 
they've steadily moved and they've moved
through<00:04:10.730> into<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.090> Northern<00:04:11.390> Territory<00:04:11.570> and

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
through into the Northern Territory and

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.480 
through into the Northern Territory and
now<00:04:12.080> they're<00:04:12.260> even<00:04:12.530> starting<00:04:12.740> to<00:04:12.950> get<00:04:13.220> through

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
now they're even starting to get through

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.310 
now they're even starting to get through
into<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.850> board<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.180> Western<00:04:14.510> Australia<00:04:14.960> the

into the board of Western Australia the

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.560 
into the board of Western Australia the
reality<00:04:15.770> is<00:04:15.920> there's<00:04:16.190> basically<00:04:16.340> an<00:04:16.970> army<00:04:17.450> of

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570

reality is there's basically an army of
200<00:04:18.530> million<00:04:18.830> of<00:04:19.130> these<00:04:19.280> little<00:04:19.420> amphibians

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
200 million of these little amphibians

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.660 
200 million of these little amphibians
out<00:04:20.930> there<00:04:21.230> in<00:04:21.380> our<00:04:21.500> environment<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:22.400> the

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
out there in our environment that the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.610 
out there in our environment that the
Navy<00:04:22.880> Wildlife<00:04:23.360> see<00:04:23.630> as<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:23.930> little<00:04:24.110> bags<00:04:24.380> of

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
Navy Wildlife see as a little bags of

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.920 
Navy Wildlife see as a little bags of
food<00:04:24.830> all<00:04:25.520> it<00:04:25.700> takes<00:04:25.940> is<00:04:26.090> for<00:04:26.120> them<00:04:26.390> to<00:04:26.540> eat<00:04:26.690> one

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.330 
food all it takes is for them to eat one
of<00:04:26.960> these<00:04:27.170> and<00:04:27.410> they<00:04:27.500> can<00:04:27.530> die<00:04:27.830> so<00:04:28.190> they're

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
of these and they can die so they're

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.040 
of these and they can die so they're
really<00:04:28.460> having<00:04:28.820> a<00:04:28.880> devastating<00:04:29.240> effect<00:04:29.630> on

is<00:06:15.240> n<00:06:15.419> Finian's<00:06:15.839> we<00:06:16.199> do<00:06:16.379> find<00:06:16.709> that<00:06:17.029> cane<00:06:18.029> toads

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:18.329 
is n Finian's we do find that cane toads

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:20.569 
is n Finian's we do find that cane toads
are<00:06:18.569> a<00:06:18.959> problem<00:06:19.439> for<00:06:19.649> us<00:06:19.709> throwing<00:06:20.009> crocodiles

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:20.579 
are a problem for us throwing crocodiles

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:22.549 
are a problem for us throwing crocodiles
and<00:06:20.789> also<00:06:21.149> freshwater<00:06:21.719> crocodiles<00:06:22.229> which<00:06:22.439> is
