00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
I am this is a really dumb paintball map

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.319 
I am this is a really dumb paintball map
where<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> think<00:00:50.850> you're<00:00:50.940> supposed<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.180> like

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
where I think you're supposed to like

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:07.670 
where I think you're supposed to like
capture<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> flag<00:00:51.989> or<00:00:52.260> something<00:00:52.559> I<00:01:06.590> don't<00:01:07.590> know

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
capture a flag or something I don't know

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.010 
capture a flag or something I don't know
the<00:01:07.830> textures<00:01:08.640> aren't<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.270> bad<00:01:09.479> looking<00:01:09.869> I

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
the textures aren't that bad looking I

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.060 
the textures aren't that bad looking I
guess<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:11.450> suppose<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.750> not<00:01:13.500> much<00:01:13.860> better

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070
