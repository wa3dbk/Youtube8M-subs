a<00:04:50.070> last<00:04:50.310> road<00:04:50.550> to<00:04:50.669> go<00:04:50.790> down<00:04:50.970> because<00:04:51.210> it<00:04:51.389> takes

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
a last road to go down because it takes

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.050 
a last road to go down because it takes
away<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:51.960> enjoyment<00:04:52.380> you<00:04:52.440> you<00:04:53.100> painting<00:04:53.910> to

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
away the enjoyment you you painting to

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.270 
away the enjoyment you you painting to
to<00:04:54.510> a<00:04:54.540> deadline<00:04:55.020> you're<00:04:55.229> painting<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:55.950> a<00:04:55.979> goal

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
to a deadline you're painting to a goal

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.520 
to a deadline you're painting to a goal
you're<00:04:56.760> painting<00:04:57.360> to<00:04:57.570> win<00:04:57.810> trophies<00:04:58.139> and

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
you're painting to win trophies and

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.620 
you're painting to win trophies and
what-have-you<00:04:58.950> and<00:04:59.130> it<00:04:59.610> changes<00:05:00.540> your

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
what-have-you and it changes your

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.930 
what-have-you and it changes your
mentality<00:05:00.990> as<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.380> painter<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:01.979> I<00:05:02.550> found

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
mentality as a painter and I found

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.180 
mentality as a painter and I found
certainly<00:05:03.389> that<00:05:03.540> it<00:05:03.870> doesn't<00:05:04.740> take<00:05:04.830> all<00:05:05.040> the

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
certainly that it doesn't take all the

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.620 
certainly that it doesn't take all the
enjoyment<00:05:05.400> away<00:05:05.700> but<00:05:05.910> it<00:05:05.970> certainly<00:05:06.150> takes<00:05:06.539> a

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
enjoyment away but it certainly takes a

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.020 
enjoyment away but it certainly takes a
big<00:05:07.200> chunk<00:05:07.229> learn<00:05:07.620> enjoyment<00:05:08.039> away<00:05:08.190> let's<00:05:08.880> say

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
big chunk learn enjoyment away let's say

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.390 
big chunk learn enjoyment away let's say
they<00:05:09.180> don't<00:05:09.419> paint<00:05:10.080> to<00:05:10.590> enter<00:05:11.190> competitions

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
they don't paint to enter competitions

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.550 
they don't paint to enter competitions
