I said honed in on on the wart very

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.060 
I said honed in on on the wart very
specifically<00:00:43.940> and<00:00:44.940> within<00:00:45.329> seconds<00:00:45.810> the<00:00:46.070> bolt

it had removed it relatively painlessly
that<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> only<00:00:53.940> problem<00:00:54.180> at<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.300> point<00:00:54.660> was

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930
