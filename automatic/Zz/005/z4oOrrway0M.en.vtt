particularly<00:01:13.229> strong<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.700> no<00:01:14.850> surprise

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
particularly strong so it's no surprise

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.530 
particularly strong so it's no surprise
really<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.950> here's<00:01:16.950> my<00:01:17.220> attempt<00:01:17.880> at<00:01:18.000> my<00:01:18.150> second

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
set but you see here it was a massive

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.640 
set but you see here it was a massive
struggle<00:01:21.600> here<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.960> grind<00:01:22.259> out<00:01:22.470> that

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
struggle here just to grind out that

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.950 
struggle here just to grind out that
first<00:01:22.860> rep<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.460> thought<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.750> bit

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
first rep and I thought this is a bit

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.320 
first rep and I thought this is a bit
silly<00:01:25.200> I'm<00:01:25.530> gonna<00:01:25.740> leave<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.040> there<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:27.119> terms

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
silly I'm gonna leave it there in terms

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.429 
silly I'm gonna leave it there in terms
my<00:01:27.540> target<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.110> kind<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.470> adjust<00:01:29.130> my<00:01:29.369> plan<00:01:29.640> so

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
my target and kind of adjust my plan so

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.990 
my target and kind of adjust my plan so
why<00:01:31.439> did<00:01:31.650> next<00:01:31.890> was<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.369> dropped<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> weight

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
why did next was I dropped the weight

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.130 
why did next was I dropped the weight
down<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.600> 200<00:01:34.409> kilos<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.860> 441<00:01:35.759> pounds<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.420> i

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
down to 200 kilos of 441 pounds and i

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.780 
down to 200 kilos of 441 pounds and i
thought<00:01:37.380> i'll<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.860> if<00:01:37.979> i<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.189> get<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.369> 45

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
thought i'll see if i can get this 45

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.179 
thought i'll see if i can get this 45
now<00:01:39.150> again<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.350> bit<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.680> struggle<00:01:40.890> my

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
now again it's a bit of a struggle my

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.690 
now again it's a bit of a struggle my
form<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.670> not<00:01:41.700> ideal<00:01:42.290> but<00:01:43.290> I've<00:01:43.590> got<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.950> 45<00:01:44.280> so

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.810

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
the time and sometimes then

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.770 
the time and sometimes then
detrimental<00:02:14.210> because<00:02:14.330> obviously<00:02:14.510> if<00:02:14.720> you

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
detrimental because obviously if you

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.780 
detrimental because obviously if you
can't<00:02:14.990> get<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.290> weight<00:02:15.520> you're<00:02:16.520> just<00:02:16.670> going

also<00:02:19.130> emotionally<00:02:19.730> kind<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:20.000> mentally<00:02:20.330> so

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
also emotionally kind of mentally so

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.050 
also emotionally kind of mentally so
it's<00:02:21.290> good<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.530> adjust<00:02:22.520> what<00:02:22.700> you're<00:02:22.790> doing

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
190 which is 419 pounds i think and i

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.240 
190 which is 419 pounds i think and i
got<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.100> 45<00:02:34.550> as<00:02:34.760> well<00:02:34.940> so<00:02:35.860> essentially<00:02:36.860> i<00:02:36.890> did

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
got that 45 as well so essentially i did

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.450 
got that 45 as well so essentially i did
a<00:02:37.460> set<00:02:38.300> of<00:02:38.420> three<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:38.960> two<00:02:39.230> sets<00:02:39.530> of<00:02:39.710> five<00:02:39.920> so

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
a set of three and two sets of five so

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.180 
a set of three and two sets of five so
kind<00:02:40.760> of<00:02:40.910> like<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.590> compromiser<00:02:42.590> mix<00:02:42.980> between

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
kind of like a compromiser mix between

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.680 
kind of like a compromiser mix between
the<00:02:43.790> sessions<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.240> have<00:02:44.360> been<00:02:44.540> doing

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
the sessions I have been doing

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.690 
the sessions I have been doing
particularly<00:02:45.470> recently<00:02:45.770> as<00:02:46.070> five<00:02:46.100> six<00:02:46.580> to

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
particularly recently as five six to

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.490 
particularly recently as five six to
five<00:02:46.820> prior<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.660> that<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:47.960> was<00:02:47.990> doing<00:02:48.140> three

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.770 
five prior to that I was doing three
sets<00:02:48.710> of<00:02:48.800> three<00:02:49.040> so<00:02:49.190> it's<00:02:49.340> kind<00:02:49.550> of<00:02:49.580> like<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.780> mix

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
sets of three so it's kind of like a mix

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.440 
sets of three so it's kind of like a mix
of<00:02:50.990> those<00:02:51.110> two<00:02:51.350> sessions<00:02:51.590> but<00:02:52.180> like<00:02:53.180> I<00:02:53.210> said<00:02:53.300> I

and<00:03:42.050> just<00:03:42.220> activating<00:03:43.220> them<00:03:43.310> on<00:03:43.430> our<00:03:43.459> me<00:03:43.610> on<00:03:43.730> I

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
and just activating them on our me on I

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.670 
and just activating them on our me on I
think<00:03:43.970> it<00:03:44.120> was<00:03:44.180> my<00:03:44.300> second<00:03:44.690> set<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:45.019> was<00:03:45.500> really

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
think it was my second set I was really

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.949 
think it was my second set I was really
struggling<00:03:46.010> on<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.580> then<00:03:46.670> about<00:03:46.850> two<00:03:47.150> reps<00:03:47.750> in

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
struggling on and then about two reps in

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.290 
struggling on and then about two reps in
I've<00:03:48.200> suddenly<00:03:48.590> occurred<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:49.489> me<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.820> kind<00:03:50.180> of

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
I've suddenly occurred to me to kind of

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.090 
I've suddenly occurred to me to kind of
contract<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:50.870> try<00:03:51.019> nuclide<00:03:51.470> my<00:03:51.680> glutes<00:03:51.920> and

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
contract and try nuclide my glutes and

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.310 
contract and try nuclide my glutes and
the<00:03:52.160> rep<00:03:52.700> felt<00:03:52.970> hidden<00:03:53.330> times<00:03:53.540> cleaner<00:03:53.840> so<00:03:54.140> I

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
the rep felt hidden times cleaner so I

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.170 
the rep felt hidden times cleaner so I
am<00:03:54.739> making<00:03:55.070> a<00:03:55.130> mansioner<00:03:55.519> to<00:03:55.640> do<00:03:55.760> that<00:03:55.910> on<00:03:56.060> the

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
am making a mansioner to do that on the

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.400 
am making a mansioner to do that on the
occasions<00:03:56.540> where<00:03:56.630> I<00:03:56.690> remember<00:03:56.989> to<00:03:57.110> do<00:03:57.200> it<00:03:57.230> I

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
occasions where I remember to do it I

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.740 
occasions where I remember to do it I
get<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:57.590> right<00:03:57.769> it<00:03:57.920> feels<00:03:57.980> much<00:03:58.340> much<00:03:58.519> easier

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
get it right it feels much much easier

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.229 
get it right it feels much much easier

Allah 14 12 and 10 i think around that

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.910 
Allah 14 12 and 10 i think around that
kind<00:04:10.550> of<00:04:10.670> region<00:04:11.019> then<00:04:12.019> continuing<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.650> wide

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
kind of region then continuing the wide

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.190 
kind of region then continuing the wide
grip<00:04:13.430> pull<00:04:13.670> down<00:04:14.090> theme<00:04:14.450> i<00:04:14.660> did<00:04:14.840> some<00:04:14.989> wide

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
grip lat pulldowns i felt a massive

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.449 
grip lat pulldowns i felt a massive
amount<00:04:18.230> of<00:04:18.290> land<00:04:18.470> get<00:04:18.709> from<00:04:18.859> here<00:04:18.980> to<00:04:19.040> be<00:04:19.220> fair

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
amount of land get from here to be fair

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.520 
amount of land get from here to be fair
both<00:04:19.970> of<00:04:20.150> those<00:04:20.209> exercises<00:04:20.780> I<00:04:20.989> felt<00:04:21.200> some<00:04:21.350> nice

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
both of those exercises I felt some nice

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.159 
both of those exercises I felt some nice
kind<00:04:21.770> of<00:04:21.859> lower<00:04:22.100> lat<00:04:22.600> engaging<00:04:23.600> which<00:04:23.840> is<00:04:23.960> good

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
kind of lower lat engaging which is good

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.330 
kind of lower lat engaging which is good
because<00:04:24.350> that's<00:04:24.620> what<00:04:24.830> I'm<00:04:24.919> trying<00:04:25.039> to<00:04:25.220> focus

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
because that's what I'm trying to focus

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.640 
because that's what I'm trying to focus
on

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
on

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.840 
on
because<00:04:25.860> that's<00:04:26.009> where<00:04:26.220> I<00:04:26.250> believe<00:04:26.490> I<00:04:26.669> have<00:04:26.820> a

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
because that's where I believe I have a

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.300 
because that's where I believe I have a
pretty<00:04:27.120> big<00:04:27.419> weakness<00:04:27.960> so<00:04:28.830> I'm<00:04:28.919> trying<00:04:29.250> to

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
pretty big weakness so I'm trying to

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.110 
pretty big weakness so I'm trying to
kind<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.520> rectify<00:04:30.000> that<00:04:31.490> going<00:04:32.490> back<00:04:32.850> to<00:04:32.880> my

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
kind of rectify that going back to my

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.110 
kind of rectify that going back to my
deadlift<00:04:33.479> form<00:04:33.949> trying<00:04:34.949> to<00:04:35.039> hit<00:04:35.250> and<00:04:35.430> engage

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
deadlift form trying to hit and engage

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.930 
deadlift form trying to hit and engage
and<00:04:36.900> utilize<00:04:37.229> my<00:04:37.410> glutes<00:04:37.650> obviously<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.520> nice

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
and utilize my glutes obviously a nice

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.430 
and utilize my glutes obviously a nice
big<00:04:39.210> crossover<00:04:39.570> with<00:04:39.750> my<00:04:39.900> squats<00:04:40.229> there

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
big crossover with my squats there

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.050 
big crossover with my squats there
because<00:04:40.770> where<00:04:41.310> I'm<00:04:41.430> squatting<00:04:41.729> to<00:04:41.880> full

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
because where I'm squatting to full

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.159 
because where I'm squatting to full
depth<00:04:42.330> there's<00:04:42.509> obviously<00:04:42.750> a<00:04:42.810> lot<00:04:42.870> of<00:04:43.020> glue

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
depth there's obviously a lot of glue

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.810 
depth there's obviously a lot of glue
engagement<00:04:43.650> there<00:04:43.740> as<00:04:43.889> well<00:04:44.070> so<00:04:44.280> hopefully<00:04:44.430> as

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
engagement there as well so hopefully as

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.180 
engagement there as well so hopefully as
my<00:04:45.300> squat<00:04:45.660> strength<00:04:46.020> increases<00:04:46.740> that's<00:04:46.979> gonna

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
my squat strength increases that's gonna

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.219 
my squat strength increases that's gonna
obviously<00:04:47.460> aid<00:04:47.759> my<00:04:47.940> deadlift<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.570> vice<00:04:48.930> versa

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
obviously aid my deadlift and vice versa

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.840 
obviously aid my deadlift and vice versa
so<00:04:49.820> it's<00:04:50.820> kind<00:04:51.030> of<00:04:51.120> win-win<00:04:51.330> um<00:04:51.780> I<00:04:52.430> then<00:04:53.430> did

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
so it's kind of win-win um I then did

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.330 
so it's kind of win-win um I then did
finish<00:04:54.630> my<00:04:54.840> back<00:04:55.080> accessory<00:04:55.620> work<00:04:55.830> with<00:04:56.039> some

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
finish my back accessory work with some

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.450 
finish my back accessory work with some
kind<00:04:56.699> of<00:04:57.050> standard<00:04:58.050> cable<00:04:58.470> rows<00:04:58.650> using<00:04:59.280> a

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
kind of standard cable rows using a

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.500 
kind of standard cable rows using a
different<00:04:59.760> attachment<00:05:00.150> which<00:05:00.270> obviously

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
different attachment which obviously

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.290 
different attachment which obviously
allows<00:05:00.960> you<00:05:01.169> to<00:05:01.380> kind<00:05:02.310> of<00:05:02.430> change<00:05:02.699> the<00:05:02.940> angle

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
allows you to kind of change the angle

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.930 
allows you to kind of change the angle
of<00:05:03.419> your<00:05:04.490> elbows<00:05:05.490> I<00:05:05.760> did<00:05:06.240> three<00:05:06.510> sets<00:05:06.840> of<00:05:07.940> think

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
of your elbows I did three sets of think

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.900 
of your elbows I did three sets of think
are<00:05:09.320> kind<00:05:10.320> of<00:05:10.440> ten<00:05:10.650> down<00:05:10.860> to<00:05:11.039> sort<00:05:11.400> of<00:05:11.460> 12<00:05:11.699> down

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
are kind of ten down to sort of 12 down

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.850 
are kind of ten down to sort of 12 down
to<00:05:12.030> about<00:05:12.150> 10<00:05:12.419> of<00:05:12.539> those<00:05:12.690> again<00:05:13.440> felt<00:05:13.710> some

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
to about 10 of those again felt some

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.010 
to about 10 of those again felt some
really<00:05:14.160> good<00:05:14.250> land<00:05:14.490> agent<00:05:14.940> and<00:05:15.090> then<00:05:15.690> it<00:05:15.870> was

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
really good land agent and then it was

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.250 
really good land agent and then it was
time<00:05:16.260> for<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:17.039> gun<00:05:17.190> show<00:05:17.460> and<00:05:17.490> I<00:05:18.110> have<00:05:19.110> not

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
time for the gun show and I have not

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.620 
time for the gun show and I have not
done<00:05:19.470> that<00:05:19.800> much<00:05:20.460> biceps<00:05:21.000> for<00:05:21.180> quite<00:05:21.360> a<00:05:21.389> while

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
done that much biceps for quite a while
