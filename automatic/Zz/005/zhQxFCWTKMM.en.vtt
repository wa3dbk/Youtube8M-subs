good<00:02:25.569> success<00:02:25.749> rate<00:02:26.079> so<00:02:26.769> you<00:02:26.859> really<00:02:27.069> don't

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
good success rate so you really don't

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.819 
good success rate so you really don't
have<00:02:27.549> to<00:02:27.639> worry<00:02:27.939> about<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.659> know<00:02:28.689> failing<00:02:29.680> the

training<00:03:36.879> strength<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.389> I'm<00:03:38.079> thinking

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
training strength and I'm thinking

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.789 
training strength and I'm thinking
strongly<00:03:39.729> about<00:03:39.939> going<00:03:40.269> to<00:03:40.389> 99<00:03:40.870> attack<00:03:41.169> 99

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
strongly about going to 99 attack 99

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.030 
strongly about going to 99 attack 99
strength<00:03:42.159> and<00:03:42.400> leaving<00:03:42.729> it<00:03:42.819> 46<00:03:43.449> defense

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
strength and leaving it 46 defense

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.439 
strength and leaving it 46 defense
because<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.129> feel<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.489> it'd<00:03:45.579> be<00:03:45.609> a<00:03:45.699> lot<00:03:45.970> more<00:03:46.030> fun

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
because I feel it it'd be a lot more fun

is a blue dragon hide and he does not
touch<00:05:35.930> me<00:05:36.169> once<00:05:36.530> I<00:05:36.830> think<00:05:37.130> he<00:05:37.190> might<00:05:37.310> actually

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
touch me once I think he might actually

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.210 
touch me once I think he might actually
took<00:05:37.880> me<00:05:38.030> one<00:05:38.360> time<00:05:38.600> but<00:05:38.870> that's<00:05:39.050> about<00:05:39.229> it<00:05:39.289> but

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
took me one time but that's about it but

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.100 
took me one time but that's about it but
yeah<00:05:40.520> he's<00:05:40.729> really<00:05:41.330> really<00:05:41.510> weak<00:05:41.780> it<00:05:41.990> was

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
yeah he's really really weak it was

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.380 
yeah he's really really weak it was
really<00:05:42.500> surprising<00:05:43.010> to<00:05:43.250> me<00:05:43.340> and<00:05:44.090> if<00:05:44.300> you

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
really surprising to me and if you

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.600 
really surprising to me and if you
actually<00:05:44.510> notice<00:05:44.990> each<00:05:45.289> hurt<00:05:45.560> his<00:05:46.010> body<00:05:46.250> turns

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
actually notice each hurt his body turns

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.820 
actually notice each hurt his body turns
into<00:05:46.940> like<00:05:47.180> a<00:05:47.390> mushroom<00:05:47.660> shape<00:05:48.229> before<00:05:48.620> it

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
into like a mushroom shape before it

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.620 
into like a mushroom shape before it
explodes<00:05:49.160> so<00:05:49.760> I<00:05:49.789> guess<00:05:50.030> that's<00:05:50.150> a<00:05:50.300> little<00:05:50.510> bit

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
explodes so I guess that's a little bit

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.750 
explodes so I guess that's a little bit
a<00:05:50.660> little<00:05:50.720> bit<00:05:51.380> of<00:05:51.530> humor<00:05:51.890> especially<00:05:52.220> for
