00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
focusing on that as they have done for

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.490

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
will want to exploit it as a consequence

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.860 
will want to exploit it as a consequence
of<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.380> also<00:00:23.540> recognizing<00:00:24.540> that<00:00:24.630> maybe

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:24.870 
of that and also recognizing that maybe

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.070 
of that and also recognizing that maybe
referees<00:00:25.760> may<00:00:26.760> not<00:00:27.090> allow<00:00:27.360> the<00:00:27.420> contest<00:00:27.960> to

energy and qualities that he brings it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.649 
energy and qualities that he brings it
here<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.820> may<00:01:09.030> seem<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.299> little<00:01:09.510> bit

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
here it may seem a little bit

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.870 
here it may seem a little bit
uncontrolled<00:01:10.200> at<00:01:10.320> times<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
uncontrolled at times but it's just the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.880 
uncontrolled at times but it's just the
intensity<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.990> collisions<00:01:13.380> he<00:01:13.469> has<00:01:13.649> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
intensity of the collisions he has and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.350 
intensity of the collisions he has and
certainly<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.219> tall<00:01:14.430> man<00:01:14.640> within<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.000> line<00:01:15.180> now

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
certainly a tall man within the line now

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.590 
certainly a tall man within the line now

the opportunity back row you know it
might<00:01:51.810> seem<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.649> my<00:01:53.189> area<00:01:53.429> of

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
might seem that this is my area of

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.330 
might seem that this is my area of
expertise<00:01:54.179> and<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:55.920> probably<00:01:56.039> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
expertise and I think it's probably the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.679 
expertise and I think it's probably the
fact<00:01:56.520> there's<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.880> many<00:01:56.939> quality<00:01:57.420> players

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
fact there's so many quality players

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.179 
fact there's so many quality players
around<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.499> actually<00:01:58.770> found<00:01:59.039> this

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
around that I actually found this

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.709 
around that I actually found this
probably<00:01:59.490> one<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.789> more<00:01:59.880> difficult<00:02:00.060> areas

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
probably one of the more difficult areas

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.709 
probably one of the more difficult areas
and<00:02:00.899> they<00:02:01.829> were<00:02:02.149> potentially<00:02:03.149> players<00:02:03.390> that

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
and they were potentially players that

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.599 
and they were potentially players that
if<00:02:03.899> we'd<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.319> selected<00:02:04.679> this<00:02:04.799> team<00:02:05.069> you<00:02:05.520> know

I'm<00:02:46.480> sure<00:02:46.720> is<00:02:46.930> going<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.170> try<00:02:47.380> and<00:02:47.410> want<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:47.770> put

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
I'm sure is going to try and want to put

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.210 
I'm sure is going to try and want to put
pressure<00:02:48.190> on<00:02:48.430> them<00:02:48.640> with<00:02:49.600> his<00:02:50.070> athletic<00:02:51.070> and

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
pressure on them with his athletic and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.830 
pressure on them with his athletic and
dynamic<00:02:51.640> ability<00:02:52.060> with<00:02:52.240> the<00:02:52.270> ball<00:02:52.450> in<00:02:52.630> hand

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840

and<00:02:53.110> yes<00:02:53.710> certainly<00:02:53.920> i<00:02:54.100> think<00:02:54.220> it's<00:02:54.730> an<00:02:54.850> area

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
and yes certainly i think it's an area

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.290 
and yes certainly i think it's an area

roberts did feature in 2009 and featured
very<00:04:28.210> well<00:04:28.390> so<00:04:28.630> you<00:04:29.140> know<00:04:29.200> another<00:04:29.680> man<00:04:29.919> who

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
very well so you know another man who

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.100 
very well so you know another man who
can<00:04:30.700> provide<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.150> platform<00:04:31.300> can't<00:04:31.810> go<00:04:31.960> over

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
can provide the platform can't go over

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.399 
can provide the platform can't go over
the<00:04:32.200> game

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:32.409 
the game

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.769 
the game
I<00:04:32.830> think<00:04:33.129> something<00:04:33.339> like<00:04:33.429> Jonathan<00:04:34.179> Davis

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:34.779 
I think something like Jonathan Davis

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:37.859 
I think something like Jonathan Davis
will<00:04:35.559> put<00:04:36.339> pressure<00:04:36.369> on<00:04:36.819> him<00:04:36.939> I<00:04:37.089> think<00:04:37.330> he<00:04:37.629> has

00:04:37.859 --> 00:04:37.869 
will put pressure on him I think he has

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:40.009 
will put pressure on him I think he has
got<00:04:38.110> you<00:04:38.739> know<00:04:38.830> some<00:04:38.860> attributes<00:04:39.580> of

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:40.019 
got you know some attributes of

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:43.529 
got you know some attributes of
releasing<00:04:41.019> the<00:04:41.019> ball<00:04:41.229> out<00:04:41.439> the<00:04:41.589> tackle<00:04:42.539> yeah

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
releasing the ball out the tackle yeah

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.719 
releasing the ball out the tackle yeah
but<00:04:43.749> certainly<00:04:44.139> those<00:04:44.349> four<00:04:44.949> would<00:04:45.339> be<00:04:45.369> the

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
but certainly those four would be the

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.309 
but certainly those four would be the
four<00:04:45.939> that<00:04:46.119> I<00:04:46.179> would<00:04:46.389> be<00:04:46.509> selecting<00:04:46.899> from<00:04:47.050> but

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:47.319 
four that I would be selecting from but

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:49.889 
four that I would be selecting from but
at<00:04:47.409> this<00:04:47.499> stage<00:04:47.559> back<00:04:48.429> three<00:04:48.849> I've<00:04:49.599> been<00:04:49.779> very

terms<00:05:00.849> of<00:05:01.029> his<00:05:01.119> kick<00:05:01.300> chase<00:05:01.619> aerial<00:05:02.619> ability

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:02.709 
terms of his kick chase aerial ability

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:05.879 
terms of his kick chase aerial ability
to<00:05:03.159> whether<00:05:03.339> he<00:05:03.489> was<00:05:04.079> chasing<00:05:05.079> onto<00:05:05.529> a<00:05:05.559> kick<00:05:05.860> or

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
to whether he was chasing onto a kick or

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.540 
to whether he was chasing onto a kick or
receiving<00:05:06.579> a<00:05:06.849> ball<00:05:07.149> on<00:05:07.179> onto<00:05:07.809> himself<00:05:08.369> has<00:05:09.369> got

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
receiving a ball on onto himself has got

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.359 
receiving a ball on onto himself has got
a<00:05:09.579> great<00:05:09.819> try<00:05:10.329> scoring<00:05:10.769> record<00:05:11.769> at<00:05:11.919> the<00:05:12.009> moment

00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:12.369 
a great try scoring record at the moment

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:13.859 
a great try scoring record at the moment
