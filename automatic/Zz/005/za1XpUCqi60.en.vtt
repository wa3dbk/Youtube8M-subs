00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.449
 expired again since that is certainly true 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.979
 because today I'll give you the clip how to properly store his firewood 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.749
 The storage place for the firewood is you should follow criteria 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:28.169
 choose 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.680
 he should be on the six-sided side of the house and 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:33.589
 be covered 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:36.599
 so that the wood is protected by Massa and driving rain 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.550
 a trivial location 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.620
 who a photo of a roof 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.620
 or as here was a separate board underneath 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.030
 the firewood 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.030
 should be best beaten in the winter months 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.630
 even before storage 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.470
 that's how hot logs are heating up 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.220
 of a length of 30 cm No diameter of 10 to 15 centimeters 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.780
 just split 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.670
 a roundwood like this one 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.280
 To dry much longer than a finished split appears 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.690
 the lighting range 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.140
 are started on a pad 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.939
 this can be a pallet or bricks like here 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.509
 that prevents 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.659
 that the moisture from the ground 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.659
 can pull into the wood 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.990
 b 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.220
 The wood should be a distance of five to ten inches to the house wall 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.600
 between the stacks 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.930
 should also be one hand wide 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.990
 the circulating air 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.630
 Vanessa can record 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.600
 and the wood dries faster 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.650
 under no circumstances 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.650
 you should cover the wood with such a foil 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.090
 under the slide picture itself sweat 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.240
 and the wood 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.460
 does not get dry 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.240
 Wood should not be stored in basements 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.270
 because in Plauen Klo humidity and a bad but so cool action 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.039
 consists 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.989
 the moisture in the wood can not be dissipated 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.099
 and mold can form 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.699
 optimal firewood 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:22.079
 should be stored for at least two years and have a residual moisture content below 20 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.319
 Percent 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.459
 it applies 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.119
 the dive is done 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:28.889
 WSU more energy yield 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.459
 that saw again 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.879
 See you soon European Burmeister courtyard of h
