long documentary project that
photographers<00:02:12.180> will<00:02:12.360> go<00:02:12.630> around<00:02:13.380> England<00:02:13.920> and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
photographers will go around England and

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.690 
photographers will go around England and
do<00:02:14.370> with<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> vigor<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.810> determination

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
do with a vigor and a determination

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.310 
do with a vigor and a determination
photograph<00:02:17.700> in<00:02:17.910> certain<00:02:18.360> communities<00:02:18.570> and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
photograph in certain communities and

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.560 
photograph in certain communities and
that's<00:02:20.010> what<00:02:20.250> we've<00:02:20.400> really<00:02:20.760> concentrated<00:02:21.420> on

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
that's what we've really concentrated on

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.870 
that's what we've really concentrated on
in<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.870> section<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:23.040> final<00:02:23.430> room<00:02:23.610> is

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
in that section the final room is

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.290 
in that section the final room is
section<00:02:24.420> 6<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.590> runs<00:02:26.130> from<00:02:26.250> 1990<00:02:27.120> to

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
section 6 and that runs from 1990 to

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.690 
section 6 and that runs from 1990 to
present<00:02:27.810> what<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:28.560> see<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.860> shift<00:02:29.160> in<00:02:29.340> scale

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
present what we see is a shift in scale

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.960 
present what we see is a shift in scale
a<00:02:29.730> lot<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.270> photographs<00:02:30.630> are<00:02:31.020> much<00:02:31.170> bigger<00:02:31.500> and

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
a lot of photographs are much bigger and

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.690 
a lot of photographs are much bigger and
also<00:02:33.110> they<00:02:34.110> they<00:02:34.740> tackle<00:02:35.130> subjects<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.640> a

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
also they they tackle subjects that a

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.780 
also they they tackle subjects that a
little<00:02:35.910> more<00:02:36.060> ability<00:02:36.930> than<00:02:37.010> perhaps<00:02:38.010> you've

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
little more ability than perhaps you've

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.180 
little more ability than perhaps you've
seen<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.360> earlier<00:02:39.540> parts<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.350> show<00:02:40.560> so

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
seen in earlier parts of the show so

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.280 
seen in earlier parts of the show so
instead<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:42.000> being<00:02:42.209> more<00:02:42.660> straightforward

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
instead of being more straightforward

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.430 
instead of being more straightforward
documentary<00:02:44.010> they're<00:02:44.370> they're<00:02:45.150> cooler<00:02:46.080> in<00:02:46.290> a

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
documentary they're they're cooler in a

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.080 
documentary they're they're cooler in a
way<00:02:46.590> they're<00:02:46.920> stepping<00:02:47.310> back<00:02:47.730> the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
way they're stepping back the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.300 
way they're stepping back the
photographers<00:02:48.570> are<00:02:48.690> allowing<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.800> viewer<00:02:49.830> to

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
photographers are allowing the viewer to

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.490 
photographers are allowing the viewer to
bring<00:02:50.790> much<00:02:51.060> more<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.810> images<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.230> we

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
bring much more to the images that we

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.220 
bring much more to the images that we
see<00:02:52.760> another<00:02:53.760> kind<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.209> exciting<00:02:54.690> part<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.140> the
