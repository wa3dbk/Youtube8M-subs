00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
this passage and I'm thinking I made a

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.220 
this passage and I'm thinking I made a
mistake<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.760> wonder<00:02:22.330> if<00:02:22.420> anybody<00:02:22.750> heard<00:02:23.050> it

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
mistake I wonder if anybody heard it

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.220 
mistake I wonder if anybody heard it
probably<00:02:24.160> not<00:02:24.340> maybe<00:02:25.209> that's<00:02:25.450> my<00:02:25.630> one<00:02:25.840> mistake

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
probably not maybe that's my one mistake

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.100 
probably not maybe that's my one mistake
for<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.530> whole<00:02:26.680> piece<00:02:27.540> I'm<00:02:28.540> gonna<00:02:28.750> go<00:02:28.989> ahead

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
for the whole piece I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.210 
for the whole piece I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:02:29.260> make<00:02:29.440> another<00:02:29.739> mistake<00:02:30.239> if<00:02:31.239> in<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.660> speech

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
and make another mistake if in a speech

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.390 
and make another mistake if in a speech
I'm<00:02:33.220> thinking<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.410> didn't<00:02:35.410> say<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.860> right<00:02:36.069> word

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
I'm thinking I didn't say the right word

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.190 
I'm thinking I didn't say the right word
and<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:38.200> keep<00:02:38.440> worrying<00:02:38.890> about<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.610> history

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
and you keep worrying about that history

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.229 
and you keep worrying about that history
then<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.590> future<00:02:42.190> words<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.670> say<00:02:42.880> are<00:02:43.090> going

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
then the future words you say are going

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.340 
then the future words you say are going
to<00:02:43.300> be<00:02:43.420> impacted<00:02:44.080> if<00:02:44.739> you<00:02:45.220> instead<00:02:45.700> say<00:02:46.350> next

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
to be impacted if you instead say next
