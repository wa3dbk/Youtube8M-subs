00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:25.279
 good morning today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:30.489
 open the distance a window as you see 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:33.400
 I have put these these two things that are 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:35.620
 nothing to take it out of a lamp 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.700
 I started cutting the tubes and put this on 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.700
 inside there are some syringes 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.760
 connected to a water pipe 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.500
 to a system made with a with an engine 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.500
 well of the ego 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.730
 good 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.320
 if you want to see how the system works 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.320
 now he taught them 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.570
 good and now let's open the window 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.869
 all right 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.880
 i 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.049
 i 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.950
 let's see how it works very easy this 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.410
 syringe with what it does is get 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.970
 for inside and outside that moves 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:40.280
 this tube which moves the window like 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:44.080
 come and it's connected with a tube to this 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.000
 and from here here is an engine 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.650
 that when hitler what he does is make 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.989
 turn these and this is twisted 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.380
 this will be oscar or unscrewed because 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.710
 here inside there is a thread 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.250
 and good when it comes to looking for it 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:05.090
 this wood to sÃºa and when unscrewing it 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.020
 so let it go down consequently go up and 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.470
 lowers the syringes from the windows 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.710
 there is one more 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.050
 up here another one is as crooked the 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.080
 normal wood is because a window should 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.410
 closed before the other but not 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.020
 close well 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.900
 and this pier is for you to open if you 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:29.000
 open one or more before 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.370
 and well it's not very complicated although I 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.500
 has taken a lot of work seems very 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.230
 simple but has had many problems 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.000
 to do it as for example you have to 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.790
 change the engine several times because 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.489
 sang one with sufficient power 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.280
 it has been quite difficult what the engine and 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.750
 still it was very slow as you can see me 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.890
 I wish it was faster but not 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:54.060
 I have other engines at the moment 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.980
 when I have it, I will try to do 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.880
 that go faster so far I've done 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.400
 what I could with this 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.350
 good and that's all the invention is going to be 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.720
 improved although at the moment it does not 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.150
 nothing like it is 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.470
 I'm going to put a button to open one for 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.090
 close and when it's open it's going to 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.940
 stop only when it's closed it's going 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.790
 for only also at the moment I have to 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.360
 disconnect it manually 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:25.630
 it will be more automatic but I'm in it 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.520
 I will already present another good video 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.570
 Well, that's all 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.570
 thank you very much for watching
