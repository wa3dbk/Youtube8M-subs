00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
so first I started off by already

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.670 
so first I started off by already
sectioning<00:00:16.010> off<00:00:16.100> the<00:00:16.340> back<00:00:16.520> of<00:00:16.550> my<00:00:16.670> hair<00:00:16.970> I<00:00:17.680> did

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
sectioning off the back of my hair I did

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.120 
sectioning off the back of my hair I did
two<00:00:18.920> bantu<00:00:19.400> knots<00:00:19.640> in<00:00:19.820> the<00:00:19.910> front<00:00:20.180> already

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
two bantu knots in the front already

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.040 
two bantu knots in the front already
working<00:00:22.130> on<00:00:22.160> the<00:00:22.280> third<00:00:22.600> but<00:00:23.600> as<00:00:23.720> you<00:00:23.810> can<00:00:23.930> see

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
working on the third but as you can see

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.290 
working on the third but as you can see
I'm<00:00:24.140> just<00:00:24.170> separating<00:00:24.770> my<00:00:24.890> hair<00:00:25.160> and<00:00:25.550> then<00:00:26.180> I

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
I'm just separating my hair and then I

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.930 
I'm just separating my hair and then I
be<00:00:26.360> tangled<00:00:26.960> with<00:00:27.260> a<00:00:27.320> tangle<00:00:27.710> teezer<00:00:27.940> stop

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
be tangled with a tangle teezer stop

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:36.790 
be tangled with a tangle teezer stop
putting<00:00:29.330> the<00:00:30.110> flexi<00:00:30.470> gel<00:00:30.680> on<00:00:30.950> my<00:00:31.430> hair<00:00:35.800> now

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
putting the flexi gel on my hair now

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.200 
putting the flexi gel on my hair now
make<00:00:36.950> sure<00:00:36.980> I<00:00:37.100> really<00:00:37.280> saturate<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.000> ends

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
make sure I really saturate the ends

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:47.920 
make sure I really saturate the ends
with<00:00:38.329> flexi<00:00:38.719> Joe

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.270 

for<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.050> particular<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.860> I'm<00:00:50.100> actually

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
for this particular one I'm actually

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.869 
for this particular one I'm actually
doing<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:51.030> braid<00:00:51.949> so<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:52.980> wanted<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.309> see<00:00:53.519> maybe

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
doing a braid so I wanted to see maybe

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.400 
doing a braid so I wanted to see maybe
if<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.149> would<00:00:54.239> come<00:00:54.269> out<00:00:54.390> better<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> braid

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
if it would come out better with a braid

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.270 
if it would come out better with a braid
versus<00:00:56.160> join<00:00:57.089> twist<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.890> was<00:00:59.010> sort<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.219> my

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
versus join twist so that was sort of my

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.910 
versus join twist so that was sort of my
little<00:00:59.760> experiment

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.670 

so<00:01:07.520> I've<00:01:08.210> seen<00:01:08.479> in<00:01:08.600> other<00:01:08.720> videos<00:01:09.110> that<00:01:09.140> they

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
so I've seen in other videos that they

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.010 
so I've seen in other videos that they
usually<00:01:09.830> take<00:01:10.189> the<00:01:10.430> bantu<00:01:10.820> knot<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.330> wrap<00:01:11.869> it

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
usually take the bantu knot and wrap it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.249 
usually take the bantu knot and wrap it
around<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:12.650> go<00:01:12.770> to<00:01:12.830> war<00:01:13.220> like<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.610> left<00:01:13.909> side

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
around and go to war like the left side

00:01:14.259 --> 00:02:11.310 
around and go to war like the left side
so<00:01:15.259> that's<00:01:15.680> how<00:01:15.830> I<00:01:15.860> did<00:01:16.070> all<00:01:16.220> my<00:01:16.250> bantu<00:01:16.759> knots

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.160 

alright<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:12.500> then<00:02:12.620> for<00:02:12.890> this<00:02:13.070> part<00:02:13.430> I

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
alright and then for this part I

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.480 
alright and then for this part I
basically<00:02:15.170> decided<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.890> go<00:02:16.010> ahead<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.310> twist

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
basically decided to go ahead and twist

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.310 
basically decided to go ahead and twist
up<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.030> different<00:02:17.360> sections<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.750> my<00:02:17.870> hair<00:02:17.900> and

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
up the different sections of my hair and

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.890 
up the different sections of my hair and
then<00:02:18.710> do<00:02:18.920> all<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.220> bantu<00:02:19.580> knots<00:02:19.850> just<00:02:20.240> all

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
then do all the bantu knots just all

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.890 
then do all the bantu knots just all
together<00:02:21.260> at<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.620> end<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:22.450> i<00:02:23.450> found<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.720> to

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
together at the end and i found that to

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.170 
together at the end and i found that to
be<00:02:23.930> like<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.230> faster<00:02:24.860> way<00:02:25.430> instead<00:02:25.850> of<00:02:25.970> just

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
be like a faster way instead of just

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.540 
be like a faster way instead of just
going<00:02:26.420> twist<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:27.050> then<00:02:27.230> doing<00:02:27.890> each<00:02:28.160> bantu

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
going twist and then doing each bantu

00:02:28.550 --> 00:04:13.250 
going twist and then doing each bantu
knot<00:02:28.700> separately

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.300 

oh<00:04:13.349> I<00:04:13.830> did<00:04:14.129> use<00:04:14.280> a<00:04:14.310> bobby<00:04:14.760> pin<00:04:14.879> for<00:04:15.979> that<00:04:16.979> front

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
oh I did use a bobby pin for that front

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.560 
oh I did use a bobby pin for that front
one<00:04:17.430> there<00:04:17.639> because<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.060> kept<00:04:18.209> coming<00:04:18.359> to

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
one there because it kept coming to

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.170 
one there because it kept coming to
loose<00:04:19.250> but<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.340> other<00:04:20.489> ones<00:04:20.729> were<00:04:20.910> pretty

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
loose but the other ones were pretty

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.070 
loose but the other ones were pretty
much<00:04:21.329> fine

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.800 

oh<00:04:24.139> and<00:04:24.979> that<00:04:25.159> big<00:04:25.400> fancy<00:04:26.120> not<00:04:26.300> that<00:04:26.449> I<00:04:26.509> did<00:04:26.689> the

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
oh and that big fancy not that I did the

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.719 
oh and that big fancy not that I did the
brain<00:04:27.050> on<00:04:27.289> I<00:04:27.560> ended<00:04:27.860> up<00:04:27.919> taking<00:04:28.129> that<00:04:28.340> out<00:04:28.400> and

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
brain on I ended up taking that out and

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.879 
brain on I ended up taking that out and
doing<00:04:28.879> the<00:04:28.970> twist<00:04:29.150> so<00:04:29.479> it<00:04:29.750> looks<00:04:29.780> like<00:04:29.990> fancy

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
doing the twist so it looks like fancy

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.290 
doing the twist so it looks like fancy
knots<00:04:31.039> work<00:04:31.250> best<00:04:31.520> when<00:04:32.030> you<00:04:33.580> twist<00:04:34.580> or<00:04:34.939> maybe

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
knots work best when you twist or maybe

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.770 
knots work best when you twist or maybe
a<00:04:35.449> smaller<00:04:35.840> braid<00:04:37.060> because<00:04:38.060> when<00:04:38.300> I<00:04:38.389> did<00:04:38.569> like

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
a smaller braid because when I did like

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.439 
a smaller braid because when I did like
a<00:04:38.810> big<00:04:39.110> thick<00:04:39.610> fancy<00:04:40.610> not<00:04:40.819> it<00:04:41.030> just<00:04:41.060> came<00:04:41.300> out

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
a big thick fancy not it just came out

00:04:41.449 --> 00:05:44.499 
a big thick fancy not it just came out
way<00:04:41.930> too<00:04:41.960> loose<00:04:42.349> not<00:04:42.939> really<00:04:43.939> much<00:04:44.060> my<00:04:44.240> girl

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:44.509 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.839 

so<00:05:45.509> after<00:05:45.719> I<00:05:46.019> undid<00:05:46.679> all<00:05:46.859> the<00:05:47.039> bantu<00:05:47.399> knots<00:05:47.609> and

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
so after I undid all the bantu knots and

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.709 
so after I undid all the bantu knots and
the<00:05:47.909> twist<00:05:48.209> I<00:05:48.419> started<00:05:48.989> separating<00:05:49.849> the<00:05:50.849> curls

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
the twist I started separating the curls

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.779 
the twist I started separating the curls
just<00:05:51.899> to<00:05:52.139> make<00:05:52.289> them<00:05:52.409> a<00:05:52.469> little<00:05:52.739> bit<00:05:53.099> you<00:05:53.759> know

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
just to make them a little bit you know

00:05:53.789 --> 00:06:28.450 
just to make them a little bit you know
fuller<00:05:55.039> for<00:05:56.039> the<00:05:56.129> overall<00:05:56.519> look

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.640 

alright<00:06:29.060> and<00:06:29.270> that's<00:06:29.360> it<00:06:29.600> hope<00:06:30.470> you<00:06:30.590> guys
