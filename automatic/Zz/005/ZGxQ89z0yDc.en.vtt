00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.900
 for the first verbally played by the series 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.270
 and I believe that 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.940
 Game will promise some excitement I will see the team him 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:08.949
 from 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.349
 only three points apart 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.830
 Brambauer takes the twelfth place in the Westfalenliga with seven points 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.259
 Group 2 on 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.259
 and that's because he's the chain currently with four points bottom of the table 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.670
 after all, who is the doctor's first sales era usher in Sascha Riether 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.480
 after a minute of playing time 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.730
 the guest from the grim bike of Erfurt to 5 they have morning 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.490
 yes that was of course a view for the idR 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.860
 a prelude to measure 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.549
 after bathing in the last few weeks but some personnel 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.010
 So you want to experience them in the club you could rank them, among others 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.110
 Player like him before the session 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.960
 came to Victoria 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.260
 but I think that actually both teams Brambauer and Phoebe 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.610
 Kebbel has the potential to do both 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.859
 Teams Brambauer on Rivic fought 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:34.020
 have the corresponding potential 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.600
 around this league 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.400
 Passengers can or can compete in this league so Jan Fischer 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.250
 the ball 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.250
 Diddy beats 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.020
 on 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.120
 Ben Bernanke IdeaPad scoring but faulty 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.729
 the goalkeeper met in his rescue attempt 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.179
 survived 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.809
 7 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.739
 Brussels 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.659
 Bittner 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.809
 increased in the eighth minute 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:26.209
 Sascha Richter with the number 9 on 0 to 2 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:33.119
 since only 8 minutes are played here, in contrast, was in the first and 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.049
 Eighth minute 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.230
 the pals were scored by Sascha Richter number 9 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.629
 Repel and sculpt Florian Fischer's guarded goal of BVB 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:47.679
 Raul is played again in the middle 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:01.519
 Ball conquest by that was the desire but in the end all explored 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.299
 Dr 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.009
 Felix Helbig years in prison, this was now the 3rd 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:18.259
 in the 17 minute 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:24.419
 to keep the church order 8 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:29.419
 yes, half of the first half was played by a lady named so far 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.269
 Score unchanged 0 to 3 for the guests from Wickede 11 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:40.269
 and the host has now taken the number 21 Philipp Rosenkranz from the place 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.529
 and used it with the number 17 David Sawatzki 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:49.729
 Of course, Brambauer is not the result 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.729
 be satisfying that we are for clear 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:55.069
 now one 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.149
 Soost slower 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:04:00.579
 Dr the assistant referee already had one 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:01.849
 offside 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.999
 position 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:07.620
 all are eager to do so is the captain of the ball 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:09.919
 presents 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.919
 then should not close from this position 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.290
 it is clear that there is something wrong 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.479
 how to participate 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.939
 Header though 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:24.080
 Mention Condé 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.360
 not placing so that goalkeeper Adrian Goalie had no chance but 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.210
 a notable good scoring opportunity she had surrendered 

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:34.400
 and then on 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.470
 high-profile chances of the BVB was 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:48.479
 Throwing in with their side up in the penalty area header extension is there 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.930
 the ball in the net 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.930
 Volker Wissing elected 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:59.309
 alone in big trouble 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:02.400
 the way for the attacker 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.400
 to complete here 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.020
 Devil with the number 7 Christian Fröse 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.810
 Of course, the guy has to say Bigler matches as well as they do each one 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:18.789
 were times 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.840
 Of course, Sandra Theres predicts mistakes went now dived 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:25.879
 of course the question it raised was two 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:29.909
 Defender of Brambauer on the line where was the goalkeeper one 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.449
 legitimate question 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.990
 because only four is of course now for the host team 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.490
 harder to reconnect 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.710
 after one's efforts of course 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.860
 a few times 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.590
 on the crossbar or on the well-placed goalkeeper or even a safe 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.069
 safe defense so far 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:54.759
 from the west wall of the Victory had failed 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:58.139
 Meters remove this sharp input from Christian Fröse 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.699
 in the gate to build the builds 

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:09.430
 fatal 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.460
 where loses has been claimed free kick 4 for Brambauer from Dr 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:17.409
 we're going to do it 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:21.929
 we see if in Heusweiler execution Peter number four 

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:27.619
 very nicely made the number 17 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.960
 since the location of each pharmacy Rangersdorf 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.249
 just 17 ago 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:37.259
 almost everyone is present 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:40.650
 came on in the 23 minute 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:46.740
 and thus justified his substitution in the league 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.770
 beautiful Haider saw the goalkeeper but Yann Golay not so 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.059
 very good 

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:56.529
 and that was the hit for a profit 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.610
 been 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.909
 on 

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:05.270
 17 minutes now played in the second section and still clear 

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:08.039
 Leadership of Westfalia Wickede l 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:08.949
 in this case
