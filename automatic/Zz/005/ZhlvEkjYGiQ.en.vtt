00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.640
 I 'm Tomoyuki 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:17.460
 today 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:22.980
 I would like to introduce a simple scones of how to make using the dung to the Buddha tree 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.519
 Thank you for the real consciousness recipe because I introduce early summer but I know net information 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.519
 I will 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:35.870
 First of all, it is dumpling 200 g to a hot cake 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.870
 And we put in a bowl where you added the olive oil at the time of author 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.090
 And milk 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.090
 It should be c 4 please add 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:53.050
 If you focus on 8 and add it, it will be a fairly sticky article, so it may be a little less 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:57.360
 think 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.360
 Mix it and add it 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.840
 I think that I want to go by work 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.380
 As you can see quite um 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.920
 Because it is sticky 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:20.159
 Should be cc 4 risk may be good and 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.159
 It is safe to use soymilk instead of milk 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:30.310
 I will put chocolate when the article is finished 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:35.580
 We used plate chocolate this time, but are included by one bite 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.580
 I think that good in chocolate that has been packaged by bite 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.289
 Because this 100 was hot 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.659
 Sticky 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:50.299
 It was difficult but it was easy to move. 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.299
 Please put as much chocolate as you like 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.240
 Let's go with Erikon 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.610
 It was so difficult to treat that we finally added some potato starch 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.560
 Naa tried go 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:30.159
 Lay cooking paper on top of it 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.159
 I'll put an article on it to some extent 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.489
 If you do so, please divide into 8 equal parts 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.570
 To some extent, if you can paste it for a while 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:30.600
 Prepare a place 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.600
 And in the oven preheated to 180 degrees 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.210
 Please try to burn while watching the opening for 25 minutes this time 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.460
 Then 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:45.700
 I have finished I scones is as so browned 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:49.670
 I was worried if the chocolate melts, but without such a thing 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:53.550
 It becomes baked floor of nice mansion 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:57.020
 The outside was crispy and the inside was moist 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:01.550
 We were able wonderful scones 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:06.720
 The material is only three chocolate love or four but it is really easy 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:09.220
 Please try by all means because it is modest sweetness 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.850
 Was there a Beijing if 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.850
 Then again
