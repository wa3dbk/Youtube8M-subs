going<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:38.110> do<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.410> electricity<00:02:39.010> but<00:02:39.280> I'm

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
going to do the electricity but I'm

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.250 
going to do the electricity but I'm
going<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.730> change<00:02:39.910> my<00:02:40.030> locations<00:02:40.750> now

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
going to change my locations now

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.560 
going to change my locations now
okay<00:02:42.100> so<00:02:42.160> I've<00:02:42.850> started<00:02:43.060> change<00:02:43.420> my

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
okay so I've started change my

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.380 
okay so I've started change my
positioning<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.440> hopefully<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:46.000> can<00:02:46.150> see

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
positioning and hopefully you can see

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.090 
positioning and hopefully you can see
her<00:02:46.450> hair<00:02:46.630> go<00:02:46.870> up<00:02:47.050> since<00:02:47.320> it's<00:02:47.500> blue<00:02:47.740> and<00:02:48.010> my

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
now there now it's kind of starting to

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.369 
now there now it's kind of starting to
go<00:02:59.580> off<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.760> little<00:03:00.030> one

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.970

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
if this would actually work on like

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.819 
if this would actually work on like
people<00:03:09.480> or<00:03:09.599> other<00:03:09.719> dolls<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.319> want<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.590> test

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
people or other dolls I want to test

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:11.509 
people or other dolls I want to test
that<00:03:11.010> theory

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
that theory

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.459 
that theory
well<00:03:11.849> this<00:03:12.120> work<00:03:12.359> on<00:03:12.510> other<00:03:12.689> dolls<00:03:13.019> beside

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:13.469 
well this work on other dolls beside

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:15.800 
well this work on other dolls beside
this<00:03:13.680> lungs<00:03:13.950> okay<00:03:14.909> I've<00:03:14.969> decided<00:03:15.090> test<00:03:15.659> out

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
this lungs okay I've decided test out

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.780 
this lungs okay I've decided test out
ghoulia<00:03:16.230> where<00:03:16.499> this<00:03:16.650> may<00:03:16.920> or<00:03:17.249> may<00:03:17.370> not<00:03:17.519> work

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
ghoulia where this may or may not work

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.830 
ghoulia where this may or may not work
and<00:03:18.090> hopefully<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.019> will<00:03:20.510> turning<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.629> lights

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840
