00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700
 finally the german trailer is out too 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.700
 sin city 2 the title 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.660
 is normal saturday night 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.919
 power is something fragile it is 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.490
 tears me because I like you so much 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.740
 love are you that far 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.330
 and this must be done by her belong 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.099
 she was an angel 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.920
 if you wish 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.379
 we die one day pressed the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.379
 deduction a nice game 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.590
 you do not want it any other way you want 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:07.170
 one for the bride to orders by 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.170
 you go with science city open eyes 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.400
 or you'll never get out again 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.950
 oh yeah, what about the second one? 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.810
 partly happy and we are honestly sin 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.940
 City is such a movie of the year then 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.100
 In 2005, a really big one 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.200
 not only has the fan base built up 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.760
 Fans of Robert Rodriguez at this 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.380
 look and this adaptation of frank mÃ¼ller 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.780
 Stop the partially freaked out and the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.880
 was the mix of this great look 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.980
 The brute would have the crass cast 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.050
 and the absolute dissimilarity and 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.690
 that's why it's nice to see that sin 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.420
 city â€‹â€‹2 a day mimt help and hide film 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.590
 from 18 september 2014 in the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.970
 German cinemas will bring and the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.170
 history of the white will continue 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.150
 but he is now counting here 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.010
 played by josh brolin no more of 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.330
 clive owen and above all, he is a man 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.700
 in the first part after he 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.590
 has saved or with her 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.150
 has experienced a very own story 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.860
 no fun in his everyday life 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.170
 more feels his life is hell 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.580
 but as an ex-wife on his mat 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.260
 stands and asks for help because she 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.820
 abused is played by evergreen 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.650
 is clear to him he must be the 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.660
 do justice to justice and that 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.340
 means to pave the way with corpses 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.870
 You can see old well-known one sees 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.760
 what does that like jessica alba like? 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.710
 stripper again we have again 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.720
 played by mickey rourke and the 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.530
 many old known to new flat 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.570
 play better 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.190
 joseph gordon levitt rosario dawson and 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.260
 many others more and need to be on the spot 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.000
 I say I'm looking forward to the city 2 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.620
 helping the train not just because it's one 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.510
 goodbye it too because of the movie 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.890
 just different is a fsk 's 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.230
 not known yet but me 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.790
 I almost hope you can do it with a FKS18 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.620
 to start in German cinemas 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.180
 We are honest for genre fans 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.290
 could that be a really nice jar 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.790
 would be and I did not understand either 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.410
 why between the release of 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.330
 english trainers and german so 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.830
 but a lot of time has passed 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.390
 Anyway, it's similar to you 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.860
 or you are interested in the continuation 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.390
 so that would not bother me at all 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.100
 I'm interested in every case, I hope 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.110
 first tears then I am through mine 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.410
 short little trailer check to sin city 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.330
 2 the uk before a bride for the man 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.680
 kills and I'm looking forward to the 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.120
 next trailer and then determined 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.590
 1 time corners trailer checkers can 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.300
 download made with this job 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.260
 let it stay if not otherwise 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.000
 there are still a few left and me 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.220

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.810
 new video and until then I hope here 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.519
 Since then, of course, we're back 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.519
 at 3
