00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.780
 hello to all and we all find ourselves for a new video of the game for 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.119
 present the most unpublished morning 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.500
 so simple line that allows you to view sales in real time 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.499
 directly in the country in your internet browser 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.070
 so these sentences will be committed even if mac will appear in the tarlatane 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.919
 google maps are made 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.349
 the assassin 5-5 but just download it 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.680
 for 111 20 points 6 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.930
 a dozen pass the record 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.429
 and gear% point in my folder 

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:39.730
 more than one 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.690
 so I have already done 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.690
 so if you just have to start your server 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.620
 so you have a useless makelele that is displayed while 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.900
 that the ump 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.060
 no more inactivate 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.540
 then after the second would be that softer activated 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.810
 so to connect percent 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.810
 125 places 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.180
 and there you have to destroy a few blocks 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.940
 since finally in the default settings 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.380
 e the most none i'm 9 years old will make a amap somehow depending on 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.920
 unlock are destroyed 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.350
 it must change very recently the parameters in Montreal game after 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.859
 francona 300 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.760
 final winner these few pages 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.660
 to deal with season repayments 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.660
 and then you go on the ocher upward 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.820
 all points and 1923 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.470
 cause of changes including our site 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.730
 to us four years 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.520
 a picture from above that appears 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.220
 the amap me i activated the mode the treasure us are actually three years 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.300
 now and also shows you how to activate it 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.090
 you know a lot more time to do it the round back of an amap 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.090
 but the quality behind the child in the city of suez 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.869
 the right you can choose to activate to display the foil will quickly 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.029
 and the 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:11.240
 the display points of the disc 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.780
 the team get lost from this ramp you often have a chad so 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.949
 to talk about it 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:22.439
 on the right you have the worlds with his muse and players 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.699
 and for every world could change life 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.889
 to the way of life he calls surface 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:32.499
 poyet who even displays suture prescillia fashion village for example 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:34.929
 that was generated while we went 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:38.939
 In the inter it is necessary to have quality just fantastic right now I find 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.089
 it really impressive 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:42.349
 either the smallest details 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.019
 finally gilles the seven were a good ten minutes for him 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.759
 make 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:47.919
 this part 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.619
 a year ago 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:52.919
 who has not done all that yet all around you 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.449
 an elderly man and precisely changes in the practical settings 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:03.259
 which does not generate the map in fact especially the it is the part the hand that I 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:04.419
 changed - time game 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.809
 and that I see in the decent life 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:10.289
 so to prevent it from changing stable trulli and glock bed 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:12.519
 falletti a coup d'état all blogs 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.159
 nothing so it's not over yet 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.549
 or almost is still there that was 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.549
 a lawsuit often even in the reeds here 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.070
 so there in all we can see the sitarail players' bets to 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.749
 the time that appears in August 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:27.369
 with the lensois are from the moon 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:28.829
 very practical if 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.299
 we changed a little bit the world let go the swimmer but I'm not the ones 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.059
 names that did not generate a lover 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:35.849
 hostilities 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.849
 at the key a little strange we emptied cavern in celebration 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:41.709
 believe it underground 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.579
 that's what it thinks that's life is in danger that's shaped 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.789
 misfortune balaban mines 

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:51.639
 ap amap complaint eh yes the German it is only on the positive control to 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.949
 the% map on the surface 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.989
 as for the outcome of the 10 in a row 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.989
 so in the folder then we have a dim folder 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.349
 and a config file to his external friend 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.409
 so for a little earlier with the notary further 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:10.359
 but not with the notebook since the notebook 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.329
 it m it is not layout so it's after the access and readable 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:18.620
 so at the very beginning brood 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.620
 change the quality for 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.340
 it's scary 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.309
 nothing else 

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:26.509
 I did not know 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:31.029
 e our columns in the context config file and you can% in line 8 

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:35.259
 we spoke faucigny and for these races by signing in the form of comments 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.090
 with a little puzzle 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.759
 if sharp before 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.449
 benmoussa edelstenne fixed fee 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.040
 so if you want the aurès or without lifting the foot what is in front of this 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.509
 beautiful line 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.499
 if you want high definition 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:54.749
 even to remove the said and what is in front of the bottom line plati sex by 

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:55.580
 rss 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.999
 so by default it will be then to his list is overrated 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:02.599
 and if you resell the sharp in front of the line to where it is 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.050
 it will make a man of quality 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.150
 then to lignières so much lower line 222 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.100
 you can choose to salute e actions that go to generate the 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.710
 less 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.229
 he died 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.969
 so by default we have a filler in their block to place a block 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.169
 pleased with the man for her account 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.300
 we retain that generate 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.550
 as to block formation of this encounter are for example so why 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.460
 we see for example the troops of the ump 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.169
 two criteria 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.520
 source 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.580
 the names start sooner the rejection by the parliament 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.719
 end of May the rest is less important 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:47.819
 in the back you have a 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.139
 documentation for the most dignified 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:52.680
 we see the misstep in changing the parameters of chad 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.000
 and yet the documentation inscribed as 6% against 6 referred 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.119
 for 100 m 

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:03.269
 the congo is all in my power so that all phones 

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:06.029
 are more advanced 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:09.029
 so here I present you the low part 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.089
 but that's all for this video 

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:16.979
 there I tell you soon see you do not hesitate too at the chain
