3.0 ports and Thunderbolt so that really

from<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.490> laptop<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:24.119> big<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:24.720> actually

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
from a laptop this big but it's actually

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.440 
from a laptop this big but it's actually
slimmer<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:25.979> lighter<00:01:26.400> than<00:01:26.610> last<00:01:26.880> year's

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
slimmer and lighter than last year's

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.270 
slimmer and lighter than last year's
it's<00:01:27.659> still<00:01:27.840> nine<00:01:28.049> point<00:01:28.350> five<00:01:28.500> pounds<00:01:29.130> and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
it's still nine point five pounds and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.100 
it's still nine point five pounds and
about<00:01:29.850> two<00:01:30.150> inches<00:01:30.390> thick<00:01:30.509> at<00:01:30.780> its<00:01:30.840> thickest

about two inches thick at its thickest

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.050 
about two inches thick at its thickest
point<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.400> not<00:01:32.579> something<00:01:32.759> you're<00:01:32.970> going

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
point so it's not something you're going

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.240 
point so it's not something you're going

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
to tuck away into your bag easily but

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.760 
to tuck away into your bag easily but
we'll<00:01:35.549> take<00:01:35.700> what<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.650> overall<00:01:37.650> it's

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
we'll take what we can get overall it's

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.890 
we'll take what we can get overall it's
