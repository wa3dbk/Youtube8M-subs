00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.580
 hi friends of gt5 i am stratus and os 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.110
 I bring a new video for the channel and the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.059
 today I wanted to talk to you about the subject 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.130
 the emblem of the cross I have seen many 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.320
 messages that you ask me to put 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.359
 an emblem and others and the truth guys what 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.550
 I'm sorry but I could not put it because 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.430
 between work and the channel is going 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.650
 quite a while and the truth is that I 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.920
 I would obviously like to put an emblem 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.960
 well in conditions not just anything 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.969
 that as you know already drag the patch to 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.710
 the option that we can put images 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.600
 that are not created with the editor 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.640
 emblems because I can not put the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.829
 emblem of the channel that was my idea in a 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.660
 principle but good has given rise to that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.180
 I can think of another idea where you can 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.500
 absolutely everyone participate and that 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.860
 is that I'm going to do a contest 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.140
 of emblems for the sieve you can 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.640
 participate as I have told you all and what 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.800
 only thing you have to do is publish 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.469
 your emblem that makes you have 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.120
 done you in the good social club 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.500
 but specifically in the I think so that 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.150
 we can see all of us 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.600
 especially me what is the what 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.410

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.560
