very small brush and I'm creating little

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.329

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
lines using a black eyeshadow that I got

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.410 
lines using a black eyeshadow that I got
wet<00:00:54.579> so<00:00:54.790> it's<00:00:54.910> easier<00:00:55.180> to<00:00:55.210> work<00:00:55.329> with<00:00:57.420> so

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
wet so it's easier to work with so

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.819 
wet so it's easier to work with so
following<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:58.870> same<00:00:58.899> lines<00:00:59.289> as<00:00:59.440> your<00:00:59.589> teeth

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
following the same lines as your teeth

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.439 
following the same lines as your teeth
again<00:01:00.250> you<00:01:00.430> can<00:01:00.550> use<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.699> picture<00:01:00.969> of<00:01:01.180> a<00:01:01.239> skull

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
again you can use a picture of a skull

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.060 
again you can use a picture of a skull
to<00:01:01.629> see<00:01:01.780> how<00:01:01.930> to<00:01:01.989> do<00:01:02.140> that<00:01:02.290> or<00:01:02.530> you<00:01:02.680> can<00:01:02.800> follow

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
to see how to do that or you can follow

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.369 
to see how to do that or you can follow
the<00:01:03.220> same<00:01:03.370> line<00:01:03.579> as<00:01:03.729> your<00:01:03.850> teeth<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:05.229> dip

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
the same line as your teeth just dip

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.899 
the same line as your teeth just dip
your<00:01:05.409> brush<00:01:05.680> in<00:01:05.860> water<00:01:06.159> and<00:01:06.460> then<00:01:06.550> back<00:01:06.729> into

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
your brush in water and then back into

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.310 
your brush in water and then back into
the<00:01:07.000> eyeshadow<00:01:07.420> sort<00:01:07.720> of<00:01:07.810> like<00:01:07.899> paint<00:01:08.170> and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
the eyeshadow sort of like paint and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.139 
the eyeshadow sort of like paint and
it'll<00:01:08.680> work<00:01:08.710> easier<00:01:09.340> over<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.820> base<00:01:09.940> that

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
it'll work easier over the base that

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:20.500 
it'll work easier over the base that
you've<00:01:10.299> already<00:01:10.450> created

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.730 

so<00:01:21.510> this<00:01:21.660> part<00:01:21.870> of<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.110> whole<00:01:22.470> look<00:01:22.590> is

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
so this part of the whole look is

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.110 
so this part of the whole look is
probably<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.160> hardest<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.730> probably<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
probably the hardest and probably the

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.930 
probably the hardest and probably the
most<00:01:24.240> tedious<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.690> do<00:01:25.310> just<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.400> patient<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
most tedious to do just be patient and

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.340 
most tedious to do just be patient and
work<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.480> and<00:01:27.630> try<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.810> make<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.110> look<00:01:28.200> as

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
work with it and try to make it look as

00:01:28.350 --> 00:02:32.050 
work with it and try to make it look as
most<00:01:28.590> realistic<00:01:29.070> as<00:01:29.190> you<00:01:29.310> can

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.130 

so<00:02:33.060> now<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.239> my<00:02:33.390> teeth<00:02:33.540> are<00:02:33.690> done<00:02:33.840> I'm<00:02:34.019> gonna
