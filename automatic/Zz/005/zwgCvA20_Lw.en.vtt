00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.000
 has some functions here not 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.270
 external visual 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.270
 It would be interesting if we could work, right? 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:12.579
 and I have one here 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:13.570
 I want 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.890
 the inter 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.740
 returns the inside of the value represented by expression 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.880
 expression means 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.800
 what you put the real number 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 which causes it to return the integer 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.250
 I have to the algorithm 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.120
 So we can explain better. 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.120
 returns the entire year 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.340
 then this function 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.410
 is that I 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.690
 how come there was nothing snowing counter 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.280
 variable real value is the whole year 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.070
 who commanded the last day 4 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.070
 success in the real read the report 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.130
 attributes this value to the international pole aggravated in the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.840
 would fail distribution 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.840
 to the real is from relatives to the interior 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.920
 then formulating that jacket is that relatives too 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.490
 and the expression and before relatives 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.480
 so you put there 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.500
 write something whole lot places 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.380
 the exit 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.370
 what we have done to others see only the erc 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.860
 it's the same thing 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.860
 only with this differential here a 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.880
 of the range assigned in this year-long variable 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.650
 there when you wake up 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.790
 any name you put 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.790
 which is thus broken in Rwandan kigali 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.260
 before your soul in the whole number 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.900
 500 got there 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.730
 there 500 5214 comma 32 41 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.130
 It already adds morumbi. 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.420
 nuno melo 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.049
 pinwheel 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.439
 interesting to born 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.439
 regardless of how many numbers ended 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.269
 but in his yamaha all over the world 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.059
 so I stayed with this function even more delma worked to analyze 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.489
 Of course you can not do the reverse. 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.049
 because whole integer real not real he already have the numbers then 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.109
 to see dogs not written after the comma he gets alone with the front 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:36.619
 comma 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:39.699
 and I understand what it's like a dish to her real mother 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.919
 you stay there you know 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.869
 with this algorithm there is a coach 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:48.909
 look there 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.909
 welcome to lau or twitter 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.499
 paulo bento 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:58.249
 ailton lime 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:01.939
 if you can some information she also has a blog link 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.189
 For you, it may be analyzed. 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.469
 o ctg 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.209
 sociological claudia 3 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.959
 we have several in the world how can the goal there for you could go research and 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.259
 practice 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:17.209
 and it stays there a lot 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.399
 and acting 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.029
 to understand more easily 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:24.279
 the logic behind the programs 

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:25.439
 so until the next
