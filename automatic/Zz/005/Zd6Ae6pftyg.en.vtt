three-game<00:00:11.099> LCS<00:00:11.880> winning<00:00:12.179> streak<00:00:12.389> was<00:00:13.380> a

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
three-game LCS winning streak was a

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.279 
three-game LCS winning streak was a
little<00:00:13.710> tense<00:00:14.610> there<00:00:14.880> for<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> moment<00:00:15.269> yeah<00:00:16.109> it

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
little tense there for a moment yeah it

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.109 
little tense there for a moment yeah it
was<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.440> really<00:00:16.770> shaky<00:00:17.160> start<00:00:17.460> i<00:00:17.609> think<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
was a really shaky start i think in the

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.859 
was a really shaky start i think in the
beginning<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.720> was<00:00:18.840> one<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.350> five<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:20.750> four<00:00:21.750> of

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
beginning it was one to five and four of

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.509 
beginning it was one to five and four of
the<00:00:21.930> kills<00:00:22.199> were<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.619> elise<00:00:22.859> jungle<00:00:23.250> yeah

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
the kills were on the elise jungle yeah

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.040 
the kills were on the elise jungle yeah
which<00:00:23.699> actually<00:00:24.000> makes<00:00:24.390> things<00:00:24.600> better<00:00:24.750> for

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
which actually makes things better for

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.900 
which actually makes things better for
us<00:00:25.170> because<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.650> jungler<00:00:26.160> can't<00:00:26.400> really<00:00:26.699> care

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
us because a jungler can't really care

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.150 
us because a jungler can't really care
even<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.300> he<00:00:27.420> builds<00:00:27.599> damage<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.949> was

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
even if he builds damage I so it was

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.339 
even if he builds damage I so it was
good<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.699> kills<00:00:29.910> were<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.210> her<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.689> I

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
good that the kills were on her and I

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.959 
good that the kills were on her and I
think<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.679> moment<00:00:31.980> where<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.189> started<00:00:32.550> having

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
think the moment where we started having

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.760 
think the moment where we started having
an<00:00:33.180> idea<00:00:33.420> okay<00:00:33.630> we<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.899> make<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> comeback<00:00:34.500> on

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
an idea okay we can make a comeback on

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.549 
an idea okay we can make a comeback on
this<00:00:35.010> was<00:00:35.550> when<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:36.420> actually<00:00:36.750> got<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.989> kill<00:00:37.350> on

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
this was when we actually got a kill on

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.010 
this was when we actually got a kill on
her<00:00:37.890> word<00:00:38.309> Judy<00:00:38.879> pie<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.180> jinx<00:00:39.510> got<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.809> kill

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
her word Judy pie on jinx got the kill

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.889 
her word Judy pie on jinx got the kill
managed<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.980> kill<00:00:41.430> her<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.030> we<00:00:42.149> got<00:00:42.300> her<00:00:42.510> spree

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
managed to kill her so we got her spree

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.569 
managed to kill her so we got her spree
and<00:00:43.079> got<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.469> kill<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.800> one<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.250> our<00:00:44.309> late-game

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
and got the kill on one of our late-game

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.250 
and got the kill on one of our late-game
carries<00:00:45.090> distinct<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:45.870> have<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> much

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
carries distinct so we have a much

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.810 
carries distinct so we have a much
better<00:00:46.440> late<00:00:46.710> game<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.100> already<00:00:47.550> started

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
better late game I already started

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.000 
better late game I already started
rolling<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> gold<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:49.170> him<00:00:49.350> yeah<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.920> I

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
rolling the gold in for him yeah and I

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.260 
rolling the gold in for him yeah and I
think<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.309> big<00:00:50.460> turning<00:00:50.730> point<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.090> game

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
think the big turning point of that game

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.400 
think the big turning point of that game
is<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.539> actually<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> clip<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.199> we<00:00:52.289> can

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
is we actually have a clip if we can

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.479 
is we actually have a clip if we can
pull<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.620> up<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> screen<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.399> guys

later<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.850> then<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.360> actually<00:01:33.659> end<00:01:33.810> up

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
later and then we actually end up

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.810 
later and then we actually end up
getting<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.170> kill<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.860> Shen<00:01:35.460> because<00:01:35.700> he

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
getting the kill on on a Shen because he

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.219 
getting the kill on on a Shen because he
gets<00:01:35.970> another<00:01:36.180> zap<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.570> him<00:01:36.720> even<00:01:37.140> though

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
gets another zap on him even though

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.230 
gets another zap on him even though
renekton<00:01:37.799> dies<00:01:37.979> obviously<00:01:38.939> would<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.090> been

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
renekton dies obviously would have been

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.080 
renekton dies obviously would have been
better<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.750> got<00:01:39.900> 44<00:01:40.380> none<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.280> we're<00:01:41.729> still

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
better if we got 44 none but we're still

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.270 
better if we got 44 none but we're still
able<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.420> do<00:01:42.570> baron<00:01:42.930> after<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.890> so

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
completely on the back foot as soon as

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.850 
completely on the back foot as soon as
you<00:01:48.270> guys<00:01:48.420> saw<00:01:48.659> an<00:01:48.780> opening<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.470> seem<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.740> just

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
you guys saw an opening you seem to just

kind<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.040> all<00:01:50.250> turn<00:01:50.490> around<00:01:50.729> what<00:01:50.880> really

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
kind of all turn around what really

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.660 
kind of all turn around what really
keyed<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.540> off<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.020> mean<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.619> think<00:01:53.070> when

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
keyed that off I mean I think when

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.789 
keyed that off I mean I think when
somebody<00:01:54.000> gets<00:01:54.149> ahead<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.689> lot<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.170> times<00:01:55.380> teams

somebody gets ahead a lot of times teams
tend<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.310> be<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> little<00:01:57.000> bit<00:01:57.149> over<00:01:57.600> aggressive

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
tend to be a little bit over aggressive

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.109 
tend to be a little bit over aggressive
and<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> bit<00:01:58.619> reckless<00:01:58.890> which<00:01:59.579> as<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.909> saw

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
solo against a team that we can easily

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.260 
solo against a team that we can easily
pick<00:02:04.710> him<00:02:04.799> up<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.280> ice<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.490> they

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
then we won the game off this so there's

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.990 
then we won the game off this so there's
even<00:03:28.890> if<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.130> have<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> grog<00:03:29.490> US<00:03:29.640> release

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.100 
even if you have a grog US release
there's<00:03:30.270> still<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.480> chance<00:03:30.570> you<00:03:30.870> can<00:03:30.990> get

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
there's still a chance you can get

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
mean the thing is we went the original

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.860 
mean the thing is we went the original
play<00:04:02.550> was<00:04:02.760> based<00:04:03.000> on<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.300> fact<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:03.540> we<00:04:03.690> could

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
play was based on the fact that we could

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.360 
play was based on the fact that we could
burn<00:04:04.020> down<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.470> Baron<00:04:04.830> and<00:04:04.980> get<00:04:05.130> it<00:04:05.220> before

burn down the Baron and get it before
they<00:04:05.700> reacted<00:04:06.210> we<00:04:06.330> saw<00:04:06.540> caitlin<00:04:06.810> back<00:04:07.110> we<00:04:07.290> saw

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
they reacted we saw caitlin back we saw

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.900 
they reacted we saw caitlin back we saw
shen<00:04:07.740> retreat<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.220> we<00:04:08.310> didn't<00:04:08.850> have

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
shen retreat and we didn't have

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.580 
shen retreat and we didn't have
excellent<00:04:09.360> wars<00:04:09.690> but<00:04:09.900> we<00:04:10.020> figured<00:04:10.230> that<00:04:10.380> we

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
excellent wars but we figured that we

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.750 
excellent wars but we figured that we
would<00:04:10.620> be<00:04:10.740> able<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:11.010> burn<00:04:11.220> it<00:04:11.400> quickly<00:04:11.610> enough

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
would be able to burn it quickly enough

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.580 
would be able to burn it quickly enough
now<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.510> issue<00:04:12.750> is<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:13.020> i<00:04:13.140> think<00:04:13.230> it<00:04:13.500> was

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
now the issue is that i think it was

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.230 
now the issue is that i think it was
still<00:04:13.920> warded<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.490> they<00:04:14.580> were<00:04:14.640> able<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:15.000> run

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
still warded and they were able to run

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.940 
still warded and they were able to run
there<00:04:15.450> in<00:04:15.630> time<00:04:15.900> maybe<00:04:16.170> this<00:04:16.320> one<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.710> speed

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
there in time maybe this one is speed

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.950 
there in time maybe this one is speed
boost<00:04:17.160> got<00:04:17.340> them<00:04:17.580> got<00:04:18.120> them<00:04:18.270> that<00:04:18.450> quickly<00:04:18.660> so

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:18.960 
boost got them got them that quickly so

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.539 
boost got them got them that quickly so
then<00:04:19.140> you<00:04:19.859> know<00:04:19.950> it's<00:04:20.130> not<00:04:20.280> something<00:04:20.520> that

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
then you know it's not something that
