no<00:00:11.490> matter<00:00:11.610> what<00:00:11.759> your<00:00:12.030> hair<00:00:12.059> length<00:00:12.420> is

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
no matter what your hair length is

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.419 
no matter what your hair length is
you'll<00:00:13.110> just<00:00:13.349> kind<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.830> do<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.309> that

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
you'll just kind of do it to that

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.099 
you'll just kind of do it to that
proportion<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.389> if<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.839> look<00:00:15.960> really

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
proportion so if you have a look really

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.320 
proportion so if you have a look really
short<00:00:16.410> hair<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.920> would<00:00:17.130> make<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.490> like<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.150> made

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
short hair you would make it like I made

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.689 
short hair you would make it like I made
a<00:00:18.359> braid<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.869> makes<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.350> shorter<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.220> basically

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
a braid it makes it shorter so basically

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.910 
a braid it makes it shorter so basically
what<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.750> piece<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.230> hair<00:00:22.529> wrapped

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
what it is it's a piece of hair wrapped

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.460 
what it is it's a piece of hair wrapped
around<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.880> top<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.090> my<00:00:24.330> ponytail<00:00:24.510> like<00:00:25.199> this
