00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:29.480
 Caibing hodgepodge 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.260
 Outside the number 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.560
 Today, I signed the enlistment order to give a glimpse of the life of the soldiers. 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.580
 Here is Nicksburg 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.060
 Is a typical boot camp 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.240
 (with a sense of snoring) 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.200
 (Army trumpeter) 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.400
 (get up number) 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.500
 (Singing up to get up) 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.540
 stand at attention! 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.380
 Report! 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.600
 1,2,3,4 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600
 1,2,3,4 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.360
 1,2,3..... 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.640
 Uh.... 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.640
 Let me think about what the next one is. 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.080
 It is 4! 4! 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.500
 Not allowed to cheat to let him come 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.680
 Oh, I think about it. 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.920
 It is 4! Yes, it is 4!嘿嘿嘿

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.220
 Congratulations, you have answered right now. Are you going to participate in the Super Millionaire Competition? (instructor is ironic) 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.780
 I don’t know, I have to think about it... 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.600
 (You will regret it~) 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.620
 Uh. . So much money, I can't afford it, can I only take 5 million? 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.240
 The music that soldiers love to hear is the sound of the meal. 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.460
 (Infantry class) 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.080
 (machine guns) 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.920
 (bomber pilot) 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.700
 (The death squad is eating drug irony to provide soldiers with drugs to refresh) 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.280
 After the soldiers are full, they will start a day of training. 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.780
 The most conspicuous of these is the daily exercise of the cavalry. 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.700
 The whole team is upright! 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.980
 Step on! 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.760
 turn right! 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.320
 Start off! 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
 The infantry squad is the backbone of the army. 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.500
 Daily long-distance march training is the commonplace of these soldiers. 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.820
 (Try to train soldiers by train next time) 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.760
 The next thing I saw was the camouflage special swollen force. 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.780
 The artillery class is experimenting with a new type of cannon 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.980
 Different from the modern and advanced mechanized army, the early A Bingge used temporary pieces to carry out exercises in order to save costs. 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.200
 This is an example of 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.480
 This is the training of the machine gun class. 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.800
 (using the mouth to simulate gunshots) 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.060
 This is the tank unit 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.560
 (Children's favorite ice cream car &lt;3) 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.380
 Paratroopers 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.260
 (parachute cloth strip) 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.760
 "Simulated parachute" 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.780
 The Air Force plays a very important part in the war 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.300
 Simulating the aircraft’s "fighting" in the air during the exercise 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.080
 (Win ~) 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.340
 Next is the daily shooting exercise of the Air Defense Artillery Corps. 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.060
 (Standing to fight for you?) 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.640
 Large-caliber cannons are expensive because of the ammunition, and the use of fire commands is transmitted from the command department. 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.240
 The command department is generally located at the farthest point of the battle line. 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.380
 (effort in calculation) 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.260
 Muzzle vertical angle 45 Muzzle pointing 30 degrees north east 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:47.680
 (Communicator repeats the instructions of the general) 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.160
 Longitude 36 latitude 58 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160
 (Communicator repeats the instructions of the general) 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.600
 (Communicator repeats the instructions of the general) 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.360
 Ready to fire 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.800
 Open fire 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.880
 (Central Headquarters) 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.520
 (The taunting communication process here is not uniform and there is no uniform standard unit) 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.500
 I am really an incompetent general. 

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.940
 Thanks for watching
