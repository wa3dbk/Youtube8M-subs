very<00:01:23.780> interesting<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.080> especially<00:01:26.009> when<00:01:26.190> I

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
very interesting and especially when I

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.410 
very interesting and especially when I
had<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> opportunity<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.740> read<00:01:28.740> his<00:01:29.420> diary

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
had the opportunity to read his diary

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.559 
had the opportunity to read his diary
the<00:01:31.170> last<00:01:31.410> version<00:01:31.709> we<00:01:32.490> suppose<00:01:33.209> that<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.539> the

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
the last version we suppose that is the

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.290 
the last version we suppose that is the
version<00:01:34.080> which<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.709> how<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.640> was<00:01:35.849> written

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
version which is how it was written

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.870 
version which is how it was written
so<00:01:36.780> because<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.740> know<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:37.890> for<00:01:38.310> many<00:01:38.429> years

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
so because we know that for many years

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.350 
so because we know that for many years
his<00:01:39.720> wife<00:01:40.170> Ramona<00:01:40.830> who<00:01:41.250> was<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.849> possession<00:01:42.119> of
