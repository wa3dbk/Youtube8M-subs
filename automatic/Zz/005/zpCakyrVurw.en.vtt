00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.230 
the base you cut a little bit extra
because<00:01:43.770> we're<00:01:44.189> not<00:01:44.310> taking<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.759> lining

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
because we're not taking that lining

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.030 
because we're not taking that lining
piece<00:01:45.450> out<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.930> need<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.229> allow<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:46.649> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
piece out so you need to allow for a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.160 
piece out so you need to allow for a
seam<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:48.030> cut<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> little<00:01:48.420> bit<00:01:48.659> wider<00:01:48.899> at<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
seam so cut a little bit wider at the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.080 
seam so cut a little bit wider at the
base<00:01:49.350> then<00:01:49.710> follow<00:01:50.040> along<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.460> edges<00:01:50.850> and

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
base then follow along the edges and

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.200 
base then follow along the edges and
here<00:01:51.780> are<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.110> two<00:01:52.380> outer<00:01:52.950> sections<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.970> your

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
here are the two outer sections of your

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.609 
here are the two outer sections of your
tie<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> part<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.200> people<00:01:55.320> will

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
tie this is the part that people will

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.770 
tie this is the part that people will
see<00:01:55.829> now<00:01:56.700> next<00:01:56.969> we're<00:01:57.119> going<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.270> copy<00:01:57.509> those

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
see now next we're going to copy those

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.020 
see now next we're going to copy those
lining<00:01:58.290> pieces<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.159> use<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> scrap<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.820> I

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
lining pieces I just use a scrap that I

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.990 
lining pieces I just use a scrap that I
had<00:02:00.329> from<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.960> lining<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.500> dress<00:02:01.829> just<00:02:02.189> lay

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
had from the lining of a dress just lay

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.060 
had from the lining of a dress just lay
them<00:02:03.180> out<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.509> lining<00:02:03.780> pin<00:02:04.380> them<00:02:04.560> down<00:02:04.799> and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
them out on the lining pin them down and

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.190 
them out on the lining pin them down and
then<00:02:05.340> cut<00:02:05.790> around<00:02:06.030> them<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.659> again<00:02:06.930> give

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
then cut around them and again give

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.779 
then cut around them and again give
yourself<00:02:07.560> some<00:02:07.740> extra<00:02:07.829> room<00:02:08.280> because<00:02:08.610> you

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
yourself some extra room because you

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.479

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
need that extra room to sew the seams so

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.339 
need that extra room to sew the seams so
just<00:02:11.700> cut

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
just cut

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.979

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
them and once you have those cut out you

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.660 
them and once you have those cut out you
should<00:02:15.200> be<00:02:15.230> left<00:02:15.530> with<00:02:15.650> your<00:02:15.890> two<00:02:16.099> bottom

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
should be left with your two bottom

should be left with your two bottom
lining<00:02:16.969> sections<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.079> they<00:02:18.680> will<00:02:18.859> look<00:02:19.069> a

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
lining sections and they will look a

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.179 
lining sections and they will look a
little<00:02:19.430> bit<00:02:19.579> like<00:02:19.939> this<00:02:20.889> next<00:02:21.889> you're<00:02:22.069> going

inside<00:02:27.519> you<00:02:28.519> can<00:02:28.639> choose<00:02:28.879> to<00:02:29.090> reuse<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.659> or

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
inside you can choose to reuse that or

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.720 
inside you can choose to reuse that or
make<00:02:30.049> a<00:02:30.079> new<00:02:30.319> one<00:02:30.349> I<00:02:30.769> just<00:02:30.859> made<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.370> new<00:02:31.549> one

make a new one I just made a new one
again<00:02:31.969> take<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.540> seam<00:02:32.750> out<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:33.109> holds<00:02:33.469> the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
again take the seam out that holds the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.949 
again take the seam out that holds the
two<00:02:33.769> long<00:02:34.129> pieces<00:02:34.400> together<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.180> just<00:02:35.719> copy

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
two long pieces together and just copy

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.530 
two long pieces together and just copy
them<00:02:36.290> exactly<00:02:36.319> and<00:02:37.180> when<00:02:38.180> you're<00:02:38.269> done<00:02:38.359> with

them exactly and when you're done with

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.059 
them exactly and when you're done with
that<00:02:38.569> you<00:02:38.900> have<00:02:39.079> all<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.439> pieces<00:02:39.650> cut<00:02:40.040> out

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
that you have all the pieces cut out

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.920 
that you have all the pieces cut out
that<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.489> will<00:02:40.639> need<00:02:40.790> for<00:02:41.030> this<00:02:41.120> tie<00:02:41.389> okay

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
that you will need for this tie okay

that you will need for this tie okay
your<00:02:42.230> first<00:02:42.409> step<00:02:42.709> is<00:02:42.859> to<00:02:42.980> take<00:02:43.159> those<00:02:43.310> two

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
your first step is to take those two

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.300 
your first step is to take those two
lining<00:02:43.999> pieces<00:02:44.409> overlap<00:02:45.409> them<00:02:45.680> where<00:02:45.919> you<00:02:46.099> cut

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
lining pieces overlap them where you cut

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.339 
lining pieces overlap them where you cut
them<00:02:46.489> out<00:02:46.639> and<00:02:46.939> then<00:02:47.510> just<00:02:47.540> sew<00:02:47.989> them<00:02:48.169> together

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
them out and then just sew them together

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.740 
them out and then just sew them together
with<00:02:48.859> either<00:02:49.069> a<00:02:49.189> straight<00:02:49.579> seam<00:02:49.909> or<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.209> zig<00:02:50.719> zag

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
with either a straight seam or a zig zag

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.709 
with either a straight seam or a zig zag
seam<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.500> should<00:02:51.680> look<00:02:51.799> kind<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.069> like<00:02:52.219> this

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:52.719 
seam it should look kind of like this

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.659 
seam it should look kind of like this
next<00:02:53.719> take<00:02:53.989> your<00:02:54.139> two<00:02:54.319> outer<00:02:54.530> pieces<00:02:54.949> and<00:02:55.430> lay

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:55.669 
next take your two outer pieces and lay

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.550 
next take your two outer pieces and lay
them<00:02:55.849> perpendicular<00:02:56.569> to<00:02:56.599> each<00:02:56.900> other<00:02:57.109> at<00:02:57.379> the

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
them perpendicular to each other at the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.229 
them perpendicular to each other at the
middle<00:02:57.859> seam<00:02:58.159> should<00:02:58.579> look<00:02:58.790> kind<00:02:59.060> of<00:02:59.090> like

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
middle seam should look kind of like

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.390 
middle seam should look kind of like
this<00:02:59.510> make<00:03:00.169> sure<00:03:00.199> you<00:03:00.439> lay<00:03:00.560> in<00:03:00.680> perpendicular

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
this make sure you lay in perpendicular

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.759 
this make sure you lay in perpendicular
and<00:03:01.699> and<00:03:02.180> then<00:03:02.659> sew<00:03:02.959> them<00:03:03.139> together<00:03:03.290> with

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
and and then sew them together with

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.949 
and and then sew them together with
right<00:03:04.010> sides<00:03:04.340> facing<00:03:04.569> then<00:03:05.569> just<00:03:05.780> take<00:03:05.930> that

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
right sides facing then just take that

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.780 
right sides facing then just take that
to<00:03:06.199> your<00:03:06.230> ironing<00:03:06.680> board<00:03:06.739> and<00:03:07.189> press<00:03:07.579> that

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:09.949 
seam down really flat and nice so it'll

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:11.679 
seam down really flat and nice so it'll
look<00:03:10.040> good<00:03:10.250> when<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:10.699> finished<00:03:11.060> product<00:03:11.480> is
