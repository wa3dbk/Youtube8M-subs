games<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.100> main<00:00:53.309> reason<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.180> I

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
games and the main reason for that is I

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.369 
games and the main reason for that is I
hate<00:00:56.399> getting<00:00:56.699> locked<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.420> by<00:00:57.690> stuff<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.170> think

that<00:00:58.410> ruins<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.160> lot<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> fun<00:00:59.879> obviously<00:01:00.600> in

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
that ruins a lot of the fun obviously in

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.930 
that ruins a lot of the fun obviously in
games<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.500> plant<00:01:01.859> aside<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.579> need

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
rid of them or anything like that you'd

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.960

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
to start doing stuff like that but it

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.609 
to start doing stuff like that but it
just<00:01:11.700> makes<00:01:12.119> flying<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.049> much<00:01:13.200> fun<00:01:13.409> for

war thunder you're not going to have
lock<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.750> missiles<00:01:25.729> thankfully<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.270> makes

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
lock on missiles thankfully and it makes

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.590 
lock on missiles thankfully and it makes
it<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.229> much<00:01:28.290> more<00:01:28.560> fun<00:01:29.310> obviously<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:30.450> don't

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
it so much more fun obviously you don't

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.910 
it so much more fun obviously you don't
have<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> balancing<00:01:31.259> stuff<00:01:31.439> because<00:01:31.770> there

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
have the balancing stuff because there

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.060 
have the balancing stuff because there
are<00:01:32.070> no<00:01:32.250> infantry<00:01:32.909> least<00:01:33.750> not<00:01:33.990> yet<00:01:34.040> actually<00:01:35.040> i

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
are no infantry least not yet actually i

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
are no infantry least not yet actually i
don't<00:01:35.159> think<00:01:35.369> there's<00:01:35.490> ever<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:35.970> in

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
don't think there's ever going to be in

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.929 
don't think there's ever going to be in
between<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.479> game<00:01:36.689> they<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:38.840> naval<00:01:39.840> and

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
between this game they do have naval and

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.240 
between this game they do have naval and
armor<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.119> think<00:01:42.540> lined<00:01:42.930> up<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.470> eventually<00:01:44.070> be

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
armor I think lined up to eventually be

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.240 
armor I think lined up to eventually be
put<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.850> war<00:01:45.030> thunder<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:46.350> don't<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:47.070> how

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
put in the war thunder I don't know how

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.710 
put in the war thunder I don't know how
that's<00:01:47.490> actually<00:01:47.970> going<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.180> work<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.600> it

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
that's actually going to work but it

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.230 
that's actually going to work but it
sounds<00:01:49.290> very<00:01:49.320> intriguing<00:01:50.060> especially<00:01:51.060> if

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
sounds very intriguing especially if

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.580 
sounds very intriguing especially if
they're<00:01:51.420> going<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.810> anywhere<00:01:52.229> near<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
they're going to have anywhere near the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.780 
they're going to have anywhere near the
number<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.310> ships<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.060> tanks<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.780> they<00:01:55.590> do

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
number of ships and tanks as they do

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.719 
number of ships and tanks as they do
planes<00:01:56.790> currently<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.750> think<00:01:58.049> there's<00:01:58.229> almost

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
planes currently I think there's almost

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.470 
planes currently I think there's almost
200<00:02:00.110> real-life<00:02:01.110> World<00:02:01.710> War<00:02:01.920> two<00:02:02.189> planes<00:02:02.610> in

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
200 real-life World War two planes in

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.410 
200 real-life World War two planes in
from<00:02:03.630> there<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.810> think<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.110> timelines<00:02:04.740> spread

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
from there I think the timelines spread

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.890 
from there I think the timelines spread
somewhere<00:02:06.420> from<00:02:07.370> 1927<00:02:08.370> to<00:02:08.430> 48<00:02:08.880> or<00:02:09.090> might<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.450> 28

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:09.900 
somewhere from 1927 to 48 or might be 28

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.960 
somewhere from 1927 to 48 or might be 28
247<00:02:10.620> something<00:02:10.950> like<00:02:11.070> that<00:02:11.250> almost<00:02:11.370> 20<00:02:11.760> years

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
247 something like that almost 20 years

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.350 
247 something like that almost 20 years
around<00:02:12.750> 20<00:02:13.170> years<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.880> timeline<00:02:15.330> for

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
around 20 years of of a timeline for

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.240 
around 20 years of of a timeline for
where<00:02:16.050> planes<00:02:16.350> are<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.710> can<00:02:16.860> you're<00:02:17.160> gonna

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
where planes are you can you're gonna

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.110 
where planes are you can you're gonna
see<00:02:17.550> how<00:02:17.930> crazy<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.290> difference<00:02:19.710> is<00:02:20.000> over<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
see how crazy the difference is over the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.030 
see how crazy the difference is over the
course<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.600> 20<00:02:21.990> meet<00:02:22.170> 20<00:02:22.590> years<00:02:22.890> you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
course of that 20 meet 20 years you

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.040 
course of that 20 meet 20 years you
literally<00:02:23.430> have<00:02:23.790> at<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> start<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.570> roll<00:02:24.900> or

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
literally have at the start of roll or

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.700 
literally have at the start of roll or
two<00:02:25.080> or<00:02:25.350> before<00:02:25.470> World<00:02:25.890> War<00:02:25.950> two<00:02:26.190> in<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.600> 20s

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
two or before World War two in the 20s

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.590 
two or before World War two in the 20s
you<00:02:28.710> have<00:02:28.890> biplanes<00:02:29.550> which<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.270> can<00:02:30.390> use<00:02:30.420> in

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
you have biplanes which you can use in

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.150 
you have biplanes which you can use in
the<00:02:30.690> game<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.050> then<00:02:31.260> you'll<00:02:31.380> get<00:02:31.560> all<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:32.040> way

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
the game and then you'll get all the way

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.390 
the game and then you'll get all the way
up<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.790> first<00:02:33.510> starting<00:02:34.350> jets<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:35.250> they

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
up to the first starting jets that they

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.450 
up to the first starting jets that they
ever<00:02:35.550> had<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.530> you'll<00:02:37.530> just<00:02:37.650> see<00:02:37.800> how<00:02:37.980> crazy

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
ever had and you'll just see how crazy

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.630 
ever had and you'll just see how crazy
technology<00:02:39.150> with<00:02:40.110> planes<00:02:40.470> advanced<00:02:41.280> over<00:02:41.550> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
technology with planes advanced over the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.740 
technology with planes advanced over the
course<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.300> 20<00:02:42.690> years<00:02:42.930> it's<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:43.380> unreal

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
course of that 20 years it's just unreal

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.550 
course of that 20 years it's just unreal
and<00:02:45.750> that's<00:02:45.900> one<00:02:46.050> of<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.230> things<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.530> really

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
and that's one of the things I really

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.190 
and that's one of the things I really
like<00:02:46.950> about<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.430> game<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.690> does

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
like about this game is that it does

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.230 
like about this game is that it does
kind<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.650> show<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.220> history<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.760> these

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
kind of show you the history of these

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.510 
kind of show you the history of these
planes<00:02:51.600> I've<00:02:51.840> never<00:02:52.020> been<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.260> big<00:02:52.350> plane<00:02:53.280> guy

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
planes I've never been a big plane guy

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.670 
planes I've never been a big plane guy
I've<00:02:53.730> always<00:02:53.880> been<00:02:54.090> somewhat<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.870> world<00:02:55.530> war

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
I've always been somewhat of a world war

I've always been somewhat of a world war
2<00:02:56.040> enthusiasts<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.150> guess<00:02:58.020> that's<00:02:58.560> how<00:02:58.680> you

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
2 enthusiasts I guess that's how you

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.990 
2 enthusiasts I guess that's how you
want<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.010> put<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.310> I've<00:02:59.610> always<00:02:59.790> been

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
want to put it I've always been

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.700 
want to put it I've always been
intrigued<00:03:00.390> by<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.600> weapons<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.260> stuff<00:03:01.440> um

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
intrigued by the weapons and stuff um

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.520 
intrigued by the weapons and stuff um
kind<00:03:02.550> of<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.700> gun<00:03:02.940> collector<00:03:03.210> I<00:03:03.840> don't<00:03:04.440> really

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
kind of a gun collector I don't really

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.800 
kind of a gun collector I don't really
have<00:03:04.800> too<00:03:04.950> many<00:03:05.040> guns<00:03:05.280> but<00:03:05.640> if<00:03:05.730> i<00:03:05.880> had<00:03:06.120> money<00:03:06.450> to

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
have too many guns but if i had money to

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.040 
have too many guns but if i had money to
spend<00:03:07.080> more<00:03:07.830> on<00:03:07.860> guns<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:09.240> would<00:03:09.480> be<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.660> lot<00:03:10.020> of

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
spend more on guns it would be a lot of

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.780 
spend more on guns it would be a lot of
World<00:03:10.380> War<00:03:10.470> two<00:03:10.560> stuff<00:03:10.980> it's<00:03:11.220> stuff<00:03:11.550> I've

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
World War two stuff it's stuff I've

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.260 
World War two stuff it's stuff I've
always<00:03:12.150> found<00:03:12.600> very<00:03:13.440> interesting<00:03:13.700> so<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.730> think

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
always found very interesting so I think

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.150 
always found very interesting so I think
that's<00:03:15.510> what<00:03:15.750> actually<00:03:16.080> drew<00:03:16.410> me<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.800> were

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
that's what actually drew me to were

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.550 
that's what actually drew me to were
thunders<00:03:17.550> fact<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.120> it's<00:03:18.240> real<00:03:18.510> world<00:03:19.350> war

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
thunders fact that it's real world war

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.590 
thunders fact that it's real world war
two<00:03:19.739> planes<00:03:20.070> I've<00:03:20.730> always<00:03:20.970> kind<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.420> had<00:03:21.540> a

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
two planes I've always kind of had a

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.440 
two planes I've always kind of had a
thing<00:03:21.690> for<00:03:22.110> World<00:03:22.830> War<00:03:22.950> two<00:03:23.610> fighter<00:03:24.090> pilot

thing for World War two fighter pilot

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.170 
thing for World War two fighter pilot
games<00:03:24.630> but<00:03:25.590> there<00:03:25.739> hasn't<00:03:25.950> really<00:03:26.130> been<00:03:26.430> any

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
that I've really known about I guess but

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.440 
that I've really known about I guess but
yeah<00:03:34.560> you're<00:03:35.459> going<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.700> probably<00:03:35.910> see<00:03:36.239> more
