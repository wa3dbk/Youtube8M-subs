hydrating<00:03:54.550> face<00:03:55.550> facial<00:03:56.270> lotion<00:03:56.630> I<00:03:56.720> guess

hydrating face facial lotion I guess

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.480 
hydrating face facial lotion I guess
it's<00:03:57.080> kind<00:03:57.260> of<00:03:57.290> like<00:03:57.410> a<00:03:57.470> mask<00:03:57.920> and<00:03:58.190> facial
