00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
any double stitching on this so you know

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.340 
any double stitching on this so you know
if<00:03:36.090> double<00:03:36.660> stitching<00:03:36.959> which<00:03:37.140> are<00:03:37.260> looking

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
if double stitching which are looking

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.810 
if double stitching which are looking
for<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.709> then<00:03:37.829> this<00:03:37.920> probably<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.340> in<00:03:38.400> fact<00:03:38.640> for

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
for it then this probably is in fact for

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.270 
for it then this probably is in fact for
you<00:03:38.910> but<00:03:39.810> everything<00:03:40.320> does<00:03:40.500> seem<00:03:40.530> extremely

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
you but everything does seem extremely

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.400 
you but everything does seem extremely
heavy-duty<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.940> zippers<00:03:42.299> like<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.540> said<00:03:42.750> very

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
heavy-duty the zippers like I said very

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.009 
heavy-duty the zippers like I said very
heavy-duty<00:03:43.680> right<00:03:44.010> out<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.250> bag<00:03:45.019> comes

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
heavy-duty right out of the bag comes

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.460 
heavy-duty right out of the bag comes
with<00:03:46.079> a<00:03:46.200> nice<00:03:46.350> padded<00:03:47.630> carry<00:03:48.630> strap<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:49.410> you

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
with a nice padded carry strap so you

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.160 
with a nice padded carry strap so you
can<00:03:49.590> throw<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.799> over<00:03:50.010> your<00:03:50.040> shoulder<00:03:50.930> -<00:03:51.930> nice

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
definitely a heavy duty on there

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.789 
definitely a heavy duty on there
probably<00:03:57.959> can't<00:03:58.109> see<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.350> stitching<00:03:58.650> in<00:03:58.739> this

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
probably can't see the stitching in this

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.319 
probably can't see the stitching in this
video<00:03:59.100> but<00:03:59.280> in<00:03:59.430> our<00:03:59.519> full<00:03:59.730> review<00:03:59.910> I'll<00:04:00.150> show

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.270 
just
on<00:04:07.000> there<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:08.680> loop<00:04:08.860> system<00:04:10.500> obviously<00:04:11.500> you

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
on there the loop system obviously you

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.530 
on there the loop system obviously you
know<00:04:12.400> with<00:04:12.520> the<00:04:12.610> block<00:04:12.790> with<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.030> X<00:04:13.180> through

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
know with the block with the X through

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.480 
know with the block with the X through
it<00:04:13.570> on<00:04:13.780> there<00:04:14.080> and<00:04:14.320> rivets<00:04:14.890> as<00:04:15.010> well<00:04:15.190> but<00:04:15.310> hold

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
it on there and rivets as well but hold

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.660 
it on there and rivets as well but hold
that<00:04:15.610> in<00:04:15.820> so<00:04:16.810> all<00:04:17.110> in<00:04:17.260> all<00:04:17.380> it's<00:04:17.980> a<00:04:18.130> probably

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
that in so all in all it's a probably

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.580 
that in so all in all it's a probably
one<00:04:18.790> of<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:18.940> better<00:04:19.060> bags<00:04:19.270> I<00:04:19.420> have<00:04:19.660> I<00:04:20.020> do<00:04:20.350> have

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
one of the better bags I have I do have

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.340 
one of the better bags I have I do have
a<00:04:20.650> condor<00:04:21.220> bag<00:04:21.430> with<00:04:21.580> me<00:04:21.730> as<00:04:21.850> well<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:22.350> this

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
a condor bag with me as well and this

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.590 
a condor bag with me as well and this
this<00:04:23.650> voodoo<00:04:23.830> tactical<00:04:24.490> probably<00:04:25.270> runs<00:04:25.480> a

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
this voodoo tactical probably runs a

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.290 
this voodoo tactical probably runs a
little<00:04:25.690> bit<00:04:25.840> more<00:04:26.080> but<00:04:26.770> it<00:04:26.920> definitely<00:04:27.300> from

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
little bit more but it definitely from

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.940 
little bit more but it definitely from
what<00:04:28.420> I<00:04:28.450> can<00:04:28.570> tell<00:04:28.720> it's<00:04:29.590> going<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:29.830> be<00:04:29.920> a

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
what I can tell it's going to be a

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.030 
what I can tell it's going to be a
little<00:04:30.130> bit<00:04:30.310> more<00:04:30.460> worthwhile<00:04:30.670> and<00:04:31.090> honestly

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
little bit more worthwhile and honestly

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.200 
little bit more worthwhile and honestly
it's<00:04:33.040> got<00:04:33.190> this<00:04:33.340> patch<00:04:33.550> system<00:04:33.940> right<00:04:34.030> on<00:04:34.150> the

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
it's got this patch system right on the

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.780 
it's got this patch system right on the
front<00:04:34.420> so<00:04:35.050> if<00:04:35.110> you're<00:04:35.260> a<00:04:35.290> lead<00:04:35.470> farmer<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:36.610> can

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
front so if you're a lead farmer you can

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.020 
front so if you're a lead farmer you can
throw<00:04:37.360> that<00:04:37.510> right<00:04:37.660> on<00:04:37.720> there
