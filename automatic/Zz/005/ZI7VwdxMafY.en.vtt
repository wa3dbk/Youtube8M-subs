00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
wires well and whatnot motherboard is a

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:38.309 
wires well and whatnot motherboard is a
asus<00:01:29.310> m5a<00:01:33.330> to<00:01:34.330> PCI<00:01:34.780> Express<00:01:35.740> slots<00:01:36.490> I<00:01:37.450> could

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
asus m5a to PCI Express slots I could

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:41.490 
asus m5a to PCI Express slots I could
cross<00:01:38.560> fire<00:01:38.830> but<00:01:39.250> it's<00:01:39.509> only<00:01:40.509> a<00:01:40.750> hybrid<00:01:41.319> cross

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
cross fire but it's only a hybrid cross

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.460 
cross fire but it's only a hybrid cross
fire<00:01:41.770> so<00:01:42.100> I<00:01:42.520> just<00:01:43.030> can't<00:01:43.390> really<00:01:43.810> use<00:01:44.020> any<00:01:44.319> of

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
fire so I just can't really use any of

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.649 
fire so I just can't really use any of
the<00:01:44.679> higher<00:01:44.890> and<00:01:45.310> cards<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:46.030> crossfire<00:01:46.479> on

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
the higher and cards to crossfire on

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.339 
the higher and cards to crossfire on
this<00:01:46.780> board<00:01:47.020> unfortunately<00:01:47.679> arm<00:01:49.170> next<00:01:50.170> I'm

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:50.349 
this board unfortunately arm next I'm

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:52.979 
this board unfortunately arm next I'm
just<00:01:50.379> going<00:01:50.679> to<00:01:50.709> move<00:01:51.129> on<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:52.030> CPU<00:01:52.390> I<00:01:52.690> have

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:52.989 
just going to move on to the CPU I have

00:01:52.989 --> 00:02:00.410 
just going to move on to the CPU I have
a<00:01:53.170> AMD<00:01:55.080> 965<00:01:57.300> Black<00:01:58.300> Edition<00:01:58.450> overclocked<00:01:59.259> and

a AMD 965 Black Edition overclocked and
3.9<00:02:01.420> gigahertz<00:02:02.379> and<00:02:02.830> here<00:02:03.789> is<00:02:03.970> my<00:02:04.179> cpu<00:02:04.599> cooler

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
3.9 gigahertz and here is my cpu cooler

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:12.720 
3.9 gigahertz and here is my cpu cooler
is<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.590> noctua<00:02:06.869> NH<00:02:07.869> c<00:02:08.560> 12<00:02:10.200> se14<00:02:11.200> i<00:02:12.160> love<00:02:12.610> this

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
is a noctua NH c 12 se14 i love this

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.540 
is a noctua NH c 12 se14 i love this
cooler<00:02:13.090> it's<00:02:13.269> a<00:02:13.330> low<00:02:13.450> profile<00:02:13.959> cooler<00:02:14.550> it's

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
cooler it's a low profile cooler it's

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.670 
cooler it's a low profile cooler it's
pretty<00:02:15.849> massive

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.880 

but<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.860> does<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.280> job<00:02:20.310> at<00:02:20.819> 3.9<00:02:21.480> gigahertz<00:02:22.470> it

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
but it does the job at 3.9 gigahertz it

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.290 
but it does the job at 3.9 gigahertz it
actually<00:02:23.640> idles<00:02:24.180> at<00:02:24.620> about<00:02:25.620> 29<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.550> 30<00:02:27.200> degrees

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
actually idles at about 29 to 30 degrees

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:37.070 
actually idles at about 29 to 30 degrees
Celsius<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:31.610> basically<00:02:32.610> on<00:02:34.760> load<00:02:35.760> high<00:02:36.720> loads

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
Celsius and basically on load high loads

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.520 
Celsius and basically on load high loads
i<00:02:37.560> would<00:02:38.129> say<00:02:38.340> around<00:02:38.700> 42<00:02:39.629> degrees<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.500> it

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
i would say around 42 degrees so it

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.270 
i would say around 42 degrees so it
keeps<00:02:40.799> pretty<00:02:41.099> cool<00:02:41.400> actually<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.860> next

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
keeps pretty cool actually the next

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.160 
keeps pretty cool actually the next
thing<00:02:44.700> i<00:02:44.879> want<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.269> show<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:47.540> ram<00:02:48.540> i<00:02:48.840> have

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
thing i want to show is the ram i have

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.130 
thing i want to show is the ram i have

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.839 
played surprisingly in ultra settings as
well<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:16.470> next<00:03:16.709> thing<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.459> power<00:03:17.640> supply

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
well the next thing is the power supply

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:26.059 
well the next thing is the power supply
I<00:03:18.239> have<00:03:19.079> a<00:03:19.349> closer<00:03:19.680> at<00:03:20.959> hx750<00:03:21.959> w<00:03:24.380> silver<00:03:25.380> 80

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
I have a closer at hx750 w silver 80

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.690 
I have a closer at hx750 w silver 80
silver<00:03:26.670> so<00:03:27.420> basically<00:03:28.079> as<00:03:28.500> cleaner<00:03:29.190> power<00:03:29.400> in

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
silver so basically as cleaner power in

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.840 
silver so basically as cleaner power in
power<00:03:30.420> consumption<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.139> better<00:03:31.700> also<00:03:32.700> as

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
power consumption is better also as

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.180 
power consumption is better also as
modular<00:03:33.299> so<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.989> cable<00:03:34.290> management<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:34.889> much

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
modular so the cable management is much

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.650 
modular so the cable management is much
better<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.849> could<00:03:36.030> just<00:03:36.209> choose<00:03:36.450> what

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
better and I could just choose what

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.349 
better and I could just choose what
cables<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.109> need<00:03:37.470> instead<00:03:37.950> having<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.280> big<00:03:39.060> mess

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
cables I need instead having a big mess

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.640 
cables I need instead having a big mess
