maybe<00:02:02.310> 20<00:02:02.700> 30<00:02:02.729> cents<00:02:03.360> each<00:02:03.510> on<00:02:04.909> Lego<00:02:05.909> designed

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
maybe 20 30 cents each on Lego designed

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.910 
maybe 20 30 cents each on Lego designed
by<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.540> or<00:02:06.870> Lego<00:02:07.049> factory<00:02:07.290> whatever<00:02:07.770> they're

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
by you or Lego factory whatever they're

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.240 
by you or Lego factory whatever they're
calling<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.369> now<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:09.959> what<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.110> use<00:02:10.409> for

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
calling it now so this is what I use for

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.800 
calling it now so this is what I use for
basically<00:02:12.920> light<00:02:13.920> transformers<00:02:14.640> legs<00:02:15.480> and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
basically light transformers legs and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.800 
basically light transformers legs and
arms<00:02:16.049> so<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.680> get<00:02:16.890> big<00:02:17.519> range<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.849> motion<00:02:17.909> so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
arms so you get big range of motion so

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.309 
arms so you get big range of motion so
your<00:02:18.930> transforms<00:02:19.470> don't<00:02:19.650> look<00:02:19.739> boxy<00:02:19.980> and

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
your transforms don't look boxy and

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.229 
your transforms don't look boxy and
ultimately<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.890> get<00:02:23.069> a<00:02:23.129> pretty<00:02:23.670> sturdy<00:02:23.879> fit

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
ultimately you get a pretty sturdy fit

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.630 
ultimately you get a pretty sturdy fit
within<00:02:24.420> your<00:02:24.540> pieces<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:25.860> can<00:02:26.069> be<00:02:26.099> set<00:02:26.519> up

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
within your pieces so this can be set up

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.660 
within your pieces so this can be set up
like<00:02:26.670> an<00:02:26.970> arm

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
like an arm

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.620 
like an arm
or<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:27.970> can<00:02:28.090> put<00:02:28.270> two<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.480> these<00:02:28.630> guys<00:02:28.960> on<00:02:30.630> and

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
or you can put two of these guys on and

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.480 
or you can put two of these guys on and
do<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.650> leg<00:02:32.980> as<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.760> can<00:02:33.940> see<00:02:34.150> here<00:02:34.510> in

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
do a leg as you can see here in

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.100 
do a leg as you can see here in
optimises<00:02:36.490> leg<00:02:36.730> maybe<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.540> can't<00:02:37.750> no<00:02:37.959> there

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
optimises leg maybe you can't no there

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.490 
optimises leg maybe you can't no there
we<00:02:38.230> go

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
we go

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.920 
we go
as<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:38.980> can<00:02:39.130> see<00:02:39.310> here<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:39.850> optimises<00:02:40.690> length

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
as you can see here and optimises length

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.480 
as you can see here and optimises length
there's<00:02:41.140> kind<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.440> two<00:02:41.500> there<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.100> that's<00:02:42.280> the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
there's kind of two there so that's the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:51.210 
there's kind of two there so that's the
section<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.940> next<00:02:48.970> kind<00:02:49.630> of<00:02:49.720> joint<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.980> can

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
section the next kind of joint you can

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.940 
section the next kind of joint you can
use<00:02:51.910> I<00:02:52.180> guess<00:02:52.320> would<00:02:53.320> be<00:02:53.500> for<00:02:53.709> something

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
use I guess would be for something

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.690 
use I guess would be for something
bigger<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:55.090> there's<00:02:56.220> this<00:02:57.220> here<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:59.700> since

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
bigger so there's this here and since

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.330 
bigger so there's this here and since
he's<00:03:00.880> big<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.360> heavy<00:03:01.600> I<00:03:01.900> use<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:03.190> more

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
he's big and heavy I use the more

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.530 
he's big and heavy I use the more
ratchet<00:03:03.820> type<00:03:04.030> joints<00:03:04.450> which<00:03:04.900> is<00:03:05.110> this<00:03:05.290> kind

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
ratchet type joints which is this kind

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.630 
ratchet type joints which is this kind
so<00:03:07.540> what<00:03:08.080> I<00:03:08.110> typically<00:03:08.650> do<00:03:08.920> is<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.340> can<00:03:09.489> either

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
so what I typically do is you can either

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.900 
so what I typically do is you can either
get<00:03:10.110> this<00:03:11.110> double<00:03:11.950> connector<00:03:12.400> kind<00:03:12.610> of<00:03:12.700> piece

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
get this double connector kind of piece

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.490 
get this double connector kind of piece
if<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.959> want<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.200> wider<00:03:14.410> transformer<00:03:15.190> or

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
if you want a wider transformer or

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.550 
if you want a wider transformer or
there's<00:03:17.500> this<00:03:17.769> one<00:03:18.040> which<00:03:18.610> I<00:03:18.940> think<00:03:19.030> was

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
there's this one which I think was

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.370 
there's this one which I think was
available<00:03:20.560> mostly<00:03:21.310> with<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:22.600> not<00:03:23.140> this

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
available mostly with the not this

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.140 
available mostly with the not this
Aquanaut<00:03:23.980> series<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.550> came<00:03:24.640> out<00:03:24.790> last<00:03:24.940> year

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
Aquanaut series that came out last year

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.380 
Aquanaut series that came out last year
but<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.350> one<00:03:26.530> from<00:03:26.860> probably<00:03:27.250> late<00:03:27.760> 90s<00:03:28.269> or

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
but the one from probably late 90s or

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.410 
but the one from probably late 90s or
early<00:03:28.420> 2000s<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:31.120> what<00:03:31.269> you<00:03:31.390> do<00:03:31.540> basically

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
early 2000s so what you do basically

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.900 
early 2000s so what you do basically
snap<00:03:34.420> them<00:03:34.600> in<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:38.680> there<00:03:38.860> you<00:03:38.890> can<00:03:39.160> see<00:03:39.430> so

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
snap them in and there you can see so

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.000 
snap them in and there you can see so
you've<00:03:40.060> got<00:03:40.299> knee<00:03:40.540> articulation<00:03:40.780> all<00:03:41.680> kinds

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
you've got knee articulation all kinds

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.860 
you've got knee articulation all kinds
articulation<00:03:42.579> this<00:03:43.090> four<00:03:43.329> legs<00:03:43.510> for<00:03:43.720> heavy

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
articulation this four legs for heavy

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.199 
articulation this four legs for heavy
transformers<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:45.310> good<00:03:45.579> part<00:03:45.850> about<00:03:45.910> these

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
transformers the good part about these

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.569 
transformers the good part about these
ones<00:03:46.480> is<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:47.290> whole<00:03:47.500> pin<00:03:47.860> holes<00:03:48.100> on<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.370> side

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
ones is the whole pin holes on the side

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.990 
ones is the whole pin holes on the side
so<00:03:49.269> what<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:49.750> can<00:03:49.930> do<00:03:50.140> is<00:03:50.350> if<00:03:51.310> four<00:03:51.579> legs<00:03:51.760> that

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
so what you can do is if four legs that

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.640 
so what you can do is if four legs that
fold<00:03:52.269> up<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:52.630> things<00:03:52.810> like<00:03:52.930> that<00:03:52.989> you<00:03:53.320> can<00:03:53.440> put

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
fold up and things like that you can put

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.350 
fold up and things like that you can put
them<00:03:53.769> on<00:03:53.860> a<00:03:53.920> pin<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.400> then<00:03:54.880> they<00:03:55.000> can<00:03:55.180> rotate

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
them on a pin and then they can rotate

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.810 
them on a pin and then they can rotate
around<00:03:55.660> so<00:03:56.079> you<00:03:56.170> can<00:03:56.350> you<00:03:56.560> know<00:03:56.650> hard<00:03:57.549> to<00:03:57.670> see

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
around so you can you know hard to see

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.319 
around so you can you know hard to see
here<00:03:58.769> but<00:03:59.769> you<00:03:59.890> can<00:04:00.040> basically<00:04:00.220> fold<00:04:01.030> up<00:04:01.180> on

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
here but you can basically fold up on

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.630 
here but you can basically fold up on
itself<00:04:01.720> so<00:04:02.049> they're<00:04:02.519> Transformers<00:04:03.519> should

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
itself so they're Transformers should

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.280 
itself so they're Transformers should
have<00:04:03.760> legs<00:04:04.150> that<00:04:04.360> fold<00:04:04.600> basically<00:04:04.959> up<00:04:05.049> at<00:04:05.170> the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
have legs that fold basically up at the

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.140 
have legs that fold basically up at the
knee<00:04:05.440> into<00:04:06.100> a<00:04:06.130> car<00:04:06.430> or<00:04:06.459> to<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.850> back<00:04:06.970> of<00:04:07.120> a

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
knee into a car or to the back of a

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.539 
knee into a car or to the back of a
truck<00:04:07.390> or<00:04:07.510> something<00:04:08.010> these<00:04:09.010> are<00:04:09.070> ideal

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
truck or something these are ideal

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.900 
truck or something these are ideal
without<00:04:10.769> functionality<00:04:11.769> so<00:04:12.280> again<00:04:12.519> these<00:04:12.850> are

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
without functionality so again these are

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.550 
without functionality so again these are
very<00:04:13.060> versatile<00:04:13.799> my<00:04:14.799> favorite<00:04:16.229> for<00:04:17.229> building

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
very versatile my favorite for building

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.440 
very versatile my favorite for building
legs<00:04:18.090> very<00:04:19.090> sturdy<00:04:19.510> make<00:04:20.019> sure<00:04:20.140> Lego

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
legs very sturdy make sure Lego

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.230 
legs very sturdy make sure Lego
transformers<00:04:22.450> look<00:04:22.720> very<00:04:23.760> articulated<00:04:24.760> and

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
transformers look very articulated and

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.260 
transformers look very articulated and
very<00:04:25.830> full<00:04:26.830> of<00:04:26.950> motion<00:04:27.190> not<00:04:27.610> just<00:04:27.940> kind<00:04:28.180> of

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
very full of motion not just kind of

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.969 
very full of motion not just kind of
stiff<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:28.780> bricky<00:04:29.200> if<00:04:29.289> you<00:04:29.440> were<00:04:29.500> just<00:04:29.620> using

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
stiff and bricky if you were just using

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.779 
stiff and bricky if you were just using
straight<00:04:30.910> forward<00:04:31.390> kind<00:04:31.600> of<00:04:32.250> joints<00:04:33.250> so

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
straight forward kind of joints so

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.000 
straight forward kind of joints so
really<00:04:34.450> good<00:04:34.690> I<00:04:34.810> suggest<00:04:35.350> these<00:04:35.590> are<00:04:35.740> hard<00:04:35.919> to

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
really good I suggest these are hard to

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.690 
really good I suggest these are hard to
find<00:04:36.280> now<00:04:36.460> the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.220 

look<00:04:39.880> for<00:04:40.060> them<00:04:40.150> on<00:04:40.270> ebay<00:04:40.690> that's<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:41.050> just

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
look for them on ebay that's I just

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.480 
look for them on ebay that's I just
bought<00:04:41.410> a<00:04:41.440> whole<00:04:41.680> bunch<00:04:41.860> so<00:04:42.160> there's<00:04:42.370> more

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
bought a whole bunch so there's more

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.200 
bought a whole bunch so there's more
Transformers<00:04:43.180> coming<00:04:44.760> they<00:04:45.760> don't<00:04:45.970> think

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
Transformers coming they don't think

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.760 
Transformers coming they don't think
they<00:04:46.300> sell<00:04:46.570> is<00:04:46.720> unlegal<00:04:46.990> factory<00:04:47.500> that<00:04:47.650> you

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
they sell is unlegal factory that you
