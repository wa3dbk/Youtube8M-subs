in<00:03:23.549> this<00:03:23.670> game<00:03:23.880> seems<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.480> be<00:03:24.540> pretty<00:03:25.049> good<00:03:25.380> in

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
in this game seems to be pretty good in

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.160 
in this game seems to be pretty good in
the<00:03:25.590> xbox<00:03:25.950> 360<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.489> playstation<00:03:26.610> 3<00:03:27.360> so<00:03:27.810> if<00:03:27.959> not

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
the xbox 360 and playstation 3 so if not

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.720 
the xbox 360 and playstation 3 so if not
i'm<00:03:28.350> not<00:03:28.380> really<00:03:28.650> sure<00:03:28.769> how<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.100> actually<00:03:29.400> did

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
i'm not really sure how to actually did

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.220 
i'm not really sure how to actually did
this<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.090> know<00:03:30.209> this<00:03:30.360> game<00:03:30.510> is<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> big<00:03:30.989> game

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
this you know this game is a big game

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.289 
this you know this game is a big game
but<00:03:31.500> i<00:03:32.130> think<00:03:32.579> it<00:03:32.670> has<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.820> do<00:03:33.030> with<00:03:33.209> the

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
but i think it has to do with the

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.000 
but i think it has to do with the
installing<00:03:34.019> that<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.290> had<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.739> need<00:03:34.890> to

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
installing that you had that you need to

battlefield 4 is ok but yeah I was a

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.970 
battlefield 4 is ok but yeah I was a
little<00:05:46.880> bitty<00:05:47.030> game<00:05:47.210> to<00:05:47.510> you<00:05:47.960> so<00:05:48.320> yeah<00:05:48.770> let's

little bitty game to you so yeah let's

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.760 
little bitty game to you so yeah let's
move<00:05:49.100> on<00:05:49.310> normal<00:05:50.150> walking<00:05:50.419> is<00:05:50.900> quite<00:05:51.230> slow<00:05:51.470> now

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
move on normal walking is quite slow now

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.380 
move on normal walking is quite slow now
we<00:05:51.830> are<00:05:52.070> we<00:05:52.220> already<00:05:52.430> can<00:05:52.669> see<00:05:52.940> this<00:05:53.120> and<00:05:53.300> one

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
we are we already can see this and one

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.360 
we are we already can see this and one
of<00:05:53.480> the<00:05:53.570> trailers<00:05:53.930> that<00:05:53.960> Michael<00:05:54.620> is<00:05:54.740> actually

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
of the trailers that Michael is actually

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.950 
of the trailers that Michael is actually
very<00:05:55.430> slow<00:05:55.910> walking<00:05:56.240> I<00:05:56.510> think<00:05:56.720> it<00:05:56.780> will<00:05:56.840> be

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
very slow walking I think it will be

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.830 
very slow walking I think it will be
pretty<00:05:57.169> annoying<00:05:57.500> but<00:05:57.860> you<00:05:57.950> know<00:05:58.630> you<00:05:59.630> can

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
pretty annoying but you know you can

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.210 
pretty annoying but you know you can
just<00:05:59.870> run<00:06:00.200> yeah<00:06:00.440> let's<00:06:00.650> move<00:06:00.800> on<00:06:00.950> to<00:06:01.100> the<00:06:01.190> next

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
just run yeah let's move on to the next

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.980 
just run yeah let's move on to the next
thing<00:06:01.460> the<00:06:01.970> weather<00:06:02.180> system<00:06:02.660> it's<00:06:02.780> quite

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
thing the weather system it's quite

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.230 
thing the weather system it's quite
different<00:06:03.350> act<00:06:03.710> it<00:06:03.830> actually<00:06:04.220> has<00:06:04.430> virtual

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
different act it actually has virtual

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.290 
different act it actually has virtual
Sun<00:06:05.630> race<00:06:05.900> which<00:06:06.260> is<00:06:06.530> as<00:06:07.160> well<00:06:07.640> as<00:06:07.790> thing<00:06:08.030> that

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
Sun race which is as well as thing that

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.270 
Sun race which is as well as thing that
battlefield<00:06:08.660> had<00:06:09.080> or<00:06:09.410> while<00:06:09.950> some<00:06:10.160> other

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
battlefield had or while some other

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.520 
battlefield had or while some other
games<00:06:10.550> have<00:06:10.790> this<00:06:10.970> as<00:06:11.090> well<00:06:11.300> but<00:06:11.540> it<00:06:12.260> just

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
games have this as well but it just

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.500 
games have this as well but it just
makes<00:06:12.740> the<00:06:12.980> game<00:06:13.370> more<00:06:13.640> realistic<00:06:14.300> when<00:06:14.390> you

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
makes the game more realistic when you

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.690 
makes the game more realistic when you
look<00:06:14.750> into<00:06:14.930> the<00:06:15.080> Sun<00:06:15.440> that<00:06:15.980> you<00:06:16.100> won't<00:06:16.400> see

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700

look into the Sun that you won't see
anything<00:06:17.260> that<00:06:18.260> you<00:06:18.680> know<00:06:18.970> surrounds<00:06:19.970> you

anything that you know surrounds you

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.450 
anything that you know surrounds you
because<00:06:20.960> of<00:06:21.080> you<00:06:21.200> if<00:06:21.410> you<00:06:21.470> in<00:06:21.800> real<00:06:22.040> life<00:06:22.220> if

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
because of you if you in real life if

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.250 
because of you if you in real life if
you<00:06:22.640> look<00:06:22.820> into<00:06:23.000> the<00:06:23.210> Sun<00:06:23.450> you<00:06:23.720> can't<00:06:23.990> see

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.020 
you look into the Sun you can't see
anything<00:06:24.530> for<00:06:25.040> real<00:06:25.190> you<00:06:25.460> cannot<00:06:25.700> see

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
anything for real you cannot see

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.330 
anything for real you cannot see
anything<00:06:26.270> so<00:06:26.900> that<00:06:27.440> is<00:06:27.620> what<00:06:27.770> rock<00:06:27.890> star<00:06:28.160> tried

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
anything so that is what rock star tried

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
anything so that is what rock star tried
to<00:06:28.570> remake<00:06:29.570> in<00:06:29.930> this<00:06:30.050> game<00:06:30.290> so<00:06:30.919> the<00:06:31.669> frame<00:06:32.060> rate

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
to remake in this game so the frame rate

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.050 
to remake in this game so the frame rate
in<00:06:32.570> GTA<00:06:32.990> 5<00:06:33.229> is<00:06:33.260> pretty<00:06:33.710> consistent<00:06:33.979> and<00:06:34.700> there

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
in GTA 5 is pretty consistent and there

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.330 
in GTA 5 is pretty consistent and there
seems<00:06:35.330> to<00:06:35.539> be<00:06:35.630> no<00:06:35.930> lag<00:06:36.320> when<00:06:36.979> you<00:06:37.160> are

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
seems to be no lag when you are

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.119 
seems to be no lag when you are
switching<00:06:37.669> with

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:38.129 
switching with

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:41.029 
switching with
when<00:06:38.249> characters<00:06:39.050> when<00:06:40.050> you're<00:06:40.409> in<00:06:40.529> a<00:06:40.589> mission

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 
when characters when you're in a mission

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:43.579 
when characters when you're in a mission
so<00:06:41.309> a<00:06:41.580> lot<00:06:42.239> of<00:06:42.270> people<00:06:42.389> were<00:06:42.809> complaining<00:06:43.050> like
