00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.740
 metal forum read section me 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.890
 modest mesh 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.710
 some helpful tips happen when 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.200
 rock any input details 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.599
 just a coffin of grief to put it mildly need 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.350
 knock out the UN bearing is pressed into 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.070
 deaf 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.260
 u ancient way but effective you take 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.800
 internal clip pick cylinder 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.890
 yall with a drill killed if minus 2 weave 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.170
 then the bearing flies out like a cork from 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.090
 bottles there grease thick well type litol 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.600
 then something like that in milk 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:44.700
 you will present that is to extrude it from there 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:46.890
 here I am just not what to call not 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.870
 can you done good and so back 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.870
 this is a bearing knock out here applies 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.840
 things like that now he's ready all 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.289
 lavished as per extruded recorded through 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.210
 textolite can be tight wood and such 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.549
 something of a certain size that is 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.670
 this is a rough mold pusher 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.130
 polished 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.470
 and I have such blanks if they are 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.110
 also put on a certain grind 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.080
 size then let minus 1 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.640
 like this all the other tapes 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.890
 respectively under the bearings 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.000
 only bearings are possible what else 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.369
 happens here but it works but for this 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.400
 work and from the racer all charge me 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:34.470
 all chasing the night Lord Shiva Dai Li 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.280
 Intact remained and accordingly facilitate 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.340
 the flywheel is here and here 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.200
 redraw different options i.e. 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.600
 reprove him in a circle on all sides from 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.060
 separate topic and redrawing the crown 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.180
 shake it inserted what with it a glass 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.829
 options have different lead or without 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.340
 crown and work that's what I now 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:02:00.090
 did bummed the ring this i squandered 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.369
 on kamaz drives cams back yet 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.219
 I stayed I say damn drives do not drag 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.399
 one by one only two people went 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.050
 take a second disc and work there 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.860
 quite complicated to 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.420
 make it this 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.180
 homemade on rails and here is the spacer 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.910
 spacer on until I polished 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.970
 put it on a sanding here like that 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.940
 showed polished bearings clips and 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.010
 Found another clip to see the 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.940
 ground networks I'll take 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.280
 to put the head upright 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.550
 milling machine you diar very conveniently 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.160
 when auto attack walks and do not need a parallel 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.360
 the shadow of a novice but such rings from 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.990
 waste to income 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.820
 they need a lot of staff quietly 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.790
 formed here is not particularly visible but they 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.680
 there are different diameters of different thicknesses and on 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.090
 and the same thing so it happens 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.120
 cams let's go home back or else 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:05.470
 what here's how it showed sly here 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.030
 Spacer 150 requires well conflicts 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.160
 cams of course make even if 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.430
 did that you can get lost in them here a 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.740
 having such distance rings is possible 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.459
 detail so how to draw cams 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:22.660
 Naturally similar indicator dosochki 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:25.420
 caught up and machined but that work on yes in 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.380
 principle interesting on the Japanese did 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.400
 brake discs 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.770
 but the client also failed to take off 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.600
 already with the detail here and I have not had time 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.340
 do also had to do everything run 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.700
 but so useful 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.700
 small tips for new meetings
