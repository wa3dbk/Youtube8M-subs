00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.640 
do another tactical flashlight review
this<00:00:03.060> is<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.389> one<00:00:03.540> that<00:00:03.629> I<00:00:03.720> keep<00:00:03.929> in<00:00:04.049> my<00:00:04.080> go<00:00:04.410> bag

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
this is the one that I keep in my go bag

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.160 
this is the one that I keep in my go bag
this<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.850> Phoenix<00:00:06.620> ta20<00:00:08.330> it's<00:00:09.330> similar<00:00:09.990> in

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
this is the Phoenix ta20 it's similar in

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.759 
this is the Phoenix ta20 it's similar in
design<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.910> the<00:00:11.910> defender<00:00:12.690> from<00:00:12.900> surefire<00:00:13.469> a

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
design to the defender from surefire a

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.029 
design to the defender from surefire a
little<00:00:14.099> bit<00:00:14.219> bigger<00:00:14.690> it's<00:00:15.690> got<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.520> the<00:00:19.039> bezel

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
little bit bigger it's got the the bezel

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.410 
little bit bigger it's got the the bezel
with<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.480> impact<00:00:21.480> edges<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.920> got<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.420> clip

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
with the impact edges it's got the clip

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.269 
with the impact edges it's got the clip
and<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:26.730> one<00:00:26.910> thing<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.410> has<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.650> instant<00:00:29.070> on

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
and the one thing I has the instant on

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.450 
and the one thing I has the instant on
too<00:00:30.000> which<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.480> nice<00:00:30.830> which<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.040> surefire

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
too which is nice which the surefire

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.540 
too which is nice which the surefire
also<00:00:32.880> has<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:34.410> thing<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.040> reason<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.340> carry

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
also has the thing I the reason I carry

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.310 
also has the thing I the reason I carry
this<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.760> my<00:00:35.850> go<00:00:36.030> bag<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.570> because<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.079> many

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
this in my go bag is because of the many

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.590 
this in my go bag is because of the many
settings<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.790> lowest<00:00:39.239> setting

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
settings this is on the lowest setting

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.369 
settings this is on the lowest setting
right<00:00:39.750> now<00:00:39.989> as<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.440> see<00:00:40.500> there's

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.040 

different<00:00:46.379> settings<00:00:48.590> from<00:00:49.590> low<00:00:50.070> light<00:00:50.370> a

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
different settings from low light a

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.100 
different settings from low light a
little<00:00:52.050> bit<00:00:52.230> higher<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.969> maximum<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.210> believe

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
little bit higher to maximum I believe

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.869 
little bit higher to maximum I believe
that<00:00:55.140> strobe<00:00:56.210> so<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.660> me<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.079> great<00:00:58.350> because

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
that strobe so for me it's great because

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.060 
that strobe so for me it's great because
in<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.000> go<00:01:00.180> back<00:01:00.359> situation<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.559> know<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.770> may

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
in a go back situation you know you may

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.670 
in a go back situation you know you may
need<00:01:02.280> low<00:01:03.059> light<00:01:03.329> more<00:01:03.930> than<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.260> do<00:01:04.409> bright

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
need low light more than you do bright

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.990 
need low light more than you do bright
light<00:01:05.330> around<00:01:06.330> making<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.960> campground<00:01:07.770> or

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
light around making a campground or

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.969 
light around making a campground or
finding<00:01:09.000> things<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.479> back<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.869> car<00:01:10.170> so

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
finding things in the back of a car so

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.960 
finding things in the back of a car so
you<00:01:11.340> know<00:01:11.490> setting<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.060> low<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.590> nice<00:01:13.970> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
you know setting it to low is nice the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.210 
you know setting it to low is nice the
next<00:01:15.119> level<00:01:15.830> is<00:01:16.830> also<00:01:17.330> still<00:01:18.330> pretty<00:01:18.600> bright

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
next level is also still pretty bright

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.280 
next level is also still pretty bright
then<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.340> go<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.790> maximum<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:22.049> thing

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
then you go to the maximum this thing

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.710 
then you go to the maximum this thing
can<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:22.790> really<00:01:23.790> throw<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.240> some<00:01:24.509> light

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
can really really throw out some light

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.880 
can really really throw out some light
if<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.049> compare<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.549> surefire

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
if you compare it to the to the surefire

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.580 
if you compare it to the to the surefire
you<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.070> see<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.430> much<00:01:30.060> wider<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.750> more

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
you can see it's much wider and more

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.749 
you can see it's much wider and more
focused<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.369> then<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.390> last<00:01:34.020> one<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.759> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
focused and then the last one is the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.889 
focused and then the last one is the
strobe<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.570> see<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.009> pretty<00:01:41.899> pretty

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
strobe you can see it's pretty pretty

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.330 
strobe you can see it's pretty pretty
blinding<00:01:43.470> go<00:01:44.130> back<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> bright<00:01:46.340> you

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
blinding go back to the bright you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.030 
blinding go back to the bright you
pretty<00:01:47.610> much<00:01:47.670> I've<00:01:48.570> used<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.990> doing<00:01:49.829> night

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
pretty much I've used this doing night

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.020 
pretty much I've used this doing night
training<00:01:50.899> it<00:01:51.899> was<00:01:52.049> simunition<00:01:52.729> where<00:01:53.729> you

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
training it was simunition where you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.190 
training it was simunition where you
shine<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.540> at<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:56.280> know<00:01:56.310> force<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.820> force<00:01:57.200> just

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
shine it at you know force on force just

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.420 
shine it at you know force on force just
to<00:01:58.350> give<00:01:58.500> them<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.710> sense<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.040> what<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.340> like

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
to give them a sense of what it's like

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.370 
to give them a sense of what it's like
to<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.850> flashlight<00:02:00.479> shine<00:02:00.930> denim<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
to have a flashlight shine denim in the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.580 
to have a flashlight shine denim in the
dark<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.979> then<00:02:02.909> they<00:02:03.060> have<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.360> try<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.290> shoot

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
dark and then they have to try to shoot

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.709 
dark and then they have to try to shoot
at<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.700> mean<00:02:05.909> literally<00:02:06.270> when<00:02:06.509> in

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
at you and I mean literally when in

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.719 
at you and I mean literally when in
pitch<00:02:07.049> black<00:02:07.350> or<00:02:07.649> very<00:02:07.680> low<00:02:08.129> light<00:02:08.399> when

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
pitch black or very low light when

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.600 
pitch black or very low light when
something<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.479> bright<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.869> shined<00:02:10.110> at<00:02:10.259> you

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
something that bright is shined at you

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.190 
something that bright is shined at you
it's<00:02:11.610> like<00:02:11.819> all<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.090> see<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.360> supernova

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
it's like all you see is supernova

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.229 
it's like all you see is supernova
so<00:02:13.530> it's<00:02:13.770> definitely<00:02:14.610> good<00:02:14.819> it's<00:02:15.000> also<00:02:15.120> a

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
so it's definitely good it's also a

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.750 
so it's definitely good it's also a
bullet<00:02:15.599> magnet<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.709> have<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.610> have<00:02:17.640> to

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
bullet magnet so you have to you have to

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.970 
bullet magnet so you have to you have to
realize<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.180> as<00:02:18.569> well<00:02:18.780> that's<00:02:19.440> why<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.709> like

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
realize that as well that's why you like

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.009 
realize that as well that's why you like
the<00:02:20.129> momentary<00:02:20.610> on<00:02:20.760> where<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.090> can<00:02:21.269> basically

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
the momentary on where you can basically

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.130 
the momentary on where you can basically
do<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.709> couple<00:02:23.129> flashes<00:02:23.819> in<00:02:23.940> their<00:02:24.090> eyes<00:02:24.239> move

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
do a couple flashes in their eyes move

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.960 
do a couple flashes in their eyes move
and<00:02:25.500> then<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.129> hopefully<00:02:26.700> have<00:02:26.730> the
