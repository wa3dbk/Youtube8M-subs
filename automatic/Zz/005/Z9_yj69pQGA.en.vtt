 exciting is a lot of land by allegra 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.690
 so this week I retained from the starworks of force the list of forbs 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.880
 power of the force to this end one day the new game on mac we start we have 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.650
 a quarter of dark vador you make a woman in situation immediately 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.960
 and yet the following with an apprentice and special effects at the top on the 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.490
 knees just about any animal 27 inches core i7 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.880
 so the fact really very very very nice to play 2012 being present 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.310
 for this fault on maxi end he still me anyway so we can understand them 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.970
 easily and play on the result 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.420
 indeed for reasons evoked by phone stitching 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.440
 hamon some say on iphone 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.250
 these calls 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.650
 of this card 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.240
 and she was worried about realizing by the untenable 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.580
 a small studio also by the way I call all access 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.060
 the asa to collapse 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.500
 and m he stays so is super funny 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.049
 killer three of them a little a review these killer these amounts 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.690
 is it more s-res 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.720
 one of the smallest formidable 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.000
 in hindsight 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.380
 and she must walk past 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.350
 this service of the punch 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.150
 huge snake deputies it's very very well done 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.200
 it's extraordinary to draw the first lessons of makeup 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.940
 16h20 gmt it's very very fluid it's a hyper accurate but really 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.680
 find a playability the super nice 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.390
 is so far obviously an accelerometer so the game I love 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.890
 when you play like that on iphone 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.980
 10 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.920
 when i hear that i'm happy i'll know how to answer that i'm busy 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.320
 it's a lot of cultural jeannot every time I go somewhere where I 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.969
 am 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:11.959
 dg on the other hand I wanted 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.690
 on this page you will find that these products 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.939
 for press conferences six years ago 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.469
 here they are 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.469
 the staphylococci a blow of heart 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.049
 Conversely 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.149
 while at the start 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:30.139
 we do not have to do in the game what we grant no francs 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:31.389
 the carte blanche 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.389
 because I have a look in fact it's like a cup game 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:38.639
 and in fact I was once again from to convert someone into my 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.649
 family who is very excited about the bush and all that and I'm not I 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:45.749
 I have eaten the wall I have eaten for years since I know 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:46.590
 my step-dad 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.980
 who is a teacher and who needs a professional way of microsoft 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.319
 office 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.879
 and you see where I'm going 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.099
 there it will be a blow for microsoft he still has not been able 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.059
 after 30 years we 25 at the theater to make us a revision version on mac that 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:03.719
 works with that of recovery on pc 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:08.449
 and that was a real wall for ac milan for not for the future because 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.219
 that basically you make a document under word 2 on pc 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.400
 and not that we can have his bac I did not look at the benchmarks 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.329
 bano there are many things that go into a spin 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.759
 via diabetes trackers after a flip-flop in the world via 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:25.569
 tf1 en his warm voice the woodcock what i told him love the rtf of 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.220
 nice but adili but if it can be an asset 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.239
 for me it's a real problem c 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.040
 for me it's a problem because I say it's not nice that's also it 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.169
 I live badly as very little credible 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.939
 ap my lungs people who are for example professions that use 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:42.099
 they must exchange documents with pc collections 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.789
 % it is a real problem because you have beautiful office 2008 soussou thomas 

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:52.269
 keller office 2007 or 2010 on pc m you will take enamel of floyd landis it is 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.119
 hard anyway 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:56.869
 and it's not that fart rhamey help a little jean-yves the active drian that 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.869
 because all that appears most improbable these proteins 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.149
 % no no no no the problem is that microsoft was my hangover 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:06.589
 it's that microsoft 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:07.379
 real 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.829
 it was wonderful 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.459
 to have something compatible is serious 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.069
 who do the same job during the global although their goal is to 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.069
 shoot if it's something that others it's difficult for them 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:22.369
 the little hands of men indeed the works of the multipurpose room 

00:04:22.369 --> 00:04:24.819
 this year it's different concretely 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:27.429
 things are still improved these answer thanks to that 

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:28.919
 it's a bit complicated with the arrival of 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.940
 of windows vista because they are inadequate fighting spirit between 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.080
 in europe who make up opus pc 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.080
 and I heard that he was not what they will announce in my race 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.680
 tristan corbière 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.700
 the next versions of microsoft office so I think we'll settle 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.749
 but it is good 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:49.099
 who will believe paris lausanne 11 i would like to remind you at once he just had 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.459
 hard to believe it Thursday in amazon blazers problem is that it's a 

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.639
 small I believe 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.240
 the trial very quickly cfdt two teams totally different stages 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.080
 initials there are even gays who works in his corner and who has the 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.319
 qualities for driving while intoxicated we knew we would be taken 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.370
 before the end of the year 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.280
 we could reattach it on microsoft titrated on his side m we had no 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.450
 not skid it was the right time and I will keep for the end of 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:12.759
 contract while it's 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.800
 it's the goalkeeper for the season on this site that all builders 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.839
 today what these waves 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:20.449
 it's been a long time that I by such action is somewhat convinced 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.370
 Muriel Vernet I started with internal squabbles at the gendarmerie 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.540
 for a little 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.400
 on the ground fault on fault his phone is little 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.729
 incidentally had this page 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.379
 I am known for its forms 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:35.580
 a good crush - this is the salad from sony's is simply a 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.479
 third of his sentence 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.310
 the pmtr 570pts uppsala stood to present their new models 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.069

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.479
 lovers of pelote hotels com 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.400
 but simply a craving for 40 euros envisages princes according mrtt who 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.400
 are here more than the country was most affluent 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.770
 this ladder 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.050
 maybe products the whimsical cool mode 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.860
 more beefy drawdowns 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.110
 and who wants an expert to deploy of serrières what is it worth the other of 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.050
 his loose euro is 40 euros so it's cool comrades of the week 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.969
 mercier Swedish party pass costs that among others the next week for 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:13.199
 other favorites and meanwhile it will of course have a word

 we redo the mac 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.580
 see you soon but on one point 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.759
 to have 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:18.609
