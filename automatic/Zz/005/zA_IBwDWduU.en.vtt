decided to become frizzy in some areas

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.750 
decided to become frizzy in some areas
and<00:02:36.660> also<00:02:37.380> I'm<00:02:37.680> not<00:02:37.860> sure<00:02:38.010> if<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.310> camera<00:02:38.730> is

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
and also I'm not sure if the camera is

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.940 
and also I'm not sure if the camera is
really<00:02:39.090> picking<00:02:39.420> up<00:02:39.600> well<00:02:39.900> if<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.380> can<00:02:40.560> notice

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
really picking up well if you can notice

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.050 
really picking up well if you can notice
but<00:02:41.130> there<00:02:41.340> was<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.700> ton<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.690> white<00:02:43.430> residue<00:02:44.430> so

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
but there was a ton of white residue so

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.600 
but there was a ton of white residue so
this<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.290> me<00:02:46.470> was<00:02:46.980> um<00:02:48.560> not<00:02:49.560> necessarily<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:50.220> fail

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
this to me was um not necessarily a fail

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.090 
this to me was um not necessarily a fail
but<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:51.270> maybe<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:51.960> need<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.410> revisit<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.980> and

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
but just maybe I need to revisit it and

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.700 
but just maybe I need to revisit it and
try<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.400> different<00:02:53.550> technique<00:02:54.240> with<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.140> but<00:02:55.470> I

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
try a different technique with it but I

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.370 
try a different technique with it but I
wasn't<00:02:56.070> very<00:02:56.430> pleased<00:02:56.700> with<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.660> did<00:02:58.110> let<00:02:58.260> it

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
wasn't very pleased with it I did let it

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.180 
wasn't very pleased with it I did let it
go<00:02:58.530> for<00:02:58.770> seven<00:02:59.190> days<00:02:59.370> and<00:03:00.110> by<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.170> fourth<00:03:02.010> and

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
fifth day I had to refresh and reapply

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.720

some<00:03:07.500> moisture<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:09.150> little<00:03:09.570> gel<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:10.350> try<00:03:10.560> to

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
some moisture and a little gel to try to

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.120 
some moisture and a little gel to try to
help<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:12.000> clump<00:03:12.240> back<00:03:12.600> again<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.230> also<00:03:13.950> to

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
help it to clump back again and also to

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.530 
help it to clump back again and also to
kind<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.430> get<00:03:14.610> rid<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.790> some<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.330> white

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
kind of get rid of some of the white

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.360 
kind of get rid of some of the white
residue<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.330> is<00:03:18.480> day<00:03:18.660> seven<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.350> by<00:03:20.310> this

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
residue so this is day seven and by this

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.190 
residue so this is day seven and by this
time<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.180> was<00:03:21.210> just<00:03:21.570> pretty<00:03:21.720> much<00:03:21.900> done<00:03:22.170> with

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
time I was just pretty much done with

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.620 
time I was just pretty much done with
this<00:03:22.470> wash<00:03:22.740> and<00:03:23.010> go<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.550> usually<00:03:24.300> don't<00:03:24.420> like

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
this wash and go I usually don't like

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.330

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310
