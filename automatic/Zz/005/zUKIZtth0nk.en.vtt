 that's a question mark 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.310
 That means I tell very briefly and concisely but there are such things 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.210

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.369

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.980
 technology owners would like a choice is 5 x 2 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.900
 This panda is pretty extreme 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.440
 used at the counter only if nothing else works but then you have to 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.170
 this at excelsior it comes in addition, it is an advantage of the neat man 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.170
 that question became a man to how does everything look good today because 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.110
 that have ever been broken 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.110

 400 characters are I didn't know anyone talking but 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.380
 but a little more experiencing what's your name 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.610
 then come 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.610
 Branco may require you to be something adjusted 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.209

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.469

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.969
 and ask that question to you 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:39.139

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.980
 serve a bigger one in an hour and a half 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.329

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:01.889

 Bin Laden 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:49.909
 he did that and then I thought he was talking about a child 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.039
 he was talking about his 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.729
 legs 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.729
 but I wanted something very different he cleaned up 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:02.110
 he was in the car himself 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.969
 out of branco 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:07.069

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.400
 to be 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.270

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.620

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.219
