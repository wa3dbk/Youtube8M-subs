00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hey and welcome here too 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.279
 a new video is what he does today 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.600
 leaves if card slash special 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.880
 hardware to Him is because the one 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.070
 a little more work than just a steering wheel 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.660
 and i want to help out all the facts about it 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.920
 I want everything that is known so far 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.960
 then we just start to cost 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.820
 me in germany 199 euro 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.050
 can pre-order one now imagine 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.029
 on anderson 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.820
 there is already a delivery date what 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.789
 31 would not be complete 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.380
 sure but that is as provisional too 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.760
 that means I think that's coming 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.260
 earlier in the same way as in the United States in 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.669
 autumn but endes probably had 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
 they have a special appointment in life 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.360
 said we give ourselves later than early 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.140
 and then it does not come 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.670
 that's why it's a preliminary date 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.170
 but I think it comes in the same way as in 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.719
 america also in germany in autumn 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.370
 out exactly in the reha costs that 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.629
 Steering wheel from the 300 dollars in 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.250
 Germany only 200 euros 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.340
 in the end, 300 dollars will be added 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.480
 about 2 166 euro that first time 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.640
 that's cool in germany 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.660
 cheaper than an america that is yes 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.100
 usually the other way around 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.530
 but I think only those would have 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.199
 at least 300 euro really for 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.300
 the country issued or even 266 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.500
 second sounds quite right there 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.729
 Surprisingly at the fjord I was happy 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.830
 does not have to spend that much money 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.479
 Next we come to the features 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.390
 so to speak or what she considers as 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.250
 List features offensen and that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.740
 Steering wheel will rotate 900 degrees for the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.710
 maximum realism therefore have half 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.810
 turn it to life in training 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.909
 Detachable leash for easy steering 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.140
 with a hand that is practically out of the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.490
 simple reason because if I say now 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.140
 times the pages console wants to serve 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.430
 or what will drink or what will 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.439
 whatever the mouse or keyboard has 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.030
 or what want to touch again is 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.829
 I think that can be done with one hand 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.040
 ever pretty cool come on 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.509
 to the next point and with iges 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.579
 Steering wheel with which all activities 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.170
 outside the vehicle 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.549
 I think that's cool, too 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.560
 The figures now once stocker there 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.060
 so stick buttons but only goes up later 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.880
 an exact degree called 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.590
 as the side console with over 25 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.420
 programmable buttons for operation 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.619
 your agricultural equipment 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.229
 I also think that's cool 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.090
 can put any shit on these buttons 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.860
 So you had so much stuff on it 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.600
 lie 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.610
 You really need more keyboard 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.459
 next to his console 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.720
 front loader stick for top lower left 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.819
 turn right commands and mode button to 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.890
 doubling the control is axel 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.260
 fischer quietly flat ergonomic 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.090
 design for a comfortable seat at the desk 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.850
 and sturdy clips for attaching the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.930
 Steering wheel and side console that the 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.310
 you have to get the last points first 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.250
 prove that I want to see myself 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.830
 that it sits firmly at the table and that one 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.630
 nice ergonomic well- feeling 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.910
 design has yet to happen 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.090
 continue to prove extent so next to 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.739
 Steering wheel pedals and side console 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.470
 also the gold edition of the 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.300
 Agricultural simulator on 15 the 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.910
 includes a new environment plus new 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.010
 vehicles and of course then the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.910
 probably the default for 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.350
 the steering wheel but I can also good 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.830
 Imagine that in an update for 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.560
 everyone comes next we have too 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.790
 even more things to the steering wheel 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.280
 then that's what they have a bit 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.140
 funny divided on the Amazon side 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.420
 namely number 9 degrees rotation in 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.310
 both directions which are pretty horny and 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.690
 then I find a right inclination 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.130
 also group and mac run to lose weight 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.760
 stay has the side consoles serve 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.410
 I can and I personally think so 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.299
 pretty cool and then you go the 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.730
 immediately reject buttons 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.650
 Two analog sticks with push button are 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.730
 ideal to move around your character the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.090
 camera to control 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.400
 the four ways switch next to each 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.280
 lie the stick offer eight more 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.920
 represent keys easy accessible 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.079
 build that they need to be easily accessible 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.040
 prove that we see you myself 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.690
 hope my husband can do it at gamescom 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.470
 antenna design and there will be natural 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.880
 hope that it is also on the 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.959
 gamescom already at test pass on the e3 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.470
 you just look at it with the 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.060
 box 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.799
 I will be the same in between now 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.060
 or have a few already 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.829
 make impressions from the 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.620
 Video material what the type uploaded there 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:04.130
 the sound is unfortunately interesting 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.859
 that's why mother no sound is there as 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.540
 next to the pedals so I read 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.430
 again the definition and what the 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.430
 Spectator stands in front and that of the 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.049
 rotation angle at 20 degrees 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.970
 the pure as possible her one possible 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.370
 Good control to offer the pedals 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.070
 values ​​over 1 x 8 meter long cable 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.120
 connected with the steering wheel that's 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.530
 Good because you do not need it that way 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.789
 many slots in the computer always that 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.190
 Steering wheel then the side 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.300
 has made the steering wheel pc 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.710
 have stuck to not consumed 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.990
 so much USB connection is on laptops 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.820
 practically one say my four usb 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.220
 has connection and therefore still depends 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.960
 times the mouse keyboard steering wheel and then 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.729
 it's just about what else is there if 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.560
 that would need three now that makes 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.110
 it would not fit anymore I think 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.050
 personally very cool 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.570
 that is really well resolved next 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.720
 to the side console realistic front 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.780
 lara stick is on the side control 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.979
 and 25 degrees asten as already said that 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.660
 now everything is known 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.720
 if there are a few pictures 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.419
 I have all kinds of videos too 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.740
 already done a few times in between 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.150
 exactly where I say that 's it in that 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.949
 video you can from the website of 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.780
 really all news in text form 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:15.500
 or a little more content and 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.699
 instagram couple twitter pictures linked 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.690
 of the people on the three we were 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.740
 Unfortunately, design could not be one 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.990
 a bit expensive just go there too 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.690
 unfortunately we can not fly that 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.789
 I would have liked to be there but 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.470
 it's really a bit too much 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.210
 expensive to fly there you are welcome 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.620
 From the website also vote fits 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.990
 the vote for the middle of the month, the 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.380
 vote on whether the murder of the month 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.840
 will 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.949
 and really we want to go better or 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.659
 distance left is of course also one 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.949
 video description however you can 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.419
 also like under the video to admire 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.520
 Amazon for the pre-order 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.259
 that's a nimble I want on it 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.479
 to point out that means we deserve it 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:49.240
 also with if you ordered about it 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.380
 Of course you will not pay for a cent anymore 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.820
 brings us just what the whole thing 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.349
 finance it was not recently 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.320
 what we do and above all the number 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:58.759
 and if you do not advertise me 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.380
