00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:08.799
 and and art plus production represents 

00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:11.580
 hi my favorite viewers and in this 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:15.160
 issue we will consider the counter-peak 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.040
 antiheroes of such a hero as a task 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.470
 a very popular hero, all the more soon 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.020
 we will have an internet show and there be it 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.930
 pikat hero constantly well, or is it 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.940
 baths become wanted to notice many think 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.910
 as it is said or task 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.309
 Or tusk correctly say task precisely 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.160
 so in the original dubbing he calls 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.289
 himself a task 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.530
 Well, let's go and the main potential 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:44.949
 the hero is that he can initiate 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.070
 there is making a snowball collecting there or 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:51.339
 allies or rolls himself and ultuet on 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.050
 enemy for example who beats the enemy 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.980
 he also has the first ability 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:00.100
 which can block the path that is 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:04.840
 blocked the way the marriage can't from us 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.110
 leave well we have a seal i mean we 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.030
 can slow down enemies 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.660
 so now let's take the law 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.230
 first and the first hero I took the valve 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.880
 all heroes who have 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.460
 blink yes it is clear why in the first place and 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.120
 such a hero can not block the way she 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.580
 can just take and jump over 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.740
 barrier low technology 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.130
 the same with our lump for example we 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.010
 made a com roll she just 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.820
 running away and the last moment from the blink 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.750
 jumps and we will not reach her see 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.030
 we do not have enough coma to roll 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.450
 also in and of itself a hero 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:53.170
 who for very hemorrhoids further on 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.360
 goes distar firstly adistar can 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.520
 defend yourself from coma using astral 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.450
 he can also throw allies in 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.170
 Astral still look at melancholy very low 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:12.370
 intelligence gain is very low here too 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:16.180
 already goes to battle ultimate dest pack 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.890
 dies and he dies first by itself 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.400
 we take intelligence from him later 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.409
 ultuem and then goes pugna well, you can 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.620
 take as support already 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.959
 first look when we throw at 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.200
 itself astral but called ghostly 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.720
 form yes in tuscany is the ultimate he 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.900

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.180

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:50.230
 i have ordered you to ult and u can't 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.569
 see the same thing if we throw 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.370
 astral habitual form on its 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.400
 allies that is, we can save them 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.590
 we see that flies to our 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.590
 ally and we throw him in astral 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.970
 so oops 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.810

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.519

 and again watch the fourth hero here 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.069
 too many heroes fit mass wiki 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.329

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.090
 masses to the hero 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:26.889

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.829
 shaker or enigma yes when you collect 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:32.889
 people in whom and roll on this hero 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.720
 then they even have this benefit for example 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.269
 enigma may begin to ult 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.099
