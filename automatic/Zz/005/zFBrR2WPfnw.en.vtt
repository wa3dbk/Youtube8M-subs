00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.460
 ok 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:48.260
 inspiration to me all he can 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.559
 get out of everyday life when 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.210
 in everyday life you leave an open space 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.210
 an open space for poetry 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.710
 operation takes place 24 hours a day 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.710
 because you live it 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:17.159
 but it is the photograph we took 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.880
 today it is a great photograph 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.579
 depth in the sense that we are inside 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:27.840
 at the source of knowledge in the library e 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:30.479
 so for me it represents a little sense 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.240
 deep in my kitchen in quality 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.159
 of the ingredients is very important but 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.340
 the quantity of the dishes is also fundamental 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.340
 ideas 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.510
 no 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.410
 the encounter with this great company 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.430
 Italian representing Italy in 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.520
 everything and for everything 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.650
 what the family is friendship italy 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.170
 dreaming together and lavazza what it is 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.400
 the family business shoot on the phone 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.640
 and I already know who I'm talking to 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.530
 this is the crazy one and then the whole part 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.960
 ethics exactly like ours 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.370
 francesca indeed we want the dream 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.960
 we want the great raw material 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.740
 exactly so 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.740
 very good who did it 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.520
 in my kitchen I have always tried to 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.890
 look where others didn't look 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.200
 you look at the ingredients trying to 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.010
 taste the truth what their 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.570
 air and this is the fundamental thing 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.710
 look at the world from another 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.050
 perspective 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.170
 and from there then make visible 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.170
 the unseen
