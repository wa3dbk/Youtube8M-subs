all<00:00:37.590> our<00:00:37.649> more<00:00:38.100> there<00:00:38.570> however<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
all our more there however the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.840 
all our more there however the
interesting<00:00:40.350> bit<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.860> when<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.399> respond

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
interesting bit is a when you respond

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.490 
interesting bit is a when you respond
the<00:00:42.059> items<00:00:42.390> dropped<00:00:42.690> by<00:00:42.870> enemies<00:00:43.290> won't

the items dropped by enemies won't
disappear<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.969> means<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.780> get<00:00:45.899> to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
disappear this means that if you get to

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.840 
disappear this means that if you get to
the<00:00:46.140> right<00:00:46.260> spot<00:00:46.320> you'll<00:00:47.129> be<00:00:47.309> able<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.550> quickly

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
the right spot you'll be able to quickly

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.779 
the right spot you'll be able to quickly
cycle<00:00:48.360> through<00:00:48.510> week<00:00:48.750> enemies<00:00:49.140> die<00:00:49.680> then<00:00:50.550> take

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
cycle through week enemies die then take

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.639 
cycle through week enemies die then take
them<00:00:50.940> all<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.120> again<00:00:51.510> building<00:00:52.140> up<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.379> huge

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
them all on again building up a huge

them all on again building up a huge
number<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.100> loot<00:00:53.340> drops<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.789> pick<00:00:53.940> up<00:00:54.680> so<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
number of loot drops to pick up so the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.380 
number of loot drops to pick up so the
best<00:00:56.039> area<00:00:56.399> will<00:00:56.579> found<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> take<00:00:57.090> advantage
