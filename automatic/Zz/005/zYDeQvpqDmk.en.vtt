00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.786
What's up, guys.

00:00:00.786 --> 00:00:02.375
It's Sona and I'm here with CoverGirl.

00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:06.580
A lot of you wanted to see a really
fun spring-inspired makeup tutorial.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.530
So here I am, and I
hope you guys enjoy it.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.010
One thing to remember
is that with dewy skin,

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.760
you have to prep your skin really well.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.160
So I'm going to go in with
a really rich moisturizer

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.450
and make sure my skin
is nice and hydrated.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.770
For my foundation, I'm
going in with truBlend.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.890
Blend this into your skin really well.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.800
You want to take this
down to your neck area

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.600
to make sure that everything matches.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.230
Next, I'm going to go
in with some concealer

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.700
and conceal the center of my face.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.040
This foundation is one
to two shade lighter

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.990
than my skin, which is what I want
because I want to conceal and highlight

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.990
at the same time.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.745
And I'm just going to use my
fingers to blend this in place.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.340
I'm going to go ahead and
highlight my face just

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.890
a little bit using an eye shadow.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.420
Actually, this is the
eye quads by CoverGirl.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.010
And I'm just going to use this
lightest color right over here.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.590
And I'm going to apply this on
the high points of my cheeks

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.600
because I do like to add
some shine around this area

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.870
because it looks beautiful in pictures.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.800
So I'm just going to go ahead and
give myself a little bit of color

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.770
using truBlend Minerals.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.620
And this stuff is cool because you
can contour and sort of give yourself

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.070
a nice color.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.260
And as you can see, I'm kind of dabbing
and then taking it up to my forehead

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.200
as well.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.020
Especially for spring, you
definitely want some color.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.440
You also want to get this
color on your jawline

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.820
because this is going
define your features.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.230
And I personally like to kind of
match my skin to my arms as well,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.931
and it gives you a
beautiful, dewy finish.

00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:52.930
Almost done with the skin, but I'm
going to apply a little bit of blush.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.440
And this is the Cheekers blush, and
it's a really pretty coral color.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.110
And I'm just going to pop this
on the apples of my cheeks.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.080
If you think you've
applied too much, just

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.420
grab your foundation
brush and kind of work

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.360
on top of what you did
and kind of just dab it.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.590
And as you can see, it kind
of softens the whole look.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.592
Onto the eyes.

00:02:13.592 --> 00:02:15.550
And I'm really excited
about this because we're

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.841
going to be playing with color.

00:02:16.841 --> 00:02:18.260
I'm going to start with pencils.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.010
So the first pencil is
going to be the Ink It.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.620
I'm going to start from the
inner corners of my eyes

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.450
and kind of line this.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.133
Take it all the way to your crease.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.330
And you also want to take this down.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.560
Now that I have a light
blue on, I'm going

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.450
to go ahead and apply a darker blue
before moving on to my shadows.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.050
So this is the Liquiline Blast, and
I'm going to go ahead and apply this

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.490
starting from the outer corners.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.960
And this is such a beautiful color.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.696
I'm obsessed with it.

00:02:50.696 --> 00:02:52.570
Once you get to the
middle, you want to start

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.660
blending it with your fingers and kind
of merging the two colors together

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.120
in the center.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.030
I'm going to do the same
thing on the bottom lash line,

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.220
and I'm also going to go ahead
and apply this on the inner rim.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.220
I'm going to go ahead and
start with my eyeshadow.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.450
I want to start blending
this from the outer corners.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.130
And you see how it instantly starts
to blend all those harsh edges that we

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.460
had from the pencil?

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.930
That's pretty much the trick,
is to blend, blend, blend.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.110
Now with a lighter color,
I'm just going to use

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.640
the same one that I used on my phase and
start to apply this on the brow bone.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.080
And kind of blend this down because
I want to add a little bit of shimmer

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.780
to this look.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.510
So we're going to do the same
thing on the bottom lash line,

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.210
but this time using a pencil brush.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.610
If you want to elongate your eye,
you can extend this a little bit

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.050
towards the end.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.950
This is the LashBlast Volume Mascara.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.490
And we're going to go ahead and
apply this starting from the root

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.390
and taking it up.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.540
And this is going to add a lot of
volume and even more drama to this look.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.510
So the eyes are done.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.010
And I'm going to move on to my lips.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.520
And I actually want a bold lip.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.000
I know I have a bold eye, but
who says we have rules, right?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.089
We're going to go ahead and
put the Colorlicious in 300.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:21.209
And this is a really pretty coral.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.360
Makeup's all about having
fun, so I like to experiment.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.170
A lot of you were wondering
what to pack with you when

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.480
stepping out the door and need
products to touch up your makeup.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.350
And I thought I'd show you guys
what I would pack for this look

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.450
and hopefully give you guys some ideas.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.460
So for this look, I would
obviously pack a powder

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.850
to touch up the t-zone, which is the
center of your face and your forehead.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.050
And of course, you want to take your
concealer with you because that way,

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.510
your undereye area looks nice
and clean throughout the day.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.610
I do like to take a blending brush
with a little bit of my eyeshadow

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.450
because sometimes you tend
to crease around this area.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.110
So you can just blend everything
so that it looks nice and perfect.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.390
I do like to take a spoolie
because I like to brush my brows

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.650
and make sure they look nice and even.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.580
Lastly, you want to grab your
lipstick because this is what you

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.030
want to touch up every couple of hours.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.820
So of course your lipstick
has to go into your bag.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.120
And my bag is packed
and I'm ready to leave.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.430
Thank you so much for watching.
