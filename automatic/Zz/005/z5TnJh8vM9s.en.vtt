00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
but there is some shady and this is a

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.600 
but there is some shady and this is a
lace<00:01:09.510> front<00:01:09.869> week<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.470> there's<00:01:10.650> only<00:01:10.920> lace<00:01:11.310> in

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
lace front week so there's only lace in

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.940 
lace front week so there's only lace in
the<00:01:11.640> front<00:01:11.729> area<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.840> parts<00:01:13.380> very<00:01:13.770> very

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the front area but it parts very very

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.429 
the front area but it parts very very
well<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.460> my<00:01:14.580> legs<00:01:14.850> color<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.720> think<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
well and my legs color is I think it's a

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.100 
well and my legs color is I think it's a
medium<00:01:16.950> brown<00:01:17.280> color<00:01:17.700> now<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.570> doesn't<00:01:18.960> have

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
medium brown color now it doesn't have

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.740 
medium brown color now it doesn't have
any<00:01:19.470> combs<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.700> an<00:01:20.880> adjustable<00:01:21.450> strap

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
any combs in it just an adjustable strap

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.260 
any combs in it just an adjustable strap
so<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.229> do<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.770> use<00:01:23.189> bobby<00:01:23.549> pins<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:24.119> hold

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
so I do have to use bobby pins to hold

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.609 
so I do have to use bobby pins to hold
you<00:01:24.450> down<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.990> don't<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> use<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
you down but I don't like to use the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.130 
you down but I don't like to use the
combs<00:01:26.040> anyway<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:27.150> works<00:01:27.180> very<00:01:27.659> well<00:01:27.780> for

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140
