00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:10.410
 and again, people build a doll, right? 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.809
 and now I'm going to show you how 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.070
 I weave the white dough to look good. 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.369
 white 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.090
 for those who do not know or have secrets then 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.150
 to start the white mass of 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.150
 fabric 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:33.989
 so I always get the car from a 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:49.559
 brush is for this much of mass here 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:53.730
 amount that is where it puts the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:57.120
 white island and the secret comes people thought 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.430
 that she continues to support will then 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.170
 come the secret is that little piece because 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.019
 I had to because I'm going to make a shirt. 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.729
 of doll team bambolina I got one 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.720
 little more mass on Saturday though 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.340
 here but to show you and tell 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.650
 For you about who does not know the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:21.210
 secret of whitening bleaching that 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:26.520
 is the brand is the blue group is in it 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:32.180
 People this bleacher works miracles in the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.920
 white mass because the white mass is 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.810
 bank-dyed is that we know 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.340
 well, our work knows that it 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.950
 darkens a little, it's not yellow 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.280
 in fact after she arrives at the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.520
 total drying process and sps pozinho 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.970
 here prevents that from happening right 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.310
 So how do I work, I do not 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.549
 I mix the white dough after 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.710
 I apply the people are not 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.530
 How do I do it? 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.880
 he had on top of the dough as he did now and 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.880
 I'll add later 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:19.870
 put powder has to be in small 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:26.280
 Amounts to show agent won here 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.280
 a little tip for you to have a notion 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:45.689
 very little that ita applies to this 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.689
 mass as I'll play access here 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.040
 It's hard enough for people like me 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.470
 I can already almost finish but he comes 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.200
 but it lasted a lot longer than it is 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.870
 because you will see some can not 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.209
 too much and too little 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:12.129
 does the desired effect right 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:16.949
 so now I go before that the mixture 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.949
 money and let's play 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.040
 So people I've seen a lot of people stay in 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.389
 internet that even with little air and 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.299
 solo turned white 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.340
 when dried almost dry yellowish and has 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.159
 people saying it got even worse 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.669
 Good, I did not know, I do not know. 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:39.790
 how the used I believe 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:41.979
 Most complaints are coming from 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.940
 craftsmen who already have the habit of buying 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:50.979
 most hit ready right then apply 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:54.280
 the pozinho the mass that I believe 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:56.319
 that's why it's because with me, never 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.519
 happened quite the opposite I did not 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:04.419
 will even bring white dough dishes 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:07.419
 I do not know how to live without this little thing since 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:10.989
 that he was introduced to me by one of the 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:15.040
 my students in my courses her name 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:17.680
 then let her represent 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.659
 pozinho more people student teaching 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.550
 teacher of a course 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:26.730
 Look, he denies it. 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:31.770
 which the people here going to show 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:34.200
 for you the result of the head of the 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.980
 doll also remember our hit 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.320
 white 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.280
 because it's how the white guy looks 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.130
 still're right and white 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.700
 still having the mark is already 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:53.520
 Show show to you, it's okay. 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:59.430
 and there is no sea and that 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:07.560
 result is due to what I asked 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:09.450
 for you as're so really counts is 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:15.800
 take a little bit from here you can start 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:21.930
 If I compare yourself with you, you see that 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:25.410
 does not clarify you using this powder in the 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.780
 non-yellow white mass 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.580
 Of course you use it the right way. 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.610
 I showed in the video how I do it 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:36.000
 so using it the right way so that 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:40.320
 I never tell my pieces the 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:47.780
 continuing the same color of my pieces 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:51.210
 White mass with this white powder continues 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:57.990
 beautiful anyway so this is us 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:06:11.430
 here's the test is the proof is me 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:12.450
 I found who can get in other 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.900
 regions 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:19.830
 You look, can not you? 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:24.810
 I know there are other brands that are 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.340
 da blue is this little star here to 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.400
 You who want to buy

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.830
