00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.580
 so we chose this blogger while 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.680
 just because it's fx sound 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.619
 partner of sarenza with whom we 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.270
 working long it's 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.310
 super babes are apparently a style 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.400
 which sticks completely to the tones of 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.359
 sarenza and who are for us icons 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.550
 in each of their countries 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.669
 we arrive and alicante for some 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.489
 after a few hours of travel 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.260
 Alicante is the bastion of crafts 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.120
 the shoe in Spain is a bit 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.340
 the pledge to be when we were making a 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.360
 shoe and it's especially in the workshop 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.489
 with whom we have been working since 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.329
 a long time and who has a know-how 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.280
 particular 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.559
 we took the shuttle to visit 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.629
 the workshop what was good is that it 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.610
 was reserved for her ie 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.230
 that there was a whole team that was 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.850
 ready for her who was going to help them to 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.500
 to realize the end of their dream 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.629
 I knew it was still very 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.370
 sharp points facing a knee on a 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.140
 little detail that we do not necessarily see 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.110
 when we see a talent like that but there 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.590
 suddenly 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.530
 we really saw the differences and 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.420
 fortunately 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.420
 why the bottom pump simply 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.440
 because it's our flagship product 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.560
 it's our favorite product 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.270
 it's a bit of a darling and it's 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.870
 especially the shoe prefect our customers 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:38.170
 to hero's maxim in abobo that chief ue 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:40.060
 kirouac aubry comes out when you're young 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.570
 then they are not coming at all 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.009
 empty hands 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.619
 she had already started working 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.600
 on flies board defends 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.979
 of village shoes on which in fact 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.899
 she the city where all their inspiration 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.700
 he self that made them want them 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.930
 materials she was doing but the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:01.740
 trends she had read and that she 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:01.740
 is also appreciated by the interests 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.709
 Americans in fact we wanted it 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.380
 that the blogger is really in the center 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.450
 of creation that it be a little the 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:22.150
 sarenza stylist for the story of a 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.400
 day they saw a workshop totally 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:29.370
 with hundreds of thousands of heels 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.370
 different atom pine and me it was hard 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.670
 every two years 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.530
 they also saw accessories to no 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.190
 more power it was a little cave 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.590
 of ali baba 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.390
 and what's good is that it's delivered 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.010
 still things in their context 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.260
 because you have to know that a shoe 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.180
 it's a culmination of time and 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.500
 hours of work this is the result of 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.840
 dozens of little hands 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.110
 work are specialized in this 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.370
 what they do these are things that 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.320
 can not be made by others 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.890
 even fewer people machines 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.680
 it's the talent of one side a sole of 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.920
 the other cook them all this is going to be 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.490
 assembled to make a little miracle of 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.490
 fashion actually
