really<00:02:10.840> picks<00:02:11.080> it<00:02:11.230> up<00:02:11.319> well<00:02:11.560> and<00:02:11.770> i'm<00:02:11.860> using

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
really picks it up well and i'm using

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.190 
really picks it up well and i'm using
the<00:02:12.310> really<00:02:12.550> fine<00:02:12.760> detail<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.450> regular<00:02:13.750> white

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
the really fine detail a regular white

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.000 
the really fine detail a regular white

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.290 

I've<00:02:25.840> decided<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.560> color<00:02:26.830> in<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.430> tree<00:02:27.700> with<00:02:27.970> my

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
I've decided a color in the tree with my

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.180 
I've decided a color in the tree with my
markers<00:02:28.780> here<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.410> i<00:02:29.440> have<00:02:29.620> my<00:02:29.770> memento

markers here and i have my memento
markers<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.090> they<00:02:31.540> are<00:02:31.810> rich<00:02:32.080> cocoa

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
markers and they are rich cocoa

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.850 
markers and they are rich cocoa
cantaloupe<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.150> bamboo<00:02:34.690> leaves<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.350> i<00:02:35.740> have

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
cantaloupe and bamboo leaves and i have

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.770 
cantaloupe and bamboo leaves and i have
a<00:02:35.890> piece<00:02:36.100> of<00:02:36.130> acetate<00:02:36.400> here<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.360> i'll<00:02:37.480> just<00:02:37.660> be

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
a piece of acetate here and i'll just be

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.930 
a piece of acetate here and i'll just be
scribbling<00:02:38.110> my<00:02:38.530> marker<00:02:38.920> on<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.460> acetate

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
scribbling my marker on to the acetate

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.690 
scribbling my marker on to the acetate
and<00:02:40.240> i'll<00:02:40.990> be<00:02:41.110> using<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.620> water<00:02:41.950> brush<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.520> pick

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
and i'll be using a water brush to pick

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.000 
and i'll be using a water brush to pick
up<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.240> color<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.810> paint<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.380> on<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.830> my

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
up the color and paint it on to my

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.870 
up the color and paint it on to my
little<00:02:45.490> tree<00:02:45.850> here<00:02:46.740> so<00:02:47.740> i'm<00:02:48.010> using<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.610> tim

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
little tree here so i'm using that tim

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.730 
little tree here so i'm using that tim
holtz<00:02:49.240> water<00:02:49.480> brush<00:02:49.750> because<00:02:50.020> i<00:02:50.200> really<00:02:50.530> like

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
holtz water brush because i really like

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.860 
holtz water brush because i really like
the<00:02:50.920> detail<00:02:51.100> if<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.970> don't<00:02:52.180> have<00:02:52.420> one<00:02:52.450> you

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
the detail if you don't have one you

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.900 
the detail if you don't have one you
could<00:02:53.080> certainly<00:02:53.590> use<00:02:53.710> a<00:02:54.220> paintbrush<00:02:54.550> with<00:02:54.700> a

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
could certainly use a paintbrush with a

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.340 
could certainly use a paintbrush with a
little<00:02:55.120> bit<00:02:55.300> of<00:02:55.390> water<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.870> just<00:02:56.020> pick<00:02:56.170> up<00:02:56.200> the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
little bit of water and just pick up the

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.440 
little bit of water and just pick up the
color<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.950> go<00:02:57.070> ahead<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.310> paint<00:02:57.820> in<00:02:58.120> the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
color and go ahead and paint in the

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.080 
color and go ahead and paint in the
lines<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.890> i'm<00:03:00.160> going<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.460> paint<00:03:00.700> each<00:03:00.940> of

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
lines so i'm going to paint each of

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.450 
lines so i'm going to paint each of
these<00:03:01.210> lines<00:03:01.450> in<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.140> as<00:03:02.770> you<00:03:02.920> can<00:03:03.040> see<00:03:03.070> the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
these lines in and as you can see the

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.870 
these lines in and as you can see the
ink<00:03:03.820> just<00:03:04.180> flows<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:04.930> between<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:06.520> embossing

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
ink just flows in between the embossing

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.570 
ink just flows in between the embossing
and<00:03:07.330> i've<00:03:08.110> decided<00:03:08.410> because<00:03:08.740> this<00:03:09.070> tree<00:03:09.310> is<00:03:09.430> a

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
and i've decided because this tree is a

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.280 
and i've decided because this tree is a
little<00:03:09.850> more<00:03:09.970> whimsical<00:03:10.180> looking<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:11.080> it

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
little more whimsical looking that it

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.900 
little more whimsical looking that it
might<00:03:11.470> look<00:03:11.620> better<00:03:11.830> if<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:12.370> just<00:03:12.400> kind<00:03:12.820> of

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
might look better if I just kind of

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.840 
might look better if I just kind of
color<00:03:13.120> outside<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.690> lines<00:03:13.810> as<00:03:14.230> well<00:03:14.550> so<00:03:15.550> here

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
color outside the lines as well so here

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.670 
color outside the lines as well so here
I'm<00:03:15.970> going<00:03:16.180> back<00:03:16.450> over<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.080> just<00:03:17.260> adding<00:03:17.590> a

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
I'm going back over and just adding a

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.080 
I'm going back over and just adding a
little<00:03:17.710> bit<00:03:17.920> more<00:03:18.190> color<00:03:20.460> so<00:03:21.460> next<00:03:21.730> I'm<00:03:22.030> using

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
little bit more color so next I'm using

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.690 
little bit more color so next I'm using
the<00:03:22.810> cantaloupe<00:03:23.470> marker<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.130> scribbling<00:03:24.400> on

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
the cantaloupe marker and scribbling on

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.540 
the cantaloupe marker and scribbling on
to<00:03:24.910> my<00:03:25.030> acetate<00:03:25.600> and<00:03:25.960> before<00:03:26.740> I<00:03:26.770> go<00:03:27.100> to<00:03:27.130> paint

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
to my acetate and before I go to paint

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.100 
to my acetate and before I go to paint
again<00:03:27.850> I<00:03:28.120> want<00:03:28.390> to<00:03:28.450> go<00:03:28.540> ahead<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:28.810> clean<00:03:28.960> off

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
again I want to go ahead and clean off

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.830 
again I want to go ahead and clean off
the<00:03:29.290> tip<00:03:29.500> of<00:03:29.709> my<00:03:30.209> water<00:03:31.209> brush<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.750> I'm<00:03:31.780> just

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
the tip of my water brush and I'm just

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.170 
the tip of my water brush and I'm just
using<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.380> towel<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.920> now<00:03:33.430> I'll<00:03:33.580> be<00:03:33.640> picking<00:03:33.940> up

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
using a towel and now I'll be picking up

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.390 
using a towel and now I'll be picking up
the<00:03:34.239> cantaloupe<00:03:35.020> paint<00:03:35.410> or<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.830> cantaloupe

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
the cantaloupe paint or the cantaloupe

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.300 
the cantaloupe paint or the cantaloupe
marker<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.270> painting<00:03:38.080> into<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.350> star<00:03:38.590> as<00:03:38.770> you

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
marker and painting into the star as you

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.949 
marker and painting into the star as you
can<00:03:39.459> see<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.970> star<00:03:40.209> looks<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:40.570> little<00:03:40.720> bit

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
can see the star looks a little bit

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.820 
can see the star looks a little bit
darker<00:03:41.470> because<00:03:42.340> it's<00:03:42.760> soaking<00:03:43.239> in<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.780> water

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
darker because it's soaking in the water

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.710 
darker because it's soaking in the water
so<00:03:44.830> once<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.190> dries<00:03:45.580> out<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:45.940> little<00:03:46.150> bit<00:03:46.420> it

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
so once that dries out a little bit it

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.970 
so once that dries out a little bit it
will<00:03:47.080> be<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.530> nice<00:03:47.860> yellow<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:49.800> once<00:03:50.800> again

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
will be a nice yellow and once again

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.160 
will be a nice yellow and once again
I'll<00:03:51.370> clean<00:03:51.700> off<00:03:51.820> my<00:03:51.850> brush<00:03:52.270> between<00:03:52.510> colors

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
I'll clean off my brush between colors

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.710 
I'll clean off my brush between colors
and<00:03:53.590> now<00:03:53.980> I'll<00:03:54.160> get<00:03:54.340> ready<00:03:54.520> to<00:03:55.000> use<00:03:55.270> the<00:03:55.570> rich

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
and now I'll get ready to use the rich

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.710 
and now I'll get ready to use the rich
cocoa<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.500> again<00:03:57.340> I'll<00:03:57.459> scribble<00:03:57.700> this<00:03:58.060> on<00:03:58.270> to

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
cocoa and again I'll scribble this on to

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.550 
cocoa and again I'll scribble this on to
the<00:03:58.810> acetate<00:03:59.290> and<00:04:00.120> i'll<00:04:01.120> go<00:04:01.300> ahead<00:04:01.330> and<00:04:01.840> paint

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
the acetate and i'll go ahead and paint
