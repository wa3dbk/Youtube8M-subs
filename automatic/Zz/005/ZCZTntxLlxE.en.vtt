going to tell you what to do well first

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.960 
going to tell you what to do well first
of<00:00:19.410> all<00:00:19.560> when<00:00:19.740> you're<00:00:19.859> removing<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.550> trim

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
of all when you're removing the trim

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.090 
of all when you're removing the trim
work<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.420> everything<00:00:21.660> or<00:00:22.140> crown<00:00:22.650> molding

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
work and everything or crown molding

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.089 
work and everything or crown molding
anything<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:24.119> get<00:00:24.420> like<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.660> knife<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.890> you

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
anything you get like a knife and you

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.890 
anything you get like a knife and you
know<00:00:26.160> start<00:00:26.460> blade<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.849> everything<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.480> cut

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
know start blade and everything and cut

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.290 
know start blade and everything and cut
along<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.320> line<00:00:29.160> where<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.609> coughing<00:00:30.119> is

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
along the line where the coughing is

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.260 
along the line where the coughing is
first<00:00:30.929> then<00:00:31.619> pull<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.070> off<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.520> then<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.940> want

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
first then pull it off and then you want

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.069 
first then pull it off and then you want
to<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.750> any<00:00:33.930> damage<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.300> texturing<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
to have any damage of the texturing and

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.260 
to have any damage of the texturing and
then<00:00:37.680> after<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.160> would<00:00:38.579> recommend<00:00:38.910> that

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
then after that I would recommend that

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.830 
then after that I would recommend that
you<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.440> probably<00:00:40.890> use<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.100> little<00:00:41.250> scraper

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
you can probably use a little scraper

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.510 
you can probably use a little scraper
probably<00:00:42.840> like<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.170> where<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.920> caulking<00:00:44.309> is

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
probably like this where the caulking is

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.290 
probably like this where the caulking is
and<00:00:44.730> kind<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.090> gently<00:00:45.420> scrape<00:00:45.840> off<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
and kind of gently scrape off the

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.450 
and kind of gently scrape off the
caulking<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.510> then<00:00:48.920> you'll<00:00:49.920> be<00:00:50.070> fine<00:00:50.280> after

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
caulking and then you'll be fine after

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.810 
caulking and then you'll be fine after
that<00:00:51.079> but<00:00:52.079> what<00:00:52.289> she<00:00:52.440> did<00:00:52.620> was<00:00:52.829> she<00:00:53.160> pulled<00:00:53.640> she

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
that but what she did was she pulled she

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.880 
that but what she did was she pulled she
probably<00:00:54.059> pulled<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.719> crown<00:00:55.350> molding<00:00:55.559> off

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
probably pulled the crown molding off

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.420 
probably pulled the crown molding off
and<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:57.149> detection<00:00:57.570> came<00:00:57.780> off<00:00:57.989> that's<00:00:58.859> typical

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
and so detection came off that's typical

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.100 
and so detection came off that's typical
so<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.270> need<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.660> do<00:01:00.750> next<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.730> once<00:01:02.730> you

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
so we need to do next is once you

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.570 
so we need to do next is once you
everything's<00:01:04.110> all<00:01:04.290> cleaned<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:05.369> get<00:01:05.549> a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
everything's all cleaned up you get a

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.149 
everything's all cleaned up you get a
spackle<00:01:05.939> knife<00:01:06.060> probably<00:01:06.390> four<00:01:06.689> inch<00:01:06.900> next<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
spackle knife probably four inch next to

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.160 
spackle knife probably four inch next to
go<00:01:08.280> down<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.580> store<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.540> buy<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> joint

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
go down the store you go buy a joint

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.399 
go down the store you go buy a joint
compound<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.610> mud<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.810> mean<00:01:13.320> it's

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
compound it's it's a mud so I mean it's

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.370 
compound it's it's a mud so I mean it's
a<00:01:13.439> real<00:01:13.619> thick<00:01:13.890> mud<00:01:14.930> but<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.140> what<00:01:16.290> you

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
a real thick mud but this is what you

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.850 
a real thick mud but this is what you
need<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.619> do<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.159> make<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.400> look<00:01:17.490> right<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:19.470> once

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
need to do to make it look right so once

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.370 
need to do to make it look right so once
you<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.880> feel<00:01:21.240> like<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.689> wall<00:01:21.900> and

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
you like feel like this is a wall and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.230 
you like feel like this is a wall and

it's like a little path right here you

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.960 
it's like a little path right here you
dip<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.500> smooth<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.920> out<00:01:26.100> don't<00:01:26.850> go

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
dip it in and you smooth it out don't go

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.590 
dip it in and you smooth it out don't go

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.340 
it off and make sure it's pretty level I
usually<00:01:58.920> do<00:01:59.070> two<00:01:59.219> coats<00:01:59.460> so<00:02:00.149> once<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:01.110> first

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
usually do two coats so once the first

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.219 
usually do two coats so once the first
coats<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:02.100> can<00:02:02.509> work<00:02:03.509> around<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.110> then

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
coats you can work around it and then

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.249 
coats you can work around it and then
the<00:02:04.350> second<00:02:04.680> coat<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.159> smoother<00:02:06.110> after<00:02:07.110> that

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
the second coat it's smoother after that

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.740 
the second coat it's smoother after that
after<00:02:07.680> was<00:02:08.039> totally<00:02:08.399> totally<00:02:08.640> dry<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.239> usually

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
after was totally totally dry I usually

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.280 
after was totally totally dry I usually
oil<00:02:10.500> kills<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.940> know<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.120> can<00:02:12.750> oil

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
oil kills it you know you can oil

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.770 
oil kills it you know you can oil
oil<00:02:13.980> face<00:02:14.790> kills<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:16.620> spray<00:02:16.980> one<00:02:17.280> time<00:02:17.780> what

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
oil face kills you spray one time what

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.670 
oil face kills you spray one time what
with<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.079> mud<00:02:19.260> okay<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.280> then<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.209> next

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
with the mud okay and then the next

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.259 
with the mud okay and then the next
after<00:02:22.680> that's<00:02:22.859> dry<00:02:23.189> it<00:02:23.250> should<00:02:23.700> be<00:02:23.790> dry<00:02:23.939> within

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
after that's dry it should be dry within

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.990 
after that's dry it should be dry within
15<00:02:24.689> minutes<00:02:24.959> then<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:26.159> use<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.459> texturing

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
15 minutes then you use a texturing

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.240 
15 minutes then you use a texturing
spray<00:02:27.299> can<00:02:27.599> but<00:02:28.170> i<00:02:28.230> recommend<00:02:28.590> probably<00:02:29.069> going

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
spray can but i recommend probably going

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.460 
spray can but i recommend probably going
outside<00:02:29.609> using<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.060> cardboard<00:02:30.480> box<00:02:30.780> or

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
outside using a cardboard box or

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.410 
outside using a cardboard box or
something<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.640> has<00:02:32.790> paper<00:02:33.120> or<00:02:33.390> anything

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
something that has paper or anything

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.660 
something that has paper or anything
like<00:02:33.659> that<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.500> test<00:02:34.829> out<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.220> texture

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
like that you test out the texture

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.699 
like that you test out the texture
because<00:02:36.209> right<00:02:36.930> here<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.439> you<00:02:38.069> can<00:02:38.250> adjust<00:02:38.689> the

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
because right here is you can adjust the

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.309 
because right here is you can adjust the
texture<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:41.220> how<00:02:41.370> how<00:02:41.970> fast<00:02:42.329> or<00:02:42.569> how<00:02:42.750> all<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
texture that how how fast or how all the

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.990 
texture that how how fast or how all the
heavy<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:44.090> texture<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.170> once<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:47.760> play

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
heavy the texture is once you you play

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.360 
heavy the texture is once you you play
around<00:02:48.239> with<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.870> go<00:02:49.200> back<00:02:49.379> to<00:02:49.409> your<00:02:49.680> your

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
around with it you go back to your your

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.190 
around with it you go back to your your
wall<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.209> match<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:52.049> texture<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:54.200> the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
wall and you match the texture of the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.330 
wall and you match the texture of the
walls<00:02:55.439> because<00:02:55.709> every<00:02:55.889> texture<00:02:56.129> is<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> little

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
walls because every texture is a little

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.849 
walls because every texture is a little
different<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:58.200> then<00:02:58.290> once<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.620> match<00:02:58.829> it

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
different and then once you match it

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.039 
different and then once you match it
then<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.790> start<00:02:59.909> spraying<00:03:00.329> a<00:03:00.629> little<00:03:00.900> bit

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
then you you start spraying a little bit

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.909 
then you you start spraying a little bit
you<00:03:01.200> know<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:03.150> then<00:03:04.109> you<00:03:04.439> work<00:03:04.680> your<00:03:04.709> way

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:04.919 
you know you and then you work your way

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.710 
you know you and then you work your way
out<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.430> when<00:03:05.849> you're<00:03:06.000> working<00:03:06.120> your<00:03:06.359> way<00:03:06.480> out

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
out and when you're working your way out

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.229 
out and when you're working your way out
i<00:03:07.079> recommend<00:03:07.950> probably<00:03:08.220> going<00:03:08.430> about<00:03:08.519> oh

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
i recommend probably going about oh

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.809 
i recommend probably going about oh
about<00:03:09.720> seven<00:03:10.200> inches<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:10.769> then<00:03:11.159> when<00:03:11.669> you're

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
about seven inches and then when you're

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.500 
about seven inches and then when you're
working<00:03:11.939> your<00:03:12.239> way<00:03:12.359> out<00:03:12.599> I<00:03:13.019> would<00:03:13.909> go<00:03:14.909> outwards

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
working your way out I would go outwards

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.960 
working your way out I would go outwards
like<00:03:15.659> this<00:03:16.019> okay<00:03:16.919> and<00:03:17.329> in<00:03:18.329> it<00:03:18.569> feathers<00:03:19.139> it<00:03:19.319> out

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
like this okay and in it feathers it out

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.020 
like this okay and in it feathers it out
so<00:03:20.970> it's<00:03:21.150> not<00:03:21.269> one<00:03:21.479> great<00:03:21.810> big<00:03:22.019> glob<00:03:22.440> of

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
so it's not one great big glob of

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.319 
so it's not one great big glob of
texture<00:03:24.030> that's<00:03:24.599> what<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:24.870> don't<00:03:24.989> want<00:03:25.260> and

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
texture that's what you don't want and

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.520 
texture that's what you don't want and
after<00:03:27.329> you<00:03:27.419> get<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.690> done<00:03:27.989> I<00:03:28.229> would<00:03:28.349> try

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
after you get that done I would try

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.159 
after you get that done I would try
recommend<00:03:29.129> oil<00:03:29.459> killing<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.389> with<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.750> spray

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
recommend oil killing it to with a spray

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.680 
recommend oil killing it to with a spray
can<00:03:31.199> and<00:03:31.709> let<00:03:32.549> that<00:03:32.760> sit<00:03:33.000> for<00:03:33.030> about<00:03:33.269> 15

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
can and let that sit for about 15

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.420 
can and let that sit for about 15
minutes<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.530> reason<00:03:34.799> why<00:03:34.919> you<00:03:34.949> want<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.310> do

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
minutes the reason why you want to do

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.479 
minutes the reason why you want to do
this<00:03:35.579> because<00:03:36.169> when<00:03:37.169> you're<00:03:37.349> painting<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:38.040> wall

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
this because when you're painting a wall

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.969 
this because when you're painting a wall
and<00:03:39.319> the<00:03:40.319> mud<00:03:40.590> or<00:03:40.889> the<00:03:41.549> texture<00:03:42.090> will<00:03:42.750> soak<00:03:43.680> in

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:43.979 
and the mud or the texture will soak in

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:46.250 
and the mud or the texture will soak in
the<00:03:44.370> sheen<00:03:44.819> so<00:03:45.209> if<00:03:45.329> you<00:03:45.449> have<00:03:45.629> like<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.810> semi

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
the sheen so if you have like a semi

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.180 
the sheen so if you have like a semi
gloss<00:03:46.440> or<00:03:46.889> satin<00:03:47.639> Sheen<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.799> you're<00:03:49.799> you're

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
gloss or satin Sheen and you're you're

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.189 
gloss or satin Sheen and you're you're
paying<00:03:50.519> it<00:03:51.919> where<00:03:52.919> your<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.609> are<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.879> hit<00:03:54.209> the

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
paying it where your you are you hit the

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.539 
paying it where your you are you hit the
scene<00:03:55.849> it<00:03:56.849> goes<00:03:57.209> from<00:03:57.620> semi-gloss<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.069> flat

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
scene it goes from semi-gloss to a flat

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.240 
scene it goes from semi-gloss to a flat
almost<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:00.540> you'll<00:04:00.720> see<00:04:00.959> where<00:04:01.349> exactly<00:04:01.859> where

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
almost so you'll see where exactly where

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.140 
almost so you'll see where exactly where
that<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:03.209> texturing<00:04:03.780> was<00:04:04.699> so<00:04:05.699> i<00:04:05.729> recommend

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
that the texturing was so i recommend

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.409 
that the texturing was so i recommend
priming<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.260> area<00:04:07.709> with<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.519> spray<00:04:08.760> can<00:04:09.000> or

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
priming that area with the spray can or

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.390 
priming that area with the spray can or
you<00:04:09.659> can<00:04:09.780> actually<00:04:09.989> prime<00:04:10.409> the<00:04:10.620> whole<00:04:10.829> wall<00:04:11.189> if

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
you can actually prime the whole wall if

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.119 
you can actually prime the whole wall if
you<00:04:11.519> want<00:04:11.759> or<00:04:12.120> or<00:04:12.509> if<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.049> have<00:04:13.199> any<00:04:13.409> regular
