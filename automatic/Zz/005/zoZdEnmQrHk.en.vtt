and the time as you can see there but

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.219 
and the time as you can see there but
let's<00:01:04.519> get<00:01:04.640> actually<00:01:04.910> into<00:01:05.239> using<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.899> device

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
let's get actually into using the device

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:07.960 
let's get actually into using the device
it<00:01:06.590> opens<00:01:06.830> up<00:01:06.979> right<00:01:07.250> at<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.460> little<00:01:07.759> redstone

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
band there and as you can see it houses

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.180 
band there and as you can see it houses
a<00:01:10.220> USB<00:01:10.880> 3.0<00:01:11.660> port<00:01:11.960> now<00:01:12.289> at<00:01:12.530> this<00:01:12.679> point<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.070> may

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
a USB 3.0 port now at this point you may

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.609 
a USB 3.0 port now at this point you may
be<00:01:13.220> thinking<00:01:13.340> it's<00:01:13.820> just<00:01:13.940> a<00:01:14.119> really<00:01:14.360> fancy<00:01:14.689> USB

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.160 
be thinking it's just a really fancy USB
stick<00:01:15.950> but<00:01:16.159> actually<00:01:17.119> it's<00:01:17.270> a<00:01:17.390> whole<00:01:17.630> lot<00:01:17.900> more

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
stick but actually it's a whole lot more

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.590 
stick but actually it's a whole lot more
than<00:01:18.229> that<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:19.040> is<00:01:19.159> a<00:01:19.369> whole<00:01:19.759> lot<00:01:20.180> faster

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
than that and it is a whole lot faster

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.460 
than that and it is a whole lot faster
than<00:01:21.439> a<00:01:21.680> normal<00:01:22.100> USB<00:01:22.400> stick<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.479> it<00:01:23.869> holds<00:01:24.140> all

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
all of your same worlds there are many

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.800 
all of your same worlds there are many
things<00:03:01.100> that<00:03:01.370> are<00:03:01.489> that<00:03:01.670> cross-platform<00:03:02.330> so

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
things that are that cross-platform so

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.880 
things that are that cross-platform so
that's<00:03:02.930> definitely<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.470> plus

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
that's definitely a plus

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.410 
that's definitely a plus
I<00:03:04.130> guess<00:03:04.370> we<00:03:04.489> should<00:03:04.640> also<00:03:04.760> talk<00:03:05.000> about<00:03:05.060> the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
I guess we should also talk about the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.449 
I guess we should also talk about the
design<00:03:05.840> for<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.200> second<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.920> design<00:03:07.220> of<00:03:07.370> it

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
design for a second the design of it

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.790 
design for a second the design of it
seems<00:03:07.700> really<00:03:08.120> good<00:03:08.390> it's<00:03:08.660> very<00:03:08.900> robust<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.680> I

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
seems really good it's very robust and I

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.350 
seems really good it's very robust and I
like<00:03:09.950> how<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.130> screen<00:03:10.430> sort<00:03:10.610> of<00:03:10.760> hides<00:03:11.060> behind

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
like how the screen sort of hides behind

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.850 
like how the screen sort of hides behind
the<00:03:11.660> black<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.200> as<00:03:12.440> soon<00:03:12.590> as<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:12.709> hit<00:03:12.800> the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
cons I can see with this is that it's

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.210 
cons I can see with this is that it's
not<00:03:17.060> size<00:03:17.450> adjustable<00:03:18.260> us<00:03:18.590> have<00:03:18.830> to<00:03:18.920> make<00:03:19.069> sure

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
not size adjustable us have to make sure

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.190 
not size adjustable us have to make sure
you<00:03:19.400> buy<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.610> right<00:03:19.760> size<00:03:20.090> I<00:03:20.360> have<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.840> large

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
you buy the right size I have the large

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.380 
you buy the right size I have the large
version<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.069> does<00:03:22.220> fit<00:03:22.400> me<00:03:22.550> a<00:03:22.580> bit<00:03:22.940> loosely

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
version so it does fit me a bit loosely

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.210 
version so it does fit me a bit loosely
but<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:23.989> would<00:03:24.080> fit<00:03:24.200> my<00:03:24.290> brother<00:03:24.530> quite<00:03:24.860> well

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
but it would fit my brother quite well

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.590 
but it would fit my brother quite well
other<00:03:25.370> than<00:03:25.550> that<00:03:25.670> though<00:03:25.910> it<00:03:26.090> seems<00:03:26.360> really

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
other than that though it seems really

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.690 
other than that though it seems really
nice<00:03:26.840> clasps<00:03:27.799> very<00:03:28.040> well<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.430> seems<00:03:28.640> very

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
nice clasps very well and seems very

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.699 
nice clasps very well and seems very
sturdy<00:03:29.150> while<00:03:29.450> you're<00:03:29.600> wearing<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:30.049> it<00:03:30.560> also

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
sturdy while you're wearing it it also

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.470 
sturdy while you're wearing it it also
seems<00:03:30.950> like<00:03:31.010> it's<00:03:31.220> fairly<00:03:31.519> water<00:03:31.880> resistant

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
seems like it's fairly water resistant

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.910 
seems like it's fairly water resistant
so<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.810> seems<00:03:33.079> pretty<00:03:33.110> ready<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.650> handle
