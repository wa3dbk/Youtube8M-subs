course<00:01:47.970> yeah<00:01:48.149> I'm<00:01:48.299> very<00:01:48.600> interested<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.140> this

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
course yeah I'm very interested in this

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.380 
course yeah I'm very interested in this
because<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.790> direction<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
because it's the direction that the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.330 
because it's the direction that the
world<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.750> going<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.860> know<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.189> you're

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
world is going in and I know that you're

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.460 
world is going in and I know that you're
also<00:01:53.520> very<00:01:53.670> very<00:01:54.270> supportive<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:55.229> all

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
also very very supportive of of all

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.730 
also very very supportive of of all
these<00:01:55.700> efficient<00:01:56.700> energies<00:01:57.229> as<00:01:58.229> great<00:01:58.590> that

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
these efficient energies as great that

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.380 
these efficient energies as great that
you've<00:01:58.890> hosted<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.790> formula<00:02:00.689> E

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
you've hosted the formula E

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.300 
you've hosted the formula E
yeah<00:02:02.930> for<00:02:03.140> sure<00:02:03.290> it<00:02:03.380> has<00:02:03.500> a<00:02:03.530> great<00:02:03.770> future<00:02:04.010> that

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
yeah for sure it has a great future that

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.250 
yeah for sure it has a great future that
that<00:02:04.340> category<00:02:04.730> and<00:02:05.090> also<00:02:05.300> us<00:02:05.420> in<00:02:05.570> f1<00:02:05.900> we<00:02:06.200> are

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
that category and also us in f1 we are

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.320 
that category and also us in f1 we are
now<00:02:06.380> hybrid<00:02:06.800> powers<00:02:07.130> so<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.970> whole<00:02:08.149> way

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
now hybrid powers so the whole way

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.630 
now hybrid powers so the whole way
around<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.690> lab<00:02:08.840> we<00:02:09.410> have<00:02:09.440> hybrid<00:02:09.740> power<00:02:10.070> all

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
around the lab we have hybrid power all

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.870 
around the lab we have hybrid power all
the<00:02:10.789> way<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.510> it's<00:02:11.690> quite<00:02:11.870> unbelievable<00:02:12.170> that

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
the way and it's quite unbelievable that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.730 
the way and it's quite unbelievable that
for<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:13.970> same<00:02:14.180> race<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.930> same<00:02:15.140> race<00:02:15.380> time

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
for the same race and the same race time

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.730 
for the same race and the same race time
and<00:02:15.980> everything<00:02:16.340> we<00:02:16.820> use<00:02:17.060> 1/3<00:02:17.840> less<00:02:18.140> fuel<00:02:18.560> now

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
and everything we use 1/3 less fuel now

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.550 
and everything we use 1/3 less fuel now
so<00:02:19.220> for<00:02:19.400> instead<00:02:19.610> of<00:02:19.670> 150<00:02:20.420> liters<00:02:20.690> we<00:02:21.200> just<00:02:21.410> use

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
so for instead of 150 liters we just use

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.650 
so for instead of 150 liters we just use
hundred<00:02:21.920> liters<00:02:22.160> for<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.730> same<00:02:22.970> speed<00:02:23.420> and

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
hundred liters for the same speed and

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.180 
hundred liters for the same speed and
for<00:02:23.810> everything<00:02:24.260> just<00:02:24.470> by<00:02:24.680> being<00:02:24.920> better

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
for everything just by being better

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.150 
for everything just by being better
technology<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:26.060> more<00:02:27.010> efficient<00:02:28.010> and

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
technology and more efficient and

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.430 
technology and more efficient and
everything<00:02:28.520> so<00:02:28.730> that's<00:02:29.209> quite<00:02:29.540> quite

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
everything so that's quite quite

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.560 
everything so that's quite quite
phenomenal<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.580> think<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.150> you're<00:02:32.270> also

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
phenomenal and I think and you're also

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.570 
phenomenal and I think and you're also
it's<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.200> bit<00:02:33.350> of<00:02:33.470> an<00:02:33.590> intense<00:02:33.920> moment<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:34.370> think

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
it's a bit of an intense moment I think

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.130 
it's a bit of an intense moment I think
with<00:02:34.670> your<00:02:34.820> project<00:02:35.300> of<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.600> solar<00:02:35.840> plane

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
with your project of the solar plane

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.190 
with your project of the solar plane
isn't<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:36.530> yes<00:02:37.010> no<00:02:37.220> it's<00:02:37.459> in<00:02:37.580> Nanjing<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.200> yes

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
isn't it yes no it's in Nanjing and yes

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.940 
isn't it yes no it's in Nanjing and yes
no<00:02:39.470> it's<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.860> it's<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:41.060> great<00:02:41.180> project<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:42.050> Solar

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
no it's a it's a great project the Solar

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.370 
no it's a it's a great project the Solar
Impulse<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.550> we're<00:02:43.730> very<00:02:43.760> happy<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.390> be<00:02:45.290> able

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
Impulse and we're very happy to be able

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.580 
Impulse and we're very happy to be able
to<00:02:45.500> support<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.070> in<00:02:46.100> Monaco<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:47.020> anytime<00:02:48.020> and

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
to support it in Monaco and anytime and

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.170 
to support it in Monaco and anytime and
now<00:02:48.680> but<00:02:48.950> between<00:02:49.310> now<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:49.550> Sunday<00:02:49.880> it's

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
now but between now and Sunday it's

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.729 
now but between now and Sunday it's
gonna<00:02:50.300> leave<00:02:50.630> Nanjing<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.290> across<00:02:51.560> the

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
gonna leave Nanjing to across the

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.290 
gonna leave Nanjing to across the
Pacific<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:52.370> I<00:02:52.400> think<00:02:52.670> that's<00:02:52.820> incredibly

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
Pacific so I think that's incredibly

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.020 
Pacific so I think that's incredibly
well<00:02:53.900> but<00:02:54.260> all<00:02:54.410> I'll<00:02:54.830> tell<00:02:55.070> you<00:02:55.130> about<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.520> more

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
well but all I'll tell you about it more

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.320 
well but all I'll tell you about it more
later<00:02:56.060> yeah<00:02:56.630> but<00:02:56.989> but<00:02:57.620> I<00:02:57.650> think<00:02:58.090> anything<00:02:59.090> that

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
later yeah but but I think anything that

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.949 
later yeah but but I think anything that
can<00:02:59.750> promote<00:03:00.080> an<00:03:00.980> f1<00:03:01.489> is<00:03:01.640> doing<00:03:01.880> that<00:03:02.000> as<00:03:02.209> nikos

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
can promote an f1 is doing that as nikos

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.150 
can promote an f1 is doing that as nikos
has<00:03:03.260> just<00:03:03.500> said<00:03:04.209> energy<00:03:05.209> efficiency<00:03:05.780> and

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
has just said energy efficiency and

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.729 
has just said energy efficiency and
engine<00:03:07.160> efficiency<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.910> hybrid<00:03:08.780> engines<00:03:09.110> i

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
engine efficiency and hybrid engines i

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.699 
engine efficiency and hybrid engines i
think<00:03:10.519> is<00:03:10.640> a<00:03:10.880> great<00:03:11.090> thing<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.390> this<00:03:11.900> formula

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
think is a great thing and this formula

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.870 
think is a great thing and this formula
e<00:03:12.830> series<00:03:13.130> i<00:03:14.030> think<00:03:14.630> is<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.959> great<00:03:15.320> showcase<00:03:15.560> for

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
e series i think is a great showcase for

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.140 
e series i think is a great showcase for
for<00:03:16.880> electric<00:03:17.810> vehicles<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.440> for<00:03:19.280> urban

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
for electric vehicles and for urban

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.050 
for electric vehicles and for urban
mobility<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.840> that's<00:03:21.320> why<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:22.519> great<00:03:22.700> idea

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
mobility and that's why the great idea

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.850 
mobility and that's why the great idea
of<00:03:23.560> formula<00:03:24.560> e<00:03:24.620> was<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.250> have<00:03:26.150> these<00:03:26.480> races<00:03:27.080> in

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
of formula e was to have these races in

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.180 
of formula e was to have these races in
an<00:03:28.459> urban<00:03:28.910> setting<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.510> in<00:03:29.989> major<00:03:30.739> cities

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
an urban setting and in major cities

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.550 
an urban setting and in major cities
around<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.610> world<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:32.299> and<00:03:32.900> I'm<00:03:33.110> happy<00:03:33.140> that

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
around the world and and I'm happy that

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.289 
around the world and and I'm happy that
Monaco<00:03:34.010> of<00:03:34.070> course<00:03:34.280> was<00:03:34.489> part<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:34.760> this<00:03:34.880> first

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
Monaco of course was part of this first

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.130 
Monaco of course was part of this first
series<00:03:36.170> of<00:03:36.320> the<00:03:36.560> first<00:03:36.830> year<00:03:37.100> of<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.340> series

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
series of the first year of the series

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.680 
series of the first year of the series
but<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.170> think<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:39.620> with<00:03:40.480> improvements<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.570> I'm

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
but I think it with improvements and I'm

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.479 
but I think it with improvements and I'm
sure<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:41.989> will<00:03:42.110> improve<00:03:42.470> over<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:43.100> years<00:03:43.250> it

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
sure it will improve over the years it

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.020 
sure it will improve over the years it
will<00:03:43.640> become<00:03:44.830> it's<00:03:45.830> even<00:03:46.130> a<00:03:46.220> very<00:03:46.730> competitive

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
will become it's even a very competitive

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.759 
will become it's even a very competitive
series<00:03:47.420> now<00:03:47.630> but<00:03:47.780> I<00:03:47.840> think<00:03:48.019> it<00:03:48.080> will<00:03:48.170> be<00:03:48.350> even

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
series now but I think it will be even

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.000 
series now but I think it will be even
more<00:03:49.160> popular<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.850> I<00:03:50.840> think<00:03:51.380> along<00:03:51.950> with

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
more popular and I think along with

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.190 
more popular and I think along with
Formula<00:03:52.790> One<00:03:52.910> it's<00:03:53.060> not<00:03:53.269> a<00:03:53.510> question<00:03:54.019> of

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
Formula One it's not a question of

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.110 
Formula One it's not a question of
competing<00:03:54.860> to<00:03:54.980> see<00:03:55.160> who's<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.580> better<00:03:55.790> who's

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
competing to see who's the better who's

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.630 
competing to see who's the better who's
the<00:03:56.299> best<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:57.350> series<00:03:57.739> or<00:03:57.980> who's<00:03:58.130> that<00:03:58.340> what's

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
the best the series or who's that what's

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.490 
the best the series or who's that what's
the<00:03:58.730> best<00:03:58.970> informa<00:03:59.510> but<00:03:59.810> i<00:03:59.840> think<00:04:00.110> they<00:04:00.260> both

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
the best informa but i think they both

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.770 
the best informa but i think they both
come<00:04:01.130> and<00:04:01.280> complement<00:04:01.790> each<00:04:01.820> other<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.630> they

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
come and complement each other and they

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.160 
come and complement each other and they
can<00:04:02.959> bring<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.290> lot<00:04:03.440> of<00:04:03.579> value<00:04:04.579> to<00:04:05.170> that

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
can bring a lot of value to that

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.530 
can bring a lot of value to that
motorsport<00:04:06.890> can<00:04:07.070> can<00:04:07.370> bring<00:04:07.610> to<00:04:07.760> everyone

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
motorsport can can bring to everyone

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.080 
motorsport can can bring to everyone

Nico you do very well he's dead - when
you<00:04:14.090> tell<00:04:14.750> us<00:04:14.810> about<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:15.319> both<00:04:15.709> guys<00:04:15.950> well<00:04:16.940> you

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
you tell us about the both guys well you

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.699 
you tell us about the both guys well you
know<00:04:17.180> I<00:04:17.209> think<00:04:17.359> it's<00:04:17.660> it's<00:04:18.109> it's<00:04:18.380> always

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
know I think it's it's it's always

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.490 
know I think it's it's it's always
difficult<00:04:19.040> to<00:04:19.489> try<00:04:19.699> to<00:04:19.760> compare<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:20.260> father<00:04:21.260> and

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
difficult to try to compare a father and

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.129 
difficult to try to compare a father and
a<00:04:22.010> son<00:04:22.190> I<00:04:22.820> know<00:04:22.970> a<00:04:23.090> little<00:04:23.270> bit<00:04:23.449> about<00:04:23.510> that<00:04:23.900> -

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
a son I know a little bit about that -

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.480 
a son I know a little bit about that -
I'm<00:04:24.680> sure<00:04:24.740> you<00:04:25.130> do

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
I'm sure you do

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.980 
I'm sure you do
but<00:04:26.419> I<00:04:26.750> think<00:04:26.990> that<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:28.610> know<00:04:28.760> both<00:04:29.690> of<00:04:29.720> them

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
but I think that you know both of them

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.439 
but I think that you know both of them
and<00:04:30.169> that<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:31.220> Rosberg<00:04:31.669> name<00:04:31.880> is<00:04:32.060> very<00:04:32.270> well

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
and that the Rosberg name is very well

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.779 
and that the Rosberg name is very well
known<00:04:32.479> in<00:04:32.660> in<00:04:33.560> motorsports<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:34.400> they<00:04:34.460> brought

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
known in in motorsports and they brought

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:40.860 
known in in motorsports and they brought
a<00:04:34.850> lot<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.470> -<00:04:36.470> f1<00:04:37.330> since<00:04:38.330> decades<00:04:38.720> now<00:04:39.139> and<00:04:39.169> and

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
a lot to - f1 since decades now and and

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.159 
a lot to - f1 since decades now and and
maybe<00:04:41.979> and<00:04:42.979> it's<00:04:43.100> hard<00:04:43.280> to<00:04:43.370> compare<00:04:44.169> periods

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
maybe and it's hard to compare periods

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.230 
maybe and it's hard to compare periods
and<00:04:45.380> hard<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:45.830> compare<00:04:46.100> from<00:04:46.729> the<00:04:46.910> one<00:04:47.090> of

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
and hard to compare from the one of

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.570 
and hard to compare from the one of
thirty<00:04:47.840> years<00:04:47.930> ago<00:04:48.320> and<00:04:48.530> and<00:04:48.800> now<00:04:49.130> you<00:04:49.160> know

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
thirty years ago and and now you know

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.689 
thirty years ago and and now you know
but<00:04:50.240> but<00:04:50.930> I<00:04:51.020> think<00:04:51.289> that<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.740> spirit<00:04:52.400> is<00:04:52.490> there

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
but but I think that the spirit is there

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.580 
but but I think that the spirit is there
and<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.419> competitive<00:04:53.930> spirit<00:04:54.050> has<00:04:54.410> always

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
and the competitive spirit has always

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.659 
and the competitive spirit has always
been<00:04:54.800> very<00:04:55.039> very<00:04:55.930> very<00:04:56.930> strong<00:04:57.289> between<00:04:57.889> Nico

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
been very very very strong between Nico

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.570 
been very very very strong between Nico
and<00:04:58.789> his<00:04:58.880> dad<00:04:59.090> is<00:04:59.780> dead<00:04:59.840> maybe<00:05:00.289> had<00:05:01.280> a<00:05:01.310> little

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
and his dad is dead maybe had a little

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.090 
and his dad is dead maybe had a little
less<00:05:01.729> patience<00:05:02.270> than<00:05:02.510> if<00:05:03.350> I<00:05:03.530> may<00:05:03.710> say<00:05:03.919> that

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
less patience than if I may say that

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.240 
less patience than if I may say that
then<00:05:04.430> Nico<00:05:04.940> does<00:05:05.169> but<00:05:06.169> you<00:05:06.919> know<00:05:07.010> they're

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
then Nico does but you know they're

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.250 
then Nico does but you know they're
great<00:05:07.729> competitors<00:05:07.970> in<00:05:08.600> there<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:08.990> great

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
great competitors in there and great

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.350
