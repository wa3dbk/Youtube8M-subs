00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
doll chair and you know you want to turn

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.210 
doll chair and you know you want to turn
it<00:05:06.910> into<00:05:07.030> a<00:05:07.180> regular<00:05:07.660> box<00:05:07.900> again<00:05:08.350> I<00:05:08.380> guess<00:05:08.650> but

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
it into a regular box again I guess but

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.190 
it into a regular box again I guess but
it<00:05:09.370> probably<00:05:09.580> won't<00:05:09.970> be<00:05:10.060> a<00:05:10.180> regular<00:05:10.600> box<00:05:10.840> again

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
it probably won't be a regular box again

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.610 
it probably won't be a regular box again
