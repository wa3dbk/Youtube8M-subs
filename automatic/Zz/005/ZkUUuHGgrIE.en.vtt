00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.789 
work as designed so basically what this
tells<00:01:42.240> us<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.720> he<00:01:43.049> actually<00:01:43.259> went<00:01:43.590> and

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
tells us is that he actually went and

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.139 
tells us is that he actually went and
installed<00:01:44.250> activator<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.790> his<00:01:44.909> device

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
installed activator on his device

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.960 
installed activator on his device
somehow<00:01:45.600> somehow<00:01:46.020> found<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.500> hack<00:01:46.680> and

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
somehow somehow found a hack and

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.130 
somehow somehow found a hack and
assuming<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.210> he<00:01:48.390> got<00:01:48.509> activator<00:01:48.899> honest

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
assuming that he got activator honest

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.870 
assuming that he got activator honest
advice<00:01:49.229> he<00:01:49.530> actually<00:01:49.740> jailbroken<00:01:50.460> maybe

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
advice he actually jailbroken maybe

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.760 
advice he actually jailbroken maybe

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
probably would not release this to the

I mentioned before how it's constantly a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
mouse in a cat-and-mouse game so if this

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.540 
mouse in a cat-and-mouse game so if this

actually<00:02:29.790> released<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.269> would<00:02:30.420> expect<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.810> to

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
actually released I would expect it to

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.570 
actually released I would expect it to
be<00:02:30.989> released<00:02:31.290> after<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.860> final<00:02:32.250> version<00:02:32.400> of

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
be released after the final version of

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.699 
be released after the final version of
iOS<00:02:32.700> 7<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.330> released<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.840> fall<00:02:34.110> by<00:02:34.290> Apple

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
iOS 7 is released in the fall by Apple

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.530 
iOS 7 is released in the fall by Apple
because<00:02:35.250> if<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:35.430> released<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.849> Hillary<00:02:36.180> too

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
because if it's released to Hillary too

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.210 
because if it's released to Hillary too
early<00:02:36.900> Apple<00:02:37.290> might<00:02:37.440> go<00:02:37.590> ahead<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:37.980> patch<00:02:38.190> it

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
early Apple might go ahead and patch it

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.160 
early Apple might go ahead and patch it
they<00:02:38.970> don't<00:02:39.150> want<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.360> release<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.750> too<00:02:39.870> early

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
they don't want to release it too early

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.780 
they don't want to release it too early
because<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:41.040> would<00:02:41.160> be<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> waste<00:02:41.489> of<00:02:41.640> time

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
because that would be a waste of time

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.860 
because that would be a waste of time
they<00:02:42.000> don't<00:02:42.120> have<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.299> come<00:02:42.420> up<00:02:42.540> with<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.690> new

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
they don't have to come up with a new

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.839 
they don't have to come up with a new
jailbreak<00:02:43.140> but<00:02:43.620> this<00:02:44.069> is<00:02:44.220> great<00:02:44.459> news<00:02:44.640> i

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
jailbreak but this is great news i

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.160 
jailbreak but this is great news i
figured<00:02:45.120> i'd<00:02:45.209> update<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.569> guys<00:02:45.629> because<00:02:46.049> it

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
figured i'd update you guys because it

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.930 
figured i'd update you guys because it
actually<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> picture<00:02:47.099> of<00:02:47.310> an<00:02:47.430> ipod<00:02:47.760> touch

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
actually is a picture of an ipod touch

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.020 
actually is a picture of an ipod touch
running<00:02:47.970> iOS<00:02:48.569> 7<00:02:48.959> with<00:02:49.590> an<00:02:49.799> a<00:02:50.099> jailbreak<00:02:50.580> app<00:02:50.819> on

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
running iOS 7 with an a jailbreak app on

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.640 
running iOS 7 with an a jailbreak app on
it<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.510> basically<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.049> has<00:02:52.170> been<00:02:52.349> jailbroken

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
it so basically it has been jailbroken

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.830 
it so basically it has been jailbroken
which<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:53.400> can<00:02:53.549> assume<00:02:53.849> I<00:02:54.090> figured<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.750> guys

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
which we can assume I figured you guys

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.479 
which we can assume I figured you guys
would<00:02:55.049> like<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.319> news<00:02:55.590> as<00:02:55.799> i<00:02:55.920> know<00:02:55.980> i<00:02:56.069> did

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
would like this news as i know i did

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.370 
would like this news as i know i did
because<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.790> shows<00:02:57.209> that<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.959> iphone<00:02:58.230> dev

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
because it shows that the iphone dev

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.020 
because it shows that the iphone dev
team<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.829> hackers<00:02:59.220> are<00:02:59.430> working<00:02:59.910> on

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
team and the hackers are working on

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.789 
team and the hackers are working on
getting<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.360> jailbreak<00:03:00.780> out<00:03:01.019> there<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.680> the

getting a jailbreak out there to the

pretty early on after iOS 7 the final
version<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.269> released<00:03:06.299> or<00:03:06.959> if<00:03:07.410> they<00:03:07.530> actually

pull some strings and find a way to make
it<00:03:09.360> work<00:03:09.569> early<00:03:10.019> they<00:03:10.170> might<00:03:10.349> release<00:03:10.500> it

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
it work early they might release it

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.530 
it work early they might release it
early<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:11.130> release<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.180> different<00:03:12.420> version

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
early and release a different version

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.330 
early and release a different version
later<00:03:12.780> but<00:03:13.049> I<00:03:13.079> doubt<00:03:13.140> they<00:03:13.440> would<00:03:13.530> do<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.709> but

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
later but I doubt they would do that but

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.979 
later but I doubt they would do that but
