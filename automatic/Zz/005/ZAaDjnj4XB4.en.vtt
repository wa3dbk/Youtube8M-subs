00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.440
 felt 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:56.010
 and so put gums here and paste it like this 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.010
 and do the same in Europe 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.090

 ungrateful and clear tube pot and coma 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.360

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.360
 exquisite 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:50.560
 here step 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:54.340
 very carefully because you already know that 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:05:00.599

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.599

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:14.100
 and now it will lower its boat of special 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:18.390

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:21.470

 now it 's a plate 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:58.330
 Well, that was all 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:00.520
 the option is that you decorate it or what 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.729
 paint as you want I did this 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.610
