00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:52.410 
character later in the game I think it

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:58.520 
character later in the game I think it
might<00:07:52.620> be<00:07:52.650> Oh<00:07:56.780> guess<00:07:57.780> what<00:07:57.900> we<00:07:58.200> have<00:07:58.410> an

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:58.530 
might be Oh guess what we have an

we'll<00:08:00.270> take<00:08:00.480> it

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:01.790 
we'll take it

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:08.680 
we'll take it
okey<00:08:02.790> dokey<00:08:03.180> here<00:08:03.420> we<00:08:03.570> go
