bracket is mounted in the middle so you

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.700 
bracket is mounted in the middle so you
just<00:01:13.729> simply<00:01:14.030> flip<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:14.330> drum<00:01:14.659> over<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:15.380> now

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
we have the mesh quiet practice side so

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.249 
we have the mesh quiet practice side so
you<00:01:19.310> flip<00:01:19.789> your<00:01:19.940> toms<00:01:20.240> over<00:01:21.940> add<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.750> pad<00:01:23.990> to

practice<00:01:27.319> whether<00:01:27.590> you're<00:01:27.830> sitting<00:01:28.100> or

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
practice whether you're sitting or

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.690 
practice whether you're sitting or
standing<00:01:29.770> pretty<00:01:30.770> interesting<00:01:31.190> design<00:01:31.520> and

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
standing pretty interesting design and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.139 
standing pretty interesting design and
the<00:01:31.850> same<00:01:32.119> does<00:01:33.009> change<00:01:34.009> over<00:01:34.280> concept

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
the same does change over concept

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.059 
the same does change over concept
applies<00:01:35.479> to<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.750> bass<00:01:35.929> drum<00:01:36.259> you<00:01:36.649> can<00:01:36.800> switch

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
applies to the bass drum you can switch

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.460 
applies to the bass drum you can switch
the<00:01:37.340> Spurs<00:01:37.750> flip<00:01:38.750> it<00:01:38.899> around

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
the Spurs flip it around

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.399 
the Spurs flip it around
switch<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.310> riser<00:01:40.929> then<00:01:41.929> mounts<00:01:42.200> on<00:01:42.319> the

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
switch the riser then mounts on the

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.039 
switch the riser then mounts on the
bottom<00:01:42.799> and<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:43.819> you're<00:01:43.970> not<00:01:44.090> taking<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.840> drum

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
bottom and so you're not taking the drum

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.960 
bottom and so you're not taking the drum
apart<00:01:45.440> to<00:01:45.740> make<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:46.039> happen<00:01:46.429> to<00:01:46.729> make<00:01:46.759> the

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
apart to make it happen to make the

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.789 
apart to make it happen to make the
transition<00:01:47.330> happen<00:01:47.840> it's<00:01:48.170> just<00:01:48.289> simply

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
transition happen it's just simply

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.760 
transition happen it's just simply
flipping<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.819> drums<00:01:50.409> shifting<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:51.500> drums

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
flipping the drums shifting the drums

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.340 
flipping the drums shifting the drums
and<00:01:52.159> and<00:01:52.549> do<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:52.729> foresee<00:01:53.119> people<00:01:53.450> using<00:01:53.810> this

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
and and do you foresee people using this

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.499 
and and do you foresee people using this
for<00:01:55.219> practice<00:01:55.670> they're<00:01:55.820> also<00:01:55.969> in<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.299> very

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
for practice they're also in a very

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.510 
for practice they're also in a very
quiet<00:01:56.750> situation<00:01:57.380> well<00:01:57.799> I<00:01:57.829> think<00:01:58.039> it's<00:01:58.250> both

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
quiet situation well I think it's both

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.010 
quiet situation well I think it's both
and<00:01:58.850> even<00:01:59.060> more<00:01:59.380> being<00:02:00.380> compact<00:02:01.039> quiet

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
and even more being compact quiet

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.039 
and even more being compact quiet
audible<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.619> can<00:02:03.920> be<00:02:04.130> in<00:02:04.340> your<00:02:04.490> house<00:02:04.700> at<00:02:05.149> one

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
audible it can be in your house at one

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.120 
audible it can be in your house at one
o'clock<00:02:06.259> in<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.530> morning<00:02:06.920> when<00:02:07.039> you're

small<00:02:12.410> footprint<00:02:12.920> doesn't<00:02:13.489> mean<00:02:13.760> it's<00:02:13.940> a

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
small footprint doesn't mean it's a
