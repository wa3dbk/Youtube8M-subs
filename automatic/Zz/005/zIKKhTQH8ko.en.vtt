00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
the Milan actually looks like kind of

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.420 
the Milan actually looks like kind of
like<00:01:14.360> an<00:01:14.510> Alfa<00:01:14.780> Romeo<00:01:14.870> from<00:01:15.440> the<00:01:15.620> back<00:01:15.800> kind<00:01:16.340> of

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
like an Alfa Romeo from the back kind of

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.030 
like an Alfa Romeo from the back kind of
like<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.700> Italian<00:01:17.290> looking<00:01:18.290> taillights<00:01:18.920> it

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
like the Italian looking taillights it
