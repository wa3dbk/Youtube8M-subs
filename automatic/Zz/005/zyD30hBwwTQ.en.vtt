00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.590
 and the holidays may be the time 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.450
 probably more expected by the 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.160
 young not so much for the time but 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.289
 obligations and offers of activities to 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.910
 outdoors but by the long 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.830
 periods that can happen for example 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.180
 in front of video games in many 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.550
 Sometimes the preference for these 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.530
 hobbies can reach even the 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.600
 addiction we want to talk more about 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.860
 this topic accompanies us here in the study 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.420
 the principal therapy 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.250
 occupational of the bernardo university 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.689
 o'higgins rodolfo morris or with whom 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.879
 let's address this as it is red 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.789
 thank you for being with us and good 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.649
 in the logic of one as an adult could 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.239
 think how good is time outdoors 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.010
 I could not go to the pool I could do 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.109
 a lot of activities and it usually happens 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.789
 and I had to see what the children 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.499
 love being in front of video games 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.670
 insistently when there are so many 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:52.909
 activities to do first 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.950
 we explain why this is generated very 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.720
 interesting 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.100
 think what you are raising in the 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.220
 background because children tend to choose 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.930
 activities like participating in 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.460
 true video games versus being at 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.200
 outdoors etc. then you have to 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.190
 think first that video games are 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.900
 entertained 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.610
 it's fun one has a good time when 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.500
 you play is involved in the game true 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.500
 there are certain challenges that one goes 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.729
 constantly surpassing that in 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.100
 certain video games allows the 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.190
 development of certain skills the 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.870
 problem is when that is what 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.550
 basically converts the only activity 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.680
 that kids play there where 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.520
 the problem begins is when I 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.560
 for example I think about the balance 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.479
 of a routine a child should think about 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.830
 that a smaller percentage of activities 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.300
 should relate to the use of 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.619
 video game 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.240
 the problem is generated when that 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.190
 percentage is higher and it starts to 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.450
 constantly expand then 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.160
 children are obviously going to choose the 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.130
 video games because it generates a 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.979
 generally immediate gratification 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.270
 allows you to challenge yourself are constantly going 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.130
 discovering new skills 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.140
 now there are few of several types of 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.600
 more and less interactive games and 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.250
 there are also games that are 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.659
 recurrently purchased that are the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.289
 first ranking places that are from 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.060
 fight or more violent that happens as one 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.670
 as parents regulates the time in which 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.489
 your child may be in front of a 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.769
 video game presses a console that's the 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.750
 difference between the type of game and the 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.430
 time and I step in front of a game when 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.440
 we think the types of game I have to 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.360
 look first at the child's age 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.700
 true the age that has the games 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.310
 they come labeled original but also 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.730
 a labeling is indicated so that it gives 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.620
 indicate you can play while verses 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.630
 of time I do not think about time 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.239
 I have to think that at least one 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.660
 hour a day would be something more or less 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.180
 reasonable 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.530
 the experts point out that I should not 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.410
 go through teenage children 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.840
 we should spend more than two hours truth 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.790
 the day in front of a screen then yes 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.709
 I distributed the time for example 45 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.079
 minutes a video game other minutes more 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.299
 watching a movie some rest then 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.610
 ends of the movie and so on I do not know no 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.350
 would win any kind 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.870
 the problem appears again when 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.660
 this occupies all my time and when I 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.030
 I'm always thinking about going to the 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.250
 video games in which I have to overcome such 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.810
 level I'm at school thinking 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.340
 who comes quickly to the house to continue 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.470
 playing that catches my attention after 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.880
 mentioned hours and probably many 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.000
 let's know cases where there are children who 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.040
 they are a full afternoon in front of 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.930
 videogame the mom that exists that does not 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.900
 do in the end can cause effects 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.790
 real negatives the fact that girls 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.010
 so much time in front of a console 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.390
 videogames if it was provoke some kind 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.070
 problems us from the therapy 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.600
 occupational we talk about balance 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.910
 occupational or balance of 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.020
 activities that I perform and we go 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.300
 think that there are activities 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.160
 productive activities 12 free time 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.959
 and rest activities has to exist 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.850
 a balance between those three types of 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.350
 activities we think that a 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.450
 boy spends most of his time 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.890
 only free time activities and 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.220
 of leisure forgiveness 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.080
 leaving aside for example in times of 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.680
 school children when they have certain tasks 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.829
 who made 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.420
 true dear ones with the school we 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.760
 that you can generate a problem first 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.530
 because it's not going to perform many times 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.390
 they generate the same problems by themes 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.560
 of concentration children are in the 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.569
 school they are thinking they have 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.280
 that get to play the games and 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.989
 complete the level therefore there is 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.789
 It also generates another type of problem 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.090
 so very important that parents 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:24.509
 can regulate this situation by putting 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.030
 schedules that are rigid truth in what 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:28.949
 possible, obviously that is changing 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.710
 the extent that I am in school or 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.690
 If I'm in vacation time but still 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.639
 so always important to handle the 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.349
 habits and routines of the specific that 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.520
 this summer there are many children 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.289
 who stay with their brothers more 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.639
 great because parents work has not 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.320
 gone on vacation and they do not go to the 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.820
 school the brothers biggest clear 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.889
 remember that the children are fine but 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.419
 they probably are not over seeing what 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.130
 things you did inside of which mom 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.320
 he left in the obligation like a father 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.880
 can organize a routine and as well 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.610
 can you be marc to the child so that 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.560
 also do other things 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.180
 to understand that video games are not a 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.490
 right for children but they are a 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.780
 privilege is an activity of one another 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.819
 way it could work like a 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.280
 reward therefore if I structure 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.050
 routine in this way where the 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.659
 children have to perform these tasks 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.360
 of support to the house during the morning or 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:16.250
 outdoor activities etcetera and 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.020
 I'm thinking of rewarding someone else 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.819
 way that this child is fulfilling 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.159
 those your little obligations in the 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:24.139
 fund for rewarding with an hour 45 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:25.849
 minutes video games you have to 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.349
 do obviously we have to 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:28.790
 see how I agree with 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.240
 the family 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:35.420
 and many times the parents who go to 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.950
 disagree with each other regarding the rules 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.630
 it is very important that parents are 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.110
 agree if an hour is set is 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.270
 the hour does not ask you anything more than 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.010
 this generated a major problem 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.410
 that children have a reference in 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.510
 Regarding the rules that are good 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.930
 established and concrete that standard 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:56.900
 it must also be let's say considering the 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.240
 age of children because a child 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.520
 I am inventing for 5 years playing 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.090
 all afternoon I imagine that it will not be what 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.610
 same as a teenager 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.350
 if according to our cycle we 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.550
 we have certain different interests and 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.320
 that will also be expressed in the 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.449
 video games are not the same games 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:17.790
 truth from that point of view is 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:20.530
 important to think that independent of 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.330
 the age that I have spend an afternoon 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.280
 complete every day a week 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.560
 playing video games is a certain way 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.750
 problematic because because I leave aside 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.600
 other activities therefore either a 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.530
 child who is 5 years old a teenager 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.570
 15-16 has to have a balance 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.100
 regarding the activities that I perform 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.350
 what are you imagining to have and already 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.360
 to complete eyes parents also to 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.100
 buying the games turns out to make the 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.290
 parents many of them work a 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.060
 prolonged time is also with the 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.350
 children and good children make up for it 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.340
 who likes videogames and dads 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.740
 also sometimes without realizing 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.970
 They encourage me a little bit when buying 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.169
 all the games available in the 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.219
 market and all that are fashionable 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:57.379
 and there it is important that parents 

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:58.789
 report that is to remove it exists in 

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:00.650
 internet a lot of 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:02.509
 video games and portals on the internet where 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.099
 information is provided to parents 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:05.629
 Regarding the types of videogames 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:07.340
 truth and from that very point of view 

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:10.490
 important to inform themselves before 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.810
 make some kind of purchase that can be 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.759
