filter<00:00:04.259> it's<00:00:04.979> actually<00:00:05.279> under<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.459> backseat

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:06.769 
filter it's actually under the backseat

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:09.890 
filter it's actually under the backseat
so<00:00:07.769> you<00:00:07.830> push<00:00:08.250> in<00:00:08.549> these<00:00:08.880> little<00:00:09.210> tabs<00:00:09.420> and

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
so you push in these little tabs and

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.070 
so you push in these little tabs and
then<00:00:10.500> you<00:00:10.589> can<00:00:10.740> access<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.750> it's<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.870> this

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.000 

piece<00:00:16.080> down<00:00:16.350> here<00:00:18.260> does<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.440> keep<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.800> seat

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
piece down here does that keep the seat

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.740 
piece down here does that keep the seat
up<00:00:21.800> it's<00:00:22.800> glued<00:00:23.520> down<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.240> you'll<00:00:24.450> have<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.630> pry

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
up it's glued down so you'll have to pry

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.259 
up it's glued down so you'll have to pry
it<00:00:24.780> up<00:00:24.930> I've<00:00:25.170> opened<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.650> before<00:00:32.210> to<00:00:33.210> avoid

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269 
it up I've opened this before to avoid

leaking<00:00:33.809> gas<00:00:34.379> when<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.940> pull<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> hose<00:00:36.179> off

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
leaking gas when you pull the hose off

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:46.040 
leaking gas when you pull the hose off
the<00:00:36.539> filter<00:00:37.609> try<00:00:38.609> on<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.789> car<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:45.780> go<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.929> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the filter try on the car and go to the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.340 
the filter try on the car and go to the
under<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.920> hood

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.060 

there's<00:00:50.920> fuse<00:00:51.220> box<00:00:51.489> so<00:00:52.470> you<00:00:53.470> look<00:00:53.620> for<00:00:53.650> your

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
there's fuse box so you look for your

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.770 
there's fuse box so you look for your
fuel<00:00:54.280> pump

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:06.160 

right<00:00:59.380> here

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.020 

so<00:01:07.170> now<00:01:07.320> now<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.250> out<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.430> gas<00:01:08.580> because<00:01:08.820> it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
so now now it's out of gas because it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.310 
so now now it's out of gas because it
sucked<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.510> rest<00:01:09.690> of<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.900> through<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> line

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
sucked the rest of it through the line

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.910 
sucked the rest of it through the line
it<00:01:10.619> wasn't<00:01:10.920> no<00:01:11.340> more<00:01:11.520> was<00:01:11.640> being<00:01:11.850> pumped<00:01:15.920> so

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
it wasn't no more was being pumped so

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.469 
it wasn't no more was being pumped so
now<00:01:17.009> I'm<00:01:17.070> gonna<00:01:17.190> have<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> left<00:01:17.580> least<00:01:18.240> amount

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
now I'm gonna have the left least amount

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.930 
now I'm gonna have the left least amount
of<00:01:18.570> spillage<00:01:18.930> possible<00:01:21.140> that's<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.409> gas

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
of spillage possible that's out of gas

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:30.590 
of spillage possible that's out of gas
pull<00:01:23.940> off<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:27.750> electrical<00:01:28.170> plug<00:01:29.330> and<00:01:30.330> then

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
pull off the electrical plug and then

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.160 
pull off the electrical plug and then
I'm<00:01:30.690> gonna<00:01:31.159> squeeze<00:01:32.159> these<00:01:32.550> blue<00:01:32.759> tabs

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
I'm gonna squeeze these blue tabs

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.240 
I'm gonna squeeze these blue tabs
actually<00:01:34.170> first<00:01:36.140> put<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> little<00:01:37.380> paper<00:01:37.950> towels

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
actually first put a little paper towels

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.490 
actually first put a little paper towels
underneath<00:01:38.550> because<00:01:39.420> there's<00:01:40.229> still<00:01:40.410> gonna

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
underneath because there's still gonna

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.690 
underneath because there's still gonna
be<00:01:40.590> some<00:01:40.649> gas<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.460> comes<00:01:41.640> out<00:01:43.580> it's<00:01:44.580> almost

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
be some gas that comes out it's almost

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.760 
be some gas that comes out it's almost
unavoidable<00:01:45.410> and<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.050> some<00:01:49.259> spill<00:01:49.590> in

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
unavoidable and to have some spill in

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.770 
unavoidable and to have some spill in
here<00:01:50.039> I've<00:01:50.940> done<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.630> before<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:54.479> smell

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
here I've done this before and the smell

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.840 
here I've done this before and the smell
of<00:01:54.810> gas<00:01:55.050> is<00:01:55.470> not<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.159> ting<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:56.490> need<00:01:56.580> to<00:01:56.670> deal

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
of gas is not a ting we need to deal

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.870 
of gas is not a ting we need to deal
with<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.119> all<00:01:57.210> day<00:01:57.470> because<00:01:58.470> it<00:01:58.649> takes<00:01:58.860> gas<00:01:59.700> is

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
with it all day because it takes gas is

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.430 
with it all day because it takes gas is
a<00:01:59.909> strong<00:02:00.210> smell<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.720> takes<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:01.020> little<00:02:01.170> bit<00:02:01.259> to

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
a strong smell it takes a little bit to

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.540 
a strong smell it takes a little bit to
go<00:02:01.560> away<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:03.000> if<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.420> get<00:02:03.569> it<00:02:03.659> onto

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
go away so if you can get it onto

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.060 
go away so if you can get it onto
something<00:02:05.550> disposable<00:02:06.409> and<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:07.920> just

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
something disposable and you can just

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.470 
something disposable and you can just
throw<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.310> out<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.700> don't<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.940> deal<00:02:09.090> with<00:02:09.239> it

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.730 

so<00:02:12.480> there's<00:02:12.660> two<00:02:12.840> sides

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:23.720 

there's<00:02:16.340> this<00:02:16.490> side<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:18.430> on<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.550> other<00:02:19.640> side

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.860 

got<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.450> out<00:02:24.569> I<00:02:25.700> did<00:02:26.700> spill<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.120> little<00:02:27.360> bit<00:02:27.599> I

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
got it out I did spill a little bit I

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.680 
got it out I did spill a little bit I
tried<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.319> clean<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.620> up<00:02:28.739> as<00:02:29.250> best<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.610> can<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:30.630> I

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
tried to clean it up as best I can so I

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.630 
tried to clean it up as best I can so I
got<00:02:30.810> one<00:02:30.959> side<00:02:31.170> out<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.560> then<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.190> tried<00:02:32.610> to

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
got one side out and then I tried to

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.750 
got one side out and then I tried to
tilt<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.060> up<00:02:33.209> so<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.830> fuel<00:02:35.099> goes<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.580> way

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
tilt it up so the fuel goes that way

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.350 
tilt it up so the fuel goes that way
towards<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.630> other<00:02:36.750> hose<00:02:37.489> but<00:02:38.489> still<00:02:39.120> when<00:02:39.300> I

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
towards the other hose but still when I

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.020 
towards the other hose but still when I
got<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.630> side<00:02:39.870> off<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:41.520> spilled<00:02:41.850> out<00:02:42.000> a

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
got this side off it spilled out a

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.030 
got this side off it spilled out a
little<00:02:42.300> bit<00:02:43.550> so<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.610> just<00:02:44.790> quickly<00:02:45.209> plugged<00:02:45.569> it

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
little bit so I just quickly plugged it

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.270 
little bit so I just quickly plugged it
with<00:02:47.040> on<00:02:47.430> both<00:02:47.640> sides<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.209> I<00:02:48.270> took<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.540> outside

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
with on both sides and I took it outside

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.380 
with on both sides and I took it outside
so<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.310> didn't<00:02:50.610> spill<00:02:50.790> their<00:02:50.970> aim<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.180> didn't

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
so I didn't spill their aim I didn't

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.699 
so I didn't spill their aim I didn't
spill<00:02:51.540> very<00:02:51.750> much<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:57.780> figure<00:02:58.080> out<00:02:58.110> was<00:02:58.290> which

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
spill very much you figure out was which

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.509 
spill very much you figure out was which
way<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:59.040> goes<00:02:59.130> because<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.790> electrical<00:03:00.450> tab

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
way this goes because the electrical tab

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.130 
way this goes because the electrical tab
blue<00:03:02.519> line<00:03:02.760> goes<00:03:02.940> one<00:03:03.150> way<00:03:05.600> then<00:03:06.600> when<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:06.750> want

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
blue line goes one way then when I want

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:19.759 
blue line goes one way then when I want
a<00:03:07.290> cycle<00:03:10.069> still<00:03:11.069> pump<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.340> few<00:03:11.489> times<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.620> that

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
a cycle still pump a few times so that

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.660 
a cycle still pump a few times so that
that<00:03:20.569> filter<00:03:21.569> is<00:03:21.630> not<00:03:21.810> empty<00:03:22.370> might<00:03:23.370> be<00:03:23.489> hard

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
that filter is not empty might be hard

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:49.390 
that filter is not empty might be hard
to<00:03:23.730> start<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.150> first<00:03:24.299> time

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.690 

sounds<00:03:50.400> better<00:03:50.930> it<00:03:51.930> was<00:03:52.130> it<00:03:53.130> was<00:03:53.280> running<00:03:53.580> kind

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
sounds better it was it was running kind

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.120 
sounds better it was it was running kind
of<00:03:53.820> rough<00:03:53.970> ever<00:03:54.600> since<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:54.960> ran<00:03:55.410> out<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.590> gas

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
of rough ever since I ran out of gas

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.640 
of rough ever since I ran out of gas
which<00:03:56.280> is<00:03:56.400> why<00:03:56.520> I<00:03:56.550> changed<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:57.420> filter

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
which is why I changed the filter

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.440 
which is why I changed the filter
everything<00:03:58.650> around<00:03:58.830> out<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.070> gas<00:03:59.220> you<00:04:00.150> should

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
everything around out of gas you should

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.750 
everything around out of gas you should
probably<00:04:00.630> change<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.050> filter<00:04:01.760> because

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
probably change the filter because

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.910 
probably change the filter because
there's<00:04:03.720> sediment<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.350> builds<00:04:04.590> up<00:04:04.680> in<00:04:04.830> the

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
there's sediment that builds up in the

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.010 
there's sediment that builds up in the
bottom<00:04:05.190> of<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.370> tank<00:04:05.610> so<00:04:06.510> when<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:06.720> run<00:04:06.840> all

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
bottom of the tank so when you run all

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.650 
bottom of the tank so when you run all
the<00:04:07.110> way<00:04:07.140> out<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.410> gas<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:08.790> sucks<00:04:09.180> up<00:04:09.330> a<00:04:09.480> bunch

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
the way out of gas it sucks up a bunch

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.400 
the way out of gas it sucks up a bunch
of<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.900> dirt<00:04:10.110> and<00:04:10.490> just<00:04:11.490> grit<00:04:11.850> that<00:04:12.320> ends<00:04:13.320> up

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
of the dirt and just grit that ends up

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.180 
of the dirt and just grit that ends up
in<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.620> bottom<00:04:13.770> there

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.640 

sweet<00:04:20.190> yeah<00:04:23.330> it's<00:04:24.330> something<00:04:24.990> easy<00:04:25.230> to<00:04:25.320> change

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
sweet yeah it's something easy to change

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.580 
sweet yeah it's something easy to change
you<00:04:26.310> should<00:04:26.340> probably<00:04:26.730> do<00:04:26.940> it<00:04:27.060> every<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:27.600> don't

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
you should probably do it every I don't

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.010 
you should probably do it every I don't
know<00:04:29.420> the<00:04:30.500> price<00:04:31.500> isn't<00:04:31.740> an<00:04:31.890> annual<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:33.020> once

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
know the price isn't an annual the once

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.640 
know the price isn't an annual the once
in<00:04:34.170> a<00:04:34.230> while

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
in a while

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.630 
in a while
30,000<00:04:35.640> miles<00:04:35.790> or<00:04:36.120> so<00:04:36.380> saying<00:04:37.380> it's<00:04:37.860> a<00:04:38.130> couple

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
30,000 miles or so saying it's a couple

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.920 
30,000 miles or so saying it's a couple
bucks<00:04:38.790> for<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.060> filter<00:04:39.450> you<00:04:39.600> don't<00:04:39.720> need<00:04:39.810> any

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
bucks for the filter you don't need any

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.890 
bucks for the filter you don't need any
tools<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.260> change<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.740> it's<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:41.760> it's<00:04:42.150> a<00:04:42.750> good

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
tools to change it it's a it's a good

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.290
