00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 what 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.139
 the amd zacate e-350 processor does not handle three of the shots thoroughly 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.839
 we are in two exits a vga 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.269
 a hdmi and the screen she from the human netbook that are shown here but 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.199
 we can not exploit 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.029
 the three screens in parallel against yurts very well operated 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.890
 a screen on the locker room after a second screen on the mini hd and so 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.269
 make the netbook a sedentary solution quite convincing 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.410
 in opposition so his top of half-closed vehicles in a 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.060
 corner with a keyboard a mouse deported 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.270
 in europe are used 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.460
 the machine so quite the very standard oguchi screen this 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.020
 who makes a solution really 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.020
 really interesting for who if I have fangs 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.880
 dunne and access shopkeepers disabled the vga screen the fangs 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.740
 buy a 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.910
 we will be able to speak in first and in China 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.900
 they watched on full screen big respect initiated in 1080p directly on 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.960
 the machine very fluid and very convincing if we brochand more 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.520
 his ebook on a pair of sedentary speakers a simple plan integrate 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.190
 a solution or a home amp a solution that is the complete 5% here 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.140
 I had to brake 80 countries that were worn frozen united 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.140
 and it really works very very well 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.460
 they are 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.090
 in the brawl on the booklet perfectly perfectly viable 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.280
 of course there will also be several examples where the idea 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.300
 to use others 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.670
 a much more classic solution with m 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.160
 lÃ¼thi simon from my screen of netbooks and pittsburgh documents 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.220
 deported the signal 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.350
 the last step 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.680
 on a bigger screen 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.490
 and so it allows for example to play and send that its clear signal 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.540
 the to the screen plus the biggest gift of being able to play on the TV 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.460
 with 1 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.000
 a panel is for example to be able to use the machine to replay on a 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.430
 TV 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.770
 in 1080p 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.580
 this is what it can give 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.580
 it's been five years 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.029
 so the idea again is not played these last days of death with 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.659
 its terraces cars and weight that has not hurt that passes 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.429
 it is rather to walk with her husband 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:36.069
 for this type of device a simple HDMI cable for its purposes and for example 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.889
 in a hotel room can connect to the television room 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:43.519
 to eliminate this moment on the bouquet to be able to play in bed 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.930
 for now all three social issues of china that will become able to become 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.160
 a true multimedia box full on vacation in big thing emissions 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.020
 at sight it is 10 o'clock you have in your rental in your room 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.759
 hotel 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:03:00.449
 % and% also a small family friendly game console 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.739
 it's really a machine that is yours really the sincere road 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.119
 works rather very well 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.619
 it also allows to use this machine turns for educational purposes 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:16.849
 all that will be very much in love with this meeting inscribed big thing 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.799
 for us too so at home with 3d capabilities we are for example 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.299
 to make toy with taste the hole of their stock it works rather not 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.999
 wrong 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:28.219
 m after all depends on your connection 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.219
 and it works pretty well 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.049
 there I am on the Japanese coast 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.269
 so it's a little time 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.409
 fast and easy titan 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.700
 and therefore a dead a tool that's the same for this guy 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:44.719
 used there 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.239
 the machine is really very very close 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.369
 very fast very efficient
