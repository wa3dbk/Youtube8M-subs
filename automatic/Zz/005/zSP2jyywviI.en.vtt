and just watching people hurt cars real
bad<00:03:50.959> over<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.380> years<00:03:51.590> we've<00:03:51.860> decided<00:03:52.280> that

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
bad over the years we've decided that

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.040 
bad over the years we've decided that
lassic<00:03:52.819> cars<00:03:53.000> it<00:03:53.360> was<00:03:53.420> time<00:03:53.630> to<00:03:53.660> fix<00:03:53.930> that

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
lassic cars it was time to fix that

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.800 
lassic cars it was time to fix that
problem<00:03:54.310> so<00:03:55.310> hence<00:03:55.730> we<00:03:55.819> developed<00:03:56.569> what<00:03:56.780> they

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
problem so hence we developed what they

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.140 
problem so hence we developed what they
call<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.260> slider<00:03:57.560> which<00:03:57.980> is<00:03:58.100> a<00:03:58.250> KC<00:03:58.520> slider<00:03:58.940> if

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
call the slider which is a KC slider if

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.330 
call the slider which is a KC slider if
classic<00:03:59.540> cars<00:03:59.750> and<00:04:00.020> that's<00:04:00.950> what<00:04:01.190> we're

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
classic cars and that's what we're

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.180 
classic cars and that's what we're
trying<00:04:01.550> to<00:04:01.640> promote<00:04:01.790> today
