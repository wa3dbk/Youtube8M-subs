that matter walkthrough episode 13 I
believe<00:00:07.259> we're<00:00:07.890> doing<00:00:07.919> crystal<00:00:08.760> castle<00:00:09.389> this

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
believe we're doing crystal castle this

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.070 
believe we're doing crystal castle this
time<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.590> let's<00:00:11.010> jump<00:00:11.370> right<00:00:11.460> into<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:14.750> okay<00:00:15.750> so

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
time so let's jump right into it okay so

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.510 
time so let's jump right into it okay so
there's<00:00:16.260> no<00:00:16.379> starting<00:00:16.800> dialogue<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.340> time

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
there's no starting dialogue this time

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.490 
there's no starting dialogue this time
but<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.820> level<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.420> strip<00:00:18.840> barely

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
but this level is strip barely

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.359 
but this level is strip barely
straightforward<00:00:20.070> um<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.880> kind<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.359> get<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
straightforward um you kind of get the

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.679 
straightforward um you kind of get the
implication<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.699> level<00:00:24.060> type<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.600> by

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
implication of the level type just by

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.390 
implication of the level type just by
the<00:00:24.810> name<00:00:25.170> there's<00:00:25.710> gonna<00:00:25.859> be<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> bunch<00:00:26.070> of

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the name there's gonna be a bunch of

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.460 
the name there's gonna be a bunch of
crystals<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.330> have<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.630> use<00:00:27.869> throughout

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
crystals that you have to use throughout

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.259 
crystals that you have to use throughout
this<00:00:28.590> entire<00:00:28.800> level<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.849> kind<00:00:30.150> of

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
this entire level so you have to kind of

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.290 
this entire level so you have to kind of
manage<00:00:30.570> your<00:00:31.019> your<00:00:31.590> block<00:00:31.920> placement<00:00:32.430> wisely

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
manage your your block placement wisely

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.569 
manage your your block placement wisely
it's<00:00:33.570> all<00:00:33.809> about<00:00:33.920> placing<00:00:34.920> these<00:00:35.070> crystals

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
it's all about placing these crystals

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.860 
it's all about placing these crystals
knowing<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.000> you're<00:00:36.149> never<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> be

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
knowing that you're never going to be

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.260 
knowing that you're never going to be
able<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.140> pick<00:00:37.320> them<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.649> again<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.730> definitely

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
able to pick them up again so definitely

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.490 
want to follow the way that I am placing
these<00:00:53.760> blocks<00:00:54.059> down<00:00:54.329> then<00:00:54.809> go<00:00:55.079> right<00:00:55.379> ahead

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
these blocks down then go right ahead

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.180 
these blocks down then go right ahead
and<00:00:55.860> you'll<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.510> okay<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.949> we'll<00:00:59.160> just

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
episode which will open that gate which

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.810 
episode which will open that gate which
will<00:01:15.869> allow<00:01:15.930> us<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.259> jump<00:01:16.680> right<00:01:16.890> through<00:01:16.950> okay

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
will allow us to jump right through okay

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.310 
will allow us to jump right through okay
always<00:01:18.180> watch<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.509> for<00:01:18.659> those<00:01:18.720> gravel<00:01:19.140> bits

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
always watch out for those gravel bits

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.960 
always watch out for those gravel bits
they<00:01:19.530> fall<00:01:19.950> down<00:01:20.130> after<00:01:20.549> they've<00:01:20.729> been

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
they fall down after they've been

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.270 
they fall down after they've been
touched<00:01:21.270> or<00:01:21.570> disturbed<00:01:22.409> or<00:01:22.590> whatever<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.070> may

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
just um dropped down to the portal from

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.380 
just um dropped down to the portal from
the<00:03:14.290> get-go<00:03:14.610> instead<00:03:15.610> of<00:03:15.640> getting<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:16.120> chest

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
the get-go instead of getting the chest

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.960 
the get-go instead of getting the chest
but<00:03:16.630> uh<00:03:16.660> i<00:03:17.230> don't<00:03:17.560> think<00:03:17.800> it's<00:03:17.920> don't<00:03:18.850> think

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
but uh i don't think it's don't think

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.520 
but uh i don't think it's don't think
it's<00:03:19.090> too<00:03:19.239> hard<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.480> go<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:19.930> grab<00:03:20.080> that<00:03:20.230> chest

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
it's too hard to go and grab that chest

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.740 
it's too hard to go and grab that chest
so<00:03:20.769> i<00:03:21.160> figured<00:03:21.850> i<00:03:21.940> would<00:03:22.120> show<00:03:22.390> you<00:03:22.420> guys<00:03:22.690> how
