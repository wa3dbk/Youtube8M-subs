upper lip to prevent burning or hurting

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.240

myself<00:02:45.430> because<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.180> is<00:02:46.390> such<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.590> small<00:02:47.920> area

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
myself because this is such a small area

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.070 
myself because this is such a small area
so<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.060> usually<00:02:49.450> have<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.530> small<00:02:50.800> tip<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:52.240> go

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
so I usually have the small tip and I go

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.400 
so I usually have the small tip and I go
from<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.470> outside<00:02:53.620> into<00:02:54.280> center<00:02:55.170> like<00:02:56.170> that

from the outside into center like that

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.140 
from the outside into center like that
and<00:02:56.710> then<00:02:57.250> just<00:02:57.460> repeat<00:02:57.610> on<00:02:57.910> this<00:02:58.090> side

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
and then just repeat on this side

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.330 
and then just repeat on this side
outside<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.200> center<00:02:59.260> outside<00:03:00.070> to<00:03:00.250> the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
will most likely cause it to skip and

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.460 
will most likely cause it to skip and
burn<00:03:13.300> you<00:03:13.450> third<00:03:13.810> question

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470

only looked on ebay for the applicator
tips<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:57.970> I<00:03:58.120> think<00:03:58.450> there<00:03:58.660> was<00:03:58.810> three<00:03:59.110> big

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
tips and I think there was three big

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
tips and I think there was three big
ones<00:03:59.590> for<00:04:00.250> $50<00:04:01.080> so<00:04:02.080> I<00:04:02.650> don't<00:04:03.340> think<00:04:03.490> you're

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
ones for $50 so I don't think you're

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.750 
ones for $50 so I don't think you're
gonna<00:04:03.670> get<00:04:03.910> anything<00:04:04.180> cheaper<00:04:04.990> than<00:04:05.140> that

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
gonna get anything cheaper than that

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.690 
gonna get anything cheaper than that
unless<00:04:06.760> you're<00:04:07.000> buying<00:04:07.120> maybe<00:04:07.420> one<00:04:07.840> size<00:04:08.700> tip

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.350 
unless you're buying maybe one size tip
instead<00:04:10.270> of<00:04:10.360> three<00:04:10.930> or<00:04:11.410> two<00:04:11.790> so<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:12.820> think<00:04:13.090> it

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
instead of three or two so I think it

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.570 
instead of three or two so I think it
just<00:04:13.540> depends<00:04:13.870> but<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.740> Nona<00:04:15.100> lotion<00:04:15.460> is

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
just depends but the Nona lotion is

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.979 
just depends but the Nona lotion is
fifty<00:04:15.880> dollars<00:04:16.180> so<00:04:16.359> I'm<00:04:16.450> going<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.660> guess<00:04:16.810> the

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
fifty dollars so I'm going to guess the

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:17.920 
fifty dollars so I'm going to guess the
tips<00:04:17.200> are<00:04:17.320> going<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.470> be<00:04:17.590> around

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
tips are going to be around

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.779 
tips are going to be around
fifty<00:04:18.199> dollars<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.799> as<00:04:19.039> far<00:04:19.190> as<00:04:19.250> hostage<00:04:19.699> to

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
fifty dollars and as far as hostage to

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.060 
fifty dollars and as far as hostage to
change<00:04:20.060> them<00:04:20.329> that<00:04:20.930> again<00:04:21.229> depends<00:04:21.859> on<00:04:21.949> your

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
change them that again depends on your

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.210 
change them that again depends on your
hair<00:04:22.610> type<00:04:22.940> how<00:04:23.360> often<00:04:23.690> you<00:04:23.780> using<00:04:24.289> the<00:04:24.800> nono
