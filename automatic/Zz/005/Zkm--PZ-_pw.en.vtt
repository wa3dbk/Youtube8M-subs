00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
always struggle the first few games

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:32.930 
always struggle the first few games

because if you play you know road to the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.820 
because if you play you know road to the
show<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.179> the<00:01:33.270> past<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.630> know<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
show in the past you know that the

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.969 
show in the past you know that the
pictures<00:01:35.549> all<00:01:35.759> forget<00:01:36.509> struggling<00:01:37.020> that's<00:01:37.920> a

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
pictures all forget struggling that's a

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.230 
pictures all forget struggling that's a
seeing-eye<00:01:38.340> single<00:01:38.399> for<00:01:38.790> my<00:01:38.850> first<00:01:39.000> day<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
seeing-eye single for my first day and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.190

he's<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:39.479> for<00:01:39.570> third<00:01:39.720> no<00:01:39.840> he's<00:01:39.960> not<00:01:40.049> gone

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
he's going for third no he's not gone

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.010 
he's going for third no he's not gone
for<00:01:40.350> their<00:01:40.500> he's<00:01:41.189> not<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:41.729> third<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.180> was

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
for their he's not going for third I was

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.929 
for their he's not going for third I was
gonna<00:01:43.140> say<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> pitching<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.220> little

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
gonna say that the pitching is a little

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.280 
gonna say that the pitching is a little
bit<00:01:45.060> better<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.420> triple-a<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:45.869> intended

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
bit better in triple-a and intended

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.630 
bit better in triple-a and intended
throw<00:01:46.409> some<00:01:46.619> more<00:01:46.770> breaking<00:01:47.100> balls<00:01:47.219> and<00:01:47.460> tend

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
throw some more breaking balls and tend

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.670 
throw some more breaking balls and tend
to<00:01:47.700> try<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.880> paint<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> corners<00:01:48.659> more<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.649> i

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
to try to paint the corners more so i

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.039 
to try to paint the corners more so i
might<00:01:50.520> struggle<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:51.060> little<00:01:51.240> bit<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.600> start<00:01:51.810> out

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
might struggle a little bit to start out

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.899 
might struggle a little bit to start out
and<00:01:52.259> that's<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.219> a<00:01:53.250> hit<00:01:53.460> that's<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.729> hit

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
and that's it is that a hit that's a hit

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.300 
and that's it is that a hit that's a hit
that's<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.180> hit<00:01:54.329> all<00:01:54.600> right<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.990> was<00:01:55.680> worried

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
that's a hit all right I was worried

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.649 
that's a hit all right I was worried
that<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.700> run<00:01:56.880> back<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.270> was<00:01:57.479> close

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
that I have to run back that I was close

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.959 
that I have to run back that I was close
to<00:01:57.920> being<00:01:58.920> corny<00:02:01.219> but<00:02:02.219> hopefully<00:02:02.579> I'm<00:02:02.700> able<00:02:02.820> to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
to being corny but hopefully I'm able to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.480 
to being corny but hopefully I'm able to
adapt<00:02:03.360> fairly<00:02:03.780> quickly<00:02:04.049> here<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.770> if<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.340> can

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
adapt fairly quickly here and if I can

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.010 
adapt fairly quickly here and if I can
hit<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.640> few<00:02:05.880> home<00:02:06.090> runs<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.539> put<00:02:06.659> up<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.840> same

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
