00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.810
 very good we are going to compare two nexus 51 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.810
 that is in Dalvik and another that is in 7 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.090
 as you can see is version 4.4 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.340
 Point 2 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.039
 and we're going to activate the options 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.589
 developing 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.410
 once activated we enter inside 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:25.109
 development options and we see that where 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.500
 puts choose runtime is in 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.500
 dalvik 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.450
 well let's go for the other power or nexus 5 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.510
 exactly like the other one but this one 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.270
 we have it with the functions of 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.570
 programmer already activated and with the mode 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.059
 art activated so they would be ready 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.260
 to compare them against each other 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.850
 let's start from scratch so 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.670
 we will close the applications that are 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.280
 open to multitasking on the left to 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.410
 rt to the right dalvik we are 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.470
 connected to the same wifi access point 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.020
 and we are going to open youtube 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.159
 it seems that it opens a little before in the 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.439
 model with art 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.859
 We are going to open a video at the same time 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.859
 two devices 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.750
 and as you can see it has loaded a little 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.750
 before the one in rt 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.650
 let's prepare with another video 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.370
 and although they are announcements has started 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.140
 first that of the rt version 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.140
 let's try another video more 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.240
 again for very little but it has also 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.060
 started before the one who carries art we are going to 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.310
 try the last video 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.090
 with this last video has started a 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.890
 little before the one that led to the vic 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.200
 as you can see the differences in 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.209
 youtube are almost slim to none because we 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.280
 to the desk before I 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.970
 you ask the two nexuses take the 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.810
 launcher solo launcher and fluency is 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.810
 exactly the same 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.390
 let's open pocket cast 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.590
 has also opened perhaps a 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.110
 thousandth of a second before the rt but 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.489
 practically at the same time we are going to try 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.099
 another application in this case google play 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.990
 we open both and the one that first loads 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.010
 is 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.010
 dalvik's 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.210
 let's get into the section of 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.910
 applications with both at once and the 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.520
 that opens again first is the one that 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.560
 leads to the vic 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.920
 now let's try the google browser 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.920
 chrome 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.700
 let's get into my page www dot 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.430
 the truck driver geek.com we access with the 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.500
 two and we see that practically both 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.500
 They have agreed to both the website 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.860
 let's get into an entrance to see 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.530
 which of the two opens before seems like a 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.530
 tint before rt about dalvik 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.680
 let's click on a photo here 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.680
 same 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.450
 he did not click at once on both of us and 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.450
 art has been opened before 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.510
 we go to the main desk and 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.360
 let's try the camera open the two 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.800
 at the same time and I think the bic has 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.470
 open a tad before or if not 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.380
 practically at the same speed we're going 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.180
 to open the gallery 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.810
 they have also practically opened up to 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.910
 time 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.870
 let's see how fast they open the 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.269
 multitasking the two 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.419
 is instantaneous in both there is nothing of 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.419
 lag 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.150
 let's do a search with the widget 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.150
 from google search 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.629
 written moto gave him end end al vix 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.009
 open a little before but of all 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:44.289
 ways are we going to get the first 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.289
 page that about the motor or motorcycle g 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.390
 well let's see that they charge practically 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.340
 the time 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.230
 now it has started to load a little 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.720
 faster dalvik the images and the 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:59.310
 letters but they are practically 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.310
 loading the page at the same time 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.540
 we go to the desk and we will enter 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.369
 in gallery once more to see the 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:12.449
 pictures to see what opens before 

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:14.120
 practically at the same time identical 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.340
 now let's try the application 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.830
 instagram we open both at once and 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.589
 load a tad before the bic although it is 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.689
 almost priceless good and this has been 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:27.080
 my comparative in terms of fluency and 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:30.659
 speed of opening applications between 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.839
 art and dalvik for me is practically 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:36.680
 the same goes for nothing but a greeting and 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.680
 until the next video
