00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.710
 or the android community are those 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.770
 people who have the problem that their 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.410
 device does not play music at very 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.300
 high sound level good I'll 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.040
 I recommend that for that you continue to see 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.690
 this video since I will show you in a 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.490
 excellent application that helps you 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.689
 increase the volume beyond what 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.689
 Android allows it 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.570
 well the application gets the name 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.250
 of volume plus volume without n and then 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.870
 this application can be found in 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.510
 what is the place tour 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.720
 we went to the play store and then here 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.940
 I already have it open, it has its version 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.010
 free the free version that can 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.559
 install without any obvious cost and the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.300
 pay version that good is supported 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.570
 If you like, you can download the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.820
 from app toy de or from black matt alpha 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.480
 it's just a matter of installing it 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.850
 to enjoy this application 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.970
 I'm going to address the application and see 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.710
 that this menu appears 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.380
 we can simply navigate between these 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.340
 but what interests us is the first 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.039
 the first options the first 3 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.070
 what are we going to proceed sprint speaker 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.679
 settings is to modify for 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.270
 set the sound of the speaker 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.359
 this horn 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.250
 headset settings is to modify what 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.140
 what are the bluetooth earphones 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.039
 is for bluetooth devices 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.799
 for like for example calls the hands 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:44.610
 free and good this in my case 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.860
 interested the speaker we are just going to 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.469
 check mark this audio option 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.590
 modify jones and here they appear more 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:56.070
 options what is the simple volume post 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.440
 boost that is the sound 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.710
 we see that it is the one of pay and it offers us 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.930
 up to 20 but good here tells us 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.920
 what is best for our 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.899
 what allows more cell phone in my 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.510
 case and example I handle a volume between 6 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.930
 and 7 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:20.819
 the bus is to increase the low of the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:25.110
 devices for example 7 here is already coming 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.239
 the echo and use the equalizer and so on 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.120
 I always handle these two what is the 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:34.440
 simple boost volume and elvas bus good 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.480
 once modified this one we will go to music 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.870
 and then it only remains to select one 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.870
 song 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.670
 and good with this we will see that it has 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.210
 increased in certain then it does a certain 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.670
 improvement in our sound 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:57.380
 and I mostly use it for what 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.569
 is the option of hearing aids since 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.999
 my headphones as 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.719
 they are pretty good but android 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:08.609
 puts a certain volume and then I do not 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.950
 like that therefore I use this 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.889
 application to be able to increase more the 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.930
 volume this application is perfect no 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:20.390
 it has no fault this is very 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.090
 easy to use since simply with 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.799
 press two or three buttons you're already 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.319
 greatly improving the audio of your 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.090
 good device this has been all 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.900
 friends of android I hope you have them 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.879
