is forward enough and he's turned around
and<00:01:28.829> started<00:01:28.979> walking<00:01:29.280> away<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:30.060> jump

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and started walking away you can jump

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.499 
and started walking away you can jump
out<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.659> back<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.200> cart<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.509> start

here walking around by the cannon he

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.630 
here walking around by the cannon he

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
will turn and start to walk away at

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.399 
will turn and start to walk away at
which<00:01:47.759> point<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.450> proceed<00:01:48.630> forward<00:01:49.110> I

which point you can proceed forward I

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.810 
which point you can proceed forward I
did<00:01:49.560> not<00:01:49.740> mean<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.670> just

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
did not mean to do that that just

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.710 
did not mean to do that that just
fucking<00:01:51.149> happen<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:52.250> then<00:01:53.250> get<00:01:53.909> done<00:01:54.090> brush

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
fucking happen and then get done brush

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.950 
fucking happen and then get done brush
if<00:01:55.290> if<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.130> don't<00:01:56.460> get<00:01:56.909> caught<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.299> climbing

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
if if you don't get caught on climbing

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.109 
if if you don't get caught on climbing
surfaces<00:01:58.530> there<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.920> barely<00:01:59.250> enough<00:01:59.579> time<00:01:59.939> to

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
surfaces there is barely enough time to

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.789 
surfaces there is barely enough time to
sabotage<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.780> cannon<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.290> then<00:02:01.380> get<00:02:01.590> back<00:02:01.740> to

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
sabotage the cannon and then get back to

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.399 
sabotage the cannon and then get back to
cover<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.759> recommend<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:03.990> letting<00:02:04.290> them

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
cover but I recommend just letting them

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.990 
cover but I recommend just letting them
make<00:02:04.560> another<00:02:04.860> pass<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.549> way<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.729> don't

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
make another pass that way you don't

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.670 
make another pass that way you don't
have<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.240> worry<00:02:06.420> about<00:02:06.570> getting<00:02:06.869> spotted<00:02:07.380> and

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
have to worry about getting spotted and

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.339 
have to worry about getting spotted and
having<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.009> start<00:02:08.129> over

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.390 

so<00:02:13.349> once<00:02:13.530> he's<00:02:13.650> turned<00:02:13.890> around<00:02:14.010> going

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
so once he's turned around going

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.940 
so once he's turned around going
sabotage<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.239> cannon<00:02:15.629> and<00:02:15.840> then<00:02:16.110> you're

stairs get into that that hiding spot

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.500

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
halfway up you're going to want to move

forward and make your way towards this

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:30.550 
forward and make your way towards this
ladder<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.260> get<00:03:25.739> up<00:03:25.889> on<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.189> rooftop<00:03:26.519> here

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.929 

and<00:03:31.560> keep<00:03:31.769> following<00:03:32.219> them<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.519> edge<00:03:32.669> of<00:03:32.819> the

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
eavesdrop to finish it so you do have to

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.360 
eavesdrop to finish it so you do have to
jump<00:03:36.659> forward<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.260> there<00:03:37.379> is<00:03:37.530> some<00:03:37.829> brush<00:03:38.219> you

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
jump forward and there is some brush you

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.209 
jump forward and there is some brush you
can<00:03:38.400> hide<00:03:38.669> it<00:03:38.849> on<00:03:38.939> the<00:03:39.090> other<00:03:39.180> side<00:03:39.599> I<00:03:40.129> meant<00:03:41.129> to

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:41.219 
can hide it on the other side I meant to

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:47.179 
can hide it on the other side I meant to
clear<00:03:41.489> that<00:03:45.139> they<00:03:46.139> spotted<00:03:46.650> me<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:46.949> I<00:03:46.979> had<00:03:47.159> to

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:47.189 
clear that they spotted me so I had to

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:52.689 
clear that they spotted me so I had to
quickly<00:03:48.409> get<00:03:49.409> over<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.799> other<00:03:49.949> side<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.699> I

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
quickly get over to the other side and I

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:57.289 
quickly get over to the other side and I
ran<00:03:53.699> up<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:55.859> get<00:03:56.040> down<00:03:56.220> into<00:03:56.549> this<00:03:56.849> hiding

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
ran up and I get down into this hiding

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.149 
ran up and I get down into this hiding
spot<00:03:57.599> here<00:03:57.959> which<00:03:58.139> it<00:03:58.290> immediately<00:03:58.590> kicks<00:03:58.979> me

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
spot here which it immediately kicks me

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.300 
spot here which it immediately kicks me
out<00:03:59.189> because<00:03:59.579> I<00:03:59.759> had<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.419> was<00:04:01.290> spotted<00:04:01.829> but<00:04:02.159> then

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
out because I had I was spotted but then

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.860

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
further away to get spotted like this so

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.619 
further away to get spotted like this so

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.640 
as soon as he's a bit past you can just
jump<00:04:40.860> out<00:04:41.009> and<00:04:41.190> avoid<00:04:41.550> him<00:04:41.699> and<00:04:41.880> grab<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.050> map

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
jump out and avoid him and grab the map

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.310 
jump out and avoid him and grab the map
and<00:04:44.460> then<00:04:45.389> I'm<00:04:45.509> going<00:04:45.600> to<00:04:45.660> run<00:04:45.810> over<00:04:45.840> and

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
and then I'm going to run over and

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.790 
and then I'm going to run over and
sabotage<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.220> last<00:04:47.460> cannon<00:04:48.030> and<00:04:48.680> get<00:04:49.680> the

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
sabotage the last cannon and get the

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.770 
sabotage the last cannon and get the
hell<00:04:49.919> out<00:04:50.070> of<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.250> fort<00:04:50.520> now<00:04:51.449> if<00:04:51.540> you<00:04:51.630> get

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
hell out of the fort now if you get

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.629 
hell out of the fort now if you get
spotted<00:04:52.320> you<00:04:52.410> can't<00:04:52.680> interact<00:04:52.889> with<00:04:53.250> that<00:04:53.400> so

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
spotted you can't interact with that so

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:54.800 
spotted you can't interact with that so
you<00:04:53.699> make<00:04:53.910> sure<00:04:53.940> you<00:04:54.240> need<00:04:54.389> to<00:04:54.479> make<00:04:54.570> sure<00:04:54.630> you

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
you make sure you need to make sure you

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.180 
you make sure you need to make sure you
get<00:04:54.900> that<00:04:54.960> done<00:04:55.199> quickly<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:55.650> then<00:04:55.889> I<00:04:56.009> just

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
get that done quickly and then I just

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.650 
get that done quickly and then I just
jump<00:04:56.490> off<00:04:56.900> this<00:04:57.900> way<00:04:59.300> because<00:05:00.300> you<00:05:00.449> need<00:05:00.630> to

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
jump off this way because you need to

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.140 
jump off this way because you need to
escape<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:01.169> fort<00:05:01.440> and<00:05:01.530> become<00:05:01.770> anonymous<00:05:02.150> now

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
escape the fort and become anonymous now

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.760 
escape the fort and become anonymous now
it<00:05:03.300> takes<00:05:03.509> a<00:05:03.630> really<00:05:03.840> long<00:05:03.930> time<00:05:04.139> the<00:05:04.620> route

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
it takes a really long time the route

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.680 
it takes a really long time the route
that<00:05:04.800> I<00:05:05.009> took<00:05:05.070> after<00:05:05.370> this<00:05:05.669> to<00:05:05.880> get<00:05:06.150> to<00:05:06.389> the<00:05:06.509> end

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
that I took after this to get to the end

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.260 
that I took after this to get to the end
of<00:05:06.810> the<00:05:06.900> mission<00:05:07.080> I<00:05:07.500> don't<00:05:08.340> know<00:05:08.460> if<00:05:08.759> heading

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
of the mission I don't know if heading

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.939 
of the mission I don't know if heading
left<00:05:09.479> and<00:05:09.750> climbing<00:05:10.169> up<00:05:10.289> would<00:05:10.440> be<00:05:10.470> quicker<00:05:10.830> I

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
left and climbing up would be quicker I

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.400 
left and climbing up would be quicker I
imagine<00:05:11.520> it<00:05:11.610> would<00:05:11.789> but<00:05:12.090> I<00:05:12.120> swam<00:05:12.630> around<00:05:12.840> and

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
imagine it would but I swam around and

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.250 
imagine it would but I swam around and
even<00:05:14.310> by<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.490> time<00:05:14.729> I<00:05:14.759> got<00:05:14.970> up<00:05:15.030> on<00:05:15.330> dry<00:05:15.630> land<00:05:15.660> I

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
even by the time I got up on dry land I

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.840 
even by the time I got up on dry land I
still<00:05:16.530> had<00:05:16.650> another<00:05:16.919> hundred<00:05:17.310> meters<00:05:17.669> to

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
still had another hundred meters to

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.080 
still had another hundred meters to
cover<00:05:18.030> on<00:05:18.240> foot<00:05:18.660> so<00:05:19.610> there's<00:05:20.610> probably<00:05:20.820> a

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
cover on foot so there's probably a

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.580 
cover on foot so there's probably a
quicker<00:05:21.330> way<00:05:21.419> to<00:05:21.539> get<00:05:21.810> to<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.050> end<00:05:22.229> of<00:05:22.440> this

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
quicker way to get to the end of this

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.610 
quicker way to get to the end of this
memory<00:05:23.039> but<00:05:23.690> this<00:05:24.690> is<00:05:24.840> how<00:05:24.960> it<00:05:25.020> turned<00:05:25.229> out<00:05:25.380> for

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
memory but this is how it turned out for

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.909 
memory but this is how it turned out for
me<00:05:25.740> I<00:05:26.510> had<00:05:27.510> to<00:05:27.539> swim<00:05:27.900> a<00:05:27.930> really<00:05:28.199> long<00:05:28.410> time<00:05:28.440> then

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
me I had to swim a really long time then

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.240 
me I had to swim a really long time then
run<00:05:29.160> a<00:05:29.190> really<00:05:29.460> long<00:05:29.639> time<00:05:30.289> but<00:05:31.289> that's<00:05:31.560> less

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
run a really long time but that's less

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.380 
run a really long time but that's less
of<00:05:32.310> a<00:05:32.550> burden<00:05:32.760> than<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.510> early<00:05:33.840> parts<00:05:34.139> of<00:05:34.229> this
