green<00:02:20.030> arrow<00:02:20.269> and<00:02:20.569> that'll<00:02:21.290> add<00:02:21.469> the<00:02:21.680> particle

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
green arrow and that'll add the particle

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.069 
green arrow and that'll add the particle
assist<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:22.819> fire<00:02:23.030> particles<00:02:23.599> into<00:02:23.959> the

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
assist the fire particles into the

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.339 
assist the fire particles into the
emitter<00:02:24.349> click<00:02:25.129> ok<00:02:25.519> and<00:02:25.780> exit<00:02:26.780> out<00:02:27.109> and

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
emitter click ok and exit out and

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.449 
emitter click ok and exit out and
there's<00:02:27.739> your<00:02:28.099> fire<00:02:29.439> simple<00:02:30.439> as<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:31.250> don't

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
there's your fire simple as that I don't

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.880 
there's your fire simple as that I don't
know<00:02:31.579> why<00:02:31.760> no<00:02:32.120> one<00:02:32.269> doesn't<00:02:33.109> maybe<00:02:33.319> because

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
know why no one doesn't maybe because

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.429 
know why no one doesn't maybe because
simple<00:02:34.370> that<00:02:34.629> took<00:02:35.629> me<00:02:35.780> forever<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.109> figure

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
simple that took me forever to figure

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:40.539 
simple that took me forever to figure
out<00:02:36.590> how<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.769> do<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.269> then<00:02:38.269> so<00:02:39.280> how<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.340> add

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
out how to do it and then so how to add

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:46.229 
out how to do it and then so how to add
right<00:02:41.299> now<00:02:41.420> there's<00:02:41.720> like<00:02:42.549> no<00:02:43.549> noise<00:02:44.230> will<00:02:45.230> no

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
right now there's like no noise will no

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.399 
right now there's like no noise will no
sound<00:02:47.239> coming<00:02:47.569> from<00:02:47.659> this<00:02:47.870> fire<00:02:48.139> and<00:02:49.420> I<00:02:50.420> don't

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
sound coming from this fire and I don't

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:52.960 
sound coming from this fire and I don't
like<00:02:51.560> that<00:02:51.590> because<00:02:52.069> I<00:02:52.280> like<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.639> sound<00:02:52.790> of

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
like that because I like the sound of

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.619 
like that because I like the sound of
fire<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:54.730> we're<00:02:55.730> going<00:02:55.819> to<00:02:55.909> place<00:02:56.209> that<00:02:56.239> right

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
fire so we're going to place that right

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.429 
fire so we're going to place that right
there<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.879> we're<00:02:58.879> going<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.060> add<00:02:59.379> go<00:03:00.379> to

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:00.439 
there and we're going to add go to

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.379 
there and we're going to add go to
content<00:03:00.950> browser<00:03:01.099> keep<00:03:01.609> the<00:03:01.819> torch<00:03:02.120> thing

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
content browser keep the torch thing

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.159 
content browser keep the torch thing
open<00:03:03.319> but<00:03:03.859> go<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.069> all<00:03:04.669> types<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.569> should<00:03:06.079> be

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.169 
open but go to all types it should be

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.349 
open but go to all types it should be
like<00:03:06.290> 47<00:03:06.680> types<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.189> it<00:03:07.579> should<00:03:07.730> be<00:03:07.819> a<00:03:07.849> second

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
like 47 types and it should be a second

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.899 
like 47 types and it should be a second
one<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.659> says<00:03:08.810> sound<00:03:09.230> cue<00:03:09.500> fire<00:03:09.829> torch<00:03:10.310> ambient

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
one it says sound cue fire torch ambient

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.289 
one it says sound cue fire torch ambient
01<00:03:11.900> q<00:03:12.379> drag<00:03:13.159> that<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:13.609> place<00:03:13.819> it<00:03:13.849> like<00:03:14.120> right

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
01 q drag that and place it like right

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.349 
01 q drag that and place it like right
underneath<00:03:14.659> that<00:03:15.069> that<00:03:16.069> fire<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.609> that

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
underneath that that fire and that

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.969 
underneath that that fire and that
should<00:03:18.019> be<00:03:18.049> it<00:03:18.229> but<00:03:18.590> I<00:03:19.030> believe<00:03:20.030> that's<00:03:20.150> it

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:20.979 
should be it but I believe that's it

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:26.259 
should be it but I believe that's it
let's<00:03:21.979> walk<00:03:22.159> over<00:03:22.340> Oh<00:03:24.190> yep<00:03:25.190> that's<00:03:25.489> making

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
let's walk over Oh yep that's making

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.399 
let's walk over Oh yep that's making
noise<00:03:26.479> I<00:03:26.659> don't<00:03:26.810> know<00:03:26.870> if<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.019> guys<00:03:27.109> can<00:03:27.169> hear

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:32.229 
that but that's the noise but yep that's

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:35.619 
that but that's the noise but yep that's
super<00:03:33.229> simple<00:03:33.680> version<00:03:34.129> on<00:03:34.370> how<00:03:34.669> to<00:03:34.729> add<00:03:35.120> fire

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
super simple version on how to add fire

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.210 
super simple version on how to add fire
and<00:03:36.010> add<00:03:37.359> noise<00:03:38.359> to<00:03:38.419> the<00:03:38.780> fire<00:03:39.109> I<00:03:39.440> don't<00:03:40.099> know

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
and add noise to the fire I don't know

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.089 
and add noise to the fire I don't know
yet<00:03:40.609> how<00:03:40.849> to<00:03:40.909> add<00:03:41.329> like<00:03:42.079> when<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:42.709> walk<00:03:42.889> to<00:03:43.069> the

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
yet how to add like when you walk to the

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.689 
yet how to add like when you walk to the
fire<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:43.370> add<00:03:43.879> damage<00:03:44.510> but<00:03:45.040> yeah<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.310> thought

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699 
fire and add damage but yeah I thought

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.360 
fire and add damage but yeah I thought
that<00:03:46.940> would<00:03:47.359> be<00:03:47.389> interesting<00:03:48.229> help<00:03:49.129> on

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
that would be interesting help on

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.739 
that would be interesting help on
