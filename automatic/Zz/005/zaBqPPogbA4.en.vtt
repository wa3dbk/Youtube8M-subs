going<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.189> make<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.399> very<00:00:32.430> simple<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.050> in

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
going to make it very simple for you in

going to make it very simple for you in
this<00:00:34.500> video<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.640> best<00:00:36.149> type<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.780> fat<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.559> use

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
this video the best type of fat to use

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.420 
this video the best type of fat to use
in<00:00:38.160> cooking<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.450> fat<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:40.050> stable<00:00:40.710> when

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
in cooking is a fat that is stable when

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.430 
in cooking is a fat that is stable when
heated<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.480> basically<00:00:42.930> means<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
heated and that basically means a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.080 
heated and that basically means a
saturated<00:00:44.370> fat<00:00:45.020> saturated<00:00:46.020> fats<00:00:46.590> are<00:00:47.090> solid

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
saturated fat saturated fats are solid

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.299 
saturated fat saturated fats are solid
at<00:00:48.360> room<00:00:48.600> temperature<00:00:49.500> they<00:00:49.680> contain<00:00:50.070> no

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
at room temperature they contain no

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.790 
at room temperature they contain no
double<00:00:50.730> bonds<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.170> means<00:00:52.350> anything<00:00:52.770> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
double bonds if that means anything to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.590 
double bonds if that means anything to
you<00:00:53.070> which<00:00:53.579> essentially<00:00:53.969> means<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.449> they

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
you which essentially means that they

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.590 
you which essentially means that they
are<00:00:54.809> not<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:55.980> susceptible<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.730> damage<00:00:57.570> from

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
are not as susceptible to damage from

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.220 
are not as susceptible to damage from
heat<00:00:58.320> light<00:00:59.129> or<00:00:59.370> oxygen<00:00:59.969> if<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.930> look<00:01:01.079> at

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
heat light or oxygen if we look at

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.319 
heat light or oxygen if we look at
canola<00:01:01.649> oil<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.160> other<00:01:02.280> vegetable<00:01:02.789> oils<00:01:03.030> they

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
canola oil and other vegetable oils they

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.950 
canola oil and other vegetable oils they
are<00:01:03.449> very<00:01:03.930> very<00:01:04.589> sensitive<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:06.090> those<00:01:06.240> three

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
are very very sensitive to those three

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.649 
are very very sensitive to those three
different<00:01:07.500> things<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.760> put<00:01:09.240> canola

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
different things so if you put canola

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.530 
different things so if you put canola
oil<00:01:09.930> or<00:01:10.170> vegetable<00:01:10.500> oil<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.159> pan<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.820> heat

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
oil or vegetable oil in a pan and heat

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.020 
oil or vegetable oil in a pan and heat
it<00:01:12.710> well<00:01:13.710> automatically<00:01:14.520> when<00:01:14.729> you're<00:01:14.850> doing

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
it well automatically when you're doing

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.980 
it well automatically when you're doing
is<00:01:15.119> returning<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.630> oil<00:01:15.900> into<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.400> rancid

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
is returning that oil into a rancid

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.749 
is returning that oil into a rancid
problematic<00:01:18.990> oil<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:20.159> you're<00:01:20.340> now<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.700> to

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
problematic oil that you're now going to

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.749 
problematic oil that you're now going to
put<00:01:20.909> into<00:01:21.030> your<00:01:21.180> body<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.830> we're<00:01:22.830> seeing<00:01:23.130> I

put into your body and we're seeing I

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.670 
put into your body and we're seeing I
don't<00:01:24.330> even<00:01:24.420> know<00:01:24.600> why<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.020> taken<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.380> long

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
don't even know why it's taken so long

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.350 
don't even know why it's taken so long
for<00:01:25.860> researchers<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.430> finally<00:01:26.880> uncover<00:01:27.180> this

for researchers to finally uncover this

but<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:29.040> vegetable<00:01:29.549> oils<00:01:29.880> are<00:01:30.119> very

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
but the vegetable oils are very

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.100 
but the vegetable oils are very
problematic<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:32.700> health<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.689> don't
