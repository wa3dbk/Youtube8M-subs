like<00:05:07.659> to<00:05:07.869> the<00:05:07.959> maximum<00:05:08.639> so<00:05:09.639> uh<00:05:11.039> it's<00:05:12.039> the<00:05:13.469> the

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:14.469 
like to the maximum so uh it's the the

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:16.350 
like to the maximum so uh it's the the
rear<00:05:14.649> suspension<00:05:15.309> is<00:05:15.459> already<00:05:15.849> compressed

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
rear suspension is already compressed

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.510 
rear suspension is already compressed
like<00:05:16.899> a<00:05:17.229> lot<00:05:18.069> so<00:05:18.550> I<00:05:19.259> feel<00:05:20.259> all<00:05:20.529> the<00:05:20.679> bums<00:05:20.889> and

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.409 
like a lot so I feel all the bums and
it's<00:05:22.389> a<00:05:22.509> good<00:05:22.659> idea<00:05:23.189> if<00:05:24.189> you<00:05:24.550> push<00:05:24.969> your<00:05:25.149> bike<00:05:25.389> a

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
it's a good idea if you push your bike a

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.590 
it's a good idea if you push your bike a
little<00:05:25.719> bit

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.680 

to<00:05:30.350> adjust<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:30.770> suspension<00:05:30.890> to<00:05:31.580> your<00:05:31.850> your

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
to adjust the suspension to your your

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.400 
to adjust the suspension to your your
weight<00:05:34.180> if<00:05:35.180> you<00:05:35.390> are<00:05:35.630> doing<00:05:35.920> twistys<00:05:36.920> a<00:05:36.950> lot

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
weight if you are doing twistys a lot

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.110 
weight if you are doing twistys a lot
it'll<00:05:39.410> prove<00:05:39.710> big<00:05:40.520> time<00:05:40.790> and<00:05:42.430> it's<00:05:43.430> cheap<00:05:43.820> I'm

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
it'll prove big time and it's cheap I'm

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.550 
it'll prove big time and it's cheap I'm
going<00:05:44.960> to<00:05:45.140> Jionni<00:05:46.130> in<00:05:46.820> Montreal<00:05:47.390> is<00:05:48.050> the<00:05:48.290> best

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
going to Jionni in Montreal is the best

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.160 
going to Jionni in Montreal is the best
he's<00:05:49.340> doing<00:05:49.700> a<00:05:50.950> vibe<00:05:51.950> for<00:05:52.240> racers<00:05:53.240> and<00:05:53.660> also

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
he's doing a vibe for racers and also

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.870 
he's doing a vibe for racers and also
and<00:05:54.680> it's<00:05:55.100> under<00:05:55.550> 100<00:05:56.120> bucks<00:05:56.360> I<00:05:56.630> think<00:05:57.050> for

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
and it's under 100 bucks I think for

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:04.620 
and it's under 100 bucks I think for
adjusting<00:05:58.880> that<00:05:59.060> the<00:05:59.690> bike<00:05:59.870> so<00:06:01.240> it's<00:06:02.240> worth<00:06:02.450> it

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
adjusting that the bike so it's worth it

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:12.800 
adjusting that the bike so it's worth it
so<00:06:05.630> we're<00:06:06.200> in<00:06:06.610> halle<00:06:07.610> right<00:06:07.880> now

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.640 

it's<00:06:13.680> about<00:06:13.889> maybe<00:06:14.550> a<00:06:14.669> two<00:06:15.150> hours<00:06:15.450> drive<00:06:15.630> to<00:06:16.530> go

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
it's about maybe a two hours drive to go
