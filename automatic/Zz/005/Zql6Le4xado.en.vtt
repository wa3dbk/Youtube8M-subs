 Ingolstadt the little one 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.360
 cross-country a fresh cell treatment 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.890
 missed and also the performance 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.779
 version to rs q3 developed a 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.059
 rs exhaust system with apparent flap 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.950
 gives the unmistakable sound of the 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:30.950
 five cylinders even more volume 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.600
 the new audi rs3 costs a lot 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.700
 gravel needs about 56 1000 stones 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.860
 you put it on the table but for it 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.600
 you also get a lot of car 340 ps 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.460
 and an acceleration from 0 to 100 in 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.890
 only 48 seconds 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.440
 how do you recognize the su as rocket? 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.600
 At the new grill it pulls up 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.230
 the headlamps and the vertical ones 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.230
 air intakes 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.130
 the front looks powerful and beefy 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.110
 of course, the ls include writing 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.580
 Front tail and side as well 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.000
 standard equipment like the led 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.000
 headlights 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.170
 the rear spoiler is more distinctive and 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.170
 more pronounced than the normal q3 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.439
 340 ps and 450 newton meters 30 ps and 30 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.600
 newtonmeter more than my predecessor and 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.450
 at the same time reduce consumption 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.100
 on now only 198 grams of co2 output per 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.690
 kilometer equals one 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.369
 combined consumption of only 8 4 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.680
 liters of water scarce half liter 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.600
 less than the predecessor at the same time 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.489
 but will create the spurt of 0 on 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:14.750
 100 in 4.8 seconds and the 15 of the engine 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:17.420
 is now available on request 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.250
 standard ls sport suspension also with 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.959
 Adaptive damper is the steering system 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.540
 Sporty tuned that 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.140
 driving dynamics system audi drive select is 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.550
 series 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.459
 the top speed is 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.459
 electronically limited 250 km h 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.130
 the ls q3 is waiting for the rear lights 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.440
 also with a new design on the 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.510
 change direction when turning 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.770
 indicated by the dynamic blinkers 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.430
 also the interior leaves no wishes 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.470
 open 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.440
 Optionally, the sports seats are also available 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.500
 rhombus mood available numerous rs 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.470
 logos and a lot of carbon make a difference 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.460
 also inside of his ordinary q3 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.460
 q3 brother 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.870
 the audi rs q3 can already be seen from 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.250
 not necessarily on the outside 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.250
 but rather the sound 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.900
 typical of a five-cylinder with 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.180
 really much power that sounds beefy 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.800
 and makes a lot of fun audi out there 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.700
 for an average consumption of 8 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.740
 4 liters 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:35.190
 in reality, but are also like times 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:39.290
 around the toes from 56 1600 euro there is the 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.290
 to buy ls q3 in germany 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:47.010
 our conclusion 340 ps so much power 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.440
 provides no other in this class of 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.730
 rs q3 is not just fun 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.920
 the sound but also in the 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.470
 but one thing is clear 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.300
 a lot of power costs money not only at the 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.300
 purchase but also in maintenance
