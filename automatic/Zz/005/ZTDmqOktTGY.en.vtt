00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
managed to find them and I just thought

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.459 
managed to find them and I just thought
I<00:00:50.340> would<00:00:50.489> make<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.090> little<00:00:51.360> video<00:00:51.630> showing<00:00:52.079> some

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.979 
I would make a little video showing some
people<00:00:52.590> where<00:00:52.980> they<00:00:53.160> are<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.910> case<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.840> need
