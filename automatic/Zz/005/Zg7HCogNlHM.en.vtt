00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
that's more full coverage than that but

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.590 
that's more full coverage than that but
with<00:01:51.490> that<00:01:51.640> foundation<00:01:52.090> you<00:01:52.119> can<00:01:52.360> absolutely

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
with that foundation you can absolutely

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.999 
with that foundation you can absolutely
tell<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.439> you're<00:01:53.560> wearing<00:01:53.770> makeup

regardless of how little that you apply

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.319 
regardless of how little that you apply
it's<00:01:56.470> just<00:01:57.100> I<00:01:57.310> think<00:01:57.520> because<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.149> is<00:01:58.180> so

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
it's just I think because it is so

00:01:58.329 --> 00:01:59.880 
it's just I think because it is so
pigmented<00:01:58.810> there's<00:01:59.320> no<00:01:59.560> way<00:01:59.710> that<00:01:59.829> someone

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
pigmented there's no way that someone

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.010 
pigmented there's no way that someone
space<00:02:00.310> actually<00:02:00.700> looks<00:02:00.880> like<00:02:01.000> that<00:02:01.210> with<00:02:01.810> this

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
space actually looks like that with this

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.350 
space actually looks like that with this
you<00:02:02.350> don't<00:02:02.710> necessarily<00:02:03.100> have<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.939> tell<00:02:04.270> that

to<00:02:21.940> include<00:02:22.090> in<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.600> pros<00:02:23.049> for<00:02:23.410> me<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.769> that<00:02:24.220> I

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
to include in the pros for me is that I

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.580 
to include in the pros for me is that I
feel<00:02:24.579> like<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.820> didn't<00:02:25.120> dry<00:02:25.540> out<00:02:25.959> my<00:02:26.110> face<00:02:26.380> as

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
feel like it didn't dry out my face as

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.349 
feel like it didn't dry out my face as
much<00:02:26.860> as<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.070> lot<00:02:27.160> of<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.489> other<00:02:27.670> mattifying

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:28.359 
much as a lot of the other mattifying

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.229 
much as a lot of the other mattifying
foundations<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:29.049> have<00:02:29.260> do<00:02:30.130> I<00:02:30.160> have<00:02:30.910> dry

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
foundations that I have do I have dry

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.840 
foundations that I have do I have dry
skin<00:02:31.269> so<00:02:31.870> for<00:02:32.109> me<00:02:32.290> that's<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:33.010> pro<00:02:33.340> if<00:02:33.579> you<00:02:33.700> have

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
skin so for me that's a pro if you have

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.460 
skin so for me that's a pro if you have
oily<00:02:34.209> skin<00:02:34.239> I'm<00:02:34.570> not<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.750> thousand<00:02:35.230> percent

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
oily skin I'm not a thousand percent

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.380 
oily skin I'm not a thousand percent
sure<00:02:35.560> how<00:02:35.890> it<00:02:36.040> would<00:02:36.190> work<00:02:36.400> for<00:02:36.459> you<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:37.030> does

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
sure how it would work for you it does

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.449 
sure how it would work for you it does
say<00:02:37.660> that<00:02:37.690> should<00:02:38.140> all<00:02:38.470> control<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.160> then<00:02:39.280> is

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
say that should all control and then is

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.520 
say that should all control and then is
oil-free<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:40.569> hopefully<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:40.930> will<00:02:41.080> work<00:02:41.319> for

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
oil-free so hopefully it will work for

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.660 
oil-free so hopefully it will work for
you<00:02:41.590> but<00:02:41.620> kind<00:02:41.980> of<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.069> part<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.459> Rays

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
you but kind of the part of the Rays

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.339 
you but kind of the part of the Rays
that<00:02:42.819> I<00:02:42.849> like<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.510> don't<00:02:43.569> find<00:02:44.020> it<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.170> be

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
that I like it is I don't find it to be

times full coverage foundations are

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.500 
times full coverage foundations are
super<00:03:06.040> super<00:03:06.160> mattifying<00:03:06.760> too<00:03:06.970> which<00:03:07.180> can<00:03:07.209> be

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.080 
super super mattifying too which can be
really<00:03:07.720> hard<00:03:07.930> on<00:03:08.080> dry<00:03:08.350> skin<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.280> do<00:03:09.459> really

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
really hard on dry skin so I do really

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.610 
really hard on dry skin so I do really
really<00:03:10.269> like<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.540> for<00:03:10.660> that<00:03:10.720> coverage<00:03:11.500> is

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
really like it for that coverage is

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.100 
really like it for that coverage is
awesome<00:03:12.010> like<00:03:12.160> I<00:03:12.280> said<00:03:12.550> it<00:03:12.819> is<00:03:13.090> very<00:03:13.540> good<00:03:13.959> for

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
awesome like I said it is very good for

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.420 
awesome like I said it is very good for
my<00:03:14.290> dry<00:03:14.500> skin<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.800> think<00:03:15.130> that<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.310> would<00:03:15.370> be

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
my dry skin I think that it would be

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.160 
my dry skin I think that it would be
good<00:03:15.670> for<00:03:15.700> oily<00:03:15.940> skin<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.450> combination<00:03:17.140> skin

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
good for oily skin and combination skin

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.320 
good for oily skin and combination skin
as<00:03:17.500> well<00:03:17.950> as<00:03:18.220> far<00:03:18.519> as<00:03:18.550> color<00:03:18.790> range<00:03:19.090> they<00:03:19.269> do

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
as well as far as color range they do

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.289 
as well as far as color range they do
have<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.930> ton<00:03:20.319> of<00:03:20.709> color<00:03:21.130> it's<00:03:21.370> like<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.640> ton<00:03:22.000> so

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
have a ton of color it's like a ton so

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.850 
have a ton of color it's like a ton so
check<00:03:22.600> it<00:03:22.690> out<00:03:22.810> there's<00:03:23.080> probably<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.560> color

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
check it out there's probably a color

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.650 
check it out there's probably a color
for<00:03:24.130> you<00:03:24.310> they<00:03:24.580> do<00:03:24.640> kind<00:03:25.000> of<00:03:25.030> run<00:03:25.180> on<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.390> cool

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
for you they do kind of run on the cool

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.440 
for you they do kind of run on the cool
warm<00:03:25.989> range<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.500> believe<00:03:27.010> like<00:03:27.700> Mac<00:03:27.970> does<00:03:28.209> just

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
warm range I believe like Mac does just

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.729 
warm range I believe like Mac does just
because<00:03:28.630> mine<00:03:28.780> has<00:03:29.019> a<00:03:29.049> seen<00:03:29.350> it<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:29.650> I'm

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
because mine has a seen it so I'm

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.710 
because mine has a seen it so I'm
assuming<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.130> means<00:03:30.400> cool<00:03:30.730> not<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.510> hundred

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
assuming that means cool not a hundred

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.660 
assuming that means cool not a hundred
percent<00:03:31.870> sure<00:03:32.110> but<00:03:32.560> I<00:03:32.830> do<00:03:33.010> think<00:03:33.310> they<00:03:33.489> have

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
percent sure but I do think they have

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.850 
percent sure but I do think they have
like<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.090> cool<00:03:34.299> and<00:03:34.600> warm<00:03:34.900> skin<00:03:35.230> tones<00:03:35.260> type

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
like the cool and warm skin tones type

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.330 
like the cool and warm skin tones type
range

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
range

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.280 
range
sar<00:03:36.610> as<00:03:36.819> my<00:03:37.090> skin<00:03:37.390> my<00:03:37.600> skin<00:03:37.630> hasn't<00:03:38.080> been

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
sar as my skin my skin hasn't been

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.840 
sar as my skin my skin hasn't been
breaking<00:03:38.620> out<00:03:38.739> or<00:03:38.920> anything<00:03:39.220> from<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:39.790> do

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
breaking out or anything from it I do

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.699 
breaking out or anything from it I do
have<00:03:40.269> pretty<00:03:40.600> sensitive<00:03:40.989> skin<00:03:41.290> so<00:03:41.530> like<00:03:41.680> I

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
have pretty sensitive skin so like I

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.559 
have pretty sensitive skin so like I
said<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:42.010> does<00:03:42.160> say<00:03:42.340> that<00:03:42.489> it's<00:03:42.610> oil-free<00:03:43.150> it

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
said it does say that it's oil-free it

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.960 
said it does say that it's oil-free it
hasn't<00:03:44.019> bothered<00:03:44.080> my<00:03:44.380> skin<00:03:44.620> at<00:03:44.830> all<00:03:45.069> so<00:03:45.640> I

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
hasn't bothered my skin at all so I

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.490 
hasn't bothered my skin at all so I
would<00:03:46.450> say<00:03:46.600> that<00:03:46.780> most<00:03:46.959> likely<00:03:47.260> if<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:47.410> have

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
would say that most likely if you have

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.020 
would say that most likely if you have
acne<00:03:47.680> prone<00:03:47.980> skin<00:03:48.040> or<00:03:48.340> sensitive<00:03:48.640> skin<00:03:48.760> you're

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
acne prone skin or sensitive skin you're

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.099 
acne prone skin or sensitive skin you're
probably<00:03:49.209> gonna<00:03:49.390> be<00:03:49.540> okay<00:03:49.930> with<00:03:50.079> this

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
probably gonna be okay with this

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.470 
probably gonna be okay with this
foundation<00:03:50.859> as<00:03:51.160> far<00:03:51.370> as<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.549> 15-hour<00:03:52.060> staying

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
foundation as far as the 15-hour staying

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.690 
foundation as far as the 15-hour staying
powder<00:03:52.780> I<00:03:53.109> think<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.160> it<00:03:54.250> is<00:03:54.340> a<00:03:54.489> very

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
powder I think that it is a very

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.060 
powder I think that it is a very
long-lasting<00:03:55.440> foundation<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.560> never<00:03:56.799> have

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
long-lasting foundation I never have

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.979 
long-lasting foundation I never have
worn<00:03:57.400> it<00:03:57.459> for<00:03:57.519> fifteen<00:03:58.030> hours<00:03:58.359> but<00:03:58.480> I<00:03:58.510> do<00:03:58.600> think

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
worn it for fifteen hours but I do think

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.360 
worn it for fifteen hours but I do think
that<00:03:59.019> if<00:03:59.170> you<00:03:59.260> did<00:03:59.440> put<00:03:59.590> it<00:03:59.709> on<00:03:59.829> and<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.100> set<00:04:00.310> it

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
that if you did put it on and you set it

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.490 
that if you did put it on and you set it
with<00:04:00.459> a<00:04:00.489> powder<00:04:00.579> it<00:04:01.000> would<00:04:01.239> last<00:04:01.450> for<00:04:02.140> fifteen

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
with a powder it would last for fifteen

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.349 
with a powder it would last for fifteen
hours<00:04:02.620> because<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.250> is<00:04:03.400> like<00:04:03.940> I<00:04:03.970> said<00:04:04.239> a<00:04:04.269> very

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
hours because it is like I said a very

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.990 
hours because it is like I said a very
full<00:04:04.780> coverage<00:04:04.810> foundation<00:04:05.530> so<00:04:05.890> I<00:04:06.100> do<00:04:06.430> see<00:04:06.880> it

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
full coverage foundation so I do see it

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.400 
full coverage foundation so I do see it
to<00:04:07.180> be<00:04:07.329> if<00:04:07.510> you're<00:04:07.660> like<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.900> type<00:04:08.019> of<00:04:08.109> person

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
to be if you're like the type of person

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.630 
to be if you're like the type of person
that<00:04:08.440> goes<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:08.980> work<00:04:09.250> early<00:04:09.489> in<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:09.579> morning

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
that goes to work early in the morning

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.039 
that goes to work early in the morning
and<00:04:09.880> knees<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.120> know<00:04:10.390> your<00:04:10.510> makeup<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:10.870> last

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
and knees you know your makeup to last

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.140 
and knees you know your makeup to last
all<00:04:11.290> day<00:04:11.320> I<00:04:11.500> think<00:04:11.680> this<00:04:11.920> would<00:04:12.220> be<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.670> good

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
all day I think this would be a good

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.400 
all day I think this would be a good
product<00:04:13.420> to<00:04:13.570> do<00:04:13.750> that<00:04:13.900> just<00:04:14.109> because<00:04:14.290> I<00:04:14.350> do

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
product to do that just because I do

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.650 
product to do that just because I do
think<00:04:14.709> that<00:04:14.769> it<00:04:14.890> will<00:04:15.070> last<00:04:15.730> all<00:04:16.090> day<00:04:16.120> because

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
think that it will last all day because

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.330 
think that it will last all day because
I<00:04:16.900> haven't<00:04:17.169> noticed<00:04:17.440> you<00:04:17.739> know<00:04:18.039> it<00:04:18.100> doesn't

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
I haven't noticed you know it doesn't

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.560 
I haven't noticed you know it doesn't
smudge<00:04:18.519> around<00:04:18.820> my<00:04:18.880> face<00:04:19.030> or<00:04:19.180> anything<00:04:19.299> I<00:04:19.510> do

smudge around my face or anything I do

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.360 
smudge around my face or anything I do
always<00:04:19.959> set<00:04:20.260> my<00:04:20.380> makeup<00:04:20.650> with<00:04:21.010> a<00:04:21.039> powder

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
always set my makeup with a powder

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.400 
always set my makeup with a powder
regardless<00:04:22.120> so<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.630> don't<00:04:23.020> know<00:04:23.080> what<00:04:23.229> its

I said with a powder I've never had a
problem<00:04:26.500> so<00:04:26.860> as<00:04:27.010> far<00:04:27.190> as<00:04:27.400> like<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.729> liquidity

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
problem so as far as like the liquidity

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.210 
problem so as far as like the liquidity
of<00:04:28.300> this<00:04:28.630> foundation<00:04:29.050> it's<00:04:29.200> not<00:04:29.350> nearly<00:04:29.830> as

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
of this foundation it's not nearly as

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.460 
of this foundation it's not nearly as
thick<00:04:30.820> as<00:04:31.120> like<00:04:31.419> the<00:04:31.539> Kat<00:04:31.720> Von<00:04:31.750> D<00:04:32.169> lock-it

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
thick as like the Kat Von D lock-it

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.900 
thick as like the Kat Von D lock-it
foundation<00:04:33.010> that<00:04:33.160> foundation<00:04:33.520> is<00:04:33.610> really

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
foundation that foundation is really

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.670 
foundation that foundation is really
really<00:04:34.240> thick<00:04:34.539> mac<00:04:34.780> prolongwear<00:04:35.020> can<00:04:35.560> be

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
really thick mac prolongwear can be

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.230 
really thick mac prolongwear can be
really<00:04:35.979> really<00:04:36.100> thick<00:04:36.520> this<00:04:36.760> foundation<00:04:37.120> is

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
really really thick this foundation is

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.300 
really really thick this foundation is
much<00:04:37.419> more<00:04:37.630> liquidy<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.140> would<00:04:38.380> put<00:04:38.590> it<00:04:38.710> more<00:04:39.250> in

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
much more liquidy I would put it more in

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.409 
much more liquidy I would put it more in
like<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:40.530> L'Oreal<00:04:41.530> True<00:04:41.979> Match<00:04:42.010> type<00:04:42.639> realm

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
like the L'Oreal True Match type realm

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.450 
like the L'Oreal True Match type realm
I<00:04:43.600> guess<00:04:43.840> that<00:04:44.530> one<00:04:44.680> foundation<00:04:44.979> is<00:04:45.220> pretty

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
I guess that one foundation is pretty

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.219 
I guess that one foundation is pretty
liquidy<00:04:45.669> this<00:04:46.030> is<00:04:46.210> not<00:04:46.360> a<00:04:46.630> thick<00:04:47.050> foundation

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
liquidy this is not a thick foundation

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.100 
liquidy this is not a thick foundation
by<00:04:47.650> any<00:04:47.800> means<00:04:48.039> very<00:04:48.520> very<00:04:48.789> liquidy<00:04:49.539> if<00:04:49.720> you're

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
by any means very very liquidy if you're

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.240 
by any means very very liquidy if you're
going<00:04:50.200> to<00:04:50.289> like<00:04:50.440> pour<00:04:50.710> it<00:04:50.800> out<00:04:50.890> on<00:04:50.979> your<00:04:51.070> hands

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
going to like pour it out on your hands

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.710 
going to like pour it out on your hands
and<00:04:51.460> go<00:04:51.580> everywhere<00:04:51.880> so<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:52.060> normally<00:04:52.450> just<00:04:52.510> put

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
and go everywhere so I normally just put

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.360 
and go everywhere so I normally just put
my<00:04:52.810> finger<00:04:52.870> in<00:04:53.229> it<00:04:53.320> and<00:04:53.409> shake<00:04:53.680> it<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:54.220> guys

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
my finger in it and shake it you guys

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.500 
my finger in it and shake it you guys
will<00:04:54.550> see<00:04:54.729> in<00:04:55.000> the

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
will see in the

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.120 
will see in the
you<00:04:55.780> know<00:04:55.900> over<00:04:56.200> here<00:04:56.470> where<00:04:56.650> I'm<00:04:56.770> doing<00:04:57.040> it

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
you know over here where I'm doing it

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.980 
you know over here where I'm doing it
but<00:04:57.580> I<00:04:57.610> just<00:04:57.730> like<00:04:58.060> kind<00:04:58.390> of<00:04:58.420> shake<00:04:58.660> it<00:04:58.780> up<00:04:58.870> and

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
but I just like kind of shake it up and

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.390 
but I just like kind of shake it up and
then<00:04:59.050> dot<00:04:59.320> it<00:04:59.500> around<00:04:59.710> my<00:04:59.860> face<00:05:00.070> just<00:05:00.340> because

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
then dot it around my face just because

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.560 
then dot it around my face just because
when<00:05:00.640> you<00:05:00.700> try<00:05:00.850> and<00:05:00.910> pour<00:05:01.120> it<00:05:01.180> out<00:05:01.270> it<00:05:01.450> goes

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
when you try and pour it out it goes

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.030 
when you try and pour it out it goes
everywhere<00:05:01.840> cuz<00:05:02.110> it's<00:05:02.230> super<00:05:02.590> super<00:05:02.740> liquidy

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
everywhere cuz it's super super liquidy

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.070 
everywhere cuz it's super super liquidy
and<00:05:03.520> I<00:05:03.670> don't<00:05:03.730> think<00:05:03.940> they<00:05:04.030> sell<00:05:04.300> pumps<00:05:04.750> for<00:05:04.990> it

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
and I don't think they sell pumps for it

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.990 
and I don't think they sell pumps for it
as<00:05:05.230> far<00:05:05.470> as<00:05:05.590> cons<00:05:05.860> for<00:05:06.280> this<00:05:06.430> one<00:05:06.700> thing<00:05:06.850> that<00:05:06.940> I

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
as far as cons for this one thing that I

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.490 
as far as cons for this one thing that I
can<00:05:07.210> say<00:05:07.450> is<00:05:07.690> how<00:05:07.960> it<00:05:08.080> says<00:05:08.230> that<00:05:08.380> it's

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
can say is how it says that it's

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.080 
can say is how it says that it's
transfer<00:05:08.980> resistant<00:05:09.400> I<00:05:09.460> feel<00:05:09.610> like<00:05:09.700> a<00:05:09.790> lot<00:05:10.000> of

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
transfer resistant I feel like a lot of

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.370 
transfer resistant I feel like a lot of
foundations<00:05:10.510> are<00:05:10.630> saying<00:05:10.840> that<00:05:10.990> now<00:05:11.140> and<00:05:11.350> I

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
foundations are saying that now and I

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.650 
foundations are saying that now and I
feel<00:05:11.680> like<00:05:11.920> no<00:05:12.610> foundation<00:05:13.150> is<00:05:13.270> transfer

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
feel like no foundation is transfer

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.300 
feel like no foundation is transfer
resistant<00:05:14.080> like<00:05:14.170> if<00:05:14.290> I<00:05:14.380> weigh<00:05:14.620> my<00:05:14.800> face<00:05:15.010> on<00:05:15.190> my

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
resistant like if I weigh my face on my

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.920 
resistant like if I weigh my face on my
boyfriend's<00:05:15.700> white<00:05:15.880> shirt<00:05:16.120> it's<00:05:16.540> gonna<00:05:16.720> come

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
boyfriend's white shirt it's gonna come

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.420 
boyfriend's white shirt it's gonna come
off<00:05:17.020> on<00:05:17.200> a<00:05:17.230> shirt<00:05:17.470> like<00:05:17.680> I<00:05:17.710> can't<00:05:18.070> tell<00:05:18.250> you<00:05:18.310> the

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
off on a shirt like I can't tell you the

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.370 
off on a shirt like I can't tell you the
amount<00:05:18.580> of<00:05:18.670> trips<00:05:18.880> that<00:05:18.940> I<00:05:19.060> ruined<00:05:19.480> by<00:05:20.080> doing

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
amount of trips that I ruined by doing

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.350 
amount of trips that I ruined by doing
that<00:05:20.530> on<00:05:20.650> accident<00:05:20.800> um<00:05:21.280> so<00:05:21.760> no<00:05:22.060> I<00:05:22.090> don't<00:05:22.330> think

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
that on accident um so no I don't think

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.750 
that on accident um so no I don't think
that<00:05:22.540> is<00:05:22.630> transfer<00:05:23.020> resistant<00:05:23.560> ah<00:05:23.740> I<00:05:24.340> don't

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
that is transfer resistant ah I don't

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.100 
that is transfer resistant ah I don't
think<00:05:24.880> any<00:05:25.000> foundation<00:05:25.450> is<00:05:25.540> transfer<00:05:25.870> just

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
think any foundation is transfer just

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.270 
think any foundation is transfer just
and<00:05:26.260> I<00:05:26.350> just<00:05:26.620> think<00:05:26.770> that's<00:05:26.890> funny<00:05:27.040> that<00:05:27.130> they

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
and I just think that's funny that they

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.560 
and I just think that's funny that they
put<00:05:27.460> on<00:05:27.550> there<00:05:27.670> like<00:05:27.820> maybe<00:05:27.940> if<00:05:28.120> I<00:05:28.210> lightly

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
put on there like maybe if I lightly

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.020 
put on there like maybe if I lightly
brushed<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.350> like<00:05:29.470> I<00:05:29.620> don't<00:05:29.950> know<00:05:30.160> I<00:05:30.340> don't

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
brushed it like I don't know I don't

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.090 
brushed it like I don't know I don't
believe<00:05:31.450> in<00:05:31.630> that<00:05:31.780> in<00:05:32.050> any<00:05:32.170> foundation<00:05:32.650> so<00:05:32.860> I

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
believe in that in any foundation so I

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.440 
believe in that in any foundation so I
wouldn't<00:05:33.550> really<00:05:33.640> call<00:05:33.850> it<00:05:33.910> a<00:05:34.030> con<00:05:34.180> just

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
wouldn't really call it a con just

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.550 
wouldn't really call it a con just
because<00:05:34.630> I<00:05:34.690> don't<00:05:34.840> think<00:05:34.960> there's<00:05:35.080> foundation

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
because I don't think there's foundation

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.690 
because I don't think there's foundation
out<00:05:35.650> there<00:05:35.830> that<00:05:35.980> really<00:05:36.220> is<00:05:36.340> transfer

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
out there that really is transfer

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.280 
out there that really is transfer
resistant<00:05:37.180> but<00:05:37.390> I<00:05:37.570> don't<00:05:37.930> like<00:05:38.020> when<00:05:38.140> things

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
resistant but I don't like when things

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.900 
resistant but I don't like when things
say<00:05:38.710> stuff<00:05:38.980> and<00:05:39.190> then<00:05:39.310> I<00:05:39.460> don't<00:05:39.700> think<00:05:39.820> the

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
say stuff and then I don't think the

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:40.980 
say stuff and then I don't think the
other<00:05:40.120> cons<00:05:40.360> I<00:05:40.510> would<00:05:40.660> say<00:05:40.750> with<00:05:40.900> this

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
other cons I would say with this

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.320 
other cons I would say with this
foundation<00:05:41.230> is<00:05:41.680> definitely<00:05:42.610> priced<00:05:43.150> this

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
foundation is definitely priced this

of those foundations I do think are

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.180

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
better than this foundation again it's

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.520 
better than this foundation again it's
not<00:06:09.400> like<00:06:09.610> it's<00:06:09.760> a<00:06:09.880> bad<00:06:10.090> foundation<00:06:10.330> it<00:06:10.810> really

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
not like it's a bad foundation it really

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.250 
not like it's a bad foundation it really
is<00:06:11.650> a<00:06:11.680> good<00:06:12.070> foundation<00:06:12.310> but<00:06:13.000> I<00:06:13.180> just<00:06:13.510> would

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260 
is a good foundation but I just would

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.620 
is a good foundation but I just would
reach<00:06:14.650> for<00:06:15.070> the<00:06:15.370> other<00:06:15.520> foundations<00:06:16.240> before<00:06:16.600> I

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
reach for the other foundations before I

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.060 
reach for the other foundations before I
reach<00:06:16.840> for<00:06:17.050> this<00:06:17.110> one<00:06:17.320> and<00:06:17.530> they're<00:06:17.890> less

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
reach for this one and they're less

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.230 
reach for this one and they're less
expensive<00:06:18.220> I<00:06:18.700> would<00:06:18.820> reach<00:06:19.000> for<00:06:19.180> the

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
expensive I would reach for the

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.850 
expensive I would reach for the
covergirl<00:06:19.480> three<00:06:19.840> in<00:06:19.930> one<00:06:20.110> before<00:06:20.530> all<00:06:20.680> of

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
covergirl three in one before all of

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.320 
covergirl three in one before all of
those<00:06:20.950> foundations<00:06:21.550> and<00:06:21.670> that<00:06:21.820> one's<00:06:21.970> a<00:06:22.060> way

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
those foundations and that one's a way

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.660 
those foundations and that one's a way
less<00:06:22.540> expensive<00:06:22.690> so<00:06:23.350> for<00:06:24.070> the<00:06:24.190> price<00:06:24.370> do<00:06:24.610> I

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
less expensive so for the price do I

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.460 
less expensive so for the price do I
really<00:06:25.150> think<00:06:25.360> that<00:06:25.420> it's<00:06:25.660> something<00:06:26.290> that

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
really think that it's something that

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.950 
really think that it's something that
you<00:06:26.620> need<00:06:27.130> know<00:06:27.940> if<00:06:28.210> you're<00:06:28.360> looking<00:06:28.690> to<00:06:28.780> try

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
you need know if you're looking to try

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.330 
you need know if you're looking to try
out<00:06:29.080> a<00:06:29.110> new<00:06:29.260> foundation<00:06:29.650> and<00:06:30.010> you<00:06:30.100> want

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
out a new foundation and you want

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.830 
out a new foundation and you want
something<00:06:30.730> that's<00:06:30.820> not<00:06:30.940> necessarily<00:06:31.210> such<00:06:31.810> a

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
something that's not necessarily such a

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.600 
something that's not necessarily such a
matte<00:06:32.170> finish<00:06:32.530> is<00:06:32.680> more<00:06:32.830> like<00:06:32.980> a<00:06:33.010> semi<00:06:33.310> matte

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
matte finish is more like a semi matte

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.370 
matte finish is more like a semi matte
or<00:06:33.790> a<00:06:33.820> natural<00:06:34.090> finish<00:06:34.510> then<00:06:34.960> definitely<00:06:35.140> go

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
or a natural finish then definitely go

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.660 
or a natural finish then definitely go
out<00:06:35.410> and<00:06:35.500> try<00:06:35.740> this<00:06:35.800> this<00:06:36.070> is<00:06:36.250> what<00:06:36.400> I<00:06:36.430> like

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.670 
out and try this this is what I like

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.250 
out and try this this is what I like
that<00:06:36.880> for<00:06:37.030> when<00:06:37.180> I<00:06:37.240> don't<00:06:37.480> want<00:06:37.630> a<00:06:37.780> matte<00:06:38.050> day

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
that for when I don't want a matte day

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.840 
that for when I don't want a matte day
and<00:06:38.440> I<00:06:38.470> want<00:06:38.680> more<00:06:38.890> of<00:06:38.980> a<00:06:39.040> natural<00:06:39.250> finish<00:06:39.640> on

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
and I want more of a natural finish on

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.280 
and I want more of a natural finish on
my<00:06:39.880> skin<00:06:40.180> this<00:06:40.600> is<00:06:40.780> why<00:06:40.900> I<00:06:40.930> will<00:06:41.110> go<00:06:41.230> too

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
my skin this is why I will go too

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.630 
my skin this is why I will go too
because<00:06:41.680> most<00:06:41.980> of<00:06:42.100> my<00:06:42.220> full<00:06:42.400> coverage

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
because most of my full coverage

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.250 
because most of my full coverage
foundations<00:06:43.150> are<00:06:43.270> all<00:06:43.420> just<00:06:43.720> straight<00:06:43.960> matte

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
foundations are all just straight matte

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.350 
foundations are all just straight matte
on<00:06:44.650> my<00:06:44.980> face<00:06:45.190> and<00:06:45.430> this<00:06:45.520> one<00:06:45.700> isn't<00:06:45.880> so<00:06:46.150> that's

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
on my face and this one isn't so that's

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.460 
on my face and this one isn't so that's
what<00:06:46.510> makes<00:06:46.660> it<00:06:46.780> a<00:06:46.840> little<00:06:46.870> bit<00:06:47.080> different

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
what makes it a little bit different

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.830 
what makes it a little bit different
which<00:06:48.340> is<00:06:48.370> the<00:06:48.520> main<00:06:48.790> thing<00:06:49.000> that<00:06:49.210> I<00:06:49.600> like

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
which is the main thing that I like

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.920 
which is the main thing that I like
about<00:06:49.990> it<00:06:50.320> so<00:06:50.890> yeah<00:06:51.460> like<00:06:51.940> I<00:06:52.060> said<00:06:52.090> it's<00:06:52.630> pretty

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
about it so yeah like I said it's pretty

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.380 
about it so yeah like I said it's pretty
pricey<00:06:53.260> but<00:06:53.770> it's<00:06:54.040> kind<00:06:54.340> of<00:06:54.520> fills<00:06:54.850> that<00:06:55.060> niche

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.390 
pricey but it's kind of fills that niche

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.080 
pricey but it's kind of fills that niche
of<00:06:55.660> a<00:06:55.800> full<00:06:56.800> coverage<00:06:56.980> foundation<00:06:57.130> that<00:06:57.700> isn't

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
of a full coverage foundation that isn't

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.970 
of a full coverage foundation that isn't
super<00:06:58.660> matte<00:06:58.870> so<00:06:59.380> if<00:06:59.410> that's<00:06:59.740> something

00:06:59.970 --> 00:06:59.980 
super matte so if that's something

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.230 
super matte so if that's something
you're<00:07:00.160> looking<00:07:00.370> for<00:07:00.670> I<00:07:00.730> think<00:07:00.790> that<00:07:01.000> it<00:07:01.090> would

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
you're looking for I think that it would

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.120 
you're looking for I think that it would
be<00:07:01.270> worth<00:07:01.540> the<00:07:01.690> money<00:07:01.720> if<00:07:02.140> not<00:07:02.410> I<00:07:02.710> think<00:07:02.890> there

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.130 
be worth the money if not I think there

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.500 
be worth the money if not I think there
are<00:07:03.220> better<00:07:03.340> foundations<00:07:03.910> out<00:07:04.030> there<00:07:04.090> that

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.510 
are better foundations out there that

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.210 
are better foundations out there that
you<00:07:04.780> could<00:07:04.960> go<00:07:04.990> and<00:07:05.290> spend<00:07:05.410> your<00:07:05.620> money<00:07:05.680> on<00:07:05.920> to

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.220 
you could go and spend your money on to

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.650 
you could go and spend your money on to
be<00:07:06.310> honest<00:07:06.640> with<00:07:06.700> you<00:07:06.820> guys<00:07:07.030> so<00:07:07.390> yeah<00:07:07.510> those
