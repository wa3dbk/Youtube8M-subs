 so the first thing we're going to do 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.390
 is to remove all those things that we can remove common 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.850
 then 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.390

 in the same way 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.180
 this space already has to wait about eight hours or so for a thing if you think 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.440
 instead of using the enamel that we used, we also use the 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.139
 appointment in which it takes the year to imitate out naturally if you use in 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:01.789
 excess of things the first 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.599
 this issue that you have to live in no product the second time that the 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:10.000
 correct way to use it is the following with a Palestinian 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.360
 we will distribute the z-shaped enamel all over the surface 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.080
 One is to distribute all the enamel and within ten minutes 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.890
 in we will do that in mind with the board the Palestinian drained from bottom to top as 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.280
 over the whole surface so we do not interrupt we have the route of the wood and 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.520
 if you want there is a trick to enhance even more the veins of the wood 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.160
 it's as simple as trimming the ends of the game unevenly as I know 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.249
 but today modern people
