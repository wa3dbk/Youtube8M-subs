00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:10.650
 what is it 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.500
 hello very good to all youtube people 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.970
 here we are one more day in the worst channel 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.950
 history until today don 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.960
 tomás gamer and in today's video I want 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.419
 let's talk about the little support for 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.000
 part of the parties to nintendo and from 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.849
 nintendo to go from unfortunately 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.410
 it's like that if you're something put in the 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.030
 Mundillo you already know that many companies 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.790
 they left nintendo behind 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.140
 I try will either because they wanted 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.650
 focus on what they said the 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.050
 new and real generation not referring 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.820
 to playstation 4 xbox one that in my 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.190
 it seems they are totally wrong 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.830
 I consider and said from the first 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.540
 day that nintendo wii is part of the 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.519
 same generation as teams one and 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.690
 playstation 4 but companies that do not 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.510
 they want to see it so they have decided 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.540
 leave nintendo lying down there is a 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.760
 they know ea etc etc. 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.770
 very well, there are many companies that 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.080
 they stopped giving support to nintendo 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.330
 They decided not to take out more games to 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.330
 them and stop developing for their 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.920
 new console and they allied with sony with 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.200
 microsoft whoever they liked 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.120
 then nintendo received a lot of support 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.520
 about be part of the indie games 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.290
 indie games to nintendo wii and now that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.020
 is very good as are sony 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.600
 he had that support with ps vita but what happens 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.890
 then we find ourselves with 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.470
 statements like those that have made the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.290
 founder of criterion and have done since 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.270
 striptease entertainment that I'm going to 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.320
 comment and the truth is that I do not know if it is 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.450
 that nintendo is laughing at us 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.100
 or that large companies have been 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.920
 gone completely the pot or sincerely 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.980
 I do not understand anything, it's worth 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.290
 If your company is not having support from 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.600
 the parties and a part that 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.060
 worries and wants to develop for your 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.460
 platform does not have all the support that 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.870
 have to have then I am a 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.940
 developer and I do what he has done 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.590
 this man to take for ass and me because 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.660
 is not meeting in a tooth and 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.100
 nintendo nobody absolutely nobody who 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.990
 have faith that we defend you on youtube 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.600
 games 4 that defend you between 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.610
 untranslated Partizan 45 more companies and 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.290
 if one of those who defends you from those who 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.720
 helps you from those who try to develop 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.480
 for you need help is not clarified to the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.250
 time for programming needs the support 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.290
 what you should give him and leave them 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.850
 thrown then to take for ass yes yes it is 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.820
 that I would have done the same 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.430
 this said for example in triptychs 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.530
 Entertainment is alex alex awards 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.680
 word forgiveness with criteria founder in 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.890
 the company that I told you about 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.070
 before he posted on his twitter that he never 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.640
 never again never chat said never say 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.010
 never forgiveness , but for the time step 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.440
 I will not develop anything else or to 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.150
 nintendo or for her because because it 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.490
 they have seen full of shit they have been 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.620
 working like cumshots like bastards and 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.120
 they have not got anything support they have not 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.730
 got a fucking shit 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.500
 by nintendo idea says and does not 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.350
 it will be because we have not tried it in addition 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.560
 said that they are going to do from 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.210
 now they are going to make games for 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.800
 platforms where they themselves can 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.210
 publish because if you have to be 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.220
 pending that nintendo will help you or 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.680
 what nintendo game you can use 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.240
 to die apparently this man the truth 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.130
 is that he has had a bad experience and 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.810
 I understand it if you support a company 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.520
 that at first is pseudo dead 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.530
 because as much as it weighs me I am 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.540
 loving nintendo like nobody but the 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.550
 state of wii u is terrible in the market 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.330
 at home you can pass it on as a bitch 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.460
 mother and me 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.020
 but we have never enjoyed a more 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.420
 console like that of nintendo but 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.550
 they really touch my nose that like 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.530
 company no longer as games or as 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.480
 console but as a company do 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.170
 these shits here we have the 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.360
 declarations 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.490
 the founder of criterion alex guard of 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.380
 that we were talking both 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.090
 Alex Guard and Fiona expert and abandoned 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.440
 criterion games to found being and feels 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.090
 entertainment the company of the 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.500
 previous statements is worth the 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.270
 goal of being able to publish their own 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.460
 games answering the questions of their 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.990
 followers have pointed out that it is little that 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.990
 it is unlikely that they do it Paraguayan 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.240
 but never say that because 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.990
 these people the poor have suffered everything 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.700
 what has been told 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.680
 some of these followers have accused 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.510
 to perry guards not to support the machine 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.160
 from nintendo something to what he has 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.720
 answered totally false I support 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.610
 wayú with need for speed most wanted you 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.990
 so much so that I complained when the 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.670
 company did not even bother to take out 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.650
 the discs with our game and you 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.750
 imagine that your development is a game 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.220
 or you support a game and your game 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.550
 it even comes out in physical format 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.490
 and and we're talking about a big game 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.960
 worth another user complained about the disc 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.880
 discreet release of the game equal 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.730
 He pointed out that we left our asses 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.860
 working and that to nintendo and she 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.850
 matter a real shit you have to 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.890
 understand this poor man 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.390
 everyone is running to throw the 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.730
 blame the developers were 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.230
 working from year to year for 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.790
 take out the game we did the best we could 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.440
 We could see that we are happy 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.030
 we did the code but not 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.280
 we had nothing to do when it was launched or 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.110
 the price of rob chris paul and jim 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.420
 they did what they were asked all 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.610
 others left us lying even 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.930
 we fly to nintendo to teach them 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.700
 personally a need for speed demo 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.680
 most wanted you to support us with 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.330
 the marketing did not support us anything in a 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.010
 first moment the game was not going to 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.390
 physically launch in europe members 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.500
 of the team they could not even buy their 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.550
 own game 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.500
 this is amazing 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.300
 go to warm the ear to the editors 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.800
 and not the developers says this 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.900
 Man considering that our 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.880
 families will not be able to eat if we screw it 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.370
 we choose our platforms with a lot 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.120
 care is chastened man saw it 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.720
 all for nintendo wii did it 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.970
 they developed the code of need for 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.010
 speed most wanted you and have tried 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.630
 develop other games not even 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.850
 they wanted to throw it in physical they did not have 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.020
 the option to do nothing could not even 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.600
 they buy their own game 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.940
 it is normal that you have downloaded have left 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.070
 criterion games the two co-founders of 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.600
 christie of entertainment and now they're going to 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.820
 develop games on their own 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.350
 because because as they say their 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.870
 families have to eat and I what 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.310
 I understand that I have to touch the eggs 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:04.010
 honestly the last thing that this indicates 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.440
 man is in things like that they fucked me up a lot 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.970
 and they became one of the 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.620
 reasons why he left ea though 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.500
 pointed out that this particular game does not 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.780
 was the main reason good I think that 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.550
 nintendo she does not care because she is 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.260
 a company that has never told me anything 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.330
 absolutely but nintendo the company 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.620
 with which I grew up is worth and I 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.440
 it hurts a lot to do these 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.330
 nonsense if there is serious 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.630
 no not bite the hand that feeds you 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:32.570
 if you right now nintendo without the 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.920
 Developers 5 hoeness solís si vais 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.570
 to take out the various cells the meters 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.570
 and those of starfox the super smash the 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.310
 mario kart so on and so but 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:43.070
 then you have the audience that you have and 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:46.280
 point if you want that will you succeed and 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.540
 be a console with decent sales and 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.450
 people want game of this generation 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.430
 and there are developers who try 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.720
 help you cojones 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.460
 where are you punching in the face and 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.410
 them big and I know the truth does not have 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.360
 meaning I feel outraged by this 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.620
 news the truth really fucks me and I 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.930
 I put totally on behalf of 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.460
 álex words developer 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.830
 I would have done the same in your place 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.229
 honestly I think it's a fucking shit 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.419
 of support from both of nintendo 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.460
 I like it and I hope it will not 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:15.740
 repeat many things like that because if not 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.880
 Unfortunately for companies to 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:21.350
 end they will stop having credibility 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.910
 and I support and this video is going to be a 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.320
 simple or simply I was going to comment 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.050
 the news but after reading it and 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:30.110
 get in the skin of a leward me 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.360
 I felt cheated by the company and I've 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.009
 wanted to make the video this way well 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.020
 that I do not expect anyone to be bothered by 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:39.099
 this video does not I do not want to criticize 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:42.229
 nintendo simply be a nintendo like 

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:44.750
 I already said it as the console and the 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:47.000
 games the public that we have people 

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.949
 what are we and the environment nintendo that I 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.630
 I would not change for anything but what comes 

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:52.669
 being the administrative and 

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:55.009
 the decisions of the company seem to me 

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:56.930
 a genuine fraud so clear that 

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:58.400
 I say without anything, thank you very much for 

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.169
 have seen the video of the success has 

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.910
 seemed interesting at least and we 

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:04.599
 we see until the next subscribe or 

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.599
 go dead
