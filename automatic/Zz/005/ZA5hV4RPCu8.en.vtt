using bicycles and it's very common for
people<00:03:40.990> to<00:03:41.140> use<00:03:41.290> this<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:41.710> get<00:03:42.010> around<00:03:42.250> the

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
I would very much like to design a

I would very much like to design a
sailboat<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.640> I'm<00:03:53.730> happy<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.000> say<00:03:54.120> that<00:03:54.300> I

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
sailboat and I'm happy to say that I

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.750 
sailboat and I'm happy to say that I
have<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.780> opportunity<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.440> do<00:03:55.740> so<00:03:56.010> like<00:03:56.580> I

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
have the opportunity to do so like I

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.520 
have the opportunity to do so like I
said<00:03:56.820> I<00:03:57.030> prefer<00:03:57.480> not<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.780> stick<00:03:57.990> to<00:03:58.140> one<00:03:58.320> area

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530
