00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.740
 what for the eighth finals come to the two are already burning bark 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.220
 cities minarets 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.560
 but they come from jan and be from the randstad that is because it became one 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.750
 few points the need to become an all in 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.940
 so these people injured 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.940
 his visit to rome women inc 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.520
 the French attacker happened 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.500
 the rabbi push through one radiant and others in the struggle between of course 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.689
 lots of action though 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.220
 for the children there is a nice proposal to keep 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.070
 what I regret is that 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.470
 Peeters was, by the way, always nice again a year earlier 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.150
 West also seems like something to me 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.230
 because then there will also be interest rates with a quarter percentage point too 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.010
 keep it 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.690
 pick up the traces of being all because part can become 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.960
 of waste again time for new products to be sold the barber 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.960
 I never had to cover a part of two still lifes 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.280
 a first step further 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.650
 it's fantastic 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.670
 before that 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.090
 the van rtv bodegraven says you should if it is in the sectors 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.310
 I think that was expected 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.950
 designers and 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.830
 pick it up and that could lead to a station running 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.940
 of course the name of the surface on board is her ability 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.520
 with all that there are always 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.770
 there was also the week 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.379
 m the upcoming fathers and 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.949
 so learn the best assistance to be increased some kind of stabbing 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.899
 later the coming weeks 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:20.849
 both sat in the elevator to experience the fashion show 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.169
 I got into the NS 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:23.730
 and therefore always the Leiden year 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.989
 I find it extremely annoying is a return to 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.289
 beat both in terms of content 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:33.059
 quite a lot makes it possible to take care of the trade shortly after 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:34.719
 start for an unnamed meal 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.540
 all too energetic epo people talk about a gyroscope and work 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.489
 keys a truck and narrow 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.899
 behind the ball in this misleading 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:45.859
 frontrunner but that is 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.859
 we had hoped for a lot of sweden 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.689
 at the second room 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.899
 problems with more women work more to be retained 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.329
 the order 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.569
 it's fun 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:05.489
 but the graphics
