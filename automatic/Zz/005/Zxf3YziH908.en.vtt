00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
which I've been using since it came out

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.710 
which I've been using since it came out
because<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:24.060> haven't<00:00:24.330> dropped<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.630> is

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
because and I haven't dropped this is

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.790 
because and I haven't dropped this is
the<00:00:24.779> same<00:00:24.900> one<00:00:25.019> I've<00:00:25.109> been<00:00:25.170> using<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.439> seven

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the same one I've been using for seven

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.920

years<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.189> haven't<00:00:26.490> dropped<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.570> figured

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
years I haven't dropped it so I figured

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.779 
years I haven't dropped it so I figured
why<00:00:28.109> not<00:00:28.140> hold<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.800> right<00:00:28.949> all<00:00:29.580> right

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
why not hold on to it right all right

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.690 
why not hold on to it right all right

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.920 
it's like strings you want them to last
forever<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.670> people<00:00:38.940> started<00:00:39.239> coding<00:00:39.629> there

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
forever so people started coding there

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.150 
forever so people started coding there
was<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> couple<00:00:40.260> some<00:00:40.440> companies<00:00:40.829> coding

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
was a couple some companies coding

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.369 
was a couple some companies coding
strings<00:00:41.430> way<00:00:41.910> back<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.390> started<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.930> thought

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
strings way back so I started I thought

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.160 
strings way back so I started I thought
I'd<00:00:43.559> give<00:00:43.710> them<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.890> try<00:00:44.190> but<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.270> could<00:00:45.809> hear<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
I'd give them a try but I could hear the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.990 
I'd give them a try but I could hear the
coding<00:00:46.530> which<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.309> something<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.610> don't<00:00:47.730> want

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
coding which is something you don't want

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.729 
coding which is something you don't want
it<00:00:48.210> either<00:00:48.239> sometimes<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:49.020> dulls<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> sound

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
it either sometimes it dulls the sound

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.410 
it either sometimes it dulls the sound
or<00:00:50.070> sometimes<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.640> deadens<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.120> tone

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
or sometimes it's just deadens the tone

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.920 
or sometimes it's just deadens the tone
which<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> same<00:00:52.829> thing<00:00:53.070> or<00:00:53.730> sometimes<00:00:54.360> you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
which is the same thing or sometimes you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.290 
which is the same thing or sometimes you
hear<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.170> difference<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.160> decay<00:00:56.550> which<00:00:57.270> is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
hear a difference in the decay which is

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.420 
hear a difference in the decay which is
also<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> same<00:00:58.079> thing<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.829> basically<00:00:59.160> just

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
also the same thing so basically just

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.310 
also the same thing so basically just
deadens<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> sound<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> string<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.170> it

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
deadens the sound of the string and it

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.349 
deadens the sound of the string and it
totally<00:01:01.770> screws<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.370> up<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.820> was<00:01:02.910> just<00:01:03.090> one<00:01:03.329> of

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
totally screws it up it was just one of

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.549 
totally screws it up it was just one of
those<00:01:03.480> things<00:01:03.809> where<00:01:03.989> are<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.140> thinking<00:01:04.290> wow

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
those things where are you thinking wow

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.990 
those things where are you thinking wow
I'm<00:01:04.890> never<00:01:05.070> gonna<00:01:05.220> find<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.519> coda<00:01:05.729> string<00:01:05.909> that

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
I'm never gonna find a coda string that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.370 
I'm never gonna find a coda string that
works<00:01:06.290> until<00:01:07.909> I<00:01:08.909> was<00:01:09.360> using<00:01:09.510> Everly<00:01:09.930> rockers
