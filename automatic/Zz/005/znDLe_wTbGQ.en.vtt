 I get one mask we use two 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.760
 times well not for the purpose of even saving because 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.590
 I feel sorry for the liquid that is there 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.820

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.830
 All this one here is a good composition 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.169
 maybe left on the fabric mask 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.479
 he soaked google face but considering that 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.780
 I get very small 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.450
 so 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.250
 Well, so as not to throw out 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.900
