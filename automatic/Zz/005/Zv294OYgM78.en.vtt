00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
again OOP I probably have it off every

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.680 
again OOP I probably have it off every
uh-huh<00:00:42.899> sorry<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.770> was<00:00:43.980> cheating<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.879> was<00:00:45.510> oh

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
uh-huh sorry I was cheating I was oh

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.000 
uh-huh sorry I was cheating I was oh
it's<00:00:45.840> cheating<00:00:46.110> I'm<00:00:46.350> sorry<00:00:47.030> anyway<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:49.010> this

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
it's cheating I'm sorry anyway so this

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.229 
it's cheating I'm sorry anyway so this
is<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.539> speed<00:00:51.539> saddle<00:00:52.140> pig<00:00:52.500> slaughter<00:00:52.890> thing

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
is a speed saddle pig slaughter thing

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.810 
is a speed saddle pig slaughter thing
and<00:00:54.239> i<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.809> set<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.320> it's<00:00:55.649> worth<00:00:55.920> 50<00:00:56.670> coins

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
and i have it set so it's worth 50 coins

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.720 
and i have it set so it's worth 50 coins
so<00:00:57.780> what<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.559> /<00:00:58.859> CS<00:00:59.309> eco

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
so what I can do for that is / CS eco

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.819 
so what I can do for that is / CS eco
and<00:00:59.969> then<00:01:00.570> by<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.320> uses<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> same

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
and then by and it uses the same

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.250 
and then by and it uses the same
selections<00:01:02.370> as<00:01:02.520> custom<00:01:02.850> spawners<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:04.080> it

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
selections as custom spawners so it

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.010 
selections as custom spawners so it
gives<00:01:04.409> me<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:05.030> spawner<00:01:06.030> that's<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:06.750> called<00:01:06.960> a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
gives me a spawner that's just called a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.750 
gives me a spawner that's just called a
1<00:01:07.200> spawner<00:01:07.560> because<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.280> don't<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> name

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
1 spawner because I don't have a name

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.660 
1 spawner because I don't have a name
set<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.470> go<00:01:10.710> anywhere<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
set for it but you can go anywhere and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.850 
set for it but you can go anywhere and
your<00:01:11.909> server<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:12.360> with<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:12.659> new<00:01:12.869> sponder

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
your server then with your new sponder

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.590 
your server then with your new sponder
that<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.100> bought<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.490> place<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.090> down<00:01:15.240> and

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that you bought and place it down and

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.980 
that you bought and place it down and
now<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.590> will<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.460> saddle<00:01:18.119> speed<00:01:18.780> big

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
now you will have a saddle speed big

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.710 
now you will have a saddle speed big
spawner<00:01:19.580> it<00:01:20.580> not<00:01:20.790> only<00:01:20.820> does<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.150> register<00:01:21.360> it

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
spawner it not only does it register it

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.170 
spawner it not only does it register it
with<00:01:21.750> actual<00:01:22.409> blocks<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.939> will

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
with actual blocks like this it will

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.149 
with actual blocks like this it will
also<00:01:24.360> make<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.810> custom<00:01:25.170> spawners<00:01:25.409> spawner

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
also make it a custom spawners spawner

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.490 
also make it a custom spawners spawner
just<00:01:26.549> an<00:01:26.729> active<00:01:27.090> one<00:01:27.210> come<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.170> booger

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
just an active one come on in you booger

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.649 
just an active one come on in you booger
oh<00:01:28.680> wait<00:01:29.689> okay<00:01:30.689> dense<00:01:31.020> well<00:01:31.530> done<00:01:31.740> yeah<00:01:32.659> and

that you can do is you can see how much

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.139 
that you can do is you can see how much
a<00:01:53.939> spawner<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.390> worth<00:01:54.570> which<00:01:54.869> /<00:01:55.229> CS<00:01:55.710> eco<00:01:56.189> worth

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
a spawner is worth which / CS eco worth

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.289 
a spawner is worth which / CS eco worth
and<00:01:57.450> then<00:01:58.259> whatever<00:01:58.409> spawners<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.299> that

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
and then whatever spawners so that
