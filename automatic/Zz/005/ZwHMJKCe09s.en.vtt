the<00:00:11.940> thing<00:00:12.120> with<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.840> Galaxy<00:00:13.320> Nexus

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
the thing with that is the Galaxy Nexus

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.140 
the thing with that is the Galaxy Nexus
is<00:00:13.860> currently<00:00:14.160> running<00:00:14.460> on<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.759> ice<00:00:14.880> cream

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
sandwich but the note as of now runs on

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.650 
sandwich but the note as of now runs on
the<00:00:19.160> android<00:00:20.160> 2.3<00:00:20.640> that's<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.119> gingerbread

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
the android 2.3 that's the gingerbread

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.840 
the android 2.3 that's the gingerbread
as<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:22.410> might<00:00:22.560> know<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.830> ice<00:00:23.220> cream<00:00:23.519> sandwich

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
as you might know I ice cream sandwich

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.070 
as you might know I ice cream sandwich
is<00:00:23.970> an<00:00:24.090> important<00:00:24.570> update<00:00:24.689> for<00:00:25.050> android

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
is an important update for android

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.640 
is an important update for android
phones<00:00:25.619> because<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.220> CSS<00:00:27.210> brings<00:00:27.689> native<00:00:28.260> GPU

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
phones because I CSS brings native GPU

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.050 
phones because I CSS brings native GPU
acceleration<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.400> entire<00:00:29.760> operating

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
acceleration to the entire operating

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.910 
acceleration to the entire operating
system<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.630> everything<00:00:31.080> should<00:00:31.260> run<00:00:31.470> smoother

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
system so everything should run smoother

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.889 
system so everything should run smoother
and<00:00:32.099> some<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.940> might<00:00:33.120> complain<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.540> this

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
and some of you might complain that this

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.930 
and some of you might complain that this
is<00:00:34.050> not<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> fair<00:00:34.530> comparison<00:00:34.710> because<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
is not a fair comparison because the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.209 
is not a fair comparison because the
Nexus<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.420> running<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> ICS<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.890> note<00:00:38.070> is

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
Nexus is running the ICS and the note is

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.459 
Nexus is running the ICS and the note is
running<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.120> gingerbread<00:00:39.690> even<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
running on the gingerbread even the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.319 
running on the gingerbread even the
Galaxy<00:00:40.890> Note<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.219> supposed<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.640> get<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.879> ICS

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
Galaxy Note is supposed to get the ICS

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.250 
Galaxy Note is supposed to get the ICS
update<00:00:42.480> pretty<00:00:43.140> soon<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.760> now<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
update pretty soon but as of now the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.540 
update pretty soon but as of now the
Galaxy<00:00:46.260> Note<00:00:46.289> comes<00:00:46.680> with<00:00:46.920> Gingerbread<00:00:47.399> so

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
Galaxy Note comes with Gingerbread so

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.209 
Galaxy Note comes with Gingerbread so
I'm<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:47.969> compare<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.539> with<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.780> same

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
I'm going to compare it with the same

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.799 
I'm going to compare it with the same
technically<00:00:50.219> speaking<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> note<00:00:51.180> has<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> much

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
technically speaking the note has a much

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.810 
technically speaking the note has a much
powerful<00:00:52.140> graphic<00:00:53.070> processor<00:00:53.489> that's<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
powerful graphic processor that's the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.000 
powerful graphic processor that's the
Molly<00:00:54.030> GPU<00:00:54.510> compared<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> Nexus<00:00:55.829> which

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
Molly GPU compared to the Nexus which

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.790 
Molly GPU compared to the Nexus which
has<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> power<00:00:56.760> vr<00:00:57.120> processor<00:00:57.600> but<00:00:58.230> again<00:00:58.620> we

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
has a power vr processor but again we

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.979 
has a power vr processor but again we
will<00:00:58.920> see<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.850> matters<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> actual

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
will see if that matters in the actual

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.740 
will see if that matters in the actual
performance<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.489> now<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.030> will<00:01:03.270> be<00:01:03.390> comparing

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
performance so now we will be comparing

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.950 
performance so now we will be comparing
the<00:01:04.049> Nexus<00:01:04.500> versus<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> note<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:06.659> first

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the Nexus versus the note and the first

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.399 
the Nexus versus the note and the first
differences<00:01:07.950> between<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.549> size<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.659> sports

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
differences between the size this sports

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.660 
differences between the size this sports
are<00:01:10.850> 5.3<00:01:11.850> inch<00:01:11.880> screen<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.810> sports<00:01:13.049> of

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
are 5.3 inch screen and the sports of

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.330 
are 5.3 inch screen and the sports of
4.6<00:01:14.670> 5-inch<00:01:15.330> screen<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:16.020> both<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> displays

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
4.6 5-inch screen and both the displays

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.719 
4.6 5-inch screen and both the displays
are<00:01:17.640> Super<00:01:18.330> AMOLED<00:01:18.360> HD<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:20.220> resolution

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
are Super AMOLED HD and the resolution

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.890 
are Super AMOLED HD and the resolution
on<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.090> note<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:22.400> 1280<00:01:23.400> x<00:01:23.610> 800<00:01:23.759> pixels<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.540> on

on the note is 1280 x 800 pixels and on
the<00:01:25.259> Nexus<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.340> 1280<00:01:26.790> by<00:01:27.030> 720<00:01:27.509> pixels<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
the Nexus it's 1280 by 720 pixels so the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.569 
the Nexus it's 1280 by 720 pixels so the
Nexus<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.340> exactly<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.090> 720p<00:01:30.930> HD<00:01:31.439> screen<00:01:31.740> notice

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
Nexus is exactly a 720p HD screen notice

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.149 
Nexus is exactly a 720p HD screen notice
a<00:01:32.610> slightly<00:01:32.909> higher<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:34.799> striking

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
a slightly higher and the striking

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.560 
a slightly higher and the striking
difference<00:01:35.460> between<00:01:35.700> both<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.000> them<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
difference between both of them is the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.649 
difference between both of them is the
size<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.409> galaxy<00:01:37.920> note<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.400> lot<00:01:39.030> larger

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
size the galaxy note is a lot larger

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.840 
size the galaxy note is a lot larger
phone<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.409> some<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.220> might<00:01:41.400> find<00:01:41.640> it

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
phone and some of you might find it

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.810 
phone and some of you might find it
difficult<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.329> use<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.320> other<00:01:43.439> hand

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
difficult to use but on the other hand

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.490 
difficult to use but on the other hand
the<00:01:44.820> Nexus<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.360> pretty<00:01:45.659> comfortable<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.320> hold

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the Nexus is pretty comfortable to hold

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.520 
the Nexus is pretty comfortable to hold
so<00:01:47.430> now<00:01:47.880> both<00:01:48.180> these<00:01:48.210> phones<00:01:48.450> should<00:01:49.020> run<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.470> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
so now both these phones should run on a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.370 
so now both these phones should run on a
dual-core<00:01:49.979> processor<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:51.210> runs<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> 1.4

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
dual-core processor this runs on a 1.4

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.710 
dual-core processor this runs on a 1.4
gigahertz<00:01:53.040> dual-core<00:01:53.369> processor<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.240> this

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
gigahertz dual-core processor and this

note was one of the fastest android
phone<00:03:39.730> that<00:03:39.910> I've<00:03:40.060> tested<00:03:40.570> before<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:41.020> Nexus

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
phone that I've tested before the Nexus

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.150 
phone that I've tested before the Nexus
and<00:03:41.590> it<00:03:42.459> looks<00:03:42.700> like<00:03:42.820> right<00:03:43.330> now<00:03:43.600> Nexus<00:03:44.230> as<00:03:44.830> the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
and it looks like right now Nexus as the

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.000 
and it looks like right now Nexus as the
fastest<00:03:45.640> browser<00:03:45.880> in<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.239> world<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.890> we<00:03:47.890> want

to click on the desktop version at the

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.479 
to click on the desktop version at the
same<00:03:49.660> time<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:49.989> see<00:03:50.260> which<00:03:50.620> one<00:03:51.010> will<00:03:51.370> be

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
same time to see which one will be

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.500 
same time to see which one will be
faster<00:03:52.030> i<00:03:52.060> click<00:03:52.330> on<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.600> same<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.290> and<00:03:54.510> we're

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
faster i click on the same and and we're

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.850 
faster i click on the same and and we're
going<00:03:55.660> to<00:03:55.690> click<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.049> Open<00:03:56.410> button<00:03:56.440> at<00:03:56.799> the

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
going to click the Open button at the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:06.449 
going to click the Open button at the
same<00:03:56.950> time<00:03:57.519> one<00:03:58.060> two<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:03.480> again<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:05.190> Nexus<00:04:06.190> is

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
same time one two and again the Nexus is

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.750 
same time one two and again the Nexus is
a<00:04:06.730> tad<00:04:07.360> faster<00:04:07.660> so<00:04:08.049> we<00:04:08.080> can<00:04:08.380> conclude<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:09.040> the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
a tad faster so we can conclude that the

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.220 
a tad faster so we can conclude that the
browser<00:04:10.360> on<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.840> Nexus<00:04:11.410> is<00:04:11.670> really<00:04:12.670> fast<00:04:13.230> do

when the flash is used I feel the Nexus
camera<00:04:55.870> takes<00:04:56.229> better<00:04:56.440> pictures<00:04:56.680> and<00:04:57.039> also

shutter lag with the Nexus camera ha
made<00:05:01.720> a<00:05:01.750> separate<00:05:02.169> video<00:05:02.379> regarding<00:05:02.770> that<00:05:02.949> so

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:03.129 
made a separate video regarding that so

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:06.179 
made a separate video regarding that so
you<00:05:03.220> can<00:05:03.370> check<00:05:03.550> that<00:05:03.610> video<00:05:04.770> but<00:05:05.770> I<00:05:06.009> have

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:06.189 
you can check that video but I have

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:08.520 
you can check that video but I have
noticed<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.689> note<00:05:07.689> as<00:05:07.990> it<00:05:08.259> has<00:05:08.409> an

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
noticed the note as it has an

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.040 
noticed the note as it has an
8-megapixel<00:05:08.680> camera<00:05:09.250> the<00:05:10.210> static<00:05:10.780> images

8-megapixel camera the static images

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.980 
8-megapixel camera the static images
that<00:05:11.439> we<00:05:11.949> get<00:05:12.189> a<00:05:12.340> little<00:05:12.669> bit<00:05:13.060> if<00:05:13.240> I<00:05:13.569> would<00:05:13.780> say

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
that we get a little bit if I would say

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.159 
that we get a little bit if I would say
better<00:05:14.379> on<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:14.680> node<00:05:14.860> but<00:05:15.699> videos<00:05:16.449> really

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
better on the node but videos really

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.129 
better on the node but videos really
impressed<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:18.550> video<00:05:18.819> performance<00:05:19.120> on<00:05:19.840> the

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
impressed the video performance on the

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:21.899 
impressed the video performance on the
Nexus<00:05:20.800> I'm<00:05:20.949> really<00:05:21.189> impressed<00:05:21.370> by<00:05:21.550> the<00:05:21.610> video

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:21.909 
Nexus I'm really impressed by the video

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.140 
Nexus I'm really impressed by the video
is<00:05:22.389> that<00:05:22.719> it<00:05:22.840> can<00:05:23.020> take<00:05:23.289> so<00:05:24.280> that's<00:05:24.490> even<00:05:24.909> tight

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
is that it can take so that's even tight

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.450 
is that it can take so that's even tight
I<00:05:25.389> would<00:05:25.780> say<00:05:25.990> but<00:05:26.469> if<00:05:26.680> shutter<00:05:26.979> lag<00:05:27.189> is<00:05:27.340> an

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
I would say but if shutter lag is an

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.360 
I would say but if shutter lag is an
issue<00:05:27.580> with<00:05:28.479> you<00:05:28.629> the<00:05:29.590> nexus<00:05:29.919> one<00:05:30.069> because

issue with you the nexus one because

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.709 
issue with you the nexus one because
there<00:05:30.550> is<00:05:30.639> virtually<00:05:30.819> no<00:05:31.060> shuttle<00:05:31.509> at<00:05:31.629> the

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
there is virtually no shuttle at the

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:33.119 
there is virtually no shuttle at the
moment<00:05:32.020> you<00:05:32.110> click<00:05:32.319> on<00:05:32.469> the<00:05:32.590> shutter<00:05:32.800> the

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
moment you click on the shutter the

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:37.350 
moment you click on the shutter the
photograph<00:05:33.490> was<00:05:33.520> taken<00:05:34.979> another<00:05:36.330> thing<00:05:37.330> that

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
photograph was taken another thing that

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.270 
photograph was taken another thing that
differentiate<00:05:38.020> both<00:05:38.319> these<00:05:38.530> phones<00:05:38.590> is<00:05:39.039> the

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
differentiate both these phones is the

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.159 
differentiate both these phones is the
storage<00:05:39.550> both<00:05:40.210> these<00:05:40.360> phones<00:05:40.419> come<00:05:40.990> with<00:05:41.020> a

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
storage both these phones come with a

storage both these phones come with a
built-in<00:05:41.349> storage<00:05:41.710> of<00:05:42.009> 16gb<00:05:42.629> but<00:05:43.629> the<00:05:43.750> problem

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
built-in storage of 16gb but the problem

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:46.140 
built-in storage of 16gb but the problem
with<00:05:44.319> the<00:05:44.469> Nexus<00:05:44.889> is<00:05:45.039> that<00:05:45.250> it<00:05:45.490> doesn't<00:05:45.940> have

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
with the Nexus is that it doesn't have

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.510 
with the Nexus is that it doesn't have
any<00:05:46.449> expansion<00:05:47.169> slots<00:05:47.440> like<00:05:47.740> a<00:05:47.770> microSD<00:05:48.490> slot

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520

any expansion slots like a microSD slot
or<00:05:48.759> etc<00:05:49.360> so<00:05:49.900> you<00:05:49.960> have<00:05:50.110> stuck<00:05:50.349> with<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:50.650> 16gb

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:51.129 
or etc so you have stuck with the 16gb

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:53.550 
or etc so you have stuck with the 16gb
storage<00:05:51.279> on<00:05:51.729> the<00:05:51.819> other<00:05:51.969> hand<00:05:52.150> the<00:05:52.840> note<00:05:53.379> has

16gb<00:05:53.949> of<00:05:54.430> internal<00:05:54.669> storage<00:05:54.969> but<00:05:55.539> we<00:05:56.050> do<00:05:56.229> have

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:56.469 
16gb of internal storage but we do have

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:59.610 
16gb of internal storage but we do have
the<00:05:56.710> micro<00:05:57.039> SD<00:05:57.279> card<00:05:58.060> slot<00:05:58.150> so<00:05:58.419> if<00:05:58.930> you<00:05:59.469> need

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
the micro SD card slot so if you need

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.159 
the micro SD card slot so if you need
you<00:05:59.770> can<00:05:59.949> expand<00:06:00.310> the<00:06:00.460> storage<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:04.870> last

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
you can expand the storage the last

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:06.869 
you can expand the storage the last
thing<00:06:05.500> that<00:06:05.560> differentiates<00:06:06.250> both<00:06:06.729> these

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:06.879 
thing that differentiates both these

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:09.029 
thing that differentiates both these
phones<00:06:06.940> is<00:06:07.330> that<00:06:07.509> as<00:06:07.750> this<00:06:08.139> is<00:06:08.289> a<00:06:08.319> nexus<00:06:08.770> phone
