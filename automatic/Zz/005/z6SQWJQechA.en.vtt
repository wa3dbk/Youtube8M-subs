00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:16.889 
going to try to think that it's a circle

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:22.359

coming to you this way it's down and up

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.069 
coming to you this way it's down and up

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
side and then as you get good at it you

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.330 
side and then as you get good at it you
can<00:02:03.630> start<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.049> smooth<00:02:04.319> and<00:02:04.619> there's<00:02:04.979> many

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
can start to smooth and there's many

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.489 
can start to smooth and there's many
ways<00:02:05.459> you<00:02:05.789> can<00:02:05.819> do<00:02:06.209> it<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.169> do<00:02:07.289> it<00:02:07.319> at

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:07.499 
ways you can do it you can do it at

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:09.109 
ways you can do it you can do it at
least<00:02:07.619> small<00:02:08.009> where<00:02:08.220> your<00:02:08.369> circles<00:02:08.819> are<00:02:08.940> real

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
least small where your circles are real

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.729 
least small where your circles are real
tiny<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.690> you're<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:09.929> pushing<00:02:10.140> your<00:02:10.380> hips<00:02:10.500> up

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
tiny so you're not pushing your hips up

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.370 
tiny so you're not pushing your hips up
more<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:11.910> more<00:02:12.270> like<00:02:12.450> this<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:16.200> it's

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
more so it's more like this so it's

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.710 
more so it's more like this so it's
exactly<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.099> same<00:02:17.370> technique<00:02:17.940> except<00:02:18.450> that

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
exactly the same technique except that

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.510 
exactly the same technique except that
you<00:02:19.050> don't<00:02:19.080> have<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.590> push<00:02:19.740> your<00:02:19.890> head<00:02:20.070> too<00:02:20.250> far

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
you don't have to push your head too far

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.520 
you don't have to push your head too far
on<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.420> side<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.810> can<00:02:21.960> just<00:02:22.110> push<00:02:22.230> just

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
on the side you can just push just

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.190 
on the side you can just push just
tiny<00:02:22.950> bit<00:02:23.250> just<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:24.420> it's<00:02:24.660> obvious<00:02:25.140> that

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
tiny bit just so it's obvious that

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.920 
tiny bit just so it's obvious that
you're<00:02:26.160> going<00:02:26.430> out<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.090> side<00:02:29.330> or<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.690> can

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
you're going out on the side or you can

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.590 
you're going out on the side or you can
push<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.319> hip<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.709> bit<00:02:32.400> more<00:02:32.700> keeping<00:02:33.480> your

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
push the hip a bit more keeping your

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.280 
push the hip a bit more keeping your
upper<00:02:33.750> body<00:02:34.080> nice<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.440> still<00:02:35.100> up<00:02:36.020> up<00:02:37.020> up<00:02:38.300> up

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
upper body nice and still up up up up

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.750 
upper body nice and still up up up up
or<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:42.660> could<00:02:43.040> exaggerate<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.520> make<00:02:44.730> it

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
or you could exaggerate it and make it

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.660 
or you could exaggerate it and make it
even<00:02:45.030> bigger<00:02:45.390> by<00:02:46.380> taking<00:02:47.130> your<00:02:47.190> upper<00:02:47.459> body

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
even bigger by taking your upper body

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.030 
even bigger by taking your upper body
completely<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.750> opposite<00:02:49.230> direction<00:02:49.440> of

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
completely the opposite direction of

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.880 
completely the opposite direction of
your<00:02:50.580> head<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.150> if<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.080> push<00:02:52.290> my<00:02:52.470> head<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.770> the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
your head so if I push my head to the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.750 
your head so if I push my head to the
side<00:02:52.920> I'm<00:02:53.580> going<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.239> try<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.870> really

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
side I'm going to try and really

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.330 
side I'm going to try and really
exaggerate<00:02:56.840> how<00:02:57.840> far<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.320> take<00:02:58.560> my<00:02:58.800> upper<00:02:59.160> body

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
exaggerate how far I take my upper body

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.520 
exaggerate how far I take my upper body
to<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.760> side<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:02.000> lift<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.480> then<00:03:03.959> start<00:03:04.320> to

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
to the side and lift and then start to

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.710 
to the side and lift and then start to
move<00:03:04.709> your<00:03:04.769> upper<00:03:05.160> body<00:03:05.340> slowly<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.600> the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
move your upper body slowly to the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.410 
move your upper body slowly to the
opposite<00:03:07.230> direction<00:03:07.410> as<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.220> push<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:09.239> hip

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
opposite direction as you push the hip

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.650 
opposite direction as you push the hip
up<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:10.620> way<00:03:10.830> so<00:03:11.280> as<00:03:11.519> I<00:03:11.580> lift<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.269> bring<00:03:12.450> when

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
up that way so as I lift and bring when

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.570 
up that way so as I lift and bring when
you're<00:03:12.810> keen<00:03:13.080> I'm<00:03:13.709> going<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.950> start<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.340> bring

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
you're keen I'm going to start to bring

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.910 
you're keen I'm going to start to bring
my<00:03:14.819> upper<00:03:15.150> body<00:03:15.330> already<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.530> opposite

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
my upper body already to the opposite

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:25.240 
my upper body already to the opposite
direction<00:03:17.069> so<00:03:20.720> this<00:03:21.860> would<00:03:22.860> make<00:03:23.069> it<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.840> bit

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
direction so this would make it a bit

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.479 
direction so this would make it a bit
bigger<00:03:26.250> just<00:03:27.239> by<00:03:27.420> taking<00:03:27.870> your<00:03:27.959> upper<00:03:28.140> body

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
bigger just by taking your upper body

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.560 
bigger just by taking your upper body
more<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.700> maybe<00:03:29.850> you're<00:03:30.150> not<00:03:30.269> going<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.480> be

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
more and maybe you're not going to be

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.479 
more and maybe you're not going to be
able<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.959> do<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.380> in<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.709> beginning<00:03:32.070> easier

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
able to do it in the beginning easier

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.830 
able to do it in the beginning easier
you<00:03:32.640> know<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.790> have<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.120> strain<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.630> side

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
you know you have to strain the side

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.440 
you know you have to strain the side
muscles<00:03:34.260> first<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:35.430> be<00:03:35.519> able<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.820> go<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.209> far

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
muscles first to be able to go that far

that's how we

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:37.219 
that's how we
you<00:04:33.719> know<00:04:33.839> we<00:04:34.589> keep<00:04:34.830> smaller<00:04:35.659> slower<00:04:36.659> moves

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
you know we keep smaller slower moves

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.070 
you know we keep smaller slower moves
but<00:04:37.679> with<00:04:37.949> arms<00:04:38.369> constantly<00:04:39.360> moving<00:04:39.809> rather

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.499 
your figure eight to be able to do that
there's<00:04:53.520> so<00:04:53.699> many<00:04:53.759> ways<00:04:54.029> you<00:04:54.059> could<00:04:54.270> do<00:04:54.360> that<00:04:54.389> I

so you can cross side like this like a

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:14.359 
so you can cross side like this like a
nice<00:05:09.119> big<00:05:09.949> frame<00:05:10.949> half<00:05:11.459> circle<00:05:12.059> down<00:05:12.479> and<00:05:13.369> up

00:05:14.359 --> 00:05:14.369 
nice big frame half circle down and up

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:20.570 
nice big frame half circle down and up
and<00:05:14.789> then<00:05:15.509> half<00:05:15.930> circle<00:05:16.589> down<00:05:17.520> and<00:05:18.029> up<00:05:18.569> as<00:05:19.580> you

and then half circle down and up as you

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.649 
and then half circle down and up as you
lift<00:05:20.849> other<00:05:21.330> side<00:05:21.979> other<00:05:22.979> side<00:05:23.389> it's<00:05:24.389> wait

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
lift other side other side it's wait

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:27.699 
lift other side other side it's wait
wait<00:05:25.110> do<00:05:25.379> we<00:05:25.469> already<00:05:25.709> can<00:05:25.830> keep<00:05:26.009> crossing

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:27.709 
wait do we already can keep crossing

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:30.199

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:48.569 
could just hold them on here which is

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:49.879 
could just hold them on here which is
not<00:05:48.629> my<00:05:48.899> favorite<00:05:48.930> it<00:05:49.559> doesn't<00:05:49.769> look<00:05:49.860> very

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:52.469 
good but it going to brings the emphasis

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:58.629 
good but it going to brings the emphasis
to<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:53.490> part<00:05:53.789> of<00:05:53.969> you<00:05:54.089> by<00:05:54.269> that<00:05:54.569> you're<00:05:54.749> moving

side<00:06:12.499> that<00:06:13.499> looks<00:06:13.829> a<00:06:14.069> bit<00:06:14.129> better<00:06:14.959> then<00:06:15.959> just

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
side that looks a bit better then just

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.009 
side that looks a bit better then just
holding<00:06:16.619> it<00:06:16.680> right<00:06:16.979> here<00:06:17.539> so<00:06:18.539> that's<00:06:18.719> another

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:19.019 
holding it right here so that's another
