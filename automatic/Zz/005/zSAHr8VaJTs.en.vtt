Hi, we're at Stockton Riverside college with
Naio Nails and myself, Gemma Lambert,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.466
to do some step-by-step tutorials on how to
do nails.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
We're going to be doing an acrylic lace encapsulation.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.980
This nail's already prepped, tipped and primed:
we're ready to go.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.689
We're going to start by applying a small bead
of acrylic onto the nail so that we can then

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:18.360
press the lace into it.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:29.639
Let that acrylic set a little bit so it starts
to harden before you put the lace into it.

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:37.190
It helps you to keep a good grip on it.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.350
Once that lace is in place, press down with
your brush to make it more secure.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:55.920
Then you can cut away the excess lace.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.240
We're going to use a hot pink now to give
this nail a bit of colour and a little bit

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:36.639
of glitter as well.

00:01:36.639 --> 00:02:58.899
Now we can cap the whole nail in pink acrylic.

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:06.630
Let that nail start to set a little bit and
then we're going to pinch.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:25.260
Place your pinching tool on and then you can
let go.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:04:09.210
This nail's now ready to file.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:52.520
When you've finished filing, dust the nail
and apply your gel top coat.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:00.770
Pop the client into the lamp for two minutes.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.490
To finish this nail apply a small amount of
cuticle oil and massage it in.
