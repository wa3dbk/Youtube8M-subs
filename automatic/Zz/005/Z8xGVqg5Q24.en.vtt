00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:36.170
 in the blog of mini bacbotte stuffed with 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:38.990
 chicken yoghurt and pickles these mini no 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.440
 everything requires little ingredients and they 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.370
 are not complicated to do for 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.510
 mini big boat 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:52.610
 we need 250 g of wheat semolina 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:56.329
 extra fine 100 g flour half a 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.770
 teaspoon salt 15 g yeast 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:03.150
 fresh and niety and a glass of water 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:06.600
 the equivalent of 20 centiliters 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.950
 back and we will check as and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.590
 as you mix 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.850
 if it is necessary to add also it is necessary to put 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.850
 less and less water 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.610
 in the tank of my rest I will place 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.610
 semolina 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:43.710
 I add the flour yeast 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:46.920
 on one side and the salt of another I'm going 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.830
 add a little water 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.230
 I start kneading and as and when 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.880
 measure I add the amount of water 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.530
 what it takes for for my paw 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.700
 so here it will knead 10 minutes to 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.280
 so here is my paw after ten 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:14.880
 minutes of kneading so I'm going to the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:18.060
 cut in half I sprinkle one 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.420
 little bit of semolina and I'm going to 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.420
 boulay 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.640
 I will cover with a clean cloth and I 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.160
 let's relax my paw a quarter 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.410
 of time here are my balls after little 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.470
 about twenty minutes of rest 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.110
 so I 'll start spreading them out 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.230
 using a roller so I do not hesitate 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.860
 to spread out either of the second or the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.280
 flour to prevent it sticking to the plan 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.280
 working 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.900
 so we're going to spread them thinly 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.180
 then I will take one of the corridors 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.010
 about 5 cm in diameter so if 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.360
 you do not have a deco fair you 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.360
 can use a glass 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.299
 the rest of 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.269
 not like that I 'm going back to the 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.790
 cannonball I'm going to let it grow 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:41.500
 she is resting and sorry and I can do it again 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.500
 others beat butt 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.720
 I then place but minibad fault on 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.110
 to clean laundry I dusted 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.110
 semolina 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.349
 I will cover the mini bad boys and the 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:06.900
 let it grow 40 minutes after 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.550
 the forty minutes of thumb so they 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.830
 have a little bit of volume we're going 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.260
 start cooking the ag preheated a 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.640
 anti-adhesive pans and I'm going 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.930
 start to place on 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.930
 the mini bacbotte 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.840
 and as soon as we see that they are cooked 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.840
 the other side we turn them over 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:41.890
 so after they are deprived batbout 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:45.130
 we move in a basket and garnish 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:48.550
 eliminated bungling batbout opens with 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.430
 scissors and garnishes of 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.710
 preparation of your choice 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.800
 mini packbot can be kept very well 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.480
 in the freezer so once cooked they are 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.760
 let cool in places in a 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.950
 bag and put them in the freezer on 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.940
 fate as and when quantity 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.940
