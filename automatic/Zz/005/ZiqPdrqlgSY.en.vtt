in less than 10 seconds but there's a

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.889 
in less than 10 seconds but there's a
really<00:00:49.659> good<00:00:49.839> spot<00:00:50.110> to<00:00:50.260> get<00:00:50.379> it<00:00:50.500> early<00:00:50.769> on<00:00:51.899> and

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
really good spot to get it early on and

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.380

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
challenges done in a single place so

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.940 
challenges done in a single place so
once<00:01:02.559> you<00:01:02.649> get<00:01:02.769> control<00:01:03.070> of<00:01:03.160> menendez<00:01:04.770> you<00:01:05.770> got

anyone<00:02:13.800> left<00:02:13.980> they<00:02:14.550> just<00:02:14.730> run<00:02:14.880> through<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
anyone left they just run through the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.790 
anyone left they just run through the
doorway<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.540> run<00:02:15.750> back<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.440> triggers<00:02:16.770> a

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
doorway and run back and it triggers a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:25.630 
doorway and run back and it triggers a
spawn<00:02:18.350> punch<00:02:19.350> more<00:02:19.560> people<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.040> shoot

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.400 

so<00:02:26.030> once<00:02:26.180> you've<00:02:26.270> got<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.570> eight<00:02:26.720> kills<00:02:27.050> on

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
so once you've got the eight kills on

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.850 
so once you've got the eight kills on
the<00:02:27.650> truck<00:02:27.950> mounted<00:02:28.280> mg<00:02:28.870> go<00:02:29.870> ahead<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.500> run

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
the truck mounted mg go ahead and run

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.900 
the truck mounted mg go ahead and run
like<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.040> bastard<00:02:31.370> in<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:32.120> door<00:02:32.360> right<00:02:32.390> here

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
like a bastard in this door right here

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.280 
like a bastard in this door right here
and<00:02:34.910> it's<00:02:35.270> hard<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.510> keep<00:02:35.660> track<00:02:35.720> of<00:02:35.960> what<00:02:36.170> the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
and it's hard to keep track of what the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.810 
and it's hard to keep track of what the
two-minute<00:02:36.680> timer<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:37.130> because<00:02:37.550> there's<00:02:37.790> a

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
two-minute timer is because there's a

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.370 
two-minute timer is because there's a
lot<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:37.970> slow<00:02:38.240> motion<00:02:38.660> so<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.930> timer<00:02:39.140> doesn't

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
lot of slow motion so the timer doesn't

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.710 
lot of slow motion so the timer doesn't
go<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.680> real-time<00:02:40.190> but<00:02:40.910> that<00:02:41.120> run<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.510> just

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
go to real-time but that run you just

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.840 
go to real-time but that run you just
saw<00:02:41.930> there<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.710> it's<00:02:43.100> definitely<00:02:43.580> no

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
saw there and it's definitely no

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.110 
saw there and it's definitely no
different<00:02:44.240> playback<00:02:44.540> speed<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:46.730> now<00:02:46.850> it's<00:02:47.000> on

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120
