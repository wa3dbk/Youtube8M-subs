00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.200
 hello my name is laurence benoÃ®t and 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:23.910
 I am president of the football club of 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:27.739
 riom and several caps and I try 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.930
 to fit them as well as possible 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.349
 do not take the kids here a day of 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.989
 job 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.970
 and then when I can take care of nothing 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.870
 doubt a double crazy time or so the 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.870
 weekend I'm also doing 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.020
 it's gone 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.579
 secret is especially a lot 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.989
 organization of work to his 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.399
 masked time we will say that we can 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.329
 always happen to make small 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.309
 things when we are moments 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.009
 I like it because if it's me 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.520
 I did not like it anyway I would have 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.140
 not finally made good moments 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.149
 share because we are a team 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.549
 the idea is to try to bring this 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.750
 we can do this more easily done 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.210
 they ask us the least effort 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.799
 have the least constraints does not have the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.450
 time they will be a little grain 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.670
 sand in the day butterfly the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:34.289
 teuf teuf via the club keys 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.520
 the house which office I like to be 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.740
 busy but I do not necessarily 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.030
 the impression of being overloaded 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.470
 for others it can not do it anymore 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.470
 seem overloaded actually 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.259
 in free time book it's also 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.330
 to do something we like 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.770
 and take care of a threshold club and 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.660
 to build something with 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.490
 the team of volunteers that's what is 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.490
 still interesting poutine 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.659
 a club where there are three hundred 300 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.840
 fired 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:08.050
 14 to 14 there are three youth teams 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.270
 senior teams a veteran team a 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.190
 female team also this year we have 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.920
 also we welcomed everything so on the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.360
 Saturday morning 300 people this is this 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.500
 not far from being like a breakthrough 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.150
 maybe some craftsmanship because we 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:26.290
 do a little bit as we can each 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:29.680
 according to his means to help a 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.390
 club where funds raises the treut by 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.299
 liter way it is it will be 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.600
 nor later president to teach us 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.600
 things 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.200
 not really doing the same thing 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.530
 to use the differences 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.850
 for to grow and for 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.850
 translate even more
