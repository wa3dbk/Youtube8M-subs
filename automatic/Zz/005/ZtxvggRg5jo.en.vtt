 no 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.779
 Hello everyone in this first video 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.390
 we're going to see how to build the base 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.750
 of our 3d printer 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.230
 it is a break the three the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.790
 necessary material 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.300
 we can see it on the table and it is 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.100
 composed of three linear bearings two 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.180
 smooth steel bars of about 400 mm 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:59.600
 with a diameter of 8 mm two threaded bars 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:07.080
 m10 then 10 mm in diameter by 450 mm 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:11.729
 12 from dm 10 10 12 washers m10 then 4 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.979
 Clamps these plastic parts 2 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:19.190
 m4 washers an m4 nut is a m4 life 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:23.700
 let's say immediately that the original part 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.190
 of the printer provided 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.110
 the use of this of this object 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:37.860
 here that in practice would be the guide for 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:39.720
 but for the belt I realized 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.189
 a variant always finding it up 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.119
 internet that is what it contains 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:51.860
 practically a nut m3 inside is 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.320
 a m3 life this serves in practice for 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.409
 act as a tie to the belt so that 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.140
 in case it gets loose it can always remain 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.010
 in tension 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.780
 let's start immediately with 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.619
 the first steps that are those of 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.250
 add two nuts in the bars in the 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.200
 m10 threaded bars this data goes 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.730
 positioned more or less in the center because 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.690
 then they will be the ones that will support 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:29.660
 the added vertical axis used two 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:34.040
 washers another data and later 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.110
 let's enter the data that 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.000
 instead they will support the corners go 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:47.150
 insert the ends of this bar 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:49.190
 threaded the first here is here the bars 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.800
 cut at the end can have 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.250
 can create some difficulty in the 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.100
 inwardness of strength to the whole 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.670
 printer construction is based on the 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.200
 on data and washers before each 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.530
 plastic object generally yes 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.350
 add a washer to avoid 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.980
 wear is the angle 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.860
 we see that from one side to a groove 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.090
 circular part of the groove goes 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.090
 inserted towards the outside 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:28.459
 in this way and then it must be enclosed with 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:30.470
 one washer is another given the same 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:35.799
 what we do it 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:42.980
 on the opposite side adding the data is 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:47.240
 given to the other corner washers always the 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:52.590
 circular part towards the outside 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:58.650
 washers and so in this way 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:01.350
 in practice the corner on the top is blocked 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.780
 threaded bar the smooth part 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.819
 obviously the base on the concave side and the 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:11.150
 top 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:14.910
 let's go to the second one to stay 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:20.040
 always entering a grade first 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:23.010
 center with the washers and then adding 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.960
 the second data because obviously like 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.530
 we said before it serves for the purpose 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.070
 to lock on the door and vertical 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:42.830
 the printer is then added again 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:46.680
 a die washer our corner 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:53.270
 always the external part must contain 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.270
 we are not nearly there afterwards 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.870
 the data should not be tightened but has done 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.610
 all by hand because initially we go 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.290
 first build the structure 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:20.280
 after which it is far ahead against much 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:20.280
 measures well and serve the data 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:33.040
 here is the last m10 and so have been 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:42.040
 that now we take our structure 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:45.550
 meanwhile let's go and see the same 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:53.350
 position in the middle you need to add 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:56.940
 two bearings on the side of the see that 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.940
 measures are not respected 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:18.360
 only talent I approach I try to 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.790
 center it so roughly then 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.100
 as I said before 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:25.610
 these measures must be seen the most 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.610
 precision 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:41.600
 we come to the other, definitely Tommaso 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:59.670
 in this part this part is completed 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.340
 we must add another know 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:07.350
 said all the next operate the plan 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:10.160
 this should be completed with 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:15.390
 four clamps that will block 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:20.030
 axes and drive to eliminate to avoid 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:23.940
 which then move so they are missing 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:27.470
 there is a hole inside ours 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:30.470
 corner where way fits 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.470
 simple 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:54.790
 the band is missing one here the last 

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:08.860
 perfect we leave them here then 

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:08.860
 we go to step 2 where they will be needed 

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.340
 other elements
