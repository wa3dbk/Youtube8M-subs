00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
maple snares are used to I'd highly

00:01:50.840 --> 00:02:30.070

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
recommend this one so certainly one

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.300 
recommend this one so certainly one
other<00:02:30.200> thing<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:30.500> noticed<00:02:30.830> just<00:02:30.950> now<00:02:31.069> in

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
other thing I noticed just now in

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.890 
other thing I noticed just now in
playing<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:31.700> one<00:02:31.910> it's<00:02:32.090> got<00:02:32.299> more<00:02:32.450> of<00:02:32.599> a<00:02:32.690> rich

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.170 
playing this one it's got more of a rich
texture<00:02:33.410> whereas<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.549> maple<00:02:34.849> snare<00:02:35.090> is

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
texture whereas the maple snare is

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.120 
texture whereas the maple snare is
probably<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.660> cleaner<00:02:36.079> recording<00:02:36.620> option<00:02:36.980> if

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
probably a cleaner recording option if

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.009 
probably a cleaner recording option if
you're<00:02:37.400> playing<00:02:37.609> live<00:02:37.910> I'd<00:02:38.329> highly<00:02:38.750> prefer

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.240 
snare drum getting louder because
certainly<00:03:39.350> if<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:39.560> hit<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:39.800> as<00:03:39.920> hard<00:03:39.950> as<00:03:40.190> you

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
certainly if you hit it as hard as you

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.850 
certainly if you hit it as hard as you
can<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.850> louder<00:03:41.540> snare<00:03:41.870> drum<00:03:42.140> has<00:03:42.560> more

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
can a louder snare drum has more

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.010 
can a louder snare drum has more
Headroom<00:03:43.220> basically<00:03:43.760> this<00:03:44.570> would<00:03:44.720> certainly

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
Headroom basically this would certainly

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.440 
Headroom basically this would certainly
be<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.320> pick<00:03:45.530> for<00:03:45.710> that<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:47.030> let's<00:03:47.270> take<00:03:47.420> a

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
be the pick for that so let's take a

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.450 
be the pick for that so let's take a
look<00:03:47.600> at<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.870> last<00:03:48.380> snare<00:03:48.680> over<00:03:48.740> here<00:03:49.160> we<00:03:49.280> have

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.460 
look at the last snare over here we have

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.670 
look at the last snare over here we have
the<00:03:49.670> walnut<00:03:50.300> stave<00:03:50.570> shell<00:03:50.840> see<00:03:51.350> what<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:51.560> one

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
the walnut stave shell see what that one

00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:21.480 
the walnut stave shell see what that one
sounds<00:03:51.890> like

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:21.490 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.060 

so<00:04:22.490> what<00:04:22.610> I<00:04:22.639> found<00:04:22.820> with<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.800> walnut<00:04:24.800> stave

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
so what I found with the walnut stave

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.830 
so what I found with the walnut stave
shell<00:04:25.370> is<00:04:25.669> it<00:04:25.820> has<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:25.970> lot<00:04:26.210> of<00:04:26.330> presence<00:04:26.690> like

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
shell is it has a lot of presence like

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.900 
shell is it has a lot of presence like
the<00:04:27.020> ash<00:04:27.169> not<00:04:27.560> so<00:04:27.710> much<00:04:27.980> it's<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.580> little<00:04:28.790> more

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
the ash not so much it's a little more

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.720 
the ash not so much it's a little more
bright<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.389> concise<00:04:29.990> I<00:04:30.770> feel<00:04:31.250> like<00:04:31.400> I'd<00:04:31.550> want

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
bright and concise I feel like I'd want

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.150 
bright and concise I feel like I'd want
tighter<00:04:32.060> tighter<00:04:32.960> less<00:04:33.290> involved<00:04:33.620> snare

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
tighter tighter less involved snare

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.710 
tighter tighter less involved snare
wires<00:04:34.370> out<00:04:34.700> of<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:34.940> snare<00:04:35.150> because<00:04:35.600> the

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
wires out of the snare because the

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.090 
wires out of the snare because the
musical<00:04:36.080> tones<00:04:36.290> that<00:04:36.500> come<00:04:36.620> out<00:04:36.770> of<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:36.919> shell

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
musical tones that come out of the shell

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.850 
musical tones that come out of the shell
with<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:37.790> snares<00:04:38.150> off<00:04:38.419> are<00:04:38.840> certainly<00:04:39.740> the

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
with the snares off are certainly the

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.240 
with the snares off are certainly the
defining<00:04:40.160> aspect<00:04:40.370> of<00:04:40.790> this<00:04:40.910> one<00:04:41.620> so<00:04:42.620> just<00:04:43.160> to

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
defining aspect of this one so just to

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.320 
defining aspect of this one so just to
give<00:04:43.370> you<00:04:43.400> a<00:04:43.490> little<00:04:43.610> more<00:04:43.760> of<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:43.940> comparison

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
give you a little more of a comparison

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.590 
give you a little more of a comparison
let's<00:04:44.810> see<00:04:44.990> how<00:04:45.080> they<00:04:45.200> all<00:04:45.229> sound
