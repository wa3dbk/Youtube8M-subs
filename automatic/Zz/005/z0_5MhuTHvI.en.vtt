and certainly significant psychiatric

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.520 
and certainly significant psychiatric
issues<00:03:47.889> so<00:03:48.280> my<00:03:48.459> concern<00:03:48.700> is<00:03:49.180> with<00:03:50.019> people<00:03:50.410> that

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
issues so my concern is with people that

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.289 
issues so my concern is with people that
struggle<00:03:50.799> with<00:03:51.250> drug<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.639> alcohol<00:03:52.090> and

struggle with drug and alcohol and
co-occurring<00:03:53.139> psychiatric<00:03:53.859> problems<00:03:54.700> my

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
co-occurring psychiatric problems my

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.599 
co-occurring psychiatric problems my
worry<00:03:55.540> is<00:03:55.629> about<00:03:56.260> those<00:03:56.829> people<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.519> the

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
worry is about those people and the

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.580 
worry is about those people and the
youth<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.090> certainly<00:03:58.870> any<00:03:59.019> time<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.290> smoke<00:03:59.560> a
