which<00:00:13.710> I'm<00:00:13.860> about<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.099> try<00:00:14.429> here<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
which I'm about to try here and the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.840 
which I'm about to try here and the
reason<00:00:16.650> why<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.800> got<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.430> because<00:00:17.460> I'm

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
reason why I got this is because I'm

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.920

looking<00:00:17.970> for<00:00:18.150> an<00:00:18.420> intra<00:00:18.779> workout<00:00:18.859> product<00:00:19.859> and

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
looking for an intra workout product and

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.019 
looking for an intra workout product and
these<00:00:21.930> branched<00:00:22.590> chain<00:00:23.070> amino<00:00:23.100> acids<00:00:23.820> which

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
these branched chain amino acids which

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.089 
these branched chain amino acids which
are<00:00:24.410> essential<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:26.099> building<00:00:26.609> muscle<00:00:28.099> are

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
are essential for building muscle are

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.099 
are essential for building muscle are
insta<00:00:29.519> sized<00:00:29.760> because<00:00:30.210> they're<00:00:30.420> distracted

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
insta sized because they're distracted

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.200 
insta sized because they're distracted
and<00:00:31.399> they<00:00:32.399> don't<00:00:32.579> really<00:00:32.850> need<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.090> be

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
and they don't really need to be

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.340 
and they don't really need to be
digested<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.770> regular<00:00:35.250> food<00:00:35.520> does<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:36.960> also

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
digested like regular food does and also

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.650 
digested like regular food does and also
because<00:00:37.649> I'm<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> cutting<00:00:38.940> diet<00:00:39.270> right<00:00:39.510> now

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
because I'm on a cutting diet right now

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.369 
because I'm on a cutting diet right now
so<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.079> don't<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.440> too<00:00:40.649> much<00:00:40.800> calories<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
so I don't have too much calories and

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.940 
so I don't have too much calories and
it's<00:00:43.379> only<00:00:43.530> 10<00:00:43.860> calories<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:45.950> large

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
it's only 10 calories and you get large

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.940 
it's only 10 calories and you get large
amounts<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> most<00:00:47.820> beneficial<00:00:48.950> amino

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
amounts of the most beneficial amino

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.689 
amounts of the most beneficial amino
acids<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.850> got<00:00:51.000> 2.5<00:00:51.809> grams<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:54.260> l-leucine

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
acids so we got 2.5 grams of l-leucine

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.340 
acids so we got 2.5 grams of l-leucine
1.25<00:00:56.699> grams<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.360> l<00:00:57.870> isoleucine<00:00:58.590> and<00:01:00.350> 1.25

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
1.25 grams of l isoleucine and 1.25

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.670 
1.25 grams of l isoleucine and 1.25
grams<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.980> al<00:01:02.250> valine<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.899> there's<00:01:04.439> 40

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680
