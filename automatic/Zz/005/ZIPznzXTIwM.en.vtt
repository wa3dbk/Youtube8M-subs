00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
just pasted it but I'll explain it to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.770 
just pasted it but I'll explain it to
you<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.400> might<00:01:17.400> think<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.390> border

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
you you might think that it's the border

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.780 
you you might think that it's the border
that<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.080> need<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.409> change<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.430> actuality

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
that you need to change but in actuality

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.719 
that you need to change but in actuality
it's<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.630> padding<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.560> margin<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
it's the padding and the margin the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.030 
it's the padding and the margin the
reason<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> border<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
reason for that is the border is just a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.719 
reason for that is the border is just a
thin<00:01:26.880> line<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.210> goes<00:01:27.659> around<00:01:28.100> but<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
thin line that goes around but the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.230 
thin line that goes around but the
padding<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.990> space<00:01:31.350> between<00:01:31.790> the<00:01:32.790> end<00:01:33.030> of

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
padding is the space between the end of

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.620 
padding is the space between the end of
the<00:01:33.299> image<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.670> end<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.299> thin

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the image and just the end of the thin

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.350 
the image and just the end of the thin
line<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:36.900> goes<00:01:37.259> around<00:01:37.409> if<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.610> change<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
line that goes around if you change the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.929 
line that goes around if you change the
padding<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> margin<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.740> zero<00:01:41.130> your

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
padding and the margin to zero your

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.139 
padding and the margin to zero your
border<00:01:42.329> should<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.689> gone<00:01:43.399> I'm<00:01:44.399> Omar<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.090> I
