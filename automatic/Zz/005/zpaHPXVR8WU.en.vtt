we<00:00:01.329> have<00:00:01.510> previously<00:00:01.810> learned<00:00:02.200> about<00:00:02.740> the

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:02.889 
we have previously learned about the

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:06.090 
we have previously learned about the
formation<00:00:03.280> of<00:00:03.760> ions<00:00:04.360> now<00:00:05.170> we<00:00:05.740> will<00:00:05.920> learn

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.100 
formation of ions now we will learn

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.190 
formation of ions now we will learn
about<00:00:06.130> ionic<00:00:06.970> bonds<00:00:09.480> ions<00:00:10.480> as<00:00:10.780> you<00:00:11.050> already

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
about ionic bonds ions as you already

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.250 
about ionic bonds ions as you already
know<00:00:11.500> are<00:00:11.950> formed<00:00:12.670> from<00:00:12.880> the<00:00:13.030> loss<00:00:13.300> or<00:00:13.690> gain<00:00:13.930> of

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
know are formed from the loss or gain of

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.820 
know are formed from the loss or gain of
electrons<00:00:15.390> electrons<00:00:16.390> however<00:00:16.750> do<00:00:17.710> not

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
electrons electrons however do not

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.450 
electrons electrons however do not
suddenly<00:00:18.460> appear<00:00:18.970> or<00:00:19.150> disappear<00:00:20.130> they<00:00:21.130> are<00:00:21.160> in

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
suddenly appear or disappear they are in

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.090 
suddenly appear or disappear they are in
fact<00:00:21.810> transferred<00:00:22.810> from<00:00:23.380> one<00:00:23.619> atom<00:00:23.890> to

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
fact transferred from one atom to

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.599 
fact transferred from one atom to
another<00:00:24.900> let's<00:00:25.900> look<00:00:26.140> at<00:00:26.289> sodium<00:00:26.740> chloride<00:00:27.340> as

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
another let's look at sodium chloride as

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.439 
another let's look at sodium chloride as
an<00:00:27.880> example<00:00:28.740> sodium<00:00:29.740> loses<00:00:30.160> one<00:00:30.699> electron<00:00:30.730> to

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
an example sodium loses one electron to

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.219 
an example sodium loses one electron to
form<00:00:31.930> a<00:00:32.109> sodium<00:00:32.649> ion<00:00:33.089> the<00:00:34.089> electron<00:00:34.690> is<00:00:34.929> not

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:35.229 
form a sodium ion the electron is not

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
form a sodium ion the electron is not
lost<00:00:35.620> but<00:00:36.460> transferred<00:00:37.149> to<00:00:38.050> chlorine<00:00:38.649> to<00:00:39.219> form

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:39.249 
lost but transferred to chlorine to form

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:43.590 
lost but transferred to chlorine to form
a<00:00:39.729> chloride<00:00:40.269> ion<00:00:41.159> so<00:00:42.159> we<00:00:42.339> have<00:00:42.579> a<00:00:42.850> sodium<00:00:43.300> ion

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
a chloride ion so we have a sodium ion

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.770 
a chloride ion so we have a sodium ion
and<00:00:44.019> a<00:00:44.409> chloride<00:00:44.739> ion

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
and a chloride ion

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.930

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
they are oppositely charged ions and

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.149
