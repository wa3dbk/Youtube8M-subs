that really shook and finally for a
change<00:01:52.460> of<00:01:52.580> pace<00:01:52.729> we<00:01:53.030> tuned<00:01:53.330> in<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.570> whales<00:02:04.480> so

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
change of pace we tuned in the whales so

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.450 
change of pace we tuned in the whales so
this<00:02:05.870> experiment<00:02:06.470> gave<00:02:06.710> us<00:02:06.860> some<00:02:07.010> surprising

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
this experiment gave us some surprising

this experiment gave us some surprising
results<00:02:07.490> it<00:02:08.030> seems<00:02:08.540> like<00:02:08.630> whale<00:02:08.929> songs<00:02:09.320> were

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
results it seems like whale songs were

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.620 
results it seems like whale songs were
the<00:02:09.709> least<00:02:09.950> distracting<00:02:10.519> overall<00:02:10.910> talkback

the least distracting overall talkback

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.020 
the least distracting overall talkback
also<00:02:12.110> performed<00:02:12.560> well<00:02:12.769> increasing<00:02:13.700> average

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
also performed well increasing average

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.150 
also performed well increasing average
attention<00:02:14.330> levels<00:02:14.750> while<00:02:15.500> favorite<00:02:15.920> tunes

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
attention levels while favorite tunes

proved<00:02:16.489> slightly<00:02:16.970> distracting<00:02:17.450> for<00:02:17.570> everyone

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
proved slightly distracting for everyone

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.830 
proved slightly distracting for everyone
except<00:02:18.830> Sean<00:02:19.130> but<00:02:19.760> our<00:02:19.910> most<00:02:20.269> distracting

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
except Sean but our most distracting

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.780 
except Sean but our most distracting
test<00:02:21.050> by<00:02:21.200> far<00:02:21.530> was<00:02:21.890> when<00:02:22.070> we<00:02:22.190> cranked<00:02:22.610> it<00:02:22.670> up

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
test by far was when we cranked it up

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.090 
test by far was when we cranked it up
and<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:23.330> time<00:02:23.570> Sean<00:02:24.050> performed<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.800> worst

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
and this time Sean performed the worst

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.490 
and this time Sean performed the worst
heavy<00:02:25.850> metal<00:02:25.970> was<00:02:26.420> also<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.780> big<00:02:27.170> distraction

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
heavy metal was also a big distraction

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.340 
heavy metal was also a big distraction
though<00:02:28.340> not<00:02:28.580> nearly<00:02:28.790> as<00:02:28.970> bad<00:02:29.239> as<00:02:29.420> expected<00:02:29.570> in

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
though not nearly as bad as expected in

good<00:02:33.170> for<00:02:33.380> attention<00:02:33.680> levels<00:02:34.100> music

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790
