00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.239
We've lost each other even after being together

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:15.339
Now what's left in life

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.198
To live for

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.638
I had dreams

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.279
That I wanted to live

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.461
With you

00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:39.378
Never before

00:00:39.378 --> 00:00:44.064
Had I felt this way

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.053
About you

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.316
Why has my world

00:00:53.316 --> 00:01:03.324
Suddenly stopped 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.460
What should I tell you

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.085
Sadness is with me

00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:47.784
All the time

00:01:47.784 --> 00:01:53.099
I am angry even with myself

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.658
Why did you have to

00:01:58.658 --> 00:02:04.070
Hurt this much

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.684
Never before

00:02:07.684 --> 00:02:12.752
Had I felt this way

00:02:12.752 --> 00:02:18.792
About you

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.204
Why has my world

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:30.982
Suddenly stopped

00:02:30.982 --> 00:02:42.204
What kind of relation is this

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.991
that we have?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:57.078
What kind of relation is this

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.790
that we have?

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:11.944
What kind of relation is this

00:03:11.944 --> 00:03:15.477
that we have?

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:26.531
What kind of relation is this

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.398
that we have?
