going and people well see ok well it's

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.790 
going and people well see ok well it's
quite<00:00:51.810> a<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:52.080> quite<00:00:52.200> a<00:00:52.230> lot<00:00:52.410> different<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
quite a it's quite a lot different to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.170 
quite a it's quite a lot different to
the<00:00:52.890> road<00:00:53.040> cars<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.520> honest<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:53.970> it

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the road cars to be honest it's it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.030 
the road cars to be honest it's it
starts<00:00:54.510> off<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.080> carbon<00:00:55.650> mono<00:00:55.800> cell

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
starts off with the carbon mono cell

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.890 
starts off with the carbon mono cell
like<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> road<00:00:56.790> car<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.300> after<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.750> it

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
like like the road car but after that it

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.780 
like like the road car but after that it
looks<00:00:58.080> very<00:00:58.230> looks<00:00:58.590> very<00:00:58.830> different<00:00:59.040> in<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.640> lot

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
looks very looks very different in a lot

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.250 
looks very looks very different in a lot
of<00:00:59.820> ways<00:01:00.030> there's<00:01:00.300> there's<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.720> many<00:01:00.900> things

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
of ways there's there's so many things

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.869 
of ways there's there's so many things
that<00:01:01.379> there<00:01:01.830> aren't<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.129> same<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.760> know

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
that there aren't the same so you know

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.579 
that there aren't the same so you know
you<00:01:02.970> see<00:01:03.180> obviously<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.870> got<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.020> vent<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
you see obviously it's got a vent in the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.980 
you see obviously it's got a vent in the
bonnet<00:01:04.770> it's<00:01:05.430> got<00:01:05.610> front<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.270> front<00:01:06.810> radiator

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
bonnet it's got front a front radiator

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.219 
bonnet it's got front a front radiator
it's<00:01:07.770> 50<00:01:08.220> mil<00:01:08.369> wider<00:01:08.670> per<00:01:09.570> side<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.080> that's

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
it's 50 mil wider per side so that's

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.889 
it's 50 mil wider per side so that's
quite<00:01:10.740> quite<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> considerable<00:01:11.310> difference

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
quite quite a considerable difference

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.700 
quite quite a considerable difference
obviously<00:01:12.899> it's<00:01:13.020> got<00:01:13.110> different<00:01:13.229> brakes

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
obviously it's got different brakes

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.139 
obviously it's got different brakes
bigger<00:01:14.190> discs<00:01:14.930> different<00:01:15.930> doors<00:01:17.149> it's

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
bigger discs different doors it's

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.580 
bigger discs different doors it's
obviously<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.450> lot<00:01:18.600> lower<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.229> got<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.410> front

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
obviously a lot lower it's got a front

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.290 
obviously a lot lower it's got a front
splitter<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.340> got<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.550> rear<00:01:20.790> wing<00:01:21.030> there<00:01:21.240> are

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
splitter it's got a rear wing there are

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.540 
splitter it's got a rear wing there are
the<00:01:21.360> obvious<00:01:21.479> things<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.350> below<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
the obvious things but below that the

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.969 
the obvious things but below that the
the<00:01:23.940> sort<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.360> surface<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> car<00:01:25.350> there's

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the sort of surface of the car there's

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.920 
the sort of surface of the car there's
all<00:01:26.130> sorts<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.550> differences<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.509> don't<00:01:27.690> use

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
all sorts of differences we don't use

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.690 
all sorts of differences we don't use
the<00:01:28.140> suspension<00:01:28.740> setup<00:01:29.100> from<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> road<00:01:29.490> car

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the suspension setup from the road car

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.920 
the suspension setup from the road car
and<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.940> main<00:01:30.060> reason<00:01:30.330> for<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:30.810> not

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
and the main reason for that is it's not

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.350 
and the main reason for that is it's not
legal<00:01:31.320> for<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.560> racing<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.009> we're<00:01:32.160> doing<00:01:32.360> we

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
legal for the racing that we're doing we

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.600 
legal for the racing that we're doing we
don't<00:01:33.540> use<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.050> word<00:01:34.380> going<00:01:34.710> gearbox<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.490> one

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
don't use the word going gearbox and one

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.770 
don't use the word going gearbox and one
of<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.729> main<00:01:35.880> reasons<00:01:36.180> for<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.570> just

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
of the main reasons for that is just

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.180 
of the main reasons for that is just
pure<00:01:36.990> weight<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.830> need<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.009> get<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
pure weight because we need to get the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.710 
pure weight because we need to get the
weight<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.399> the<00:01:38.520> car<00:01:38.670> down<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.149> also<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.630> need

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
weight of the car down and also we need

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.300 
weight of the car down and also we need
to<00:01:39.840> get<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.050> weight<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.440> car<00:01:40.650> slightly

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
to get the weight of the car slightly

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.190 
to get the weight of the car slightly
farther<00:01:41.520> forward<00:01:42.000> than<00:01:42.210> say<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.690> and<00:01:42.930> say<00:01:43.049> the

cooling for the gearbox which you see in
here<00:02:04.710> which<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.250> not<00:02:05.759> exactly<00:02:06.150> where<00:02:06.360> we

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
here which is is not exactly where we

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.969 
here which is is not exactly where we
want<00:02:06.720> it<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.900> be<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.619> know<00:02:07.650> it's<00:02:07.740> very

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
want it to be but you know it's very

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.560 
want it to be but you know it's very
difficult<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.580> package<00:02:08.970> things<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.420> these

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
difficult to package things in these

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.060 

inside<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.870> car<00:02:14.080> as<00:02:14.230> well<00:02:14.410> is<00:02:14.590> very<00:02:14.800> very

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
inside the car as well is very very

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.470 
inside the car as well is very very
different<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:15.610> we've<00:02:15.730> got<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.000> Formula<00:02:16.330> one

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
different so we've got the Formula one

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.180 
different so we've got the Formula one
steering<00:02:16.720> wheel<00:02:17.020> so<00:02:17.530> it's<00:02:17.740> obviously<00:02:18.130> very

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
steering wheel so it's obviously very

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.030 
steering wheel so it's obviously very
very<00:02:18.610> different<00:02:19.000> obviously<00:02:19.390> no<00:02:19.780> interior<00:02:20.040> one

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
very different obviously no interior one

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.220 
very different obviously no interior one
seat<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:22.150> inside<00:02:22.630> looks<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:23.050> lot<00:02:23.200> different

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
seat and so inside looks a lot different

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.800

the<00:02:23.590> dash<00:02:23.770> is<00:02:23.980> standard<00:02:24.430> but<00:02:25.000> beyond<00:02:25.690> that

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
the dash is standard but beyond that

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.620 
the dash is standard but beyond that
it's<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.830> very<00:02:27.070> very<00:02:27.310> different<00:02:27.630> perfect

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
it's is very very different perfect
