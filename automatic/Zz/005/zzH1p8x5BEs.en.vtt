pro<00:00:31.320> it's<00:00:31.980> another<00:00:32.250> great<00:00:32.550> tool<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.420> think

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
pro it's another great tool but I think

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.959 
pro it's another great tool but I think
the<00:00:33.930> best<00:00:34.079> way<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.320> tell<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.399> about<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.820> to

the best way to tell you about it is to

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.130 
the best way to tell you about it is to
actually<00:00:36.090> show<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.450> how<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.719> works<00:00:36.899> so

actually show you how it works so

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.490 
actually show you how it works so
getting<00:00:38.100> started<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.870> Premiere<00:00:39.870> clip<00:00:40.290> is

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500

really<00:00:41.370> straightforward<00:00:41.719> because

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
really straightforward because

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.000 
really straightforward because
everything<00:00:44.280> accesses<00:00:45.059> your<00:00:45.649> camera<00:00:46.649> roll<00:00:46.829> so

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
everything accesses your camera roll so

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.459 
everything accesses your camera roll so
you<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.969> select<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.660> clips<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.260> want

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.310 
you just select the clips that you want
to<00:00:49.559> use<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:52.879> that's<00:00:53.879> how<00:00:54.539> easy<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.199> get

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
to use and that's how easy it is to get

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.139 
to use and that's how easy it is to get
a<00:00:55.350> project<00:00:55.739> started<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.430> move<00:00:57.030> your

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
a project started you can move your

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.819 
a project started you can move your

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
sequence so I let's see let's that I

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.229 
sequence so I let's see let's that I
