with<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.619> Stars<00:01:57.820> it's<00:01:58.820> what's<00:01:59.180> gonna<00:01:59.390> make<00:01:59.810> it

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
with the Stars it's what's gonna make it

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.630 
with the Stars it's what's gonna make it
or<00:02:00.110> break<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.290> for<00:02:00.409> you<00:02:00.590> I<00:02:00.860> think<00:02:01.460> chemistry

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
or break it for you I think chemistry

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.810 
or break it for you I think chemistry
you<00:02:02.299> you<00:02:02.840> need<00:02:03.290> to<00:02:03.439> have<00:02:03.649> it<00:02:03.830> in<00:02:03.950> order<00:02:04.189> for

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
you you need to have it in order for

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.850 
you you need to have it in order for
people<00:02:04.939> to<00:02:05.149> believe<00:02:05.540> in<00:02:05.720> what<00:02:05.899> you<00:02:06.110> do<00:02:06.350> you<00:02:06.590> can

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
people to believe in what you do you can

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.899 
people to believe in what you do you can
see<00:02:07.009> it<00:02:07.100> right<00:02:07.189> through<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.430> television

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
see it right through the television

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.219 
see it right through the television
screen<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.149> think<00:02:08.450> if<00:02:08.569> you<00:02:08.720> prove<00:02:08.929> someone

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
screen I think if you prove someone

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.710 
screen I think if you prove someone
really<00:02:09.470> knows<00:02:09.619> true<00:02:09.830> chemistry<00:02:10.310> on<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.720> why

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
really knows true chemistry on it why

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.790 
really knows true chemistry on it why
are<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:11.840> looking<00:02:12.110> at<00:02:12.170> me<00:02:12.260> like<00:02:12.349> that<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:12.560> know

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
are you looking at me like that you know

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.650 
are you looking at me like that you know
I'm<00:02:13.130> thinking<00:02:13.400> about<00:02:13.489> actors<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:14.420> hear

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
I'm thinking about actors that you hear

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.150 
I'm thinking about actors that you hear
about<00:02:14.750> that<00:02:14.959> they<00:02:15.140> can't<00:02:15.410> stand<00:02:15.680> each<00:02:15.860> other

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
about that they can't stand each other

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.589 
about that they can't stand each other
and<00:02:16.400> then<00:02:16.730> they<00:02:16.790> go<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.090> movie<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.510> then

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
and then they go to a movie and then

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.120 
and then they go to a movie and then
sometimes<00:02:18.050> people<00:02:18.170> but<00:02:18.620> sometimes<00:02:18.830> people

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
sometimes people but sometimes people

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.380 
sometimes people but sometimes people
can<00:02:19.400> really<00:02:19.550> say<00:02:19.730> oh<00:02:19.760> my<00:02:19.910> god<00:02:20.030> these<00:02:20.120> two<00:02:20.269> are

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
can really say oh my god these two are

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.089 
can really say oh my god these two are

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
so in love however these are trained

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.110 
so in love however these are trained
actors<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.550> they<00:02:22.640> know<00:02:22.790> how<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:22.970> use

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
actors that they know how to use

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.030 
actors that they know how to use
techniques<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:23.599> stuff<00:02:23.750> like<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.019> with<00:02:24.980> a

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
trained like with all my previous

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.620 
trained like with all my previous
competitive<00:02:31.130> dance<00:02:31.400> partners<00:02:31.819> I<00:02:32.000> couldn't<00:02:32.510> be

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
competitive dance partners I couldn't be

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.479 
competitive dance partners I couldn't be
competitive<00:02:33.350> with<00:02:33.470> anyone<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:34.069> I<00:02:34.250> didn't

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
competitive with anyone that I didn't

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.949 
competitive with anyone that I didn't
have<00:02:34.580> chemistry<00:02:34.760> with<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.420> believe<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.810> saying

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
have chemistry with I believe you saying

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.210 
have chemistry with I believe you saying
you<00:02:36.080> had<00:02:36.200> chemistry<00:02:36.470> with<00:02:36.590> everybody

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
you had chemistry with everybody

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.740 
you had chemistry with everybody
everyone<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.120> I've<00:02:38.239> danced<00:02:38.420> with<00:02:38.569> on<00:02:38.720> a

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
everyone that I've danced with on a

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.720 
everyone that I've danced with on a
professional<00:02:38.959> level<00:02:39.350> yes<00:02:39.709> so<00:02:40.280> what<00:02:40.459> kind<00:02:40.670> of

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
professional level yes so what kind of

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.520 
professional level yes so what kind of
chemistry<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.510> because<00:02:41.810> we<00:02:42.019> are<00:02:42.140> nothing

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
chemistry is this because we are nothing

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.650 
chemistry is this because we are nothing
like<00:02:42.680> your<00:02:42.920> performance<00:02:43.340> this<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.090> perfect

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
like your performance this is perfect

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.180 
like your performance this is perfect
right<00:02:44.750> now<00:02:44.810> just<00:02:45.200> keep<00:02:45.290> rolling<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:45.799> if<00:02:46.069> you've

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
right now just keep rolling so if you've

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.680 
right now just keep rolling so if you've
had<00:02:46.340> chemistry<00:02:46.700> with<00:02:46.819> everybody<00:02:47.269> what<00:02:47.510> is<00:02:47.600> it

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
had chemistry with everybody what is it

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.880 
had chemistry with everybody what is it
that<00:02:47.810> we<00:02:47.930> have<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.260> has<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:48.470> be<00:02:48.560> something

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
that we have it has to be something

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.440 
that we have it has to be something
different<00:02:49.040> in<00:02:49.280> chemistry<00:02:49.640> that<00:02:50.000> we<00:02:50.180> they're

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
different in chemistry that we they're

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.020 
different in chemistry that we they're
totally<00:02:51.110> different<00:02:51.319> things

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
totally different things

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.530 
totally different things
we're<00:02:53.030> not<00:02:53.180> okay<00:02:54.349> well<00:02:55.060> everybody<00:02:56.060> else<00:02:56.120> I

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
we're not okay well everybody else I

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.660 
we're not okay well everybody else I
have<00:02:57.260> different<00:02:57.799> types<00:02:58.160> of<00:02:58.370> chemistry

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
have different types of chemistry

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.009 
have different types of chemistry
different<00:02:59.209> oh<00:02:59.269> they're<00:02:59.480> different<00:02:59.690> types

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
different oh they're different types

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.390 
different oh they're different types
there<00:03:00.500> are<00:03:00.530> different<00:03:00.890> types<00:03:01.040> of<00:03:01.190> chemistry

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
there are different types of chemistry

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.390 
there are different types of chemistry
now<00:03:01.640> right<00:03:05.680> chemistry<00:03:06.680> doesn't<00:03:07.010> mean<00:03:07.220> that

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
now right chemistry doesn't mean that

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.520 
now right chemistry doesn't mean that
we're<00:03:07.579> together<00:03:07.850> we're<00:03:08.720> not<00:03:08.900> boyfriend<00:03:09.470> and

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
we're together we're not boyfriend and

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.520 
we're together we're not boyfriend and
