simply<00:02:35.400> recog<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.610> back<00:02:37.980> click<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.490> little

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
simply recog it back click the little

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.910 
simply recog it back click the little
ammo<00:02:40.060> cartridge<00:02:40.420> which<00:02:41.230> will<00:02:41.440> chop<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.890> and

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
ammo cartridge which will chop it and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.680 
ammo cartridge which will chop it and
reload<00:02:42.400> on<00:02:42.510> then<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.630> says<00:02:43.780> bump<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.830> lock<00:02:45.010> in

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
reload on then it says bump to lock in

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.180 
reload on then it says bump to lock in
so<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:46.750> bump<00:02:47.080> it<00:02:47.230> like<00:02:47.380> if<00:02:47.560> you're<00:02:47.770> in<00:02:47.980> real

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
so you bump it like if you're in real

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.370 
so you bump it like if you're in real
life<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:49.300> have<00:02:49.510> your<00:02:49.860> pistol<00:02:50.860> hold<00:02:51.430> on

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.500 

pretend<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.470> this<00:02:56.860> is<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:58.090> i<00:02:58.150> guess<00:02:58.360> if

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
pretend that this is the so i guess if
