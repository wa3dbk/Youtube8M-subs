00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
remover and some q-tips now I use this

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.870 
remover and some q-tips now I use this
to<00:01:34.170> remove<00:01:34.530> any<00:01:34.740> fingerprints<00:01:35.310> or<00:01:35.490> dust<00:01:35.700> for

to remove any fingerprints or dust for
my<00:01:35.970> polymer<00:01:36.420> clay<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.110> also<00:01:37.259> helps<00:01:37.799> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
my polymer clay and it also helps to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.890 
my polymer clay and it also helps to
smooth<00:01:38.280> out<00:01:38.460> your<00:01:38.490> clay<00:01:38.850> really<00:01:39.180> nicely<00:01:39.390> I

also<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.590> really<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:41.040> keeping<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> wrong

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
also just really like keeping the wrong

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.399 
also just really like keeping the wrong
q-tips<00:01:42.090> because<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.659> use<00:01:42.840> these<00:01:43.020> instead

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
q-tips because you can use these instead

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.560 
q-tips because you can use these instead
