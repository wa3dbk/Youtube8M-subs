00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.289 
we put the text you may hear it's
because<00:01:43.649> that's<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.610> aircraft's<00:01:45.030> going<00:01:45.240> to

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
because that's the aircraft's going to

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.080 
because that's the aircraft's going to
go<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.570> now<00:01:45.920> this<00:01:46.920> aircraft<00:01:47.130> as<00:01:47.549> an<00:01:47.640> fpv

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
go on now this aircraft as an fpv

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.710 
go on now this aircraft as an fpv
aircraft<00:01:48.509> flies<00:01:49.430> really<00:01:50.430> well<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.540> great

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
aircraft flies really well it's a great

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.950 
aircraft flies really well it's a great
aircraft<00:01:51.869> system<00:01:52.439> yeah<00:01:53.600> downside<00:01:54.600> with<00:01:54.810> this

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
aircraft system yeah downside with this

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.260 
aircraft system yeah downside with this
aircraft<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.619> we<00:01:56.340> don't<00:01:56.549> have<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> GoPro<00:01:57.240> on

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
aircraft is we don't have the GoPro on

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.719 
aircraft is we don't have the GoPro on
it<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:57.810> um<00:01:58.110> because<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.950> GoPro<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.399> just<00:01:59.549> way

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
it so um because the GoPro is just way

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.490 
it so um because the GoPro is just way
way<00:02:00.000> way<00:02:00.240> too<00:02:00.509> big<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.079> heavy<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.409> this

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
way way too big and heavy for this

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.780 
way way too big and heavy for this
aircraft<00:02:01.950> you're<00:02:02.130> probably<00:02:02.280> good<00:02:02.549> flight

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
aircraft you're probably good flight

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.280 
aircraft you're probably good flight
with<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> GoPro<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:03.600> gosh<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.990> wouldn't<00:02:04.229> fly

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
with the GoPro but gosh it wouldn't fly

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.980 
with the GoPro but gosh it wouldn't fly
very<00:02:04.500> well<00:02:04.619> at<00:02:04.890> all<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.909> one<00:02:06.210> that's

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
very well at all so one that's

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.540 
very well at all so one that's
essentially<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.619> problem<00:02:07.979> we've<00:02:08.160> got<00:02:08.190> with

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
essentially the problem we've got with

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.029 
essentially the problem we've got with
this<00:02:08.700> aircraft<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.420> hence<00:02:09.810> why<00:02:10.649> we've<00:02:10.860> gone

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
this aircraft so hence why we've gone

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.220 
this aircraft so hence why we've gone
down<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.250> path<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.760> one<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.030> these<00:02:12.120> guys

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
down a path of one of these guys

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.110 
down a path of one of these guys
this<00:02:13.560> should<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:14.069> truly<00:02:14.370> awesome<00:02:14.489> that<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
this should be truly awesome that the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.000 
this should be truly awesome that the
footprint<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.510> going<00:02:15.629> to<00:02:15.690> be<00:02:15.750> tiny<00:02:15.989> that's<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
footprint is going to be tiny that's the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.380 
footprint is going to be tiny that's the
effect<00:02:17.310> shark<00:02:17.610> camera<00:02:17.909> as<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.060> can<00:02:18.209> see<00:02:18.299> it's

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
effect shark camera as you can see it's

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.289 
effect shark camera as you can see it's
not<00:02:18.510> much<00:02:18.659> bigger<00:02:18.810> weighs<00:02:19.379> next<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.709> nothing

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
not much bigger weighs next to nothing

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.640 
not much bigger weighs next to nothing
the<00:02:21.299> weight<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.810> isn't<00:02:22.200> bad<00:02:22.379> at<00:02:22.560> all

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
the weight of this isn't bad at all

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.550 
the weight of this isn't bad at all
either<00:02:23.420> no<00:02:24.420> onboard<00:02:24.690> battery<00:02:25.140> which<00:02:25.530> is

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
either no onboard battery which is

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.720 
either no onboard battery which is
fantastic<00:02:25.860> because<00:02:26.310> we're<00:02:26.489> going<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.670> be

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
fantastic because we're going to be

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.869 
fantastic because we're going to be
running<00:02:26.940> off<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.209> actual<00:02:27.750> arm<00:02:28.370> on<00:02:29.370> bought<00:02:29.640> the

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
running off the actual arm on bought the

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.339 
running off the actual arm on bought the
batteries<00:02:30.299> on<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.510> actual<00:02:30.720> aircraft<00:02:30.870> itself

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
batteries on the actual aircraft itself

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.680 
batteries on the actual aircraft itself
so<00:02:31.650> that's<00:02:31.830> going<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:31.980> keep<00:02:32.129> weight<00:02:32.370> down<00:02:32.690> I

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
so that's going to keep weight down I

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.330 
so that's going to keep weight down I
don't<00:02:34.230> think<00:02:34.379> this<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.530> going<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:34.860> bother<00:02:35.069> this

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
don't think this is going to bother this

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.180 
don't think this is going to bother this
aircraft<00:02:35.849> in<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.120> slightest<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:37.319> that's<00:02:38.069> a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
aircraft in the slightest so that's a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.930 
aircraft in the slightest so that's a
plan<00:02:38.430> that's<00:02:38.700> why<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:38.940> intend<00:02:39.299> on<00:02:39.390> mounting<00:02:39.810> it

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
plan that's why we intend on mounting it

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.819 
plan that's why we intend on mounting it
so<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:41.970> guess<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.690> next<00:02:42.780> part<00:02:43.049> is<00:02:43.170> get<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:43.680> on

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
so I guess the next part is get this on

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:44.960 
so I guess the next part is get this on
the<00:02:43.920> aircraft<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.370> get<00:02:44.549> it<00:02:44.610> going<00:02:44.640> what<00:02:44.909> you

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
the aircraft and get it going what you

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.479 
the aircraft and get it going what you
reckon<00:02:45.209> tom<00:02:45.360> yeah<00:02:45.799> so<00:02:46.799> there<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.250> go<00:02:47.280> to

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
reckon tom yeah so there you go to

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.410 
reckon tom yeah so there you go to
another<00:02:47.610> quickly<00:02:47.879> show<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.030> what<00:02:48.180> we've<00:02:48.299> got

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
another quickly show you what we've got

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.710 
another quickly show you what we've got
planned<00:02:48.739> um<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.970> think<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.269> is<00:02:51.329> going<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.599> go

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
planned um I think this is going to go

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.660 
planned um I think this is going to go
together<00:02:51.870> really<00:02:52.079> well<00:02:52.470> if<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.250> requires

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
together really well if this requires

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.430 
together really well if this requires
half<00:02:53.940> as<00:02:54.150> good<00:02:54.359> as<00:02:54.450> I'm<00:02:54.569> expecting<00:02:55.049> it<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.290> dude

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
half as good as I'm expecting it to dude

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.500 
half as good as I'm expecting it to dude
we<00:02:56.280> should<00:02:56.310> get<00:02:56.609> some<00:02:56.790> spectacular<00:02:57.480> footage

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
we should get some spectacular footage

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.490 
we should get some spectacular footage

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
because they really got this out in no

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.160 
because they really got this out in no
time<00:03:05.760> at<00:03:06.120> all<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.269> also<00:03:06.720> ask<00:03:06.930> them<00:03:07.049> a<00:03:07.140> few

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
time at all I also ask them a few

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.650 
time at all I also ask them a few
questions<00:03:07.349> before<00:03:07.799> I<00:03:08.310> getting<00:03:09.269> hold<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.569> this

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
questions before I getting hold of this

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.020 
questions before I getting hold of this
little<00:03:09.900> baby<00:03:10.079> and<00:03:10.519> they<00:03:11.519> simply<00:03:11.730> really

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
little baby and they simply really

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.220 
little baby and they simply really
responsive<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.540> email<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:12.900> i<00:03:12.930> think<00:03:13.019> it's<00:03:13.170> the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
responsive to email so i think it's the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.119 
responsive to email so i think it's the
first<00:03:13.410> time<00:03:13.470> I've<00:03:13.590> actually<00:03:13.650> bothered
