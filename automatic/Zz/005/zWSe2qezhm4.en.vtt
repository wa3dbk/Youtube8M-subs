00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
fact that they saw barnacle geese living

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.439 
fact that they saw barnacle geese living
around<00:00:23.580> them<00:00:23.760> during<00:00:23.970> much<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> year

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449

around them during much of the year
during<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.140> summer<00:00:25.410> they<00:00:25.680> could<00:00:25.859> never<00:00:25.949> find

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
during the summer they could never find

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.099 
during the summer they could never find
any<00:00:26.460> barnacle<00:00:26.820> goose<00:00:26.939> eggs<00:00:27.210> or<00:00:27.599> catch<00:00:27.900> any

barnacle geese mating or building nests

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.170 
barnacle geese mating or building nests
so<00:00:30.750> they<00:00:31.410> put<00:00:31.679> one<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.309> two<00:00:32.579> together<00:00:32.759> and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
so they put one and two together and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.459 
so they put one and two together and
came<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> conclusion<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.230> wood

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
came to the conclusion that the wood

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.750 
came to the conclusion that the wood
with<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> barnacle<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.430> must<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.670> come

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
with the barnacle on it must have come

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.860 
with the barnacle on it must have come
from<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.969> tree<00:00:36.120> branch<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.719> tree

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
from a tree branch and that the tree

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.150 
from a tree branch and that the tree
branch<00:00:37.079> must<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.380> come<00:00:37.469> from<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.680> goose<00:00:37.860> tree

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
branch must have come from a goose tree

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.350 
branch must have come from a goose tree
and<00:00:38.399> then<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.610> must<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.760> fallen<00:00:38.879> out<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and then it must have fallen out of the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.639 
and then it must have fallen out of the
goose<00:00:39.540> tree<00:00:39.780> into<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> water<00:00:40.230> before<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
goose tree into the water before the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.229 
goose tree into the water before the
goose<00:00:40.829> bud<00:00:41.129> could<00:00:41.399> finish<00:00:41.550> growing<00:00:42.030> into<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
goose bud could finish growing into a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.170 
goose bud could finish growing into a
full-grown<00:00:42.660> goose<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.260> fly<00:00:44.100> away<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
full-grown goose and fly away the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.389 
full-grown goose and fly away the
missing<00:00:45.600> piece<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> puzzle<00:00:46.260> was<00:00:46.800> my

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
missing piece of the puzzle was my

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.970 
missing piece of the puzzle was my
Gration<00:00:48.329> something<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.110> science<00:00:49.559> would<00:00:49.800> not

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
Gration something that science would not

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.650 
Gration something that science would not
explain<00:00:50.370> until<00:00:50.579> several<00:00:51.000> centuries<00:00:51.329> later

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
explain until several centuries later

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.810 
explain until several centuries later
and<00:00:52.050> without<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:52.829> crucial<00:00:53.399> bit<00:00:53.699> of

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and without that one crucial bit of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.880 
and without that one crucial bit of
knowledge<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.360> belief<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.660> geese<00:00:55.140> grew<00:00:55.680> on

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
knowledge the belief that geese grew on

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.760 
knowledge the belief that geese grew on
trees<00:00:56.149> lasted<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> very<00:00:57.480> long<00:00:58.050> time<00:00:58.079> and

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
trees lasted for a very long time and

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.020 
trees lasted for a very long time and
made<00:00:58.859> its<00:00:58.980> way<00:00:59.100> into<00:00:59.129> some<00:00:59.460> very<00:00:59.699> nice-looking

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.540 
made its way into some very nice-looking
books<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:01.199> had<00:01:01.350> reached<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.739> conclusion<00:01:01.949> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
books they had reached a conclusion and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.950 
books they had reached a conclusion and
then<00:01:02.789> they<00:01:02.879> came<00:01:03.030> up<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.300> story<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
then they came up with a story to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.870 
then they came up with a story to
explain<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:05.129> sort<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.430> backward
