guys<00:00:07.200> for<00:00:07.470> sewer<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.550> composter

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
guys for sewer and the composter

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.589 
guys for sewer and the composter
so<00:00:09.900> I've<00:00:10.019> already<00:00:10.230> set<00:00:10.590> it<00:00:10.710> up<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.639> if<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.300> have

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
so I've already set it up so if you have

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.530 
so I've already set it up so if you have
a<00:00:12.630> car<00:00:12.960> farm<00:00:13.259> that's<00:00:13.889> really<00:00:14.490> well<00:00:14.820> over<00:00:15.059> load

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
a car farm that's really well over load

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.870 
a car farm that's really well over load
it<00:00:15.690> as<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:16.049> one<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:17.250> can<00:00:17.460> make<00:00:17.670> them

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
it as this one is you can make them

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.580 
it as this one is you can make them
bigger<00:00:18.060> I'll<00:00:18.630> show<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:18.990> guys<00:00:19.140> why<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.500> a

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
bigger I'll show you guys why in a

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.400 
bigger I'll show you guys why in a
minute<00:00:19.740> if<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.400> go<00:00:20.520> down<00:00:20.760> here<00:00:20.789> I've<00:00:21.390> got<00:00:22.380> a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
minute if you go down here I've got a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.900 
minute if you go down here I've got a
sewer<00:00:22.769> sit<00:00:23.550> up

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
sewer sit up

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.810 
sewer sit up
now<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> sewer<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.900> at<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.439> same<00:00:25.710> at<00:00:26.160> ground

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
now the sewer is at the same at ground

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.480 
now the sewer is at the same at ground
level<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.750> see<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:28.859> not<00:00:29.160> like

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
level so you can see it so it's not like

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.429 
level so you can see it so it's not like
on<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> ground<00:00:30.119> or<00:00:30.359> above<00:00:30.449> or<00:00:30.900> anything<00:00:31.140> it's

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
on the ground or above or anything it's

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.709 
on the ground or above or anything it's
just<00:00:31.560> right<00:00:32.130> here<00:00:32.460> as<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.239> see<00:00:33.390> it's

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
just right here as you can see it's

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.280 
just right here as you can see it's
slowly<00:00:34.170> taking<00:00:34.649> sewage<00:00:34.980> now<00:00:35.520> I've<00:00:35.670> got<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
slowly taking sewage now I've got a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.389 
slowly taking sewage now I've got a
small<00:00:37.290> range<00:00:37.590> upgrade<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.309> if<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.120> go<00:00:39.329> into

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
small range upgrade but if you go into

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.010 
small range upgrade but if you go into
upgrades

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
upgrades

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.200 
upgrades
well<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.320> one<00:00:43.500> yeah<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.760> see<00:00:44.940> there's

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
well that one yeah you can see there's

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.660 
well that one yeah you can see there's
quite<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.780> few<00:00:45.930> upgrades<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.770> make<00:00:47.100> quite

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
quite a few upgrades you can make quite

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.150 
quite a few upgrades you can make quite
a<00:00:47.910> large<00:00:48.300> animal<00:00:48.750> form<00:00:48.989> now<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.860> thing<00:00:50.129> is

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
a large animal form now the thing is

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.590 
a large animal form now the thing is
with<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:51.170> it<00:00:52.170> takes<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.710> sewage<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.280> when<00:00:53.760> you

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
with this it takes a sewage and when you

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.619 
with this it takes a sewage and when you
can<00:00:54.840> use<00:00:55.289> stern<00:00:56.010> water<00:00:56.280> proof<00:00:56.550> types<00:00:56.789> but

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
can use stern water proof types but

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.420 
can use stern water proof types but
they're<00:00:57.930> not<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.320> fast<00:00:58.710> enough<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.280> that's

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
they're not really fast enough so that's

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.880 
they're not really fast enough so that's
why<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.699> use<00:00:59.910> four<00:01:00.149> golden<00:01:00.539> ones<00:01:00.750> just<00:01:01.410> serve<00:01:01.710> at

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
why I use four golden ones just serve at

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.509 
why I use four golden ones just serve at
because<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.850> sewer<00:01:03.090> used<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.750> full<00:01:04.049> and

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
because the sewer used to be full and

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.130 
because the sewer used to be full and
now<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.760> not<00:01:05.939> because<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.390> has<00:01:06.420> its<00:01:06.900> own

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
now it's not because it has its own

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.500 
now it's not because it has its own
little<00:01:07.439> internal<00:01:08.040> storage<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.880> sewer<00:01:09.150> also

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
little internal storage the sewer also

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.140 
little internal storage the sewer also
it<00:01:09.659> doesn't<00:01:10.110> need<00:01:10.260> power<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.610> connects

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
it doesn't need power it just connects

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.810 
it doesn't need power it just connects
for<00:01:12.420> stuff<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:13.220> composter<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> event

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
for stuff for composter on the event

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.179 
for stuff for composter on the event
uses<00:01:15.150> MJ<00:01:15.540> oh<00:01:15.750> well<00:01:16.229> sorry<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:16.920> knocked<00:01:17.070> a

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
uses MJ oh well sorry I just knocked a

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.880 
uses MJ oh well sorry I just knocked a
mouse<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.759> uses<00:01:18.090> MJ<00:01:18.570> or<00:01:18.810> EU<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.500> doesn't

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
mouse you it uses MJ or EU it doesn't

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.300 
mouse you it uses MJ or EU it doesn't
matter

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
matter

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.060 
matter
it<00:01:21.090> takes<00:01:21.450> Hertz<00:01:21.720> which<00:01:22.020> slowly<00:01:22.530> builds<00:01:22.950> up

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
it takes Hertz which slowly builds up

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.149 
it takes Hertz which slowly builds up
for<00:01:23.220> work<00:01:23.369> timer<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.409> since<00:01:25.409> we're<00:01:25.650> all<00:01:25.770> into

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
for work timer and since we're all into

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.580 
for work timer and since we're all into
industrial<00:01:26.700> fertilizer<00:01:27.080> which<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.380> win

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
industrial fertilizer which you can win

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.740 
industrial fertilizer which you can win
pump<00:01:28.860> onto<00:01:29.600> your<00:01:30.600> wall<00:01:30.900> fertilizer<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.979> make

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
pump onto your wall fertilizer to make

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.620 
pump onto your wall fertilizer to make
the<00:01:33.750> stuff<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.140> need<00:01:34.290> okay<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.700> that's<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.479> for

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the stuff you need okay so that's it for

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.899 
the stuff you need okay so that's it for
these<00:01:36.780> two<00:01:36.840> machines<00:01:37.350> really<00:01:37.979> easy<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.729> and

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
these two machines really easy to and

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.450 
these two machines really easy to and
simple<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.540> use<00:01:39.659> easy<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.110> set<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.710> then

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
simple to use easy to set up and then

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.270 
simple to use easy to set up and then
you<00:01:42.240> don't<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.899> make<00:01:43.649> industrial

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
you don't have to make industrial

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.179 
you don't have to make industrial
fertilizer<00:01:44.490> which<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.360> quite<00:01:45.720> expensive<00:01:46.200> if

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
fertilizer which is quite expensive if

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.889 
fertilizer which is quite expensive if
you<00:01:47.490> want<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.759> make<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.600> this

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
you want to make it like this and this

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.499 
you want to make it like this and this
way<00:01:49.079> it's<00:01:49.229> free<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.700> more<00:01:50.909> animals<00:01:51.390> you

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
way it's free and the more animals you

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.380 
way it's free and the more animals you
have<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.470> bigger<00:01:52.680> form<00:01:53.040> obviously<00:01:53.390> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
have and the bigger form obviously the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.289 
have and the bigger form obviously the
more<00:01:54.600> sewage<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.200> makes<00:01:55.409> now<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.430> also<00:01:56.939> think

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
more sewage it makes now I also think
