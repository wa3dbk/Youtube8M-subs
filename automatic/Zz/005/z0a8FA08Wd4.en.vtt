razon in Sonic 2 I knew that it was a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.359 
razon in Sonic 2 I knew that it was a
rehash<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.630> something<00:00:28.230> probably<00:00:29.070> from<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
rehash of something probably from a

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.939 
rehash of something probably from a
briar<00:00:29.699> genesis<00:00:30.480> game<00:00:30.720> but<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.769> some<00:00:31.920> reason

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
briar genesis game but I for some reason

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.180 
briar genesis game but I for some reason
I<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:32.279> didn't<00:00:33.030> remember<00:00:33.180> what<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.170> was<00:00:34.469> so

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190

go<00:00:39.329> inside<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> bonus<00:00:40.200> since<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.500> didn't<00:00:40.710> have

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
go inside the bonus since I didn't have

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.580 
go inside the bonus since I didn't have
any<00:00:41.040> shield<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.899> just<00:00:42.899> had<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> bit<00:00:43.350> too<00:00:43.559> much

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
any shield I just had a bit too much

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.760 
any shield I just had a bit too much
momentum<00:00:44.040> there<00:00:44.879> speaking<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.930> skipping

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
momentum there speaking of skipping

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.520 
momentum there speaking of skipping
stuff<00:00:47.160> as<00:00:48.059> I've<00:00:48.300> said<00:00:48.510> before<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.320> worth

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
stuff as I've said before and it's worth

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.090 
stuff as I've said before and it's worth
repeating<00:00:49.739> again<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:54.780> laws<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.050> physics<00:00:55.559> need

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
repeating again the laws of physics need

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.369 
repeating again the laws of physics need
not<00:00:56.370> apply<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.789> know<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.480> always<00:00:57.629> cracks<00:00:58.109> me<00:00:58.260> up

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
not apply I know it always cracks me up

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.139

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149
