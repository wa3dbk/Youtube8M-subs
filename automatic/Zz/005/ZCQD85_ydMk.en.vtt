so<00:00:53.890> this<00:00:54.890> planet<00:00:55.190> conker<00:00:55.430> is<00:00:55.460> using<00:00:55.940> the

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
so this planet conker is using the

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.150 
so this planet conker is using the
frostbite<00:00:56.660> engine<00:00:56.780> which<00:00:57.440> is<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.980> same

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
frostbite engine which is the same

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.530 
frostbite engine which is the same
engine<00:00:58.309> used<00:00:58.730> for<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.000> Battlefield<00:00:59.420> series

engine used for the Battlefield series
of<00:00:59.989> games<00:01:00.200> and<00:01:00.500> that<00:01:00.980> gives<00:01:01.219> us<00:01:01.399> DirectX<00:01:02.239> 11

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
of games and that gives us DirectX 11

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.899 
of games and that gives us DirectX 11
graphics<00:01:03.110> gives<00:01:03.559> us<00:01:03.770> real-time<00:01:04.460> physics

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
graphics gives us real-time physics

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.700 
graphics gives us real-time physics
dynamic<00:01:05.659> destruction<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:06.350> it<00:01:06.470> really

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
dynamic destruction so it really

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.770 
dynamic destruction so it really
visually<00:01:07.640> is<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.060> richest<00:01:08.450> command<00:01:08.690> &amp;

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
visually is the richest command &amp;

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.140 
visually is the richest command &amp;
Conquer<00:01:09.080> that<00:01:09.229> we've<00:01:09.380> ever<00:01:09.530> built<00:01:10.030> you<00:01:11.030> know<00:01:11.060> I

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
creating a free-to-play game like so

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.810 
creating a free-to-play game like so
anything<00:02:06.680> that<00:02:06.710> differs<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.430> lot<00:02:07.759> from

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
anything that differs a lot from

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.870 
anything that differs a lot from
something<00:02:08.450> that's<00:02:08.630> like<00:02:08.810> not<00:02:09.050> really<00:02:09.670> it's<00:02:10.670> a

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
something that's like not really it's a

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.850 
something that's like not really it's a
very<00:02:11.180> different<00:02:11.630> approach<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.260> we've<00:02:12.590> had<00:02:12.739> to

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
very different approach and we've had to

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.559 
very different approach and we've had to
learn<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.220> as<00:02:13.370> well<00:02:13.640> because<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.120> think<00:02:14.150> for

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
learn it as well because I think for

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.089 
learn it as well because I think for
most<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:14.959> team<00:02:15.170> this<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.650> first<00:02:15.890> time

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
most of the team this is the first time

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.370 
most of the team this is the first time
we<00:02:16.790> haven't<00:02:17.120> worked<00:02:17.239> on<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.510> retail<00:02:18.140> release

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
we haven't worked on a retail release

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.890 
we haven't worked on a retail release
instead<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:19.790> having<00:02:20.000> everything<00:02:20.480> done<00:02:20.660> at

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
instead of having everything done at

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.040 
instead of having everything done at
once<00:02:21.110> we<00:02:21.770> build<00:02:22.010> things<00:02:22.220> in<00:02:22.670> stages<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.390> we

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
once we build things in stages and we

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.630 
once we build things in stages and we
expect<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.470> keep<00:02:24.709> working<00:02:24.920> on<00:02:25.130> this<00:02:25.190> for<00:02:25.550> many

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
expect to keep working on this for many

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.580 
expect to keep working on this for many
many<00:02:25.880> years<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:26.540> it's<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.840> very<00:02:27.230> different

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
many years so it's a very different

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.010 
many years so it's a very different
mindset<00:02:28.040> in<00:02:28.459> building<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:28.849> I<00:02:29.030> think<00:02:29.660> probably

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
mindset in building it I think probably

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.190 
mindset in building it I think probably
the<00:02:30.410> hardest<00:02:30.770> part<00:02:30.830> for<00:02:31.400> us<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.819> just<00:02:32.450> thinking

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
the hardest part for us is just thinking

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.869 
the hardest part for us is just thinking
about<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.620> in<00:02:33.739> little<00:02:33.920> pieces<00:02:34.099> instead<00:02:34.730> of

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
about it in little pieces instead of

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.390 
about it in little pieces instead of
everything<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.480> was<00:02:35.860> exactly<00:02:36.860> like<00:02:36.950> in<00:02:37.190> order

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
everything it was exactly like in order

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.710 
everything it was exactly like in order
to<00:02:37.520> keep<00:02:37.670> people<00:02:37.819> hooked<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.330> have<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.540> keep

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
to keep people hooked you have to keep

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.020 
to keep people hooked you have to keep
creating<00:02:39.020> content<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.830> upgrading<00:02:40.489> basically

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
creating content and upgrading basically

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.839 
creating content and upgrading basically
so<00:02:41.569> what<00:02:42.230> is<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:42.590> exactly<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.220> sets<00:02:43.730> you

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
so what is it exactly that sets you

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.670 
so what is it exactly that sets you
apart<00:02:43.879> from<00:02:44.180> other<00:02:44.450> RTS<00:02:44.900> titles<00:02:45.440> such<00:02:45.650> as

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
apart from other RTS titles such as

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.250 
apart from other RTS titles such as
Starcraft<00:02:46.300> command<00:02:47.300> &amp;<00:02:47.390> Conquer<00:02:47.690> really<00:02:48.020> has<00:02:48.230> a

Starcraft command &amp; Conquer really has a

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.940 
Starcraft command &amp; Conquer really has a
different<00:02:48.890> feel<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:49.959> we<00:02:50.959> love<00:02:51.650> all<00:02:51.920> of

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
different feel to it and we love all of

we're fans of realtime strategy in

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.460 
we're fans of realtime strategy in

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
general but command &amp; Conquer has

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.490

not all there today but over time we're
going<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.769> make<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.160> very<00:03:10.610> true<00:03:11.000> into<00:03:11.330> the

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
going to make it very true into the

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.240 
going to make it very true into the
essence<00:03:11.930> of<00:03:12.110> what<00:03:12.349> the<00:03:12.530> mannequin<00:03:12.980> carries

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
essence of what the mannequin carries

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.970 
essence of what the mannequin carries
how<00:03:14.180> much<00:03:14.390> of<00:03:14.569> that<00:03:14.720> upgrade<00:03:15.260> has<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.769> do<00:03:15.890> with

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
how much of that upgrade has to do with

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.729 
how much of that upgrade has to do with
the<00:03:16.069> Frostbite<00:03:16.489> engine<00:03:16.670> things<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.599> big<00:03:18.440> part

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
the Frostbite engine things a big part

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.890 
the Frostbite engine things a big part
of<00:03:18.830> it<00:03:18.980> is<00:03:19.099> due<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.430> frostbite<00:03:19.970> we<00:03:20.269> really<00:03:20.629> have

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
of it is due to frostbite we really have

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.830 
of it is due to frostbite we really have
never<00:03:21.170> had<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:22.250> kind<00:03:22.519> of<00:03:22.910> graphics

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
never had this kind of graphics

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.600 
never had this kind of graphics
technology<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:24.560> work<00:03:24.680> with<00:03:24.890> before<00:03:25.069> things

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
technology to work with before things

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.880 
technology to work with before things
like<00:03:25.730> ambient<00:03:26.659> occlusion<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.200> radiosity<00:03:27.560> it

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
like ambient occlusion and radiosity it

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.220 
like ambient occlusion and radiosity it
just<00:03:28.129> sounds<00:03:29.000> like<00:03:29.030> a<00:03:29.180> lot<00:03:29.450> of<00:03:29.480> jargon<00:03:29.780> but<00:03:30.110> it

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
just sounds like a lot of jargon but it

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.050 
just sounds like a lot of jargon but it
really<00:03:30.409> does<00:03:30.680> make<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.099> world<00:03:31.129> look<00:03:31.700> better

other free-to-play games like League of

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
Legends or something you know a lot of

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.230 
Legends or something you know a lot of
people<00:04:33.710> on<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.860> team<00:04:34.070> really<00:04:34.430> enjoy<00:04:34.730> other

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
people on the team really enjoy other

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.480 
people on the team really enjoy other
free-to-play<00:04:35.690> games<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.260> I<00:04:36.500> think<00:04:36.560> it's

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
free-to-play games and I think it's

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.130 
free-to-play games and I think it's
great<00:04:37.730> to<00:04:37.820> see<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.390> approach<00:04:38.690> that<00:04:38.960> they've

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
great to see the approach that they've

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.950 
great to see the approach that they've
taken<00:04:39.350> I<00:04:39.650> think<00:04:40.000> for<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.180> team<00:04:41.360> there<00:04:41.840> are

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
taken I think for the team there are

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.300 
taken I think for the team there are
lessons<00:04:42.290> to<00:04:42.350> be<00:04:42.440> learned<00:04:42.680> from<00:04:42.770> every<00:04:43.160> game

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
lessons to be learned from every game

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.910 
lessons to be learned from every game
out<00:04:43.490> there<00:04:43.630> there's<00:04:44.630> no<00:04:44.840> specific<00:04:45.200> game<00:04:45.680> that

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
out there there's no specific game that

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.220 
out there there's no specific game that
were<00:04:46.180> necessarily<00:04:47.180> drawing<00:04:47.660> from<00:04:47.900> over

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
were necessarily drawing from over

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.600 
were necessarily drawing from over
another<00:04:48.440> but<00:04:48.680> I<00:04:48.800> think<00:04:49.010> there's<00:04:49.190> a<00:04:49.280> lot<00:04:49.430> of

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
another but I think there's a lot of

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.360 
another but I think there's a lot of
great<00:04:50.210> examples<00:04:50.690> of<00:04:50.810> free-to-play<00:04:51.230> and<00:04:51.620> how

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
great examples of free-to-play and how

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.190 
great examples of free-to-play and how
