00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.800
 I have the cake for here 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.360
 they are probably going to have to carry 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.150
 household or to do what 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.250

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:35.729
 etc over here 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.660
 you have to open a way to open this 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.660
 door 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:45.349

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:00.740
 look at the other side 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.190
