00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.429
 hello my name is top elena 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.340
 Vyacheslavovna 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.469
 I am a leading specialist clinic okay 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.000
 areas of therapeutic dentistry and 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.310
 endodontics including using 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.710
 laser technology broken 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.390
 tools in the channels is one of the most 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.220
 common complications after 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.920
 endodontic treatment 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.470
 earlier the problem of extraction of folk bodies 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.309
 and the dental canals were practically 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.809
 unsolvable but the situation has changed with 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.700
 the advent of microscopes 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.300
 multiply zoom technology 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.379
 allows you to extract the smallest fragments 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.489
 tools to go through complex channels and 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.100
 guarantee further absence 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.640
 relapses from breaking are removed by 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.620
 special ultrasonic nozzles 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.989
 let's start with why it happens so 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.660
 broken fragments remain in the channels 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.489
 tool tools may break 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.670
 in the channel in violation of technology 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.580
 cure for tool wear when 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.070
 complex anatomy of the canal and in the absence of 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.130
 necessary equipment and skills 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.619
 doctor presence of a foreign body in the channel 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.479
 requires compulsory treatment broken 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.820
 tools can provoke 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.310
 inflammatory processes as well as become 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.590
 cause the formation of cysts and destruction 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.340
 the walls of their channels consider concrete 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.320
 treatment examples from my practice 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.780
 A patient came to our clinic with 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.630
 complaints to 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.659
 and acute pain in the front teeth and 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.900
 acute inflammatory process before 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.390
 he went to several clinics 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.580
 where he was found huge 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.790
 cyst in the area of â€‹â€‹the two front teeth and 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.710
 the only treatment for this 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.380
 The situation has been suggested to remove these 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.830
 two teeth with along with cyst removal 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.440
 we diagnosed the presence of breaking 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.570
 channel tools that were not 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.100
 only within the root but went beyond 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.780
 top of the cyst cavity 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.759
 also diagnosed by 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.550
 huge cyst 13 by 15 millimeters 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.680
 two front and bob areas using 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.260
 microscope was removed fragment 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.720
 tools as seen in the fragments 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.620
 was 2 centimeters long and went away 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.220
 cyst cavity 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.989
 the tops of the channels were closed before the ore 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.050
 and on the same day was held 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:33.920
 surgical manipulation due 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.709
 that in the size of the cyst is huge 13 by 15 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.260
 millimeters and cyst of the eye 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.160
 filled with special bio compatible 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.730
 by material 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.570
 cool biologist here is the result we 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.780
 got as a result we saved 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.239
 patient patient's teeth remained very 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.640
 pleased with him nothing bothers 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.310
 next clinical case to us 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.030
 the patient turned whose tooth was treated 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.239
 about twenty years ago and in the channel was 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.010
 found here is such a wonderful 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.350
 a fragment that unfortunately led to 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.130
 severe inflammatory process in 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.859
 areas of the root apex and even already 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.780
 partially began to collapse rather we 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.940
 using a microscope to remove fragments 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.520
 tool claim but here's a look 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.210
 there is no channel in this picture 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.900
 tool 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.030
 well was exotic treated with 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.310
 laser application and reliably round rowan 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.350
 laser can reduce density 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.990
 microorganisms and bacteria in root 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.230
 channels are much more efficient than 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.670
 standard chemical solutions 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.980
 The following clinical cases are here at 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.560
 the channel had a silver pin on which 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.690
 previously a seal was fixed on 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.150
 darkened and the patient with this problem 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.160
 I came to the clinic for about an hour 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.200
 under the microscope using special 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.150
 ultrasonic nozzles had it 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.560
 gently retrieve since it is very 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.470
 soft and fragile 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.610
 here on this picture we see this 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.070
 silver pin 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.310
 together with a ruler its length is about 10 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.620
 millimeters but after removing the pin in 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.380
 the tooth will reveal a new surprise it was 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.560
 otlomok tools anticheskogo 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.040
 near the top of the root the fragment was also 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.190
 very fragile and we removed it by 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.980
 fragments 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.350
 here's how on this picture on 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.620
 next picture we see that in the channel 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.930
 there are no tools anymore I want to tell 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.690
 another case from my practice to me 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.419
 a patient has come across with acute pain 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.640
 in this case it turned out that as you see 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.580
 in the picture the tooth is under the crown 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.860
 the crown is fixed on the tab which 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.680
 located in the channel and behind the tip of the root 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.840
 we see a piece of the tool which 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.419
 caused cyst formation and 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.610
 corresponding to acute pain in a patient 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.120
 to solve the problem had to be removed 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.919
 crown take the tab from the channel using 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.890
 microscope remove fragments tool 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.390
 from the canal the channel was endodontic 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.370
 treated for ice cream 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.650
 and then re- made 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.870
 crown tab control 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.450
 snapshot after a year we see the full 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.730
 bone repair cyst no 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.370
 very important to preserve natural teeth 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.410
 then when it is possible progressive 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.750
 techniques materials technology today 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.760
 Avoid tooth extraction and 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.740
 conduct successful yes yes ethical 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.850
 treatment and most importantly get 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.850
 guaranteed result
