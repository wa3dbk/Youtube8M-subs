00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.150
 the benefits of pet therapy we 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.920
 talk about his listening it's funny that you 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.940
 puts it in context like that because 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.200
 yes I wanted to talk about the benefits of 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.880
 liquid nitrogen but more than anything 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.160
 did I want to praise the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.710
 animals that we merge well even if 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.769
 you can use the term pet therapy 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.760
 but it's mostly the fact that cursed 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.500
 sometimes it feels good to have a 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.490
 animal in his life and then actually less 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.490
 the reason I want to talk 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.689
 today because I do not want 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.980
 bad but not because even when 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.110
 I was younger but issued by is 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.059

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.079
 do not have to shit because I have 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.149
 embedded in the skate of the toy did not

 no when it's okay I sell language 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.379
 German and finally what context is going us 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.370
 lend because we see a job more stable and 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.140
 a given moment by force of always 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.550
 give it back at some point that brings you 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.079
 in the city of nowhere and then that 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.510
 political march until I 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.280
 meets an extraordinary woman who 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.960
 came with a package if I allow myself 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.449
 of skiing which is a labrador pitbull 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.359

 completely mad gaga lovers of this 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.729

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.869
 everything is a whole in a second other 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.840
 playing marquee putting a uncle

 bearded lizard this nasty beast a pretty 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.790
 brown as to the bearded dragons but that's 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.290
 yes, but it's a little strange me in 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.140
 my collar already has his request that what has 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.960
 done with a dragon barbules message so 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.490
 I get mail and we 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.720
 have taught us lots of things for 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.880
 I know that you had your bring to 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.110
 4 pm Caesar exactly but just 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.509
 to say by all and by all 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.649
 bearded dragon cantons twitter and learned 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.860
 yes it's my little king there he sees 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.490
 so slowly then auxerre and then the 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.590
 let their king of Asia exactly 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.030
 it's on a lamppost not right 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.380
 since I wanted to say since everything 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.969
 what ever since I got it's 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.130
 at the other to know passionate people and years 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.259
 as I am I threw myself into 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.239
 learning canine psychology 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.220
 to better understand them and obviously 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.970
 who says canine psychology says Caesar 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.290
 millan 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.420
 for those who do not know it's 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.620
 in thousand years Caesar is the reference to 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.750
 world among others must coach 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.260
 maybe you did not know but oprah 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.680
 winfrey and his oil and licked tom 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.270
 cruise jaden smith at the game named after 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.550
 it does not end it is the man of 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.520
 men the leader of the night pack understands 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.050
 really very very well licked enough 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.760
 fascinating me I stuffed myself with his 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.990
 books of his videos on youtube of his 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.490
 emissions because we call the man 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.450
 who whisper in the ear of dogs who 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.880
 is the man who whispered in his ear 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.260
 horses the dumpster and its 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.390
 men he taught several things 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.040
 on the dogs which in addition 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.840
 teach me things about me but 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.060
 it's true that I want to pass them 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.580
 because it's worth it show yes the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.200
 first thing I notice is that 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.130
 a dog goes first and foremost 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.050
 understand 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.760
 before you physically lie to him 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.220
 by the voice he will understand your energy 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.470
 but nec energy the universe is made 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.209
 in energy and therefore the tensions that you 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.610
 doors your dog they feel 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.140
 directly and adapts according to 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.270
 it turns out that a nice parallel in 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.650
 the daily that tensions that goes 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.230
 carry with other human beings they 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.510
 are going to feel their denials and to 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.980
 that moment will adapt to adapt to 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.130
 So you not that your attention 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.660
 the second thing is that in the 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.480
 pack it's either you're commenting on 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.700
 August on chip how to tame the head of 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.690
 the pack where you followed then what is 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.800
 very interesting in there is that 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.750
 this week just to take the 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.370
 responsibility for your happiness so as 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.019
 with your figure to the responsibility says 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.269
 I will become the leader of the beast pack 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.440
 can become in your next step the 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.209
 leader of your life already taking 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.150
 responsibility in another thing 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.970
 interesting also from Caesar and 10 actually 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.280
 peace with the dog be so if he 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.989
 say among others that is dominated by a 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.910
 cheese these biases it's correction 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.340
 recent safety downhill it's 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.500
 powerful devices a link in there 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.230
 because dominance equals security and 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.730
 galp and so made peace with tik tok 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.620
 and decides to change just do 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.180
 fly sweets like I'm sapiens who 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.380
 are made to be leader and a 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.060
 focus made to be with autonomous 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.560
 piano that are made to do 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:18.790
 other things in a year 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:20.139
 to accept himself which he basically 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.560
 the parallels that can be done me I 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.290
 think no 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.160
 these are our mails and our numbers m for 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.300
