00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
what I really like about it is it unlike

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.390 
what I really like about it is it unlike
concealer<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.659> has<00:01:17.080> like<00:01:17.380> light<00:01:17.680> reflective

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
concealer it has like light reflective

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
concealer it has like light reflective
kind<00:01:18.850> of<00:01:18.970> pigments<00:01:19.540> so<00:01:20.260> it's<00:01:20.950> shiny<00:01:21.730> but<00:01:22.240> not

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
kind of pigments so it's shiny but not

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.450 
kind of pigments so it's shiny but not
the<00:01:22.660> oily<00:01:23.050> kind<00:01:23.290> of<00:01:23.410> shiny<00:01:23.620> it<00:01:24.010> just<00:01:24.250> kind<00:01:24.430> of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
the oily kind of shiny it just kind of

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.550 
the oily kind of shiny it just kind of
reflects<00:01:24.940> light<00:01:25.180> up<00:01:25.450> it's<00:01:26.020> hard<00:01:26.230> to<00:01:26.350> describe

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
reflects light up it's hard to describe

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.590 
reflects light up it's hard to describe
unless<00:01:27.010> you<00:01:27.160> see<00:01:27.370> it<00:01:27.400> in<00:01:27.550> person<00:01:27.730> but<00:01:28.450> it's

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
unless you see it in person but it's

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.060 
unless you see it in person but it's
really<00:01:28.960> gorgeous<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:29.590> so<00:01:29.680> that's<00:01:29.830> why<00:01:30.010> it

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
really gorgeous and so that's why it

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.540 
really gorgeous and so that's why it
works<00:01:30.310> so<00:01:30.430> well<00:01:30.610> on<00:01:31.120> like<00:01:32.050> your<00:01:32.200> under<00:01:32.500> eye

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
works so well on like your under eye

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.360 
works so well on like your under eye
because<00:01:33.550> it<00:01:33.820> just<00:01:34.800> it<00:01:35.800> just<00:01:35.860> completely

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
because it just it just completely

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.490 
because it just it just completely
covers<00:01:36.880> everything<00:01:37.360> up<00:01:37.690> but<00:01:38.080> then<00:01:38.260> makes

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
covers everything up but then makes

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.650 
covers everything up but then makes
everything<00:01:38.830> just<00:01:38.980> a<00:01:39.190> little<00:01:39.340> brighter<00:01:39.670> so

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
everything just a little brighter so

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.600 
everything just a little brighter so
that's<00:01:41.170> one<00:01:41.560> of<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.740> reasons<00:01:42.040> that<00:01:42.100> I<00:01:42.190> love<00:01:42.250> it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610

show you how to do this and not the
foundation<00:06:53.880> afterwards<00:06:54.330> this<00:06:55.260> will<00:06:55.500> be<00:06:55.650> a<00:06:55.680> lot

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:55.890 
foundation afterwards this will be a lot

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:01.970 
foundation afterwards this will be a lot
lighter<00:06:56.100> than<00:06:56.840> my<00:06:57.840> skin<00:07:00.320> so<00:07:01.320> as<00:07:01.500> you<00:07:01.530> can<00:07:01.770> see

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980 
lighter than my skin so as you can see

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.040 
lighter than my skin so as you can see
that<00:07:02.130> almost<00:07:02.340> completely<00:07:03.180> gets<00:07:03.420> rid<00:07:03.660> of<00:07:03.690> the

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
that almost completely gets rid of the

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.270 
that almost completely gets rid of the
dark<00:07:04.500> circles<00:07:05.690> just<00:07:06.690> do<00:07:06.870> the<00:07:06.930> seas

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 
dark circles just do the seas

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:18.010 
dark circles just do the seas
the<00:07:09.550> underside<00:07:10.680> and<00:07:11.680> a<00:07:11.920> little<00:07:12.250> bit<00:07:12.400> more

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.090 

just

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.100 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.460 

like<00:07:21.700> that<00:07:21.970> and<00:07:22.420> remember<00:07:22.690> to<00:07:22.930> get<00:07:23.110> it<00:07:23.230> right

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:23.470 
like that and remember to get it right

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.920 
like that and remember to get it right
into<00:07:23.650> here<00:07:24.160> because<00:07:24.880> that's<00:07:25.120> also<00:07:25.570> where<00:07:25.900> a

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:25.930 
into here because that's also where a

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.580 
into here because that's also where a
lot<00:07:26.260> of<00:07:26.290> Darkness<00:07:26.770> occurs<00:07:27.130> and<00:07:28.410> then<00:07:29.410> the

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:29.590 
lot of Darkness occurs and then the

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.380 
lot of Darkness occurs and then the
optional<00:07:30.040> step<00:07:30.310> is<00:07:30.490> to<00:07:30.700> cover<00:07:30.910> it<00:07:31.090> with<00:07:31.210> any

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:31.390 
optional step is to cover it with any

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.420 
optional step is to cover it with any
kind<00:07:31.630> of<00:07:31.780> translucent<00:07:32.230> powder<00:07:32.620> or<00:07:33.100> face

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:37.690 
powder I'm going to be using powder

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.750 
powder I'm going to be using powder
flage<00:07:38.050> by<00:07:38.320> benefits<00:07:38.920> looks<00:07:39.760> like<00:07:39.970> that<00:07:41.640> and<00:07:42.640> it

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:42.760 
flage by benefits looks like that and it

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:50.610 
flage by benefits looks like that and it
