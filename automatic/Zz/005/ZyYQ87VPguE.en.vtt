00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.720
 I'm in a workplace where they do 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.920
 good creations where they do 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.049
 creations they deal there and has a 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.580
 very interesting very artistic product 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.650
 but as he had said from the beginning 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.590
 it's practical that we 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.130
 women do not use all the time all 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.859
 the days of necessity and also according to 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.929
 she tells me her product is very apt 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.650
 for men it is also called the spinning wheel 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:34.720
 the brand of bags that produces lidia and 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.489
 also is already venturing into other 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.650
 products for their talent and of course 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.160
 to create by designing because she herself 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.790
 accepted but everything 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.440
 lydia tell me when you were born born late 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.600
 in his life it was an idea that always 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.810
 always had as a concern of 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.420
 do something or it was an accident 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.600
 Well, actually I think that one 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.530
 always have ideas of becoming what 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.110
 What happened is that I did not know what to do 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.700
 at a certain moment consider me 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.460
 I was taking time that I could 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.509
 Take advantage of giving more because always 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.000
 we can give more and this one if the idea came out 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.000
 to make some sachets for a 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.369
 conscious gift of my husband but 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.700
 he did not want to give gift bags 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.640
 those that we all know that I wanted 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.250
 give and make the same 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.460
 bags of jute bags with things 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.280
 very traditional very rich and when 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.890
 we gave the gift this was very 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.080
 nice because to those who gave it to them 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.750
 he liked it quite a lot, they even told us 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.240
 we had pushed him back like a few 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.340
 years in time they did not imagine that 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.920
 they were going to receive a thousand cars and candies and 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.920
 all national truth a lot and tail 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.180
 I like to work on youtube because I think 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.510
 that I identify with being 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.450
 Costa Rican with youtube and why not 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.120
 it's something that all people are 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.459
 working the jute in reality this is 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.310
 see little and in the design that I am 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.840
 doing currently is very little for not 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.190
 say that almost only I am 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.950
 working to design I've truly done the 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.200
 bags are very diverse can be used 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.030
 for different things let's say there are bags 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.069
 small for women who like 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.560
 small and there are also large bags 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.010
 for people who are even 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.019
 executives who want to carry their laptop 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.599
 are designed precisely so that 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.359
 fit a laptop and so one is not 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.430
 attracting the attention of thieves 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.730
 with the exact case that is for the 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.730
 laptop 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.270
 for me the designs are like very much to me 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.530
 taste because they are very natural are 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.980
 earth colors and the texture of 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.740
 bags is very nice to touch your skin 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.620
 because I've already loaded it with meaning and 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.860
 it's nice to feel the fabric is not not 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.110
 one spraying with something synthetic very 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.730
 natural apart with jute also 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.210
 we have represented the coast cafe 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:58.050
 rich so the product 100% to the optical 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:01.080
 and that is this idea that people 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:05.220
 know that you experience using it and 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.290
 You will see that it is very comfortable and one feels 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.660
 also very attractive using her 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.380
 product because in fact it looks so pretty 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.049
 and very feminine true but in the case of 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.940
 men and she throws some 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.220
 more masculine style how to get to 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.550
 punk a woman and what happened 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.010
 Of course this a meeting I belong to 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.190
 a group of ladies creative hands of 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.340
 crown and through the municipality 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.170
 of this they summoned some executives 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.940
 from the bank for a meeting that 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.220
 knew the products of all 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.310
 ladies that we are in vices 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.110
 and well, I had the great happiness that 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.600
 the executives of the bank called them the 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.030
 attention my product seemed good and 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.130
 nice then from there they 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.580
 this is why they have me working 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:56.330
 currently and thanks to them thanks to 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.340
 them and it's like telling him I had the idea 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.560
 I was and I'm developing but one 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.810
 always need to say a 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.140
 really push that's where 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.350
 Banca arrives woman and tells me her product 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.090
 it's good and they give me the push that I 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.160
 I need initially with a 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.260
 financing to buy a machine 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.930
 industrial no longer as a landlady to 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.080
 that the product has a better finish and 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.180
 after that they continue this with me 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.510

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.510

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.640
 super important the work that they 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.980
 they are doing while helping many 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.900

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.150

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.840
 lady and give her that support true that one 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.060
