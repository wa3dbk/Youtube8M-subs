00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.719
 I'm back with a new video recipe 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.549
 forgive the cracking face but I am 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.000
 burned in the sun in the morning while 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.550
 the expense and have no one want to 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.050
 exploit them to make the video part of the 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.869
 small premise 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.300
 today I propose the savory muffin col 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.910
 cooked ham and that 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.460
 cheese slices as I say at the end of the video 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.610
 I recommend putting less cheese slices 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.710
 because I noticed that two slices are 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.380
 a little too many tend to come out during the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.410
 cooking and of course for those in third grade 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.180
 phase can put the cheese you use 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.520
 usually navigated in small pieces 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.840
 very small I hope the video recipe 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:55.430
 you like the release process 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.780
 the ingredients play 2 whole eggs 75 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.150
 grams of milk powder 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.410
 or neutral proteins I deliver on 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:10.100
 milk powder 30 grams of flour 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:14.960
 gluten 4 grams of guar salt half 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.210
 baking powder sachet 5 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.240
 they will give parmesan if you don't have it 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.710
 does not do a sprinkling of oregano 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:28.280
 and a little bit of black pepper for the shelf I 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.140
 I'll use some dried tomatoes from the 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.280
 cooked ham cut into small pieces 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.380
 very small and 2 slices is that 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.100
 first of all, break the proceedings 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.100
 eggs in a bowl 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.570
 add the salt and the parmesan aroma 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:08.370
 and fit well now add a little bit 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.370
 pepper 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.860
 a sprinkling of oregano 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.580
 this also two wanting a half packet 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.580
 of yeast 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:48.879
 and mix well now add the wire 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.879
 pierced gluten and powdered milk 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:05.480
 now with the help of a spoon 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:08.950
 incorporate the cooked ham and who and 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.950
 the slices cut into squares 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.120
 now take molds for masin e 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.920
 pour in a spoonful of 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.590
 compound obviously trying not to 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.420
 exceed half 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:41.070
 otherwise they will come out during 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:44.430
 baking now bake at 180 degrees for 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.260
 about 20 minutes past twenty minutes 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.770
 obviously check the cooking with 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.290
 a toothpick if necessary cook 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.050
 in other words 5 10 minutes depending on the 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.710
 your shape here is this the 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.710
 final results 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.000
 I recommend putting less cheese slices 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.570
 however try to put it more 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.590
 inside possible because as you see 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.590
 tends to go out a little 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.910
 I assure you they are very soft and 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.910
 very good to the next hello recipe
