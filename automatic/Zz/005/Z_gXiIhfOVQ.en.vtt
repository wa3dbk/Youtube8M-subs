00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
most important note for you to know is

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.560 
most important note for you to know is
the<00:01:10.390> root<00:01:10.540> note<00:01:14.730> if<00:01:15.730> you're<00:01:15.940> playing<00:01:16.180> over<00:01:16.540> a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
the root note if you're playing over a

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.380 
the root note if you're playing over a
chord<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.620> root<00:01:17.830> note<00:01:18.070> would<00:01:18.580> name<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.120> chord

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
chord the root note would name the chord

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.580 
chord the root note would name the chord
so<00:01:20.050> over<00:01:20.320> an<00:01:20.410> E<00:01:20.590> chord

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
so over an E chord

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.910 
so over an E chord
rude<00:01:23.250> note<00:01:23.490> would<00:01:23.789> be<00:01:23.939> an<00:01:24.060> e<00:01:24.240> note

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.190 

which<00:01:27.520> repeats<00:01:28.030> itself<00:01:28.390> up<00:01:28.659> and<00:01:28.900> down<00:01:29.050> the

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
which repeats itself up and down the

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:43.859 
which repeats itself up and down the
neck<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:42.159> root<00:01:42.369> note<00:01:42.580> also<00:01:42.880> names<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.540> key<00:01:43.720> of

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
neck the root note also names the key of

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:52.560 
neck the root note also names the key of
music<00:01:44.290> so<00:01:44.860> in<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.070> key<00:01:45.250> of<00:01:45.280> E

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.150 

for<00:01:53.570> now<00:01:53.720> we<00:01:54.140> will<00:01:54.260> start<00:01:54.560> out<00:01:54.710> simple<00:01:54.950> and

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
for now we will start out simple and

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.110 
for now we will start out simple and
only<00:01:56.150> play<00:01:56.420> over<00:01:56.810> individual<00:01:57.440> chords<00:01:57.940> this<00:01:58.940> is

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
only play over individual chords this is

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.180 
only play over individual chords this is
for<00:01:59.300> the<00:01:59.390> sake<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.840> beginner<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:00.890> we<00:02:01.010> can

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
for the sake of the beginner so we can

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.060 
for the sake of the beginner so we can
start<00:02:01.520> easy<00:02:02.210> but<00:02:03.110> also<00:02:03.320> have<00:02:03.650> a<00:02:03.680> solid

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
start easy but also have a solid
