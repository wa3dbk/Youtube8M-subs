I<00:00:58.289> shoot<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.190> used<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.609> do<00:00:59.789> all

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
I shoot it this is what I used to do all

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.299 
I shoot it this is what I used to do all
the<00:01:00.090> time<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.660> back<00:01:01.230> when<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.649> cameras<00:01:02.070> were

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the time but back when the cameras were

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.969 
the time but back when the cameras were
not<00:01:02.340> as<00:01:02.910> advanced<00:01:03.690> didn't<00:01:04.500> take<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:04.739> long<00:01:04.920> to

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
not as advanced didn't take as long to

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.590 
not as advanced didn't take as long to
transfer<00:01:05.519> footage<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.000> convert<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
transfer footage and convert it and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.170 
transfer footage and convert it and
stuff<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.340> taking<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.820> long<00:01:09.000> time

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
stuff so this is just taking a long time

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.760 
stuff so this is just taking a long time
which<00:01:09.510> makes<00:01:09.750> me<00:01:09.840> wonder<00:01:09.930> would<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:10.530> better

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
which makes me wonder would it be better

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.679 
which makes me wonder would it be better
to<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.220> use<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> crappy<00:01:11.760> camera<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.420> my<00:01:12.510> main

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
to just use a crappy camera for my main

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.899 
to just use a crappy camera for my main
channel<00:01:12.900> videos<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.590> don't<00:01:14.430> think<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.700> because

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
channel videos I don't think so because

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.820 
channel videos I don't think so because
who's<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.689> say<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.140> will<00:01:16.320> turn<00:01:16.470> out<00:01:16.619> any

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
who's to say if this will turn out any

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.890 
who's to say if this will turn out any
better<00:01:17.070> than<00:01:17.250> what<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.460> normally<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:18.090> better<00:01:18.600> is

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
better than what I normally do better is

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.499 
better than what I normally do better is
in<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> eye<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.799> beholder<00:01:20.390> dealing<00:01:21.390> with

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
in the eye of the beholder dealing with

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.240 
in the eye of the beholder dealing with
this<00:01:21.630> split<00:01:22.049> screen<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> Sun<00:01:22.950> keeps

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
this split screen and the Sun keeps

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
this split screen and the Sun keeps
going<00:01:23.880> behind<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.330> clouds<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.930> coming<00:01:25.320> out

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
going behind the clouds and coming out

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.840 
going behind the clouds and coming out
of<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.619> clouds<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.130> changing<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> lighting

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
of the clouds and changing the lighting

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.149 
of the clouds and changing the lighting
and<00:01:27.150> it's<00:01:27.240> making<00:01:27.600> me<00:01:27.720> crazy<00:01:27.950> not<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.070> i

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
and it's making me crazy not that i

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.770 
and it's making me crazy not that i
