Cattin<00:01:15.330> bumblebee<00:01:15.810> when<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> first<00:01:16.320> saw<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
Cattin bumblebee when I first saw the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.870 
Cattin bumblebee when I first saw the
pictures<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.040> thought<00:01:17.250> maybe<00:01:17.460> they<00:01:17.700> did

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
pictures I thought maybe they did

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.770 
pictures I thought maybe they did
something<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.299> make<00:01:18.479> Sam<00:01:18.810> fit<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.320> there<00:01:19.530> but

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
something to make Sam fit in there but

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.760 
something to make Sam fit in there but
nope<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.990> mean<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.200> guess<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.470> could<00:01:22.500> probably

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
nope I mean I guess you could probably

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.219 
nope I mean I guess you could probably
cram<00:01:23.400> em<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.820> there<00:01:25.580> but<00:01:26.580> not<00:01:26.729> really<00:01:27.229> and

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
cram em in there but not really and

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.730 
cram em in there but not really and
obviously<00:01:28.560> way<00:01:29.250> out<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.790> scale<00:01:30.380> but<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.590> a

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
obviously way out of scale but it's a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.649 
obviously way out of scale but it's a
nice<00:01:31.890> looking<00:01:32.220> bumblebee<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> colors

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
on him a lot my way thinks it's boring

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.850 
on him a lot my way thinks it's boring
but<00:01:35.759> i<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.600> like<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.930> his<00:01:37.079> little<00:01:37.409> design

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860

is the same thing as the patch there's
also<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.880> little<00:01:42.060> patch<00:01:42.329> design<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.960> him<00:01:43.110> too<00:01:43.320> so

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.720 
troubled transforming him mainly because
I've<00:02:16.440> never<00:02:16.680> looked<00:02:16.890> at<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.160> directions<00:02:17.460> for

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730

I've never looked at the directions for
canon<00:02:18.150> bumblebee<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:19.730> that's<00:02:20.730> probably<00:02:20.970> my

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
canon bumblebee so that's probably my

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.560 
canon bumblebee so that's probably my
own<00:02:21.590> stupid<00:02:22.590> though<00:02:23.630> I<00:02:26.240> glanced<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.390> this

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
own stupid though I glanced it this

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.390 
own stupid though I glanced it this
one's<00:02:27.780> just<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.200> see<00:02:28.380> if<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.560> said<00:02:28.770> anything

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
one's just to see if it said anything

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.400 
one's just to see if it said anything
about<00:02:30.740> how<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.800> make<00:02:32.130> him<00:02:32.310> hold<00:02:32.690> back<00:02:33.690> fire<00:02:34.050> but

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
about how to make him hold back fire but

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.740 
about how to make him hold back fire but
it<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.740> just<00:02:35.010> same<00:02:35.520> old<00:02:35.790> directions<00:02:36.300> backfires

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750

the way I think I don't know but we'll

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.720 
the way I think I don't know but we'll
find<00:03:20.910> out<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.390> guess<00:03:21.570> maybe<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.890> feel<00:03:23.580> like

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730

kmart<00:03:27.750> exclusive<00:03:28.320> I<00:03:28.590> think<00:03:29.160> we're<00:03:29.280> also<00:03:29.460> going

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.450 
kmart exclusive I think we're also going
to<00:03:30.000> get<00:03:30.270> sideswipe<00:03:31.190> with<00:03:32.190> i<00:03:32.690> want<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.780> say<00:03:34.460> ice

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.940 
to get sideswipe with i want to say ice
pick<00:03:35.880> but<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:36.720> doesn't<00:03:36.930> seem<00:03:37.050> right<00:03:37.110> I<00:03:37.350> think

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
pick but that doesn't seem right I think

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.220

that's<00:03:38.070> what<00:03:38.250> I've<00:03:38.370> seen<00:03:38.690> but<00:03:39.690> maybe<00:03:40.050> I'm

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
that's what I've seen but maybe I'm

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.080 
that's what I've seen but maybe I'm

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
bumblebee it's in my opinion maybe the

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.900 
bumblebee it's in my opinion maybe the
second<00:06:07.390> weakest<00:06:07.810> of<00:06:08.020> the<00:06:08.260> bumblebee<00:06:09.130> molds

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
second weakest of the bumblebee molds

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.470 
second weakest of the bumblebee molds
but<00:06:10.060> he<00:06:10.210> looks<00:06:10.390> very<00:06:10.720> cool<00:06:11.020> like<00:06:11.290> this<00:06:12.300> and<00:06:13.300> you

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
but he looks very cool like this and you

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.760 
but he looks very cool like this and you
get<00:06:13.630> the<00:06:13.720> little<00:06:13.840> patch<00:06:14.110> whether<00:06:14.410> you<00:06:14.590> like

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.990 
that or not I think the patch cool and
you<00:06:17.890> get<00:06:18.070> sim<00:06:18.340> but<00:06:18.670> you<00:06:18.850> know<00:06:18.970> whatever<00:06:19.150> so<00:06:19.810> if
