00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hey folks map remote of the image here

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.130 
hey folks map remote of the image here
so<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:02.790> big<00:00:02.939> news<00:00:03.090> in<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.449> world<00:00:03.629> today<00:00:03.899> is

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
so the big news in the world today is

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.020 
so the big news in the world today is
the<00:00:04.589> Nikon<00:00:05.130> d4<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.080> d800<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.610> basically<00:00:08.610> a

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
the Nikon d4 and d800 and basically a

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.610 
the Nikon d4 and d800 and basically a
lot<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.690> people<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.019> think<00:00:10.050> are<00:00:10.349> trying<00:00:10.559> to

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
lot of people I think are trying to

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.440 
lot of people I think are trying to
decide<00:00:10.889> do<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.190> need<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.370> d4<00:00:11.790> or<00:00:11.940> do<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.120> need<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.360> be

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
decide do I need a d4 or do I need to be

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.999 
decide do I need a d4 or do I need to be
800<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.990> lot<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.230> people<00:00:13.469> would<00:00:13.559> probably<00:00:13.889> like

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
800 a lot of people would probably like

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.799 
800 a lot of people would probably like
to<00:00:14.040> buy<00:00:14.219> both<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.580> them<00:00:14.849> but<00:00:15.389> if<00:00:15.540> you're<00:00:15.660> like

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
to buy both of them but if you're like

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.080 
to buy both of them but if you're like
me<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.139> can<00:00:16.320> only<00:00:16.379> afford<00:00:16.590> one<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.520> them<00:00:17.880> and

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
me you can only afford one of them and

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.689 
me you can only afford one of them and
so<00:00:18.810> I'd<00:00:18.900> like<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.050> just<00:00:19.260> clarify<00:00:19.650> what<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> big

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
so I'd like to just clarify what the big

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.779 
so I'd like to just clarify what the big
differences<00:00:21.420> are<00:00:21.689> between<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.500> two<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:23.070> all

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
differences are between the two in all

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.630 
differences are between the two in all
in<00:00:24.060> all<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.660> focus<00:00:25.109> systems<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.010> bodies<00:00:26.460> and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
in all the focus systems the bodies and

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.070 
in all the focus systems the bodies and
whatnot<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.180> these<00:00:27.390> two<00:00:27.570> cameras<00:00:27.960> are

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
whatnot on these two cameras are

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.589 
whatnot on these two cameras are
virtually<00:00:28.619> identical<00:00:28.650> bill<00:00:29.640> quality<00:00:30.210> say<00:00:30.420> my

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
virtually identical bill quality say my

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.920 
virtually identical bill quality say my
AF<00:00:31.109> system<00:00:31.650> all<00:00:32.430> those<00:00:32.700> type<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:32.940> things

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
AF system all those type of things

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.740 
AF system all those type of things
the<00:00:34.260> big<00:00:34.500> three<00:00:34.980> reasons<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.329> think<00:00:36.420> you

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the big three reasons that I think you

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.100 
the big three reasons that I think you
would<00:00:36.930> choose<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.170> d4<00:00:37.710> over<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> d800<00:00:39.180> are<00:00:39.390> I'll

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
would choose a d4 over a d800 are I'll

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.750 
would choose a d4 over a d800 are I'll
lay<00:00:40.350> em<00:00:40.469> out<00:00:40.559> for<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.280> first<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:41.730> is

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
lay em out for you here the first one is

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.690 
lay em out for you here the first one is
obviously<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.480> sensor<00:00:42.840> 16<00:00:43.620> megapixel<00:00:44.309> sensor

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
obviously the sensor 16 megapixel sensor

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.060 
obviously the sensor 16 megapixel sensor
has<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> native<00:00:46.140> high<00:00:46.559> ISO<00:00:46.980> range<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.550> 102

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
has a native high ISO range of 102

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.000 
has a native high ISO range of 102
12,800<00:00:50.070> with<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> high<00:00:51.059> -<00:00:51.480> boost<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.410> two

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
12,800 with a high - boost of two

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
12,800 with a high - boost of two
hundred<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.489> four<00:00:53.789> thousand<00:00:54.329> eight<00:00:54.539> hundred

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
hundred and four thousand eight hundred

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.920 
hundred and four thousand eight hundred
so<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.190> my<00:00:56.340> cons<00:00:56.610> high<00:00:56.910> iso<00:00:57.390> flagship

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
so this is my cons high iso flagship

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.200 
so this is my cons high iso flagship
from<00:00:58.829> all<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> samples<00:00:59.489> i've<00:00:59.640> seen<00:00:59.850> from<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
from all the samples i've seen from the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.490 
from all the samples i've seen from the
testing<00:01:00.629> i've<00:01:00.780> seen<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.140> from<00:01:01.289> what<00:01:01.379> i've

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
testing i've seen and from what i've

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.340 
testing i've seen and from what i've
heard<00:01:01.530> people<00:01:01.829> saying<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:03.120> camera<00:01:03.660> will<00:01:03.960> be

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
heard people saying this camera will be

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.160 
heard people saying this camera will be
equal<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.189> d3<00:01:05.640> s<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:06.210> far<00:01:06.510> as<00:01:06.600> high<00:01:06.750> iso

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
equal to the d3 s as far as high iso

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.590 
equal to the d3 s as far as high iso
image<00:01:07.500> quality<00:01:07.710> if<00:01:08.220> not<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.880> little<00:01:09.119> bit<00:01:09.390> better

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
image quality if not a little bit better

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.380 
image quality if not a little bit better
maybe<00:01:09.840> half<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> stop<00:01:10.560> or<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> stop<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.390> you

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
maybe half a stop or a stop and you

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.350 
maybe half a stop or a stop and you
still<00:01:12.630> get<00:01:12.720> an<00:01:12.840> extra<00:01:13.110> 4<00:01:13.320> megapixels<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
still get an extra 4 megapixels so the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.719 
still get an extra 4 megapixels so the
big<00:01:15.600> thing<00:01:16.110> there<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.799> sensor<00:01:17.159> obviously

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
big thing there is the sensor obviously

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.740 
big thing there is the sensor obviously
a<00:01:17.759> different<00:01:18.270> sensor<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.930> 16<00:01:19.770> megapixels<00:01:20.520> and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
a different sensor and 16 megapixels and

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.859 
a different sensor and 16 megapixels and
number<00:01:21.750> two<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.350> frames<00:01:23.130> per<00:01:23.369> second<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
number two is frames per second so the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.950 
number two is frames per second so the
d4<00:01:25.470> does<00:01:25.740> 10<00:01:26.220> frames<00:01:26.549> per<00:01:26.759> second<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.240> that's

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
d4 does 10 frames per second and that's

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.950 
d4 does 10 frames per second and that's
in<00:01:28.110> comparison<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.979> d800<00:01:29.640> 4<00:01:30.390> frames<00:01:30.720> per

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
in comparison to the d800 4 frames per

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.380 
in comparison to the d800 4 frames per
second<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:32.159> you're<00:01:32.700> somebody<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.119> shoots

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
second so if you're somebody that shoots

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.899 
second so if you're somebody that shoots
a<00:01:33.479> lot<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.720> sports<00:01:34.049> or<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.470> lot<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.070> fast-moving

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
a lot of sports or a lot of fast-moving

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.050 
a lot of sports or a lot of fast-moving
things<00:01:36.329> where<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.600> need<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.430> shoot<00:01:38.430> fast<00:01:38.759> have

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
things where you need to shoot fast have

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.700 
things where you need to shoot fast have
a<00:01:39.090> high<00:01:39.270> frame<00:01:39.540> per<00:01:39.750> second<00:01:40.229> rate<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.500> want<00:01:40.590> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
a high frame per second rate you want a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.520 
a high frame per second rate you want a
machine<00:01:41.070> gun<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.400> they<00:01:41.549> say<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.869> d4<00:01:43.320> is

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
machine gun as they say then the d4 is

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.710 
machine gun as they say then the d4 is
your<00:01:43.770> camera<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> fair<00:01:44.670> bit<00:01:44.880> faster<00:01:45.390> 10

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
your camera it's a fair bit faster 10

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.679 
your camera it's a fair bit faster 10
versus<00:01:46.200> 4<00:01:46.530> frames<00:01:46.829> per<00:01:47.070> second<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.360> third

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
versus 4 frames per second the third

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.020 
versus 4 frames per second the third
thing<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.229> big<00:01:49.500> big<00:01:49.710> difference<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.310> these

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
thing the big big difference on these

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.810 
thing the big big difference on these
cameras<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.590> d4<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> bigger

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
cameras is that the d4 is a bigger

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.100 
cameras is that the d4 is a bigger
heavier<00:01:54.509> camera<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:56.540> basically<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:57.930> got

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
heavier camera and basically it's got

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.020 
heavier camera and basically it's got
like<00:01:58.259> what<00:01:58.469> we<00:01:58.590> would<00:01:58.710> call<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.920> built-in<00:01:59.579> grip

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
like what we would call a built-in grip

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.700 
like what we would call a built-in grip
whereas<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.479> d800<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.229> have<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.469> get<00:02:01.619> an

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
whereas the d800 you have to get an

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.510 
whereas the d800 you have to get an
accessory<00:02:02.280> grip<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:03.090> get<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.450> vertical<00:02:04.520> and

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
accessory grip to get that vertical and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.300 
accessory grip to get that vertical and
horizontal<00:02:06.290> shutter<00:02:07.290> situation<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.160> be<00:02:08.250> able

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
horizontal shutter situation to be able

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.040 
horizontal shutter situation to be able
to<00:02:08.459> spin<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.819> camera<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.270> stuff<00:02:09.450> an<00:02:09.690> extra

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
to spin the camera and stuff an extra

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.670 
to spin the camera and stuff an extra
trigger<00:02:10.400> and<00:02:11.720> basically<00:02:12.720> it's<00:02:13.140> light

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
trigger and basically it's light

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.100 
trigger and basically it's light
and<00:02:13.950> smaller<00:02:14.370> on<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.670> 800<00:02:15.239> bigger<00:02:15.780> and

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and smaller on the 800 bigger and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.380 
and smaller on the 800 bigger and
heavier<00:02:16.290> on<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.739> D<00:02:17.040> for<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.640> lot<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.150> people

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
heavier on the D for a lot of people

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.699 
heavier on the D for a lot of people
actually<00:02:18.569> prefer<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.260> bigger<00:02:19.470> heavier

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
actually prefer the bigger heavier

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.550 
actually prefer the bigger heavier
cameras<00:02:20.400> because<00:02:20.819> they<00:02:21.360> feel<00:02:21.959> they<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.319> hold

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
cameras because they feel they can hold

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.160 
cameras because they feel they can hold
them<00:02:22.769> from<00:02:23.610> lower<00:02:24.269> shutter<00:02:24.599> speeds<00:02:24.930> better

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
them from lower shutter speeds better

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.470 
them from lower shutter speeds better
and<00:02:25.409> the<00:02:25.950> weight<00:02:26.250> gives<00:02:26.519> them<00:02:26.730> some<00:02:26.909> half<00:02:27.150> of

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
and the weight gives them some half of

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.259 
and the weight gives them some half of
the<00:02:27.540> camera<00:02:27.900> myself<00:02:28.620> I'm<00:02:29.129> probably<00:02:29.459> more<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:30.090> a

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
the camera myself I'm probably more of a

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.750 
the camera myself I'm probably more of a
lighter<00:02:30.870> camera<00:02:31.769> guy<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:31.950> like<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.459> smaller

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
lighter camera guy I like the smaller

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.910 
lighter camera guy I like the smaller
lighter<00:02:33.120> cameras<00:02:33.629> these<00:02:33.780> days<00:02:33.840> but<00:02:34.620> it's<00:02:34.829> a

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
lighter cameras these days but it's a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.800 
lighter cameras these days but it's a
personal<00:02:35.340> preference<00:02:35.579> so<00:02:36.269> those<00:02:36.420> are<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.629> big

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
personal preference so those are the big

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.309 
personal preference so those are the big
three<00:02:37.349> reasons<00:02:37.890> big<00:02:38.760> three<00:02:39.120> differences<00:02:39.629> that

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
three reasons big three differences that

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.429 
three reasons big three differences that
you<00:02:40.890> might<00:02:41.129> choose<00:02:41.909> the<00:02:42.060> D<00:02:42.239> for<00:02:42.510> over<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.930> 800

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
you might choose the D for over the 800

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.129 
you might choose the D for over the 800
the<00:02:43.769> first<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.370> sensor<00:02:44.790> 16<00:02:45.359> megapixels

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
the first is the sensor 16 megapixels

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.250 
the first is the sensor 16 megapixels
high<00:02:46.799> ISO<00:02:47.579> sensor<00:02:48.090> king<00:02:48.599> of<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.840> hill<00:02:48.989> high

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
high ISO sensor king of the hill high

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.770 
high ISO sensor king of the hill high
ISO<00:02:49.829> it's<00:02:50.670> going<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.849> be<00:02:50.940> on<00:02:51.060> par<00:02:51.329> with<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:51.569> new

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
ISO it's going to be on par with the new

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.420 
ISO it's going to be on par with the new
Canon<00:02:52.139> flagship<00:02:52.560> if<00:02:52.799> not<00:02:53.010> better

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
Canon flagship if not better

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.720 
Canon flagship if not better
and<00:02:53.579> basically<00:02:54.510> 16<00:02:55.409> megapixels<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.159> plenty

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
and basically 16 megapixels is plenty

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.030 
and basically 16 megapixels is plenty
for<00:02:57.420> just<00:02:58.049> about<00:02:58.109> anything<00:02:58.620> you're<00:02:58.920> doing

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
for just about anything you're doing

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.729 
for just about anything you're doing
except<00:02:59.489> perhaps<00:02:59.670> studio<00:03:00.269> works<00:03:00.569> so<00:03:00.930> the

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
except perhaps studio works so the

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.119 
except perhaps studio works so the
sensor<00:03:02.159> and<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:03.510> high<00:03:03.659> ISO<00:03:04.079> qualities<00:03:04.650> the

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
sensor and the high ISO qualities the

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.490 
sensor and the high ISO qualities the
second<00:03:05.819> thing<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.420> frames<00:03:06.659> per<00:03:06.870> second<00:03:07.290> 10

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
second thing is the frames per second 10

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.619 
second thing is the frames per second 10
frames<00:03:07.799> per<00:03:07.889> second<00:03:08.430> very<00:03:08.700> fast<00:03:09.030> camera<00:03:09.329> and

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
frames per second very fast camera and

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.020 
frames per second very fast camera and
the<00:03:10.049> third<00:03:10.319> thing<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.340> size<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:11.819> weight

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
the third thing is the size and weight

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.030 
the third thing is the size and weight
the<00:03:12.480> d4<00:03:12.959> is<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.709> heavier<00:03:14.159> more<00:03:15.530> larger<00:03:16.530> camera

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
the d4 is the heavier more larger camera

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.490 
the d4 is the heavier more larger camera
so<00:03:17.310> bigger<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.209> heavier<00:03:18.329> so<00:03:18.959> thanks<00:03:19.440> for

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
so bigger and heavier so thanks for
