00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.370
 We would like to explain it a little ng example of I motion track is Now 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:10.690
 I will 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:16.150
 This kind of track point of it is just Well what colors are good 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:20.510
 I told you to track what you're good at luminance and rgb a little 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:24.320
 For example, even surprisingly hard to say where this kind of range is wide 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:29.920
 For example, if you go out here, it's blue. 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.920
 I'm general to have Oite but let this little fun 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:42.060
 I'll track now I'm tracking for a while, but the range is very extensive 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.910
 I do not have me to tracking as a cut line of sight Netsumari came the scope of this Blue 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.760
 You move unexpectedly to where you are 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:53.550
 I think it is out of sync 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:57.629
 So the target is as wide as possible but not positive 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:03.600
 Or I have to put it together well in such a place like a store 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:06.940
 There is a point that you move in the same color in these same places 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.380
 See you again 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:14.710
 Similar colors occur at track points 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.280
 Or It is the way of the track point 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.340
 Let's actually go in the case where there is an obstacle ahead 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.330
 Such things may be caught unexpectedly 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.909
 For example this is this part I will try tracking for a while 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:32.399
 Yes 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.329
 Truckee has been reviving the house safely but there are obstacles similar color ahead 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.610
 If you are 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.850
 How is it going to happen ? 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:45.310
 It becomes such a shape and I bought tentatively To Do 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.310
 It is ng example of feeling that we drew in 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:58.810
 It is the point of the other track, but I would like to go through a detailed explanation here 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:03.670
 So what kind of thing that I mean the matches the tracking point I said 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:08.219
 I have rgb or something like that . 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.219
 Examples cited here I am, for example, is 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:16.359
 It is a track point is here now Kedomo I, for example, 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:20.530
 Such as deliberately camera and say to fit together that contains in it and glory 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:23.620
 I'm actually directing such a place, but the track point that supports here 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:28.670
 Green is used for something 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:31.670
 Of course, if there is something different with the winding nothing You're In other words, in this case may be in blue in red 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.330
 I'm not a problem as long as one and if there is a color 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:42.590
 For example, when it is the case of the blue-back configuration with either green back synthesis 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:47.350
 The 9 need not a sitting height mask Depending on that you it to the color of the bright green of a little 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.350
 It can be synthesized as it is
