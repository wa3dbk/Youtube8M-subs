00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
was more random thought okay so inside

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.340 
was more random thought okay so inside
out<00:04:20.549> I<00:04:20.580> had<00:04:20.880> not<00:04:21.030> seen<00:04:21.299> me<00:04:21.419> side<00:04:21.630> out<00:04:21.840> yet<00:04:22.080> but

actually<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.220> lot<00:04:29.370> more<00:04:29.400> random<00:04:29.880> than<00:04:29.970> I

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
actually a lot more random than I

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.990 
actually a lot more random than I
thought<00:04:30.419> it<00:04:30.570> would<00:04:30.660> be<00:04:30.840> thought<00:04:31.290> it<00:04:31.470> would<00:04:31.560> be

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
thought it would be thought it would be

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.370 
thought it would be thought it would be
that<00:04:33.000> was<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.150> lot<00:04:33.510> more<00:04:33.540> random<00:04:33.900> I<00:04:34.050> thought<00:04:34.290> it

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
that was a lot more random I thought it

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.100 
that was a lot more random I thought it
would<00:04:34.470> be<00:04:34.560> I<00:04:34.740> do<00:04:35.130> I<00:04:35.280> don't<00:04:35.430> know<00:04:35.610> why<00:04:35.790> I<00:04:36.090> I<00:04:36.450> was<00:04:36.810> I

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
would be I do I don't know why I I was I

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.570 
would be I do I don't know why I I was I
definitely<00:04:38.100> would<00:04:38.220> be<00:04:38.250> at<00:04:38.580> random<00:04:38.910> I<00:04:39.060> mean<00:04:40.580> it

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
definitely would be at random I mean it

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.820 
definitely would be at random I mean it
was<00:04:41.700> more<00:04:41.850> random<00:04:42.120> by<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.240> thought<00:04:42.450> so<00:04:43.410> I<00:04:43.440> mean

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
was more random by I thought so I mean

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.640 
was more random by I thought so I mean
that's<00:04:44.370> a<00:04:44.460> thing<00:04:44.490> I<00:04:48.350> don't<00:04:49.350> know<00:04:49.410> why<00:04:49.500> I<00:04:49.530> was

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.530 
that's a thing I don't know why I was
expecting<00:04:49.680> a<00:04:50.040> more<00:04:50.280> I<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:50.520> just<00:04:50.940> didn't<00:04:51.510> think

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
expecting a more I I just didn't think

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.170 
expecting a more I I just didn't think
it<00:04:51.690> would<00:04:51.840> be<00:04:52.020> that<00:04:52.229> random<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:52.830> I<00:04:53.669> said<00:04:54.150> I

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
it would be that random I I said I

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.270 
it would be that random I I said I
didn't<00:04:54.690> like<00:04:54.780> to<00:04:54.870> be<00:04:54.990> random<00:04:55.320> in<00:04:55.380> it<00:04:55.530> yeah<00:04:56.250> I

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
didn't like to be random in it yeah I

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.100 
didn't like to be random in it yeah I
was<00:04:56.430> fearing<00:04:56.700> okay<00:04:57.450> so<00:04:57.510> we're<00:04:57.750> moving<00:04:57.990> on<00:04:58.080> to

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:34.930 
wasn't expecting that to be random s it

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.320 
wasn't expecting that to be random s it
like<00:07:35.350> only<00:07:36.040> varies<00:07:36.400> a<00:07:36.430> lot<00:07:36.730> more<00:07:36.910> random<00:07:37.210> I

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:37.330 
like only varies a lot more random I

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.750 
like only varies a lot more random I
thought<00:07:37.540> there'd<00:07:37.720> be<00:07:37.750> I<00:07:38.080> mean<00:07:38.740> sure<00:07:38.890> it's<00:07:39.430> the

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:39.760 
thought there'd be I mean sure it's the
