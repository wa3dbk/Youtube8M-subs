of<00:00:47.399> course<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.910> next<00:00:48.270> highest<00:00:48.480> goalkeeper<00:00:49.050> i

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.350

believe<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.590> manuel<00:00:50.039> neuer<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.670> he<00:00:51.090> goes<00:00:51.239> to

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
believe is manuel neuer and he goes to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.180 
believe is manuel neuer and he goes to
about<00:00:51.449> 20k<00:00:52.020> or<00:00:52.230> probably<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> bit<00:00:53.010> more

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
about 20k or probably it's a bit more

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.889 
about 20k or probably it's a bit more
than<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.760> he's<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> great<00:00:54.329> option<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.780> we

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
than that so he's a great option if we

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.240 
than that so he's a great option if we
look<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> cheap<00:00:55.469> player<00:00:55.739> running<00:00:55.980> ad<00:00:56.219> lib
