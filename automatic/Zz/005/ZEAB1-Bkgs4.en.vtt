 "Hibiscus tea vs. herbal diet for hypertension" 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.844
 The latest research has examined the effect of hibiscus on obesity. 

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:15.470
 Within it, scientists were giving hibiscus to overweight people. They subsequently showed a decrease 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.238
 body weight, but after 12 weeks on hibiscus they have lost only about 1.4 kilograms 

00:00:18.238 --> 00:00:21.151
 and only three quarters of a kilogram compared to placebo - 

00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:24.103
 evidently no miracle. 

00:00:24.103 --> 00:00:27.203
 The alleged ability of hibiscus tea to lower cholesterol 

00:00:27.203 --> 00:00:28.938
 she looked a little more promising. 

00:00:28.938 --> 00:00:31.418
 Some older studies indicated a reduction of up to 8% 

00:00:31.418 --> 00:00:33.570
 when drinking two cups a day for one month 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.479
 but when comparing all the studies, the results were rather poor. 

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:41.749
 This may be because only about 50% of people drink 

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:45.137
 tea in the amount of about 2 to 5 cups a day somehow reacts, 

00:00:45.137 --> 00:00:50.568
 although those who respond may experience a 12% drop in cholesterol. 

00:00:50.568 --> 00:00:53.862
 But this is nothing compared to the 30% decline that can be achieved 

00:00:53.862 --> 00:00:58.028
 within a few weeks of a sufficiently healthy plant diet. 

00:00:58.028 --> 00:01:01.497
 The area where hibiscus can really stand out is high blood pressure, 

00:01:01.497 --> 00:01:04.765
 a disease that affects a billion people and kills millions. 

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:08.924
 Until 2010 there was not enough quality studies, 

00:01:08.924 --> 00:01:11.096
 which would encourage the use of hibiscus tea to treat hypertension. 

00:01:11.096 --> 00:01:14.630
 But now we have randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.196
 in which hibiscus tea is compared with artificially colored and flavored water, 

00:01:19.196 --> 00:01:24.280
 which tastes and looks like hibiscus tea. The tea was much better. 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.031
 We're still not sure why it works, 

00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:30.033
 but hibiscus seems to increase nitric oxide production 

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:32.997
 which probably helps the arteries to relax and expand. 

00:01:32.997 --> 00:01:37.583
 Whatever it is, an updated survey of studies has confirmed that daily consumption 

00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:40.960
 hibiscus tea can really significantly lower blood pressure in people with hypertension. 

00:01:40.963 --> 00:01:43.800
 But how much? 

00:01:43.797 --> 00:01:48.000
 How does this decrease in blood pressure compare to other interventions? 

00:01:48.998 --> 00:01:52.100
 Leading clinical study on comprehensive lifestyle adjustment for purpose 

00:01:52.197 --> 00:01:56.000
 blood pressure control is the so-called Premier Clinical Trial. 

00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:59.960
 When things happen that 9 out of 10 Americans are developing hypertension today 

00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:05.260
 randomized 800 men and women with high blood pressure to one of three groups. 

00:02:05.263 --> 00:02:08.280
 One of them was control, it was a so-called advisory group, 

00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:11.310
 in which they only told patients to lose weight, reduced salt, 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.360
 more moving and eating healthier ... Here's a handbook. 

00:02:14.362 --> 00:02:17.400
 In two groups, behavioral interventions took it seriously. 

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:20.400
 18 personal meetings, group meetings, daily records 

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:23.560
 monitoring physical activity, calorie intake and sodium intake. 

00:02:23.564 --> 00:02:26.400
 One intervention group focused only on movement 

00:02:26.496 --> 00:02:28.860
 and the other included movement and diet. 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.600
 They pushed through the so-called DASH diet, which has a high content of fruits and vegetables 

00:02:31.695 --> 00:02:33.760
 and low content of whole milk and meat products. 

00:02:33.765 --> 00:02:40.760
 And in six months they achieved a systolic decrease compared to the control group 

00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:45.530
 blood pressure by 4.3 points. That was a little better than a lifestyle change without changing the diet. 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.430
 So, a few points may not seem too much - 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.970
 this is like a drop in blood pressure from 150 to 90 for a blood pressure of 146 to 90 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.400
 but on a population scale, a drop of 5 points can bring 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:09.000
 14% fewer stroke deaths, 9% fewer heart attacks and 7% fewer deaths per year. 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.946
 However, the cup of hibiscus tea did not reduce blood pressure by 3, 4 or 5 points at each meal 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.550
 but 7 points, from 129 to 122. 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.690
 And even in direct comparison with the leading blood pressure medicine called Captopril, 

00:03:24.696 --> 00:03:27.810
 two cups of thick hibiscus tea every morning 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.770
 using a total of 5 bags for these two cups, 

00:03:30.773 --> 00:03:32.700
 were as effective in lowering blood pressure 

00:03:32.705 --> 00:03:36.720
 as a starting dose of Captopril 25 mg twice daily. 

00:03:36.724 --> 00:03:40.290
 So as effective as drugs, plus no side effects. 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.490
 And better than diet and movement? 

00:03:43.492 --> 00:03:48.160
 Well, those lifestyle interventions didn't cost much. 

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:51.330
 As health experts say, Premier studies 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.290
 demanded only 30 minutes of physical activity per day 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.560
 while the World Health Organization recommends a minimum of one hour per day. 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.940
 And in terms of diet, the lower the intake of animal fat, 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.210
 and the more protein from plant sources the Premier participants ate 

00:04:09.212 --> 00:04:10.990
 the better the diet seems to work. 

00:04:10.994 --> 00:04:15.390
 This may explain why a vegetarian diet works even better; 

00:04:15.397 --> 00:04:20.220
 the more herbal diet, the lower the incidence of hypertension. 

00:04:20.224 --> 00:04:23.890
 On the so-called DASH diet, participants were advised to reduce meat, 

00:04:23.892 --> 00:04:25.590
 but they still ate them every day. 

00:04:25.592 --> 00:04:28.880
 So they could actually be non-vegetarians from the Adventist Health Study 2, 

00:04:28.887 --> 00:04:30.920
 which targeted 89,000 Californians 

00:04:30.923 --> 00:04:34.360
 and found that those who ate meat weekly rather than daily 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.020
 23% lower high blood pressure. 

00:04:37.024 --> 00:04:40.690
 Remove all meat except fish and the rate is 38% lower. 

00:04:40.692 --> 00:04:44.130
 When you remove meat completely, vegetarians have less than half the rate of hypertension 

00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:46.960
 and vegans - who knock out all animal proteins and fats - 

00:04:46.962 --> 00:04:53.060
 apparently up to three quarters less risk of this major killer. 

00:04:53.061 --> 00:04:56.990
 We can also observe a similar gradual decrease in the incidence of diabetes 

00:04:56.994 --> 00:05:01.930
 As the diet is more herbal, and also drop in excess body weight. 

00:05:01.933 --> 00:05:07.360
 However, only those who were eating pure plant foods fell into an ideal weight. 

00:05:07.364 --> 00:05:11.860
 But can't that be the reason why people on plant foods have such great blood pressure? 

00:05:11.864 --> 00:05:14.330
 Maybe it's just because they're so slim on average. 

00:05:14.331 --> 00:05:17.100
 I have already shown that those who eat vegetable foods 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.700
 they have only a fraction of the risk of diabetes, even at the same weight, 

00:05:20.702 --> 00:05:22.700
 even after BMI control. 

00:05:22.703 --> 00:05:24.970
 But what about hypertension? 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.590
 The average American has something called prehypertension 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.040
 which means that the upper blood pressure is between 120 and 139. 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.240
 So far it is not hypertension, which starts at 140, 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.540
 but that means you're already on the right track to her. 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.540
 Compare it to the blood pressure of those who eat whole plant foods. 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.290
 They don't have it 3, 4 or even 7 points lower, but 28 points. 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.070
 But this group that ate a standard American diet 

00:05:52.071 --> 00:05:57.840
 on average overweight with a BMI above 26, still better than most Americans, 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:06.640
 but vegans, on the other hand, were here at 21 - 16 pounds lighter. 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.400
 So maybe the only reason why those who ate meat, eggs, dairy and junk food 

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:13.200
 they had so much higher blood pressure, they were overweight. 

00:06:13.295 --> 00:06:15.790
 Maybe the diet itself has nothing to do with it. 

00:06:15.796 --> 00:06:18.100
 To solve this puzzle, we'd have to find a group 

00:06:18.103 --> 00:06:21.440
 which consumes a standard American diet but is slim as vegan. 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.970
 To meet these criteria, they had to take long-distance runners 

00:06:25.973 --> 00:06:28.140
 who had a poor American diet, 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.600
 but they ran an average of over 70 km per week for 21 years. 

00:06:32.602 --> 00:06:35.990
 So for more than two decades almost two marathons a week. 

00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:43.140
 Whoever does this can be as slim as a vegan - no matter what he eats. 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.650
 So where did they place on this chart? 

00:06:45.654 --> 00:06:48.650
 Vegans and a group on a conventional diet lived a sedentary lifestyle, 

00:06:48.652 --> 00:06:50.340
 they have spent less than an hour on the move a week. 

00:06:50.345 --> 00:06:54.290
 Endurance runners were here. 

00:06:54.297 --> 00:06:58.790
 So it seems that when you run about 1600 kilometers every year 

00:06:58.797 --> 00:07:01.720
 you can start competing with some couch vegans. 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:08.890
 Not that you couldn't do both, but maybe it would just be easier to eat a vegetable diet.
