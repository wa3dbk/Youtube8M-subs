I<00:00:15.710> have<00:00:15.920> a<00:00:15.950> heavy<00:00:16.160> bag<00:00:16.430> the<00:00:16.670> weighs<00:00:16.849> probably

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:17.509 
I have a heavy bag the weighs probably

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.960 
I have a heavy bag the weighs probably
over<00:00:17.810> 100<00:00:18.200> kilos<00:00:18.380> which<00:00:19.160> is<00:00:19.189> supported<00:00:19.760> by<00:00:19.789> the

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
over 100 kilos which is supported by the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.840 
over 100 kilos which is supported by the
stand<00:00:20.420> the<00:00:21.380> stand<00:00:21.650> itself<00:00:21.980> consists<00:00:22.550> of<00:00:22.609> two

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
stand the stand itself consists of two

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.490 
stand the stand itself consists of two
beams<00:00:23.119> a<00:00:23.740> length<00:00:24.740> of<00:00:24.890> chain<00:00:24.920> a<00:00:25.660> few<00:00:26.660> carabiners

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
beams a length of chain a few carabiners

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.160 
beams a length of chain a few carabiners
and<00:00:27.910> an<00:00:28.910> anchor<00:00:29.180> the<00:00:29.480> other<00:00:29.599> end<00:00:29.840> which<00:00:29.990> I'll

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
and an anchor the other end which I'll

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.910 
and an anchor the other end which I'll
show<00:00:30.349> you<00:00:30.380> later<00:00:30.500> as<00:00:31.390> you<00:00:32.390> can<00:00:32.540> see<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.680> two

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
show you later as you can see the two

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.410 
show you later as you can see the two
beams<00:00:34.960> have<00:00:35.960> roughly<00:00:36.770> a<00:00:36.860> 10mm<00:00:37.219> hole<00:00:37.640> through

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
beams have roughly a 10mm hole through

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.860 
beams have roughly a 10mm hole through
them<00:00:38.630> and<00:00:39.130> the<00:00:40.130> short<00:00:40.430> piece<00:00:40.670> of<00:00:40.700> chain<00:00:41.149> going

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
them and the short piece of chain going

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.810 
them and the short piece of chain going
through<00:00:42.230> all<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:42.500> way<00:00:42.680> and<00:00:43.430> a<00:00:43.460> couple<00:00:43.610> of

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
through all the way and a couple of

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.299 
through all the way and a couple of
carabiners<00:00:44.450> on<00:00:44.600> either<00:00:44.780> side<00:00:45.219> and<00:00:46.219> that

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
carabiners on either side and that

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.330 
carabiners on either side and that
pretty<00:00:46.879> much<00:00:46.969> holds<00:00:47.540> the<00:00:47.750> tubes<00:00:48.140> together<00:00:48.379> it

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
pretty much holds the tubes together it

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.209 
pretty much holds the tubes together it
creates<00:00:49.700> a<00:00:49.850> supporting<00:00:50.329> structure<00:00:50.950> to<00:00:51.950> stop

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
creates a supporting structure to stop

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.000 
creates a supporting structure to stop
the<00:00:52.399> beams<00:00:52.640> from<00:00:53.059> shifting<00:00:53.300> apart<00:00:53.809> a<00:00:54.079> bit

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
the beams from shifting apart a bit

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.299 
the beams from shifting apart a bit
arrived<00:00:55.460> in<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.760> middle<00:00:55.879> horn<00:00:56.300> together<00:00:57.309> the

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
arrived in the middle horn together the

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.729 
arrived in the middle horn together the
most<00:00:58.550> important<00:00:59.030> part<00:00:59.300> of<00:00:59.510> this<00:00:59.719> system<00:01:00.289> is

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
most important part of this system is

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.580 
most important part of this system is
the<00:01:01.010> anchoring<00:01:01.989> now<00:01:02.989> here<00:01:03.230> I've<00:01:03.320> got<00:01:03.500> two

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
the anchoring now here I've got two

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.710 
the anchoring now here I've got two
lengths<00:01:03.770> of<00:01:03.920> chain<00:01:04.119> which<00:01:05.119> is<00:01:05.180> about<00:01:05.449> a<00:01:05.509> dollar

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
lengths of chain which is about a dollar

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.760 
lengths of chain which is about a dollar
50<00:01:06.200> meter<00:01:06.500> so<00:01:07.340> not<00:01:07.909> a<00:01:07.939> great<00:01:08.180> expense<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:08.869> it's

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
50 meter so not a great expense and it's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.460 
50 meter so not a great expense and it's
anchored<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.520> ground<00:01:11.080> using<00:01:12.080> a<00:01:12.170> fence

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
anchored to the ground using a fence

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.000 
anchored to the ground using a fence
post<00:01:12.970> this<00:01:13.970> fence<00:01:14.299> post<00:01:14.630> is<00:01:14.869> about<00:01:14.990> one<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:15.950> a

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
post this fence post is about one and a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.850 
post this fence post is about one and a
half<00:01:16.130> meters<00:01:16.520> long<00:01:16.760> I<00:01:17.030> basically<00:01:17.689> just<00:01:17.860> banged

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
half meters long I basically just banged

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.890 
half meters long I basically just banged
it<00:01:19.009> into<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.369> ground<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:20.450> at<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.689> top

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
it into the ground and at the top

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.179 
it into the ground and at the top
there's<00:01:21.080> a<00:01:21.140> little<00:01:21.350> hook<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:21.770> I<00:01:21.799> just<00:01:22.009> copped

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
there's a little hook and I just copped

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.940 
there's a little hook and I just copped
it<00:01:22.310> onto<00:01:22.580> there<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:23.110> this<00:01:24.110> pretty<00:01:24.470> much<00:01:24.680> has

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
it onto there and this pretty much has

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.850 
it onto there and this pretty much has
to<00:01:24.979> hold<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:25.670> whole<00:01:26.299> weight<00:01:26.540> of<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.750> bag<00:01:26.990> or

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
to hold the whole weight of the bag or

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.560 
to hold the whole weight of the bag or
the<00:01:27.979> force<00:01:28.220> on<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.549> bag<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:29.060> weight<00:01:29.210> of<00:01:29.360> bag

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
the force on the bag the weight of bag

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.429 
the force on the bag the weight of bag
is<00:01:30.200> exerted<00:01:30.799> directly<00:01:31.220> onto<00:01:31.369> this<00:01:31.640> anchor<00:01:32.630> so

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
is exerted directly onto this anchor so

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.679 
is exerted directly onto this anchor so
I<00:01:33.470> don't<00:01:33.799> recommend<00:01:34.130> anchoring<00:01:34.729> it<00:01:34.880> onto<00:01:35.479> any

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
I don't recommend anchoring it onto any

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.929 
I don't recommend anchoring it onto any
structural<00:01:36.439> object<00:01:36.979> of<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.520> house<00:01:37.700> or

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
structural object of the house or

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.910 
structural object of the house or
anything<00:01:37.970> like<00:01:38.240> that<00:01:38.299> frame<00:01:39.140> itself<00:01:39.619> is

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
anything like that frame itself is

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.890 
anything like that frame itself is
actually<00:01:40.369> just<00:01:40.579> switched<00:01:40.909> between<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.720> wall

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
actually just switched between the wall

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.300 
actually just switched between the wall
I've<00:01:42.170> got<00:01:42.380> here<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.970> tiles<00:01:44.740> now<00:01:45.740> if<00:01:46.100> you

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
I've got here and the tiles now if you

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.940 
I've got here and the tiles now if you
don't<00:01:46.490> have<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.729> wall<00:01:47.030> like<00:01:47.060> this<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:48.799> will

don't have a wall like this you will

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.389 
don't have a wall like this you will
