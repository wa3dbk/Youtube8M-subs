00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.810
 how are you doing today what we are going to do is 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.550
 clay pots and let's discover 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.370
 two things first that is easy to do 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.830
 the second they do not wear orange see 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.410
 well how colors come what is 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.390
 I would call a yellow color map of 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.320
 naples in this piece and this one that is 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.670
 where the light hits 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.960
 natural siena in the outline of the napoles 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.740
 being toast putting together this piece and 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.780
 this part of here natural shade in this 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.190
 side and below what will be 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.940
 the edge with soft bristle brush 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.489
 I come combing the colors 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.040
 trying to make the union of a color with 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.160
 the other one smokes 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.650
 but not that I mix complete but 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.780
 that are formed nothing else where it happens to me 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.870
 this happened to me just when the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.660
 clean color the brush a little release 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.100
 the excess of paint that I have 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.700
 review for clarity to be maintained 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.659
 I'm going to this part of here up here already 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.280
 it happened to the hundred state 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:17.310
 I do not touch the dark I'm going up nothing more 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.590
 what color by color now I comb the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.270
 darker part always trying to 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.690
 smoke 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.810
 the union of one with the other 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.780
 I come to this part of here below they see that 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.140
 already the volumes were armed we are going to what 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.120
 that would be the edge 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.120
 and first him in 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.670
 the lights of the inside of a pileup 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.780
 I have them inverted that what I have 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.030
 at the base 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.100
 if I have clear white on this tip 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.049
 here I will have clear of this side 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.470
 and I will have the same sequence of 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.470
 colors 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.700
 what is naples being natural has 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.450
 toasts 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.480
 natural shadow go up 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.710
 the values ​​of the browns 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.740
 instead of combing following the volume 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:18.410
 outside of the pileup he combed it following 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:23.420
 what would be the movement 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.870
 out of the pileup on the edge of the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.870
 edge 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.319
 I'm going to what is the outer edge is 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:36.090
 I repeat the succession of colors of the 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.810
 main body clarito first 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.209
 being natural after 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.849
 although I do not have the photo and you 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.550
 neither here serves us anything more than the 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.470
 reasoning here the pileup already gives 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.090
 the turn then I have to have 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.840
 darkness yes or yes 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.840
 combed 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.810
 I'm here until the end 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.480
 with the edge of the brush edge 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.319
 and there I have it ready and we go to the subject of 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.319
 how to draw it 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.790
 supported the leg of a squadron 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.690
 parallel 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.760
 to the lectern 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.380
 in the squad and I liked it 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.980
 I trace this line 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:30.360
 and eye drawing 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.510
 this side of the pileup if I like 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.230
 how was the way we are going to make it 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.360
 handy and it was nice 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.420
 with the squad 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.580
 fear towards this other side the 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.040
 distances there are and I make a line of 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.890
 little dots when one 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.319
 the pileup is symmetrical 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.330
 they see that it is not so difficult to do 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.720
 things well you have to use a little bit the 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.209
 ingenuity for these clay pots 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.850
 if I got to put orange that 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.190
 like plastic if it took them to put 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.640
 vermillion are illuminated by a 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.760
 wood fire 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.450
 I can not put them red if it came to them 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.580
 put blue 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:20.530
 and after I leave 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:23.140
 look at the shade the browns take 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.170
 they make me much more beautiful because they 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:30.130
 they lightly ali 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.840
 but remember orange not vermilion anymore 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.780
 or less and if they want to play alone in 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.190
 overseas or violet ready I hope that you 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.190
 greetings
