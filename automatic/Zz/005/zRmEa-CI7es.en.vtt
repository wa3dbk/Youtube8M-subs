00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 hello salty today salmon for 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.990
 beginning we will cut it into two parts and 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:21.350
 cut ridge to hook here goes all 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.350
 bones which here have a little knife and 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.019
 separated from the meat itself 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.980
 but 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.199
 there are small pieces here too 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.790
 principle not so pretty small on them 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.790
 can score 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.409
 we go down on the ridge 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.220
 Oksana do 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.220
 the other side 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.440
 what is left drinks 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.820
 Do I need to put it in my ear 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.820
 or give love a window 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.200
 so here 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.320
 separate what 0 does not like 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.500
 any fat is that bad cleaned 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.620
 also quote 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.570
 so that it does not interfere with eating the fish itself 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:34.200
 then we take a dry plate take 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:37.709
 salt we take sugar can be salted 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.830
 and without sugar then the fish will turn out more 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.420
 so tough it can be 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:47.670
 neatly cut nicely 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:49.560
 that is, it will come out more beautiful on the other hand 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.709
 if we add sugar it will turn out 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.060
 softer such a collapse of 100 and a bit 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:59.130
 tastier so we will salt some sugar 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:08.550
 proportions proportions tablespoon of salt 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:13.800
 and a little less than a tablespoon of sugar this 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:15.780
 so by eye on these two pieces to us 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:24.510
 probably need 2 tablespoons 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:27.500
 probably two hours of salt and two spoons 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.500
 we mix business 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.230
 salt we take large not iodized 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.389
 Letters from already purchased also we take 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:47.760
 dishes 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:47.760
 where are we going to put it all take 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:55.529
 clean cloth so that it is not possible 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:56.939
 wrap the fish need to fish 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:59.599
 in the process of salting 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:01.979
 not be weathered so that she was 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:07.469
 pretty pretty and top and bottom 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:13.129
 to not only with it we lay there 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:13.129
 the fish is 100 km long and clogged and wrapped 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:25.070
 here 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.850
 just take and dunk the fish in this our 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:34.640
 so to speak 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:37.150
 time salt and sugar in general we are good 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.150
 smeared 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.290
 and laid 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.290
 dishes 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.650
 pelt down on the next and put 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:53.729
 how many years do we take the next piece 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.729
 and do so very well 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.480
 We are not afraid and oversalt 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.950
 oversalt it can still cram salt 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:12.000
 overly and if just dip 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:15.290
 how much has stuck a little we stick 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.290
 never overdone 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.570
 we put on top 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.710
 Oleg skin 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.250
 do so here 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:38.240
 will distribute orion 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:44.340
 well then fill up 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:57.120
 and now we cover slightly 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:02.460
 it is not worth wrapping so that the fabric is not 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:06.080
 imbibe he ear then the fish will become it 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:10.340
 need a lot of soaked fat on the 1st 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:15.290
 so as not to listen to the fish that is just 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.290
 cover a little bit 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.199
 everything 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.950
 old fridge the next day 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.680
 we get a bunch 

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.360
 somewhere a day and a half to stand when 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.980
 a little tastier well, usually in the morning 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.980
 already ready like this
