00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.770
 and it is already approaching Christmas and 

00:00:02.529 --> 00:00:07.359
 came lh or in this space to start 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.090
 prepare armed things would not do more 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.950
 several little things many things and for 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.630
 jump ahead if everyone has 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.140
 enough time to prepare ourselves 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.790
 that after generating a pot that can 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.850
 be a basket can be a box of 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.700
 cardboard that we are going to intervene with the 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.010
 side in this case to do it as more 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.000
 fast and to make it more porous 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.859
 we use sidi braid side of lh and what 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.690
 we did it was simply this is fine 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:36.760
 thick and it works very fast and what 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.559
 you can crush you can not go 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.379
 crushing what we did was 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.920
 just go hitting it if you go 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:48.429
 hitting is a little bit nothing more than 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.260
 We put glue on contact glue 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.659
 common one has to end if he does 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.789
 about your part that is going to be something for 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.649
 you have to see that it is suitable for 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.139
 this kind of material because that's how it goes 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.269
 covering all this and it stays that way with 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:03.609
 the same side you how are you good and 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.440
 you follow directly with this side and 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.110
 then you continue with the color 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.820
 when you finish the first strip you follow 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.890
 with the colorado and you are covering all 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.890
 as we did here 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.950
 I directly did not round 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.240
 I even cut it and it was for when it 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.650
 says that these one Christmases that one 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.050
 eat as if it were the last day it 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.150
 they eat as if it were winter 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.660
 almonds nougat chocolates 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.790
 we put here in two or three several of 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.950
 these on the good table and one goes the 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.130
 nougat grabbing the pineapple days 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.730
 encourages and now I show you a suit 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.940
 Christmas tree costume 21 that we are 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:47.680
 to caracas 1 that is like very minimalist 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:50.800
 very simple very sober without what we did 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.270
 common wooden rings those are the 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.280
 themselves and look how cute they are 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.550
 cooked interests green looks bree 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.920
 looks silver and gold systems with 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:05.080
 rings so we went grabbing the yarn 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.110
 now I'm going to show you what a hit 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.710
 little bit and you just have it happening like that 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.990
 that for these 3 little things that one 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.700
 a little spinning and you're going on 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.130
 this case as the largest ring in 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.970
 what is best to leave the yarn continue 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.400
 the needle as I did in these that 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.470
 let's comply I made you three that later on 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.020
 this case to the form and I was putting 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.360
 there in this here and here I show you in this 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.430
 with milestone you know what this is 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.920
 what is this says the cones that the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.230
 ajaccio of yarns but everything is worn 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.390
 would be recycled previous received can 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.520
 be a nice wood because it stuck 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.770
 over here and the state can recycle it 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.300
 by people throws away so you pull cited 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.310
 alcohol they use to make a bottle what 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.590
 that wants but we try that it has 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.630
 one more orbit of clear cone and here 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.940
 simply with you you realize that what 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.610
 I have completeness if I simply do what 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.270
 Let's do is put pieces 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.070
 little ones and it's not andrÃ© exprese 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.140
 you have to take a little care 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.290
 because I feel it is getting to a 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.200
 little hand but so with the yarn 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.930
 that you take it straight out of the ball 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.690
 You are covering everything once you cover it 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.100
 everything after how to intervene can be 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.860
 long if it is inside d 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:25.780
 what hung and it's very easy to do those 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.360
 are the new colors 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.280
 for christmas another color of christmas 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.010
 you have here back with are the typical 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.540
 for red green and red yes 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.859
 but it's good at this time 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:43.310
 use the gold and silver ones that are 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:46.849
 the party that the little thing had shown 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.400
 It is the typical Christmas tree that 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:53.060
 others we always have at home this 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.010
 we explain in the other video that we recorded 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.269
 in the previous month clear then good 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.340
 in this case what we did is a 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.579
 typical campaign return but we leave it 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.879
 hollow and then we made small 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.170
 pieces of wool about 20 centimeters 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.389
 that we just did like 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.519
 little poems to go hanging in 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:14.329
 different colors here that you fijate 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.519
 you have yellowish orange if it's going to go 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.190
 hanging them and another option are the 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.109
 compasses to leave a bit of the typical 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.560
 christmas ornament that one goes 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.560
 buying 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.220
 more creative new different and in addition 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.630
 you have time to prepare the 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.910
 concerts what do you think today three 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.920
 fast jobs, especially fast 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.380
 simple and fast 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.450
 with gold plated we have the 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.280
 Herratillas in the center of table we have 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.930
 the trees that these can live 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.570
 also very minimalist bars for 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:49.700
 the offices to put in the sights 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:51.920
 also corner centerpieces 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.880
 of navia heat are these long and because 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.220
 this meeting of more than two or three 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.500
 families good to put those from different 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.200
 colors can also be done with this 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.300
 and a good side to go mixing the now 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.370
 incorporate these negotiated are the 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.979
 books 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.139
 and the pompoms in you as you make them 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.139
 I am with the gadget but in cardboard 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.280
 the paperboard 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.960
 I do not know if all of us are going to do it 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.300
 then you cut it and you pass the thread of 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.860
 to be very strong pulls well strong 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.340
 staying more and after that match 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.010
 a little yes and another thing is that already 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.229
 we had in this case how it looks like the 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.540
 Very small ring here also 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.330
 we passed but to be easier if we 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.220
 You are going directly with the needle 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.979
 Of course you're going all messing directly 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.970
 with the needle and now apenitas you put 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.570
 well now then faster because no 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.490
 I put the glue on him but the most 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.889
 directly surrounding everything and once 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.919
 you finish directly to make a knot 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.969
 is already to place marianas a lot 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.479
 of ideas 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:59.149
 the Christmas table is already ready 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:02.629
 the list we got the card for 

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:05.149
 Christmas so that for us it is going to 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:06.769
 to be unique 

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:08.839
 you're going to be pretty going to be very novel with 

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:10.549
 different colors I share a lot that 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:12.799
 another proposal also for the little tree 

00:06:10.549 --> 00:06:17.239
 to pay here we are before the 

00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:19.789
 typical typical is something nice and good

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:28.759
 We continue to spin the dh or guarantee of 

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:31.579
 quality production processes 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:35.599
 advanced more than 50 kinds of yarn each 

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:38.649
 season the trip or a business one hundred 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:38.649
