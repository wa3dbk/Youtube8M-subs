of<00:00:54.530> soft<00:00:55.530> flex<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.340> I'm<00:00:56.699> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> shoot<00:00:57.149> them

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
of soft flex and I'm going to shoot them

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.299 
of soft flex and I'm going to shoot them
straight<00:00:57.989> down<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.410> center<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.010> knitting

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
straight down the center of the knitting

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.790 
straight down the center of the knitting
spool<00:00:59.719> you're<00:01:00.719> going<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.930> go<00:01:01.050> ahead<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.469> hold

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800

spool you're going to go ahead and hold
on<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> two<00:01:02.640> ends<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.180> your<00:01:03.359> thumb<00:01:03.629> at

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
on to the two ends with your thumb at

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.050 
on to the two ends with your thumb at
the<00:01:03.899> bottom<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.530> then<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.790> look<00:01:05.939> at

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the bottom and then I like to look at

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.359 
the bottom and then I like to look at
the<00:01:06.180> knitting<00:01:06.479> spool<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.290> clock<00:01:07.619> so

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the knitting spool like it's a clock so

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.310 
the knitting spool like it's a clock so
at<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> very<00:01:08.820> top<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.659> would<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.869> 12

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
at the very top here this would be 12

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.530 
at the very top here this would be 12
o'clock<00:01:10.650> I'm<00:01:11.010> going<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.729> wind<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.299> wires

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
o'clock I'm going to wind the wires

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.070 
o'clock I'm going to wind the wires
clockwise<00:01:13.439> around<00:01:13.950> 12<00:01:14.430> o'clock<00:01:14.930> through<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
clockwise around 12 o'clock through the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.280 
clockwise around 12 o'clock through the
middle<00:01:16.439> over<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:17.280> nine<00:01:17.900> through<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> middle

down to six through the middle over to
three<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.810> then<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.950> do<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> double<00:01:26.640> knit<00:01:26.820> which

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
three and then to do a double knit which

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.999 
three and then to do a double knit which
is<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.420> we're<00:01:27.540> doing<00:01:27.840> today<00:01:28.049> I'm<00:01:28.560> going<00:01:28.890> to

is what we're doing today I'm going to

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.520 
is what we're doing today I'm going to
actually<00:01:29.189> take<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.090> wire<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.750> wrap<00:01:31.350> it

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
actually take the wire and wrap it

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.310 
actually take the wire and wrap it
around<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.890> entire<00:01:32.430> outside<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.570> all<00:01:33.750> four

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
around the entire outside of all four

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.380 
around the entire outside of all four
pegs<00:01:35.990> till<00:01:36.990> I've<00:01:37.170> got<00:01:37.409> two<00:01:37.890> loops<00:01:38.490> basically

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
pegs till I've got two loops basically

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.929 
pegs till I've got two loops basically
on<00:01:39.540> each<00:01:39.810> peg<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:41.460> I'm<00:01:41.579> going<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.759> come

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
on each peg and then I'm going to come

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.980 
on each peg and then I'm going to come
around<00:01:42.060> 12<00:01:42.600> for<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> third<00:01:43.740> loop<00:01:44.630> hold<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.810> wire

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
around 12 for a third loop hold the wire

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.280 
around 12 for a third loop hold the wire
in<00:01:46.020> place<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:48.090> I'm<00:01:48.210> gonna<00:01:48.360> pick<00:01:48.659> up<00:01:48.780> my<00:01:48.840> all

just<00:02:07.560> move<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.429> nine<00:02:09.739> take<00:02:10.739> those<00:02:11.039> two

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
just move on to nine take those two

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.630 
just move on to nine take those two
loops

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
loops

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.540 
loops
up<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.300> over<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.930> into<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:14.830> center<00:02:15.310> and

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
up and over and into the center and

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.240 
up and over and into the center and
you'll<00:02:16.180> see<00:02:16.450> as<00:02:16.600> I<00:02:16.780> go<00:02:17.020> it'll<00:02:17.380> start<00:02:17.770> creating

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
you'll see as I go it'll start creating

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.250 
you'll see as I go it'll start creating
a<00:02:18.340> pattern<00:02:18.580> because<00:02:19.450> what<00:02:19.660> it's<00:02:19.810> doing<00:02:19.900> is

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
a pattern because what it's doing is

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.650 
a pattern because what it's doing is
it's<00:02:20.470> knitting<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.100> wire<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.790> then<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.390> wire

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
it's knitting the wire and then the wire

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.770 
it's knitting the wire and then the wire
is<00:02:22.990> going<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.230> come<00:02:23.470> down<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.010> bottom<00:02:24.400> in<00:02:24.780> a

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.650 
is going to come down the bottom in a
tubular<00:02:26.410> shape<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:28.090> looks<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.510> this

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
tubular shape that looks like this

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.980

to<00:02:32.050> finish<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.680> off<00:02:32.830> it's<00:02:33.250> really<00:02:33.970> quick<00:02:34.240> and

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
to finish it off it's really quick and

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.380 
to finish it off it's really quick and
easy<00:02:34.560> what<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.590> did<00:02:35.920> was<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.190> used<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.820> three<00:02:37.209> by

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
easy what I did was I used a three by

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.660 
easy what I did was I used a three by
three<00:02:37.420> crimp<00:02:38.230> tube<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:39.070> four<00:02:39.430> millimeter

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
three crimp tube and a four millimeter

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.780 
three crimp tube and a four millimeter
crimp<00:02:40.480> cover<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.620> took<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:42.160> ends<00:02:42.550> of<00:02:42.640> the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
crimp cover so I took the ends of the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.870 
crimp cover so I took the ends of the
wire<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.420> took<00:02:44.200> them<00:02:44.440> through<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.860> cones<00:02:45.340> and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
wire and took them through the cones and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.840 
wire and took them through the cones and
then<00:02:46.390> through<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.410> beads<00:02:47.650> through<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.580> crimp

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
then through the beads through the crimp

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.820 
then through the beads through the crimp
tubes<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.450> they<00:02:49.870> actually<00:02:50.260> both<00:02:50.470> went

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
tubes and they actually both went

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.090 
tubes and they actually both went
through<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:51.850> big<00:02:52.150> onyx<00:02:52.570> bead<00:02:52.810> in<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.050> middle

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
through this big onyx bead in the middle

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.979 
through this big onyx bead in the middle
then<00:02:54.100> I<00:02:54.250> crimped<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.880> with<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.060> mighty<00:02:55.450> crimping

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
then I crimped it with a mighty crimping

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.290 
then I crimped it with a mighty crimping
plier<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.650> put<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.310> crimp<00:02:57.580> cover<00:02:57.670> over<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.180> top

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
plier and put a crimp cover over the top

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.380 
plier and put a crimp cover over the top
of<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.780> quick<00:02:59.650> easy<00:03:00.070> and<00:03:00.700> definitely
