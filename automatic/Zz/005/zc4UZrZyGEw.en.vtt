00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.600
 now we have our work isolated 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.780
 let's make the braids here and here 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:45.850
 but so that this hair does not bother us 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.300
 we can isolate it in various ways 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:53.190
 one of the ways is 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.190
 I think it is the most advanced 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.290
 when you already have a little more 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.290
 skill 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.730
 It is a small and twisted little bun 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.010
 z 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.940
 on the other side we do exactly what 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.940
 same 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.110
 Y 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.150
 we already have this hair is not going to 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.700
 bother when we do the work 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.929
 we have these two lines which is what 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.810
 let's braid 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.810
 then I advise you at the beginning 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.700
 when you start doing your jobs and 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.799
 in very pale hair like it can be 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.330
 this in blue hair is not necessary but 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.690
 in hair is very ties as can be 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.380
 you wet the areas where 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.680
 let's tighten 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.610
 and we take 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.010
 our canek fiber alone 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.850
 the fiber of panetta long is hair 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:43.090
 artificial that we are going to use to 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.030
 make our braid 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.269
 has two advantages this type of hair 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.400
 It gives consistency to the braid and we 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.930
 makes a braid much stronger then 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.510
 let's hook the curtains of 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.569
 hair and we need a good hold 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.890
 we can not make a weak braid and 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:05.170
 especially in straight hair like this 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.569
 the braid would come apart with a lot 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.350
 ease then with the fiber of 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.690
 cameron 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.250
 with the synthetic hair we are going to do 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.250
 a much stronger braid 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.220
 or
