bronzer at my blush it's so good the
shape<00:06:31.100> is<00:06:31.370> great<00:06:31.730> because<00:06:31.970> as<00:06:32.330> you<00:06:32.450> can<00:06:32.480> see

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600

it's really nice and full and round but

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.550 
it's really nice and full and round but
then<00:06:35.150> as<00:06:35.300> you<00:06:35.390> turn<00:06:35.540> to<00:06:35.690> decide<00:06:35.900> is<00:06:36.110> actually

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
then as you turn to decide is actually

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.120 
then as you turn to decide is actually
pretty<00:06:36.800> thin<00:06:37.220> so<00:06:37.940> you<00:06:38.420> can<00:06:38.600> apply<00:06:39.440> a<00:06:39.560> product

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
pretty thin so you can apply a product

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.130 
pretty thin so you can apply a product
like<00:06:40.760> in<00:06:40.940> this<00:06:41.150> sort<00:06:41.390> of<00:06:41.450> way<00:06:41.570> to<00:06:41.630> get<00:06:41.930> away

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
like in this sort of way to get away

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.680 
like in this sort of way to get away
more<00:06:42.320> direct<00:06:42.800> application<00:06:43.520> and<00:06:43.700> then<00:06:44.240> I'll<00:06:44.510> go

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
more direct application and then I'll go

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.210 
more direct application and then I'll go
to<00:06:44.780> do<00:06:44.930> is<00:06:44.990> flip<00:06:45.200> around<00:06:45.350> and<00:06:45.620> it<00:06:45.770> blends<00:06:46.070> it

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
to do is flip around and it blends it

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.670 
to do is flip around and it blends it
out<00:06:46.370> for<00:06:46.700> it<00:06:46.850> just<00:06:47.000> it<00:06:47.660> doesn't<00:06:47.930> work<00:06:48.260> for<00:06:48.530> you

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
out for it just it doesn't work for you

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.850 
out for it just it doesn't work for you
it's<00:06:48.890> so<00:06:49.190> good<00:06:49.490> it's<00:06:49.520> so<00:06:49.880> soft<00:06:50.540> I<00:06:50.900> absolutely
