00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.760
 future lady of drake I give you the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.620
 welcome without in the kitchen and good in 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.540

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.980
 muscular is a man much tastier 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.170
 do not lose any detail I will mention them 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.480

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.940
 against why I'm cutting the radish 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.940
 instead of cutting the avocado like this 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.550
 you remember this lemon sometimes I 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.840
 I put in the whistle I say my love I think 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.840
 that already follows the most difficult 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.470
 let's roll the ham with your hands 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.420

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.940
 have a doctoral degree in 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.070
 ham curl because I heard 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.590
 many believe that they can do it and 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.230
 It's simple but you would be surprised 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.330
 this once we have rolled the 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.330
 ham we just have to do this 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.700

 [Music] 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.060
 with that will suffice and the last thing that remains is 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.330
 put a bit of seasoning to Chinese lion and 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.459

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.459
 medicine that sheen in the kitchen 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.349
 fascinates and I think we're done here
