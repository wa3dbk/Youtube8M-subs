00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
for the last couple months in Canada and

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.030 
for the last couple months in Canada and
I've<00:00:44.760> been<00:00:44.970> using<00:00:45.180> these<00:00:45.360> new<00:00:45.739> raw<00:00:46.739> vintage

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040

I've been using these new raw vintage

steel pure steel saddles on my guitar

steel pure steel saddles on my guitar
but<00:00:52.290> this<00:00:52.470> is<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> little<00:00:53.220> bit<00:00:53.309> more<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
but this is a little bit more like the

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:56.929 
but this is a little bit more like the
vintage<00:00:54.890> guitar<00:00:55.890> settles<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.460> sounds<00:00:56.759> more

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:56.939 
vintage guitar settles it sounds more

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:59.810 
vintage guitar settles it sounds more
like<00:00:56.970> the<00:00:57.509> old<00:00:57.659> 59<00:00:58.229> the<00:00:58.259> the<00:00:59.189> early<00:00:59.460> fender

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
like the old 59 the the early fender

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.259 
like the old 59 the the early fender
bridges<00:01:01.129> it's<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.280> little<00:01:02.489> bit<00:01:02.580> softer<00:01:03.030> metal

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
bridges it's a little bit softer metal

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.759 
bridges it's a little bit softer metal
and<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.869> gives<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> guitar<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> little<00:01:04.559> bit

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
and it gives the guitar a little bit

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.200 
and it gives the guitar a little bit
round<00:01:04.979> or<00:01:05.189> maybe<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.519> little<00:01:05.939> bit<00:01:06.090> more

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
round or maybe a little bit more

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.700 
round or maybe a little bit more
sustained<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.810> maybe<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.079> little<00:01:07.350> bit<00:01:07.530> bigger

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
sustained and maybe a little bit bigger

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.700 
sustained and maybe a little bit bigger
sound<00:01:08.600> it's<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.720> rather<00:01:09.869> lightweight<00:01:10.350> guitar

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
sound it's a rather lightweight guitar

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.969 
sound it's a rather lightweight guitar
with<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.189> maple<00:01:11.340> neck<00:01:11.579> and<00:01:11.820> i<00:01:12.509> love<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:12.930> totally

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.370

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.320 
the saddles is the new AC booster by
exotic<00:01:28.610> it's<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.729> little<00:01:29.909> bit<00:01:30.000> different

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
exotic it's a little bit different

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.910 
exotic it's a little bit different
besides<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.840> light<00:01:31.050> being<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.590> different

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
besides the light being in a different

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.940 
besides the light being in a different
place<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.810> AC<00:01:33.960> booster<00:01:34.260> this<00:01:34.620> the<00:01:34.830> new

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
place the AC booster this the new

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.010 
place the AC booster this the new
version<00:01:35.190> of<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.520> AC<00:01:35.700> booster<00:01:35.940> has<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.600> little

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
version of the AC booster has a little

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.620 
version of the AC booster has a little
more<00:01:37.200> gain<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.830> it's<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.790> less<00:01:39.090> compressed

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
more gain and it's a less compressed

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.719 
more gain and it's a less compressed
than<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.470> old<00:01:40.620> one<00:01:40.860> they're<00:01:41.010> both<00:01:41.190> still<00:01:41.549> very

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
than the old one they're both still very

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.340 
than the old one they're both still very
similar<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.180> characteristics<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.200> could

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
similar in characteristics and you could

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.170 
similar in characteristics and you could
probably<00:01:43.770> dial<00:01:44.220> them<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.580> both<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.970> sound

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
probably dial them in both to sound

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.149 
probably dial them in both to sound
great<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.260> for<00:01:46.500> me<00:01:46.620> sounds<00:01:46.920> a

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
great but this one for me sounds a

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.740 
great but this one for me sounds a
little<00:01:47.370> bit<00:01:47.490> less<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.940> pedal<00:01:48.299> more<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.720> a

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
little bit less like a pedal more like a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.500 
little bit less like a pedal more like a
real<00:01:48.990> amp<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.920> got<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.190> more<00:01:50.880> Headroom<00:01:51.270> and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
real amp it's got a more Headroom and

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.710 
real amp it's got a more Headroom and
less<00:01:52.049> compression<00:01:53.180> which<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.270> why<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.420> prefer

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
less compression which is why I prefer

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.310 
less compression which is why I prefer
it<00:01:54.960> over<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.260> old<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:56.990> which<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.020> what<00:01:58.200> you're

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
it over the old one which is what you're

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:17.699 
it over the old one which is what you're
hearing<00:01:58.500> now

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.870 

it's<00:02:18.709> in<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:18.890> same<00:02:19.130> structure<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.760> looks

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
it's in the same structure it looks

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.220 
it's in the same structure it looks
almost<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.150> same<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.569> only<00:02:20.600> difference<00:02:20.780> is<00:02:21.080> I

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
almost the same the only difference is I

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.870 
almost the same the only difference is I
can<00:02:21.380> tell<00:02:21.530> is<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.040> there's<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.310> light<00:02:22.489> is<00:02:22.670> in<00:02:22.790> a

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
can tell is that there's a light is in a

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.370 
can tell is that there's a light is in a
different<00:02:23.030> place<00:02:23.239> which<00:02:23.989> is<00:02:24.020> not<00:02:24.260> that

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
different place which is not that

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.080 
different place which is not that
important<00:02:24.830> but<00:02:24.980> what's<00:02:25.610> important<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.030> that

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
important but what's important is that

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.090 
important but what's important is that
it<00:02:26.239> sounds<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.750> little<00:02:26.930> bit<00:02:27.020> better<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.260> think<00:02:27.440> if

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
it sounds a little bit better I think if

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.590 
it sounds a little bit better I think if
they<00:02:28.310> could<00:02:28.550> improve<00:02:28.790> on<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.150> somehow<00:02:29.360> they

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
they could improve on it somehow they

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.870 
they could improve on it somehow they
did<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:30.110> sounds<00:02:30.620> like<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.100> said<00:02:31.280> more<00:02:31.489> natural

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
did it sounds like I said more natural

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.000 
did it sounds like I said more natural
under<00:02:32.090> your<00:02:32.209> fingers<00:02:32.709> one<00:02:33.709> thing<00:02:33.860> I<00:02:33.980> always

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
under your fingers one thing I always
