00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.629
 hello today we are going to learn how to make a 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.209
 collected from three hundred very 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:13.629
 simple and very fast and as you can see this 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:13.629
 it is the result 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.730
 The first thing we are going to do is divide 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.480
 the hair in 13 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.900
 and each part the braid we will do is 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.420
 important that those on the sides 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.360
 by distributing them in three mentions and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.170
 start thinking the first one we will choose 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:37.910
 a little bit inwards is worth what 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.910
 we turn and we start to stretch 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.870
 I'm going to make three simple braids 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.969
 ends and leave rather loose 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.420
 we repeat the same thing in the other 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.420
 side 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.640
 another braid 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.950
 Well, we already do the third 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.020
 and we have been making sure that it does not 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.010
 undo it is not a rubber band each 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.740
 I have used in braid bands of these 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.270
 they sell anywhere 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.130
 hairdresser in black so you do not 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.780
 stand out too much with your hair to 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.550
 then let's make a braid 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.390
 semi unmade not necessary or that the 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.340
 pre finished with the three braids as 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.090
 each one is a cape because it will be a braid 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.090
 of three capes 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.820
 Well, the board is a bit like you see 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.880
 it is very loose and we put them together again 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.850
 with another pump when we already have the 330 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.390
 intertwined and caught with a rubber with 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.800
 the two fingers are going to hit the 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.800
 inwards it is worth 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.159
 and there we will fix it with a fork 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.200
 so that it does not fall 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.549
 then we will place you as 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.549
 we like it with hairpins 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.830
 it does not have to be too tight 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.470
 As you can see, it is taking shape according to 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.600
 we are placing the forks 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.440
 Well, as you can see, this would be the 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.440
 final result 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.620
