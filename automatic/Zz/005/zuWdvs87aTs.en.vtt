00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
that way it'll be free of oil and paint

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.830 
that way it'll be free of oil and paint
will<00:01:06.210> stick<00:01:06.240> better<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:08.330> paint<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.570> use

click<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:20.440> brew<00:03:20.770> some<00:03:20.980> air<00:03:21.190> into<00:03:21.430> these<00:03:21.580> holes

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
click and brew some air into these holes

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.000 
click and brew some air into these holes
as<00:03:24.100> you<00:03:24.340> see<00:03:24.550> all<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:25.360> rust<00:03:25.690> dust<00:03:26.350> come<00:03:26.680> out<00:03:26.860> of

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
as you see all the rust dust come out of

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.699 
as you see all the rust dust come out of
every<00:03:27.280> one<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.459> those<00:03:27.670> holes<00:03:28.350> so<00:03:29.350> I<00:03:29.709> think<00:03:30.100> that

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
every one of those holes so I think that

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.390 
every one of those holes so I think that
before<00:03:32.709> I<00:03:32.739> reassemble<00:03:33.730> I'm<00:03:34.720> going<00:03:35.080> to<00:03:35.340> try<00:03:36.340> to

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
before I reassemble I'm going to try to

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.490 
before I reassemble I'm going to try to
shoot<00:03:36.790> water<00:03:37.090> down<00:03:37.420> through<00:03:37.780> those<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:38.230> blow

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
shoot water down through those and blow

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.330 
shoot water down through those and blow
out<00:03:38.680> as<00:03:38.830> much

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
out as much

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.580 
out as much
crud<00:03:40.180> as<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.510> can<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:40.840> don't<00:03:41.200> know<00:03:41.320> if<00:03:41.380> there's

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
crud as I can I don't know if there's

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.490 
crud as I can I don't know if there's

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
any other way to get that stuff out of

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.390 
any other way to get that stuff out of
there<00:03:44.709> that's<00:03:45.100> that<00:03:45.190> no<00:03:45.580> rusty<00:03:46.209> crud<00:03:46.959> you<00:03:46.989> know

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
there that's that no rusty crud you know

there that's that no rusty crud you know
it<00:03:48.400> gets<00:03:48.580> in<00:03:48.850> there<00:03:49.060> I've<00:03:49.690> tried<00:03:50.019> to<00:03:50.230> make<00:03:50.470> as

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
it gets in there I've tried to make as

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.580 
it gets in there I've tried to make as
much<00:03:51.040> out<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.340> that<00:03:51.489> hole<00:03:52.300> as<00:03:52.570> I<00:03:52.720> possibly<00:03:53.290> can

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
much out of that hole as I possibly can

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.040 
much out of that hole as I possibly can
there<00:03:53.890> but<00:03:54.100> it's<00:03:55.090> all<00:03:55.300> you<00:03:55.540> know<00:03:55.660> in<00:03:55.810> case

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
there but it's all you know in case

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.080 
there but it's all you know in case
between<00:03:56.320> the<00:03:56.709> block<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.370> it's<00:03:57.550> in<00:03:57.700> your<00:03:57.850> water

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
between the block and it's in your water

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.970 
between the block and it's in your water
chamber<00:03:58.660> all<00:03:58.810> through<00:03:59.140> there<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.790> I

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
chamber all through there so I

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.559 
chamber all through there so I
no<00:04:02.190> it's<00:04:02.430> it's<00:04:03.120> iffy<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:04.670> I<00:04:05.670> mean<00:04:06.330> other<00:04:06.480> than

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
no it's it's iffy and I mean other than

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.750 
no it's it's iffy and I mean other than
taking<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.200> block<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.769> machine<00:04:08.190> shop<00:04:08.459> and

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
taking the block to a machine shop and

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.360 
taking the block to a machine shop and
having<00:04:08.909> them<00:04:09.150> dip<00:04:09.450> it<00:04:09.659> you<00:04:09.840> know<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:10.799> don't<00:04:11.040> want

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
having them dip it you know I don't want

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.680 
having them dip it you know I don't want
to<00:04:11.430> do<00:04:11.549> that<00:04:11.730> because<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.510> means

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
to do that because that means

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.360 
to do that because that means
disassembling<00:04:13.530> everything<00:04:14.129> and<00:04:14.250> I<00:04:14.310> don't

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370
