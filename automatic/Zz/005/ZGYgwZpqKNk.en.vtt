00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
on top of it right there ah India ranges

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.389 
on top of it right there ah India ranges

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
so they it pokes out at the bottom and

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.219 
so they it pokes out at the bottom and
then<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.640> poops<00:01:53.790> out<00:01:54.000> pretty<00:01:54.420> much<00:01:54.479> into<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
then it poops out pretty much into the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.980 
then it poops out pretty much into the
wreath<00:01:56.030> it<00:01:57.030> goes<00:01:57.180> all<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.390> way<00:01:57.540> around<00:01:57.600> so

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
wreath it goes all the way around so

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.550 
wreath it goes all the way around so
it's<00:01:58.259> noticeable<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.600> the<00:02:00.600> player<00:02:00.840> card<00:02:01.229> I

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
it's noticeable on the player card I

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.510 
it's noticeable on the player card I
don't<00:02:02.219> come<00:02:02.549> into<00:02:02.790> focus<00:02:03.770> come<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:04.920> there<00:02:05.310> we

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
don't come into focus come on there we

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.580 
don't come into focus come on there we
go<00:02:05.610> see<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.899> see<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.320> star

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
go see you can see the star

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.080 
go see you can see the star
and<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:11.090> that's<00:02:11.420> how<00:02:12.220> that<00:02:13.220> one<00:02:13.459> is<00:02:13.580> done<00:02:13.760> and

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
and so that's how that one is done and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.690 
and so that's how that one is done and
like<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.780> said<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.290> can<00:02:15.319> do<00:02:15.650> without<00:02:16.069> player

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
like I said you can do without player

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.270 
like I said you can do without player
and<00:02:17.410> then<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.530> could<00:02:18.650> even<00:02:18.800> make<00:02:19.069> it<00:02:19.190> a

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
and then you could even make it a

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.009 
and then you could even make it a
different<00:02:19.430> color<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.209> shows<00:02:20.569> up<00:02:20.750> better<00:02:20.900> on

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
different color so it shows up better on

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.979 
different color so it shows up better on
a<00:02:21.140> gun<00:02:21.379> camo<00:02:21.830> or<00:02:21.879> background<00:02:22.879> even<00:02:23.720> on<00:02:23.810> this

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
a gun camo or background even on this

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.070 
a gun camo or background even on this
particular<00:02:24.410> background<00:02:24.890> it'll<00:02:25.370> show<00:02:25.580> up<00:02:25.760> um

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
particular background it'll show up um

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.170 
particular background it'll show up um
I'll<00:02:27.080> save<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.590> changes<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.269> see<00:02:29.660> even

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
I'll save the changes so you see even

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.660 
I'll save the changes so you see even
without<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.480> black<00:02:32.690> background<00:02:33.400> just<00:02:34.400> white

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
without the black background just white

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.089 
without the black background just white

it shows up pretty good on most
backgrounds<00:02:37.790> um<00:02:37.989> but<00:02:38.989> then<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.370> thing<00:02:40.580> is

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610
