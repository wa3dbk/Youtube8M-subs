00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:05.210
 Well and otherwise came as in 2002 Super Smash Bros Neelie Kroes data the 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.580
 Pokemon yes again on appearance 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.839
 but only two as far as I know 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.939
 04 02 clock here supports application Kvitova air and YouTube 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.939
 ohso, whether I call the duo in the 60th 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.820
 Jan Delay World of Mihály 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.820
 even if those are also important enough to use with food 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.569
 because there 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.089
 and then came in 2002 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.089
 News to return to DVD 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.240
 Means with the best result 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.240
 also something offered on yes 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.400
 Anyone who fucked me up now 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.530
 it was like that 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.430
 you tour all the memories taken on your own in the first one 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.300
 Movie 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.970
 a the only one who had the lawyer Giovanni from Tino Kirst in the morning 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.860
 now Vinz 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.650
 that would 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.080
 in the o2 will return 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.670
 and there I have myself 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.670
 but before that in the film also come last year 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.090
 supported and that was pretty much the first and only time he ever did 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.090
 especially since they met each other 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.330
 Werner Haase 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.290
 So now this is the one before 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.290
 now rarely occurs 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.380
 that's so 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.940
 Do not stop because she sees no idea with her third guest 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.939
 just not performing so often today 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.710
 and weird 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.770
 So find any Pokémon movie on DVD easily or diesel 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.090
 Nissan shows the attack 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.990
 you can see at the moment 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.970
 like at the time 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.980
 he was still good but you can tell but clearly weaker case than 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.440
 first second season 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.370
 from Maltzahn ESC had gotten new voice in the fourth season as for me 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.010
 in Bielefeld under received 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.060
 then they are right with us 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.060
 since most of them I stopped 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.849
 to look in the minus Albert 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.569
 Blattmann friends 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.849
 At the very beginning, when the track was still in progress, the voice was in train 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.959
 after Schaefer 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.150
 At the very beginning, I do not even know the top four in the fourth season 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.659
 but in the course of time she has done quite well 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.449
 they are Kunis is still always 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.919
 Mr 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.629
 Ore because what happened to us 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.069
 Dr 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.099
 he died the second spokeswoman of the shot after all 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:43.209
 but already spoken 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.069
 I already marked it 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.639
 to recycle 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.909
 Well, now the first spokeswoman of Air China is back 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:54.799
 What characterizes the year now? 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.019
 the cool 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.209
 So I think I made Cooper but normal in the future 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.240
 So a 2 2-draw ever like in the weir meter 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.149
 old spokeswoman 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:05.549
 that's right in your head 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.769
 Alone because of the Marshall the apartment search or 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.989
 the TTG North 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.449
 and you only have two percent left 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:18.380
 So around 2 2002 so far so many have said at the beginning as a doll was new 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.180
 that's just such a hype who and what then briefly delete time again 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.879
 or 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.879
 and in 2002 it was really over 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:30.019
 until the pokemon then 2003 with the above and missed and come back 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:34.159
 these again upwards or 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.159
 then it went up again something can not be cured 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:39.200
 from 2000 was but 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.200
 it is clearly up again 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.449
 At least something 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:47.139
 and if you are interested then we can talk about the third generation 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:47.889
 speak 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.639
 so the forest will knock after there 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.639
 to say something 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:55.929
 especially the raid 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:59.089
 the combat zone 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:02.289
 biggest innovation finds 

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:04.389
 So I am glad that 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.289
 gold-silver project were 

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:09.199
 Sense of life are enticing 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.479
 but I do not believe that is 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:14.679
 Also, get the ten rolls coming 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:17.249
 because you really cult 

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:20.559
 if you are curious 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:23.950
 all say alone because of the great Ostalgia Bones that we z 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.099
 Autumn gold ounces of silver better than diamond &amp; pearl 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:28.620
 which has been determined since the case 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.059
 and what makes him better than gold and silver 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:35.059
 that for Miro first Mehmedi games have played in detail 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:38.699
 I will not be there anymore 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.699
 me too 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.370
 just as exciting 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.630
 Gold Silver absolutely magical effect on many Pokemon players that even mine 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.330
 Buddy who actually does not buy any poker games so Bayer is getting this now 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.949
 remake 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.840
 And at night that's nice but not saying 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.590
 but why are the Troussier Saunders out of sorry I mean the girl which 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.960
 girl 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.610
 because the trainer we got from the contest at the beginning 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.610
 the character 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.160
 that's a secret that Winnie will find out photo dapd 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.539
 it was important to us the second word 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.469
 which she could become, for example, with Osram 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:21.219
 she had what years she had 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:23.659
 Vienna why 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.969
 so there too i am not in the know anyway is legal 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.120
 Lenovo had to fix Tauss again 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:39.739
 the real life at the 1 Herald and Party Cause I say Frenchman 

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.550
 I should be called 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.180
 So you're not the only one out of the so-called 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.210
 Aschendorf 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.539
 I also learned 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.949
 all by yourself in the Frenchman to cash the fdp-man Dirk Tel 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.080
 now breaks under the table 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.919
 content can be hot on the heels 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.490
 I loved 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.490
 to relieve Netia over the line 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.150
 about diamonds per we should also be able to talk in detail 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:08.689
 to Barroso quite a lot 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:11.349
 but just the other judge 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.430
 yes the defense time 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.900
 then please do not be with a second generation to say unless 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.650
 you would like to pay something 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.250
 now it has not all been posted on Twitter at the moment 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.159
 So, as I said, was the beginning of the second generation 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:29.159
 the culmination of the then Chocolat 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:31.919
 and then a year later 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.919
 everything is clearly ebbing away 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.039
 that is there she stands for Kambeck exuberantly 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.710
 Demba Cisse Rubens whether here or yes 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.919
 So it's still a lot of good the brand for me 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.389
 for Pokalheld now three years and then disappeared forever 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.149
 we do not hold you 

00:06:58.149 --> 00:07:01.149
 we hope we have a lot of fun with the game 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.610
 Bentz 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.860
 Above all, not Edition then would have to give the new authorized signatory 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.599
 probably a lot 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:13.019
 always a thousand doll collection must complete our group d 

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:19.539
 Let's wait and see what GM does feel about it 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:22.309
 how exactly pay attention 

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:23.349
 Jordaan 

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:26.349
 I would say finish the conversation 

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:29.520
 I thought it was nice that you use it again 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.569
 Put legs 

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:34.639
 and would be very happy if you for further discussions already 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:37.740
 Mold 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.830
 So please do not always ready 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.999
 No, everything is OK 

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:46.179
 then thanked people for looking 

00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:49.029
 me, of course, people, see you 

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:50.770
 the duo next episode 

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.960
 was talking about the third generation
