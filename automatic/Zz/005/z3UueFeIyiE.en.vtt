00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.089 

here<00:00:10.330> we<00:00:10.450> can<00:00:10.630> see<00:00:10.840> the<00:00:11.230> 90<00:00:11.620> liters<00:00:11.980> of

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:12.099 
here we can see the 90 liters of

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.549 
here we can see the 90 liters of
processed<00:00:12.610> fuel<00:00:12.940> which<00:00:13.809> now<00:00:14.080> need<00:00:14.320> to<00:00:14.349> be

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
processed fuel which now need to be

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:21.950 
processed fuel which now need to be
washed<00:00:14.830> dried<00:00:15.670> and<00:00:16.000> filtered

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.170 

this<00:00:22.960> is<00:00:23.110> achieved<00:00:23.230> by<00:00:23.710> water<00:00:24.250> washing<00:00:24.820> in

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
this is achieved by water washing in

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.060 
this is achieved by water washing in
conjunction<00:00:25.810> with<00:00:26.290> the<00:00:26.380> onboard<00:00:26.560> air<00:00:27.130> pump

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
conjunction with the onboard air pump

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.830 
conjunction with the onboard air pump
here<00:00:30.070> we<00:00:30.370> can<00:00:30.550> see<00:00:30.700> water<00:00:30.970> draining<00:00:31.540> from<00:00:31.690> the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
here we can see water draining from the

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.950 
here we can see water draining from the
first<00:00:32.080> wash<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:33.550> wash<00:00:33.790> process<00:00:34.420> is<00:00:34.660> repeated

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
first wash the wash process is repeated

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.960 
first wash the wash process is repeated
until<00:00:35.590> the<00:00:36.280> water<00:00:36.670> emerges<00:00:37.570> from<00:00:38.020> the<00:00:38.260> drain

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
until the water emerges from the drain

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.150 
until the water emerges from the drain
perfectly<00:00:39.970> clear<00:00:40.270> at<00:00:40.900> this<00:00:41.200> point<00:00:41.320> we<00:00:42.010> are

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
perfectly clear at this point we are

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.880 
perfectly clear at this point we are
completely<00:00:42.610> sure<00:00:42.970> that<00:00:43.270> the<00:00:43.930> chemistry<00:00:44.530> has

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
completely sure that the chemistry has

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.890 
completely sure that the chemistry has
been<00:00:45.250> completely<00:00:45.760> washed<00:00:46.090> out<00:00:46.300> of<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.540> fuel

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
been completely washed out of the fuel

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.670 
been completely washed out of the fuel
the<00:00:47.620> fuel<00:00:47.890> is<00:00:48.160> totally<00:00:48.760> chemical<00:00:49.270> free

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.280 

we<00:00:54.680> now<00:00:54.829> move<00:00:54.860> on<00:00:55.190> to<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.460> drying<00:00:55.760> process

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
we now move on to the drying process

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.260 
we now move on to the drying process
again<00:00:57.290> we're<00:00:57.650> using<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:58.190> onboard<00:00:58.370> air<00:00:58.880> pump

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
again we're using the onboard air pump

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.840 
again we're using the onboard air pump
here<00:00:59.930> you<00:01:00.079> can<00:01:00.260> see<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.890> air<00:01:01.070> being<00:01:01.489> filtered

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
here you can see the air being filtered

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.780 
here you can see the air being filtered
through<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.239> fuel<00:01:02.600> which<00:01:03.260> dries<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.829> fuel<00:01:04.129> so

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
through the fuel which dries the fuel so

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.850 
through the fuel which dries the fuel so
that<00:01:04.940> we<00:01:05.030> can<00:01:05.239> now<00:01:05.449> carry<00:01:05.900> on<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:06.409> filter<00:01:06.830> it

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
that we can now carry on and filter it

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.650 
that we can now carry on and filter it
here<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:07.940> can<00:01:08.119> see<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.479> filter<00:01:08.810> unit<00:01:10.660> filter

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
here you can see the filter unit filter

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.749 
here you can see the filter unit filter
unit<00:01:11.930> is<00:01:12.110> now<00:01:12.320> in<00:01:12.470> operation<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:13.250> the

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
unit is now in operation and the

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:20.020 
unit is now in operation and the
filtering<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.300> fuel<00:01:14.570> down<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.350> 5<00:01:15.560> microns

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.640 

here<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.450> see<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> pipe<00:01:21.900> emerging<00:01:22.470> from

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
here you can see the pipe emerging from

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.890 
here you can see the pipe emerging from
the<00:01:22.770> filter<00:01:23.100> unit<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.970> had<00:01:24.120> been<00:01:24.300> placed<00:01:24.540> back

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the filter unit it had been placed back

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.410 
the filter unit it had been placed back
into<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.380> processing<00:01:26.040> tank<00:01:26.310> which<00:01:26.760> allows<00:01:27.150> us

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
into the processing tank which allows us

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.110 
into the processing tank which allows us
to<00:01:27.630> multi<00:01:28.110> pass<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:29.040> fuel<00:01:29.400> over<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
to multi pass the fuel over the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.670 
to multi pass the fuel over the
filtering<00:01:30.600> element<00:01:32.930> now<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> fuel<00:01:34.470> has

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
filtering element now that the fuel has

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.800 
filtering element now that the fuel has
been<00:01:34.710> filtered<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:36.000> stored<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.630> an
