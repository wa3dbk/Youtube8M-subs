00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 It has liquid, I'm going to pour it 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.779
 water with sugar and citric acid that 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.779
 I have the previous step 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.090
 we continue and we are going to take 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.800
 shows this is already a jelly yes 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.990
 swimming is freezing but it is already a 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.510
 gelatin then we have our 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.760
 gelatine which we are going to 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.740
 divide is much better done by cups 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.810
 because this is going to give me an amount 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.110
 exact in each of the containers 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:45.489
 here will be four containers in the 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:51.270
 which I will divide my jelly for 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.270
 put color and flavor in each 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.270
 here but still a little bit then I 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.970
 I go to cup rooms which I 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.690
 I will be able 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.230
 and live perfectly in quantities 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.230
 exactly the same 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:15.690
 and I'm practically finishing with my 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.590
 we continue with our procedure 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.540
 let's add a teaspoon of 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.439
 concentrated in each of our 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.159
 divisions that we made of the gelatin already 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.720
 prepared a color and a flavor these 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.580
 concentrates where we are going to find 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.740
 Well, we will find them in any 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.840
 raw materials store and let me 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.770
 tell you that they are also super super 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.790
 economic and also yielding this you 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.210
 it's going to be good for so much jelly 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.850
 shot you'll see how economical it is 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.850
 also prepare this type of fish 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.350
 Well now let's oil each 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.010
 one of our molds with oil 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.660
 vegetable or corn oil in this case not 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.550
 I recommend you use butter 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.400
 if you use butter you can 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.290
 opaque both your gelatin and is the last 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.710
 what do we want to happen to you then here 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.660
 as if you were drying your mold 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.070
 practically there are no droplets and 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.070
 we are practically 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:34.110
 right away we're going to put our gelatin 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.650
 in each of our molds having 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.890
 be careful that we do not have bubbles 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.890
 these bubbles 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.650
 they go 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.819
 yes 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.659
 and we go to the refrigerator 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.460
 and 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.460
 Y 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.459
 Y 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.670
 in the second part of this recipe 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.120
 elaborate ace milk gelatin 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.120
 special
