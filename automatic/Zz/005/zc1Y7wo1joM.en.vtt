00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.199 

I<00:02:10.369> made<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.239> changes<00:02:11.569> experience<00:02:12.020> today<00:02:13.209> how

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
I made the changes experience today how

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.330 
I made the changes experience today how
deciding<00:02:14.630> against<00:02:14.900> dragons<00:02:15.340> insecurities

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
deciding against dragons insecurities

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.729 
deciding against dragons insecurities
and<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.599> also<00:02:17.750> hits<00:02:18.050> some<00:02:18.230> things<00:02:18.410> as<00:02:18.530> well

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
and it also hits some things as well

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.080 
and it also hits some things as well
looks<00:02:18.950> like<00:02:19.010> we<00:02:19.280> hit<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.459> petition<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.000> they

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
looks like we hit the petition and they

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.960 
looks like we hit the petition and they
don't<00:02:20.239> have<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.620> lamps<00:02:21.620> then<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:22.220> ever<00:02:22.760> ate<00:02:22.940> a

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
don't have the lamps then I ever ate a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.820 
don't have the lamps then I ever ate a
full<00:02:23.270> time<00:02:23.450> via<00:02:23.989> temperance<00:02:24.500> which<00:02:24.650> really

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
full time via temperance which really

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.250 
full time via temperance which really
good<00:02:25.069> and<00:02:25.610> then<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:26.180> guess<00:02:26.540> dragons<00:02:26.989> they<00:02:27.080> can't

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
good and then I guess dragons they can't

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.199 
good and then I guess dragons they can't
