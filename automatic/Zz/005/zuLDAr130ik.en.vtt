00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.540
 If I do the lettering then I will 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.300
 I would like to give the whole thing away 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.630
 and I'll pack this in here 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.710
 these are 5 gift boxes from rossmann 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.330
 for 349 and they look that way 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.720
 then my break chocolate pure 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:39.380
 I write at least yes what it 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.330
 for a chocolate is and in the following 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.890
 I'll just show you how to do it now 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.620
 this break chocolate quite simply 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.510
 Do it yourself will be my first 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.400
 combination with which I start and 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.290
 ally milk chocolate hollyweed and 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.550
 smarties 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.750
 first and foremost 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.310
 of course now to melt 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.870
 I just have one for that 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.600
 normal water bat made so 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.070
 bigger pot of boiling water and 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.820
 a smaller pot was hung up 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.200
 now is chocolate in it and there must 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.690
 we wait for this to swing 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.220
 and melting chocolate is liquid 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.940
 and I'm distributing that now 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.820
 just on such a tin what I'm with 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.000
 as oli lined and then 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.770
 come the ingredients dream so that looks 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.660
 Now let's go and now we'll leave it 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.000
 Just cool down before we put it in 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.830
 Pieces could break the hot break 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.510
 chocolate 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.460
 my second chocolate is white 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.090
 Chocolate with the chocolate flex I have to 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.560
 say the couverture of doctor than me 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.830
 not so well done since she did 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.450
 is bad is bad melted 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.820
 then be badly distributed here 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.130
 It does not taste so good either 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.750
 the wish to dissuade you and also dear 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.190
 Linn's ones really recommend that 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.250
 I take that now also at the 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.060
 others use another one 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.940
 Delicate chocolate with lemon peel 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.030
 lack and cranberries made that is 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.050
 full of milk also with hiking trails and 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.610
 smarties 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:14.400
 and now again milk chocolate 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.500
 smarties and gummy bears now easy 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.480
 everything cool in the refrigerator until it 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.150
 really got stuck and then 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.980
 we can break that into pieces 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.570
 since the whole book correspond to chocolate 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.900
 we now just the finished chocolate 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.780
 still in small parts and I have you yes 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.209
 already shown what I pack then 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.340
 going away and will 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.950
 that was my video to actually like 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.560
 really super high chocolate 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.420
 to do it yourself is with your own 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.709
 favorite ingredients are your imagination 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.900
 no limits set 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.580
