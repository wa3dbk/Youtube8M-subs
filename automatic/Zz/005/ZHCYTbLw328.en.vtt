Touch we can tell from the battery
indicator<00:00:53.550> at<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.030> top<00:00:54.090> right<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.350> very

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
indicator at the top right that is very

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.830 
indicator at the top right that is very
close<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.280> running<00:00:56.430> out<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.699> battery<00:00:57.239> because

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
close to running out of battery because

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.560 
close to running out of battery because
then<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.100> battery<00:00:59.460> looks<00:00:59.550> empty<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.180> there's

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
then the battery looks empty and there's

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.330 
then the battery looks empty and there's
a<00:01:00.629> little<00:01:00.840> bit<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:00.989> red<00:01:01.289> there<00:01:01.680> at<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> side<00:01:02.129> so

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
a little bit of red there at the side so

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.630 
a little bit of red there at the side so
it's<00:01:02.489> less<00:01:02.640> than<00:01:02.910> 20%<00:01:03.420> let's<00:01:04.019> say<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.979> how<00:01:05.580> do

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
it's less than 20% let's say so how do

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.510 
it's less than 20% let's say so how do
we<00:01:05.790> charge<00:01:06.030> these<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.740> now<00:01:07.740> at<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> bottom<00:01:08.130> of

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
plug these two go in to each other like

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.520 
plug these two go in to each other like
this

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
this

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.899 
this
now<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.590> other<00:01:37.799> end<00:01:38.009> can<00:01:38.189> go<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.670> two

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
now the other end can go in one of two

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.569 
now the other end can go in one of two
places<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.259> easiest<00:01:40.500> places<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:41.220> into

places one of the easiest places is into

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.460 
places one of the easiest places is into
the<00:01:41.670> side<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.000> your<00:01:42.060> computer<00:01:42.570> now<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.439> a

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
the side of your computer now this is a

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.950 
the side of your computer now this is a
USB<00:01:43.920> connector<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.149> can<00:01:45.270> see<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.630> from

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
USB connector and you can see that from

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.980 
USB connector and you can see that from
the<00:01:46.380> little<00:01:46.649> USB<00:01:47.220> symbol<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:48.030> there<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.840> on

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the little USB symbol just there and on

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.840 
the little USB symbol just there and on
the<00:01:49.079> side<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.530> all<00:01:49.770> computers<00:01:50.460> these<00:01:50.790> days

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the side of all computers these days

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.330 
the side of all computers these days
there<00:01:51.509> will<00:01:51.630> also<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.049> USB<00:01:52.649> connector<00:01:53.040> there

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
there will also be a USB connector there

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.959 
there will also be a USB connector there
so<00:01:53.850> we'll<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:54.420> plug<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.640> where<00:01:56.640> we<00:01:56.820> go

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
so we'll just plug it in and where we go

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.819 
so we'll just plug it in and where we go
now<00:01:57.600> something<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.049> may<00:01:58.290> notice<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
now something you may notice on the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.679 
now something you may notice on the
computer<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> couple<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.909> popups<00:02:00.450> tell<00:02:00.600> you

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
computer is a couple of popups tell you

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.389 
computer is a couple of popups tell you
those<00:02:00.810> loading<00:02:01.350> some<00:02:01.560> software<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.219> stuff

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
those loading some software and stuff

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.190 
those loading some software and stuff
