00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.000
 hi here again here are some 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:09.770
 viola work and this video review is 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.049
 it's about a figure from the series of 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:16.730
 comics of the toy line of the 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:19.160
 amazing spider-man and I bring you the leader 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.990
 attack green goblin or attack in 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.420
 glider from where to see 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.960
 this is a figure and brought forward to 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.849
 get it for a long time and just 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.849
 I could get the warm 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.990
 we see 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.780
 and here comes the image of spider-man 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.480
 how it takes in the movie the amazing 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.750
 spider-man with exiles 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.440
 and a future is great from the pitcher 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.040
 missile 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.010
 leader attack well from behind 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.990
 the recommendations of a missile a photo 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.440
 where the missile is dropped and then a 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.300
 catalog of other figures doctor octopus 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.870
 spider man spider man black sweet 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:13.030
 spider-man as greeting from the king of before 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:16.970
 to become the scarlet spider 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.130
 I am in the near future a review of 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.330
 these trains 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.970
 efe 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.970
 let's start with multiple n 2 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.660
 very stable my truth 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:38.080
 glider we see that it is a kind of 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.500
 missile with bat wings is the 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.680
 missile has that face denounced as the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.750
 comics only if they had painted 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.540
 a purple color as always came out in 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.780
 the comics and cartoons would have been 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.960
 very well 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.230
 we see the molded detail in the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.550
 glider 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:04.420
 and this service we press this button what 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.280
 shoot and when you do not have the button or 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.140
 when the missile does not have forgiveness when 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:14.030
 the cousins 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:17.740
 and he can also do it with him 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.490
 but without taking the spring 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.880
 if you want it you can go out and it's something 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.880
 loose 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.030
 it was not a figure 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.470
 a figure that has these 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.730
 small holes so that when you put it in 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.670
 this act on this little button 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.770
 all right 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.280
 which is now very similar to the 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.280
 comic 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.760
 has with its purple tail 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.760
 it comes with fists 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.780
 a hand that would have been good to him 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.760
 they had put is one of their bombs their 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.720
 pumpkin shape 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.540
 comes molded with 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.840
 with the musculature and these wrinkles of the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.990
 clothing also comes back the same 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.350
 muscles of the back wrinkles 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:23.030
 the green part we see 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:25.310
 we have that texture like flakes very 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.940
 beautiful 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.239
 foot we see that the classic form of a 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.239
 elf 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.970
 a very good figure we are going to your 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.510
 joints that sometimes rotates 360 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.239
 degrees can you say yes for your tour 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.000
 360 degrees you can see what you can 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:48.180
 be on the side all you can 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.390
 flex and this can rotate 360 ​​degrees 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.650
 the other is exactly the same 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:04:00.540
 rotate 360 ​​degrees at the sides it flexes 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:02.459
 and 360 the leg back is all 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.050
 if forward is everything I think it would be 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:10.130
 about 80 degrees what you can do 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:14.130
 again the same thing is all that is 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:19.230
 can flex and can rotate 360 ​​degrees 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:21.570
 same as I said 360 push - ups the 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:27.050
 true but it has many joints 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.050
 but doing that has good poses 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.860
 but its stability does not help 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.050
 you can see me 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.990
 we liked to stay, no, it's not obvious that 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.230
 here you have pressed as if it were for 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.230
 stop 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:58.330
 you can grab good things despite 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.550
 its limited possibility but 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.110
 but its stability does not help you as 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:08.590
 I said well it's a good clear figure that 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.719
 if I recommend you obviously in special 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:16.360
 if you're a big fan like me 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:19.479
 spider-man or produce is a great when 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.710
 spider-man or a big fan of the character 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.710
 I am both 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:28.480
 or if you do not have a few figures from 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.920
 gift of clear light green beginning 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.920
 and good 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.330
 and he does not like it he does not like to stay 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.990
 on the skateboard the truth 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.990
 but 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.410
 I think it's not a big problem 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.830
 another thing that I liked is that 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.860
 they had put one of their pumpkin bombs 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.879
 I think I already said 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:59.219
 but they did not give us that well 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:01.710
 a movie comes out but not even the 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:04.259
 Green Goblin appeared in the film as 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.810
 more is going to put the pumpkin from 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:09.210
 herds age that says series of 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.340
 comic convictions so no 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.340
 it has nothing to do with the movie 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:19.400
 nor did this version of the 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:22.010
 Spiderman much less is very much 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.639
 less this achievement but opted for neither 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:27.500
 even be the shoulder change boiler if 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:31.270
 they have not seen the movie do not change 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:34.240
 Normans where he is named a lot 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.860
 and rather poor the plot is made very in 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.639
 the bottom 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.639
 and bing 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.760
 I do not recommend it, I do not recommend it 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.100
 if they find it 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.650
 They did not find a start because I 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.200
 comes a store then it was not already and 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:56.780
 I found it in liverpool or in a 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:58.460
 very expensive amount of 250 pesos for 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.050
 what this cost me and what these costs 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:06.920
 and yesterday I found it in the amount of 160 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:09.030
 and the truth is not 250 pesos for this 

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.940
 figure I think it's not worth it 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:16.500
 I think it's better if these 260 are going to be 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:19.890
 and 250 pesos better now and buy the 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.720
 marvel legends version another occasion 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:25.470
 of the green goblin because the truth is 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:33.150
 this figure for 250 is not worth it so 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:36.810
 if you pay more than 160 150 in one price 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:40.700
 accessible if you live this has been all 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.700
 I say goodbye bye friends
