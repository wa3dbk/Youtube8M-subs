00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.780
 The aim of this center 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.730
 Stretching is precisely the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.750
 training of the crews of 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.630
 flight 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.110
 this is to increase the margins of 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.080
 security and develop the skills 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.670
 for the safe operation of the material 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.690
 flight that in this case are the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.629
 Bell helicopters 212 the advantages come 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.330
 being precisely increase those 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.140
 safety margins during 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:43.110
 operations that they are going to carry out in 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:47.870
 a future already framed in the units 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.870
 own that have helicopters 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.320
 simulators of the company fly 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.810
 American and it serves us well 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.660
 mainly so that you know the 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.060
 student who actually performs maneuvers 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.040
 both basic and advanced that comes 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.260
 being of emergencies arrivals and departures 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.020
 mainly from a certain 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.910
 airport can be from an airport 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.140
 national or international good here 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.310
 we our function is precisely 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.260
 take the pilot to one to one condition 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.570
 in which you get to present some 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.900
 emergency or in this case some 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.259
 atmospheric condition that was the most 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.270
 favorable we can arrive and see that as 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.640
 your reaction and train what 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.560
 mainly so you can have the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.680
 enough capacity to solve that 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.790
 good problem of achievements is 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.320
 precisely that already the staff that 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.930
 he has trained here because he is already 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.729
 nourishing precisely the ranks of 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.500
 the operational units of force 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.810
 aerial 469 aviator pilots have been 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.940
 trained here in the center of this 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.250
 since 2007 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.980
 when it caused discharge from the center 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.960
 enlistment helicopters 7000 hours 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.810
 is what has flown in the aircraft 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.820
 that is assigned in the center of 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.430
 Extra lie helicopter but 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.380
 we also train in four 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.910
 simulators that as of 2010 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.610
 they caused high here in the center of this 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.100
 what is the flight by 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.780
 instruments here we have trained 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.310
 around 790 aviator pilots 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.800
 contributing at the same time in the formation of 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.340
 leaders of excellence 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.340
