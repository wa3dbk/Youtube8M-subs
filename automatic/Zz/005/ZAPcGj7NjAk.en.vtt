00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.939
 when we are often tempted 

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:11.969
 to be able to replace a product with another product not because its 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.009
 consumption does not suit us either because we think we're going to marry them 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.839
 essences and therefore have a little more satisfaction 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.509
 the problem arises for the fruits the fruit juices the compotes and all the 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:24.789
 derivatives ie 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.599
 all we are going to do is make fruit-based things like the worries 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.819
 the current time 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:32.029
 in fact fruit you have to know that he is a child that contains 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.880
 parade arms 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.250
 but also all the characteristics of the fruit, that is to say 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.370
 some vitamins few clicks times some nicolet denies 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.370
 brief micronutrients that are interesting enough for our health 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.410
 when it is transformed into compost form it does not lose any of its 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.510
 features unless heated 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.200
 the feast of warming this fruit vaka probably makes some of these contributions 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.900
 in vitamins and so the milk will take him out and then turned the crimes 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.660
 to be a little more mixer and therefore a little less fiber cons 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.570
 it will always count as much water unless in evaporation neighborhoods 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.520
 what we buy today 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.159
 in the form of fruit juices or marigolds are slightly different products 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.700
 first because the preparation that was used to make this type of products is 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.619
 often a frozen type of preparation that is to say purees of 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.320
 fruits that were frozen a few months ago 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.920
 and that were used to extract the juice 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.940
 and make a game that we put in bottles you to make a 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.439
 species of diluted puree 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.910
 that's called this month but these are dead from that time 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.810
 that the transformation will take place 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.390
 these products have therefore undergone a double transformation 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.039
 firstly they were created based on puree 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.219
 or frozen fruit that has lost 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.090
 some of their nutritional value 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.630
 but then they undergo a second transformation 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.650
 which makes them fall back again 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.240
 a certain amount of vitamins 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.020
 they lose their most important nutritional characteristics 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.810
 unless it was in Russia and vitamins what you need to observe on 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.609
 the boxes 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:59.920
 then at that time 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.890
 slight thrill size not the same nutritional characteristics as 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.400
 homemade compotes or fruits 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.630
 which are consumed in a natural way as for the compotes of the trade she 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.040
 presents a little the same characteristics as the worries it is 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.760
 to say that they are purees of fruits but which have undergone a double 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.639
 treatment 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.589
 we lost some of their nutritional interest 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.539
 so to your ticket if you want to work a little consume the 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:26.319
 raw fruit or stewed or stewed and you prepare yourself 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.579
 even if you really do not have the choice absorbed a small fraction of 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.149
 sugar in the form of fruit juice compost or this gentleman but know that 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:36.149
 you will not have it all the vitamins inside and that it is recommended 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:39.629
 for you to alternate a little there with each other so good appetite 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:40.169
 and see you
