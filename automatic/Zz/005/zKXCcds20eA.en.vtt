chord is going to be the G chord in each
chord<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.020> kind<00:04:04.350> of<00:04:04.470> pick<00:04:04.650> it<00:04:04.740> differently

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
chord you kind of pick it differently

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.820 
chord you kind of pick it differently
but<00:04:05.310> it's<00:04:05.460> not<00:04:05.760> like<00:04:06.330> a<00:04:06.570> big<00:04:07.080> difference<00:04:07.500> and

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
but it's not like a big difference and

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.950 
but it's not like a big difference and
after<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.520> start<00:04:08.820> getting<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.240> pattern<00:04:09.660> like

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
after you start getting the pattern like

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.100 
after you start getting the pattern like
down<00:04:10.230> how<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.470> how<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:10.920> do<00:04:11.660> picking<00:04:12.660> then<00:04:12.930> you

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
down how to how to do picking then you

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.560 
down how to how to do picking then you
you<00:04:13.590> know<00:04:13.620> carried<00:04:14.040> on<00:04:14.130> so<00:04:14.610> I<00:04:14.640> do<00:04:14.790> this<00:04:15.120> sixth

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
you know carried on so I do this sixth

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:22.060 
you know carried on so I do this sixth
string<00:04:15.870> fourth<00:04:16.850> second<00:04:17.850> first<00:04:18.090> six<00:04:18.390> ago

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.090 

so<00:04:22.700> six<00:04:23.120> four<00:04:23.480> seconds<00:04:24.020> five<00:04:24.170> seconds

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.140 
and then I changed the cord and I go to
fifth<00:04:33.480> fourth<00:04:34.080> third<00:04:34.550> second<00:04:35.550> per<00:04:35.700> second

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
fifth fourth third second per second

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.260 
fifth fourth third second per second

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
before third second per second and then

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.990 
before third second per second and then
I<00:04:39.540> do<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:40.170> E<00:04:40.200> minor<00:04:40.560> chord<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:41.130> I<00:04:41.160> stay<00:04:41.760> on<00:04:41.790> the

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
fifth I do the same chord pattern and I

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.900 
fifth I do the same chord pattern and I
DC<00:04:45.390> so<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.840> only<00:04:46.140> difference<00:04:46.530> is<00:04:46.800> going<00:04:47.670> to<00:04:47.730> be

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
DC so the only difference is going to be

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.420 
DC so the only difference is going to be
the<00:04:48.090> one<00:04:48.270> for<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.780> D<00:04:48.990> chord<00:04:49.170> so<00:04:49.710> you<00:04:50.070> start<00:04:50.340> on

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
the one for the D chord so you start on

00:04:50.430 --> 00:05:02.659 
the one for the D chord so you start on
the<00:04:53.690> you<00:04:54.690> change<00:04:55.080> go<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.680> fifth<00:04:55.980> string

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.430 

he<00:05:03.669> just<00:05:03.880> gotta<00:05:04.120> keep<00:05:04.900> practicing<00:05:05.110> and

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
he just gotta keep practicing and

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.800 
he just gotta keep practicing and
eventually<00:05:05.889> you'll<00:05:06.009> get<00:05:06.190> it<00:05:06.479> after<00:05:07.479> you<00:05:07.690> do<00:05:07.780> a

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
eventually you'll get it after you do a

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.990 
eventually you'll get it after you do a
whole<00:05:08.199> bunch<00:05:08.350> you<00:05:08.620> eventually<00:05:09.130> get<00:05:09.819> it<00:05:09.910> with

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
whole bunch you eventually get it with

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.240 
whole bunch you eventually get it with
your<00:05:10.120> eyes<00:05:10.240> closed<00:05:10.479> so<00:05:10.780> you<00:05:10.990> do<00:05:11.530> that<00:05:11.860> for<00:05:12.190> the

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
your eyes closed so you do that for the

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.830 
your eyes closed so you do that for the
whole<00:05:12.310> strumming<00:05:12.970> for<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.389> whole<00:05:13.509> picking

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
whole strumming for the whole picking

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.950 
whole strumming for the whole picking

I'm sorry so and at the end of the after

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.469 
I'm sorry so and at the end of the after
the<00:05:17.080> C<00:05:17.319> chord<00:05:17.590> she<00:05:17.770> does<00:05:17.919> like<00:05:18.099> this<00:05:18.310> so<00:05:19.270> she'll

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
the C chord she does like this so she'll

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:28.260 
the C chord she does like this so she'll
go<00:05:19.630> like<00:05:19.810> this<00:05:21.720> how<00:05:22.720> long<00:05:26.610> she<00:05:27.610> does<00:05:27.759> that<00:05:28.000> sort

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
go like this how long she does that sort

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.230 
go like this how long she does that sort
of<00:05:28.360> thing<00:05:28.419> so<00:05:29.020> it's<00:05:29.169> gonna<00:05:29.259> be<00:05:30.150> for<00:05:31.150> the

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
of thing so it's gonna be for the

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.460 
of thing so it's gonna be for the
fingers<00:05:31.630> you're<00:05:32.319> gonna<00:05:32.440> go<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:34.030> fifth<00:05:35.020> string

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
fingers you're gonna go the fifth string

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.110 
fingers you're gonna go the fifth string
so<00:05:36.160> you're<00:05:36.310> going<00:05:36.430> to<00:05:36.460> have<00:05:36.610> it<00:05:36.729> in<00:05:36.849> the<00:05:36.940> C

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
so you're going to have it in the C

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.310 
so you're going to have it in the C
chord<00:05:37.360> because<00:05:37.509> that's<00:05:37.720> what<00:05:37.870> you<00:05:37.960> can<00:05:38.080> do<00:05:38.169> it

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
chord because that's what you can do it

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.370 
chord because that's what you can do it
sing<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.789> C<00:05:40.060> chord<00:05:40.330> finish<00:05:40.780> string<00:05:41.050> you<00:05:41.169> pick

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
it then you move back to the E minor you

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.189
