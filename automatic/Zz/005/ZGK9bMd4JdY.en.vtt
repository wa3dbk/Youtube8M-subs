you<00:01:37.079> can<00:01:37.229> see<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> third<00:01:37.829> one<00:01:37.860> down<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.640> stomp

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
you can see the third one down the stomp

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.490

is<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.750> big-ass<00:01:40.350> crit<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:42.030> way<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.689> can<00:01:43.290> see

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
is a big-ass crit so this way I can see

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.350 
is a big-ass crit so this way I can see
it<00:01:43.590> being<00:01:43.770> very<00:01:44.070> very<00:01:44.340> useful<00:01:44.610> indeed<00:01:45.000> without

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
it being very very useful indeed without

Sam again the use of an add-on or
something<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:49.079> piece<00:01:49.350> together

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
something like that to piece together

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.679 
something like that to piece together
stuff<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.369> us<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:51.090> could<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.299> very<00:01:51.390> useful

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
stuff for us this could be very useful

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.960 
stuff for us this could be very useful
indeed<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.649> people<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.100> readers<00:01:53.790> for
