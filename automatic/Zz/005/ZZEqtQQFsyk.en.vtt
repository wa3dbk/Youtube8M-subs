00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello with you for this video about top 10 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.370
 best poet useful games and programs 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.519
 for android and ios and I will say right away that 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.240
 videos of this kind are 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.740
 subjective since i'm talking about 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.320
 your favorite programs on these 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.869
 operating systems and if you have 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.060
 some kind of opinion then write about it in 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.670
 comments write programs like 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.060
 you and I think it will be interesting to watch 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.480
 and in tenth place I have located 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.550
 a game 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.879
 control the java there is my favorite game of 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.320
 castrol series because it is very bright 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.489
 and colorful recently it has been refreshed to 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.120
 disco era era versions are more accurate to era locations 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.719
 disco 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.090
 here, as we always imagine, feed 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.399
 two lights move and 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.329
 what is unusual here is what appeared 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.010
 one more ball like that 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.729
 able to reflect 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.770
 here are these streams of light and we, as always 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.960
 representative feed two pairs of nems 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.580
 once again I remind hotels every router 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.020
 top tenth place ninth place 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.659
 shazam program is located 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.880
 it is designed to recognize 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.759
 music that is you will like this 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.460
 melody you turn it on and at the same time 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.110
 run the shazam program and program 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.360
 recognizes this tune by 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.939
 I think the Internet is the brain is an obvious thing for 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.869
 each user and it takes 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:40.710
 quite a bit but eighth place 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.869
 there is a program download on useful 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.180
 exclusively for ios users 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.610
 since in android more open 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.159
 operating system and you can download 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.780
 video directly from the browser there is 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:57.360
 the function is missing so you can 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.060
 download the program download go to the site 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.799
 this program is 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.310
 Internet browser something like safari 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.469
 you enter the site and you can 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.310
 download the movie and download and they have you 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.800
 then displayed in the files folder 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.380
 and you can watch some firms that is 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.780
 I think that a very useful program 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.160
 will be for many users about and 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.270
 devices in seventh place 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.769
 a game 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:32.209
 secret typhus I play it like on my iPod 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.739
 And on the tablet and I think that of course 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.840
 it will be more convenient for me to play 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:42.730
 tablet because you will run for 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:45.290
 little creature for a little rebel 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.750
 who constantly wants something from someone 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.480
 to steal 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.920
 so it will certainly be more convenient to play 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.810
 On a larger screen, well, if the tablet 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.630
 not always at hand as it happens in 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:04.069
 my case is on the phone too 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.049
 play in sixth place is 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.080
 snapseed program 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.930
 I do not know if this is a program on android 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.560
 however you have it and she is very 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.440
 comfortable 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.079
 this is a google image editor 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.660
 besides not i also use more 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.780
 photoshop express however snapseed to me 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.940
 like a little more thanks to my 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.910
 the interface is all intuitive 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.650
 can add a variety of effects 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.870
 frameworks of course this is a close photo 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.799
 white balance brightness contrast and 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.310
 can create 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.920
 in my opinion very cool photos on 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.150
 the fifth place is the word program 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.989

 explanatory dictionary for modern people 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.870
 I use this program every day 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.720
 look new words added 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.880
 here to show but to 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.019
 updated database need connection 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.540
 to the Internet 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:08.139
 also there is a word search can be found 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.139

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:16.300
 how to spotlight search and 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.760
 can add words to favorites ie 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.400
 very cool application I use it 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.350
 and recommend it to everyone 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.330
 fourth place program English-Russian 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.860
 vocabulary 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.470
 very often when i need to translate 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.330
 some word and appeal precisely to this 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.570
 the program is fly 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:40.930
 dictionary containing a huge database of words and 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:44.110

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:48.250
 the place I have is the program 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.350
 Yandex navigator still have of course 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.910
 standard google maps on my tablet 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.560
 but I use apples with 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.820
 navigator if why on my tablet 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.810
 have gps 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.990
 but there is no 3g module and did not look for such 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.530
 a program that may have embedded 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.860
 maps and work offline 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:13.000
 for example, I now have gps 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.410
 see a member i'm in lviv here at 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.040
 Internet connection can be 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:21.640
 see if traffic jam can be found 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:25.300
 routes are also in the settings 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:28.150
 the ability to download maps choose 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.430
 Download maps, select a region and 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.650

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:44.920
 subway surf program game of course 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:49.210
 I'm tired of it but for me 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.750
 each user has a favorite runner 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.210
 your 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.200

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:59.020
 This is a very bright and colorful game also 1 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.570
 each month the ram is up to some 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.210
 new location meaning you are playing 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.670
 some city are some action 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:10.390
 constantly that is buying characters 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:12.969
 buying skateboards constantly 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.969
 updated places where you run 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:17.879
 all that is a game that is 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:21.159
 You can play in the queue at the supermarket 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:25.899
 I recommend it to everyone in school 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:30.519
 and in the first place is not the game gta 

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:34.089
 san andreas think it is very 

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:37.779
 cool game many and waited on a and weight 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:40.559
 devices and on their android on android 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:43.149
 devices it goes on everyone only on 

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:45.929
 less powerful which have 

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:48.399
 gigabytes of ram 

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:51.309
 preferably dual core processor and 

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:53.379
 naturally higher game requirements 

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:55.959
 really turned out good 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:58.169
 it's all the same good old jetta san 

00:06:55.959 --> 00:07:01.360
 andreas which was the era so far 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:04.119
 as I said in the previous video 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.649
 tutorial for downloading jetta sandra 

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:07.959
 that basically nothing here 

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:10.299
 changed but should not yet 

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:13.089
 accused say they have improved 

00:07:10.299 --> 00:07:16.539
 graphics but again I repeat that I 

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:18.189
 This is not very noticeable but play me in 

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:20.979
 this game is very popular with all of her 

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:23.289
 I recommend you will be available to the whole state 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:25.719
 which will be three cities 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:26.800
 many settlements and endless 

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:28.689
 number of missions 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.489
 but here our video came to an end 

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:32.489
 thank you for watching through to the end 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.660
