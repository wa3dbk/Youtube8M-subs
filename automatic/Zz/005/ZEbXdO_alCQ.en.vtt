00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.140
 Good evening, people. I'm doing. 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.460
 here is a quick video only for those who have a 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.179
 renoir 1.6 16v I discovered that my car 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.369
 it was kind of sped up 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.160
 so the right vote is now on 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.890
 that I discovered motor people he was 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:32.960
 accelerated too much or when it was not 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.960
 varying the rotation here that I did 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.610
 Do you see the son? 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:47.840
 when aimed at the brakes considered more 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:47.840
 still hearing the ring 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:57.110
 but I had not seen to renew 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:02:01.179
 since that cable was about the 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.179
 surprise he accelerated nothing more 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.590
 do not gas them
