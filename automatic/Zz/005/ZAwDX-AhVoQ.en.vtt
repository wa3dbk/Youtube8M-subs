so<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:01.680> kinect<00:00:01.979> for<00:00:02.040> windows<00:00:02.159> device<00:00:02.760> doesn't

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
so the kinect for windows device doesn't

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.880 
so the kinect for windows device doesn't
actually<00:00:03.540> come<00:00:03.870> with<00:00:04.080> any<00:00:04.230> kind<00:00:04.500> of<00:00:04.560> software

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
actually come with any kind of software

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.970 
actually come with any kind of software

it's<00:00:07.980> just<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.340> device<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:09.019> right<00:00:10.019> now<00:00:10.260> there

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
it's just the device and right now there

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.410 
it's just the device and right now there
aren't<00:00:10.860> really<00:00:11.099> many<00:00:11.429> applications<00:00:12.269> out

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
aren't really many applications out

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.240 
aren't really many applications out
there<00:00:12.450> for<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.380> fact<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.710> don't<00:00:13.769> know<00:00:13.950> if<00:00:14.040> any

site and you'll have to come up to

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.929 
site and you'll have to come up to
develop<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.769> go<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.880> download<00:00:24.300> sdk<00:00:25.199> and

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
develop and go to the download sdk and

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.189 
develop and go to the download sdk and
then<00:00:26.939> from<00:00:27.090> here<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.570> just<00:00:27.720> download<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
then from here you can just download the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.019 
then from here you can just download the
sdk<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.859> can<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.699> know<00:00:29.820> start

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
sdk so you can you know start

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.790 
sdk so you can you know start
programming<00:00:30.599> forward<00:00:30.869> if<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:30.990> want<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.289> but

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
programming forward if you want to but

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.500 
programming forward if you want to but
the<00:00:31.949> file<00:00:32.130> size<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.610> little<00:00:33.000> bit<00:00:33.090> big<00:00:33.300> so

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the file size is a little bit big so

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.310 
the file size is a little bit big so
I've<00:00:34.170> gone<00:00:34.350> ahead<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.800> downloaded<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.579> and

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
I've gone ahead and downloaded it and

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.080 
I've gone ahead and downloaded it and
I've<00:00:37.320> got<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.590> right<00:00:37.710> here<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.430> after<00:00:38.670> you

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
I've got it right here and so after you

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.700 
I've got it right here and so after you
install<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:41.300> kinect<00:00:42.300> sdk<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.440> get<00:00:43.590> this

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
install the the kinect sdk you get this

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.319 
install the the kinect sdk you get this
little<00:00:43.920> program<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.520> open<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:44.910> that

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
little program that you can open up that

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.750 
little program that you can open up that
is<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.750> kinect<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.289> windows<00:00:46.440> sdk<00:00:47.100> sample

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
is the kinect for windows sdk sample

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.729 
is the kinect for windows sdk sample
browser<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.300> what<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.079> allows<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.620> do

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
browser and what this allows you to do

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.799 
browser and what this allows you to do
is<00:00:50.039> see<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> actual<00:00:50.940> code<00:00:51.270> for<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> couple

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
is see the actual code for a couple

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.590 
is see the actual code for a couple
different<00:00:51.870> things<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.610> run<00:00:53.610> some<00:00:53.789> samples<00:00:54.149> so

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
different things and run some samples so

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.170 
different things and run some samples so
the<00:00:55.260> key<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.860> that's<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> most<00:00:56.670> fun<00:00:56.910> to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the key one that that's the most fun to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.670 
the key one that that's the most fun to
start<00:00:57.329> out<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.870> see<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> Kinect

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
start out just to see what the Kinect

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.490 
start out just to see what the Kinect
can<00:00:58.859> do<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.329> connect<00:01:00.329> explore<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.989> if

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
can do is just connect explore and if

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.070 
can do is just connect explore and if
you<00:01:01.590> click<00:01:01.739> run<00:01:02.010> sample<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:03.660> application

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
you click run sample the application

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.359 
you click run sample the application
will<00:01:04.140> pop<00:01:04.379> up<00:01:04.409> you'll<00:01:04.710> see<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.010> little<00:01:05.189> guy

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
will pop up you'll see this little guy

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.700 
will pop up you'll see this little guy
right<00:01:05.400> here<00:01:05.659> this<00:01:06.659> guy<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.869> important<00:01:07.350> because

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
right here this guy is important because

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.880 
right here this guy is important because
he<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:09.290> basically<00:01:10.290> telling<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
he is basically telling you that the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.149 
he is basically telling you that the
Kinect<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.369> actually<00:01:12.030> active<00:01:12.390> connected<00:01:13.159> but

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
Kinect is actually active connected but

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.480 
Kinect is actually active connected but
this<00:01:14.430> right<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> actual<00:01:16.490> connect

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
this right here is the actual connect

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.300 
this right here is the actual connect
Explorer<00:01:18.030> window<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.710> let's<00:01:19.979> go<00:01:20.100> ahead<00:01:20.130> make

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
Explorer window so let's go ahead make

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.080 
Explorer window so let's go ahead make
this<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.520> little<00:01:20.640> bit<00:01:20.820> bigger<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:22.820> with<00:01:23.820> this

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
this a little bit bigger and with this

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.230 
this a little bit bigger and with this
you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.689> see<00:01:24.960> now<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.560> see<00:01:25.710> me<00:01:25.979> hi<00:01:26.580> again

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
you can see now you can see me hi again

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.660 
you can see now you can see me hi again
and<00:01:27.500> you<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.650> see<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.860> what<00:01:28.979> what<00:01:29.310> actually

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
and you can see that what what actually

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.160 
and you can see that what what actually
is<00:01:29.759> coming<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.240> from<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.479> Kinect<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:31.020> see

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
is coming in from the Kinect you can see

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.609 
is coming in from the Kinect you can see
that<00:01:31.320> there<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:32.570> visual<00:01:33.570> camera<00:01:33.869> there<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
that there is a visual camera there is a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.429 
that there is a visual camera there is a
depth<00:01:34.979> camera<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.640> then<00:01:36.119> at<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.450> bottom<00:01:36.600> you

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
depth camera and then at the bottom you

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.330 
depth camera and then at the bottom you
can<00:01:37.470> see<00:01:37.619> two<00:01:38.430> things<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.840> yellow<00:01:40.259> line<00:01:41.009> there

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
can see two things the yellow line there

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.940 
can see two things the yellow line there
is<00:01:41.570> showing<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.930> where<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> audio<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.890> coming

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
is showing the where the audio is coming

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.620 
is showing the where the audio is coming
from<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.090> kind<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.299> figure

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
from and then so you can kind of figure

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.330 
from and then so you can kind of figure
out<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.960> know<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.320> knows<00:01:49.710> what's<00:01:50.040> going<00:01:50.250> on

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
out you know it knows what's going on

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.670 
out you know it knows what's going on
where<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.270> audio<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.540> coming<00:01:51.630> from<00:01:51.960> if<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
where the audio is coming from if I

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.469 
where the audio is coming from if I
click<00:01:52.860> over<00:01:53.159> here<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.119> where<00:01:54.299> it's

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
click over here this is where it's

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.420 
click over here this is where it's
really<00:01:54.509> cool<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.020> us<00:01:55.049> geeky<00:01:55.350> types<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:56.280> can

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
really cool for us geeky types we can

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.100 
really cool for us geeky types we can
kind<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:56.820> what's<00:01:57.180> actually<00:01:57.390> happening

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
kind of see what's actually happening

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.770 
kind of see what's actually happening
behind<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> scenes<00:01:58.979> with<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.640> Kinect<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.329> so

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
behind the scenes with the Kinect and so

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.179 
behind the scenes with the Kinect and so
you've<00:02:01.049> got<00:02:01.079> some<00:02:01.259> controls<00:02:01.740> here<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.100> this

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
you've got some controls here that this

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.730 
you've got some controls here that this
this<00:02:02.549> right<00:02:02.759> here<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.060> for<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:04.020> regular

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
this right here is for the regular

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.310 
this right here is for the regular
camera<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.340> if<00:02:05.880> you're<00:02:06.030> recording<00:02:06.960> video

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
camera and if you're recording video

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.779 
camera and if you're recording video
ever<00:02:07.500> you're<00:02:07.740> going<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.920> want<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.220> be<00:02:08.310> at<00:02:08.429> 30

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
ever you're going to want it to be at 30

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.500 
ever you're going to want it to be at 30
FPS<00:02:09.360> frames<00:02:09.840> per<00:02:10.050> second<00:02:10.700> but<00:02:11.700> that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
FPS frames per second but that

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.059 
FPS frames per second but that
it<00:02:12.720> does<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.200> bit<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.620> higher<00:02:13.799> resolution

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
it does do a bit of a higher resolution

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.640 
it does do a bit of a higher resolution
1280<00:02:14.790> x<00:02:14.939> 960<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.659> so<00:02:16.019> you<00:02:16.110> get<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> much<00:02:16.590> better

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
1280 x 960 and so you get a much better

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.880 
1280 x 960 and so you get a much better
image<00:02:17.159> quality<00:02:17.370> but<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.720> res<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.260> frames<00:02:19.799> per

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
image quality but the res the frames per

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.710 
image quality but the res the frames per
second<00:02:20.159> goes<00:02:20.280> down<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.610> 12<00:02:20.939> frames<00:02:21.209> per<00:02:21.390> second

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
second goes down to 12 frames per second

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.559 
second goes down to 12 frames per second
so<00:02:21.870> that's<00:02:22.049> really<00:02:22.319> not<00:02:22.439> worth<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.860> for<00:02:23.569> trying

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
so that's really not worth it for trying

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.500 
so that's really not worth it for trying
to<00:02:24.629> capture<00:02:24.810> video<00:02:25.909> over<00:02:26.909> here<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.239> have<00:02:27.269> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
to capture video over here we have the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.289 
to capture video over here we have the
depth<00:02:27.780> stream<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:29.640> can<00:02:29.760> see<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:29.970> that

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
depth stream and you can see that that

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.589 
depth stream and you can see that that
it's<00:02:30.599> kind<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.440> know<00:02:31.470> over<00:02:31.920> here<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:33.420> can

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
it's kind of you know over here you can

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.100 
it's kind of you know over here you can
see<00:02:33.720> my<00:02:33.810> figure<00:02:34.019> 1<00:02:35.150> i'm<00:02:36.150> at<00:02:36.329> that<00:02:36.510> part<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:37.049> it

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
see my figure 1 i'm at that part of it

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.720 
see my figure 1 i'm at that part of it
it<00:02:37.680> looks<00:02:37.829> kind<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.040> choppy<00:02:38.310> where<00:02:38.549> you<00:02:38.640> can

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
it looks kind of choppy where you can

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.240 
it looks kind of choppy where you can
upgrade<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.870> 640<00:02:40.349> x<00:02:40.440> 480<00:02:40.769> gets<00:02:41.190> a

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
upgrade that to the 640 x 480 gets a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.680 
upgrade that to the 640 x 480 gets a
little<00:02:41.370> smoother<00:02:42.230> but<00:02:43.230> now<00:02:43.379> you'll<00:02:44.159> see<00:02:44.250> that

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
little smoother but now you'll see that

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.819 
little smoother but now you'll see that
right<00:02:45.690> now<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.930> can<00:02:46.200> see<00:02:46.319> that<00:02:46.349> you<00:02:46.739> know

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
right now you can see that you know

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.180 
right now you can see that you know
things<00:02:47.099> aren't<00:02:47.459> looking<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:47.819> huh<00:02:48.680> gray<00:02:49.680> kind

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
things aren't looking so huh gray kind

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.160 
things aren't looking so huh gray kind
of<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.519> like<00:02:50.909> the<00:02:51.329> way<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:51.659> works<00:02:51.900> is

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
of is like the way this works is

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.309 
of is like the way this works is
depending<00:02:52.980> on<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.400> town<00:02:53.639> and<00:02:53.670> color<00:02:54.319> that's

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
depending on the town and color that's

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.979 
depending on the town and color that's
telling<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:56.220> system<00:02:56.579> how<00:02:57.090> far<00:02:57.690> away<00:02:57.840> things

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
telling the system how far away things

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.129 
telling the system how far away things
are<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.859> so<00:02:59.790> when<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.209> get<00:03:00.359> up<00:03:00.450> close<00:03:00.480> they

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
are and so when you get up close they

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.099 
are and so when you get up close they
kind<00:03:01.379> of<00:03:01.440> just<00:03:01.500> all<00:03:01.859> you<00:03:02.609> know<00:03:02.700> about<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:04.019> know

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
kind of just all you know about you know

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.530 
kind of just all you know about you know
it<00:03:04.260> doesn't<00:03:04.950> want<00:03:05.159> to<00:03:05.220> do<00:03:05.310> with<00:03:05.459> me<00:03:05.609> this<00:03:06.359> is

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
it doesn't want to do with me this is

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.270 
it doesn't want to do with me this is
the<00:03:06.690> really<00:03:06.989> neat<00:03:07.170> feature<00:03:07.409> of<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:08.040> kinect

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
the really neat feature of the kinect

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.009 
the really neat feature of the kinect
for<00:03:08.340> windows<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.329> what<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.599> whole<00:03:09.780> big

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
for windows this is what the whole big

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.199 
for windows this is what the whole big
deal<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.319> about<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:10.879> changing<00:03:11.879> the<00:03:12.000> range

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
deal is about and changing the range

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.599 
deal is about and changing the range
here<00:03:12.329> from<00:03:12.690> default<00:03:13.139> to<00:03:13.470> near<00:03:13.799> and<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.489> can

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
here from default to near and you can

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.280 
here from default to near and you can
see<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:14.970> changes<00:03:15.389> and<00:03:15.599> so<00:03:15.720> now<00:03:15.900> instead

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
see that this changes and so now instead

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.580 
see that this changes and so now instead
of<00:03:16.709> being<00:03:17.010> white<00:03:17.489> and<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.870> system<00:03:19.440> not

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
of being white and the system not

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.710 
of being white and the system not
recognizing<00:03:20.160> me<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.430> change<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.209> near<00:03:21.449> and

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
recognizing me I change it to near and

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.740 
recognizing me I change it to near and
is<00:03:22.109> closer<00:03:22.410> it<00:03:23.069> takes<00:03:23.730> closer<00:03:24.000> read<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.540> now

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
is closer it takes closer read and now

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.270 
is closer it takes closer read and now
it<00:03:25.019> can<00:03:25.379> tell<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.590> little<00:03:25.799> bit<00:03:25.919> more<00:03:26.099> about

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
it can tell a little bit more about

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.460 
it can tell a little bit more about
what's<00:03:26.579> going<00:03:26.760> on<00:03:26.879> with<00:03:27.030> me<00:03:27.319> this<00:03:28.319> is

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
what's going on with me this is

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.619 
what's going on with me this is
important<00:03:28.919> because<00:03:28.980> with<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.849> Xbox<00:03:30.299> it's<00:03:30.510> set

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
important because with the Xbox it's set

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.509 
important because with the Xbox it's set
up<00:03:30.660> for<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.930> living<00:03:31.079> room<00:03:31.349> type<00:03:31.889> destination

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
up for a living room type destination

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.580 
up for a living room type destination
where<00:03:32.760> you're<00:03:33.239> far<00:03:33.419> away<00:03:33.540> from<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.780> TV<00:03:33.959> jump

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
where you're far away from the TV jump

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.349 
where you're far away from the TV jump
around<00:03:34.859> and<00:03:35.010> play<00:03:35.129> whatnot<00:03:35.459> with<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.090> kinect

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
around and play whatnot with the kinect

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.119 
around and play whatnot with the kinect
for<00:03:36.389> windows<00:03:36.480> it's<00:03:37.109> more<00:03:37.349> of<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.560> desktop

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
for windows it's more of a desktop

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.009 
for windows it's more of a desktop
solution<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:39.329> you're<00:03:39.660> going<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:39.930> be

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
solution and so you're going to be

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.479 
solution and so you're going to be
closer<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.349> then<00:03:40.560> like<00:03:40.709> now<00:03:40.859> I'm<00:03:41.010> very<00:03:41.280> close

closer to then like now I'm very close

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.520 
closer to then like now I'm very close
to<00:03:41.549> connect<00:03:41.940> right<00:03:42.060> here<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.049> can<00:03:43.199> read<00:03:43.349> me

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
to connect right here and it can read me

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.039 
to connect right here and it can read me
all<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.799> way<00:03:43.889> you<00:03:44.370> know<00:03:44.569> it<00:03:45.569> knows<00:03:45.840> what's

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
all the way you know it knows what's

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.439 
all the way you know it knows what's
going<00:03:46.230> on<00:03:46.349> because<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.709> it's<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.489> near<00:03:47.730> mode<00:03:47.940> so

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
going on because I it's a near mode so

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:49.849 
going on because I it's a near mode so
that's<00:03:48.660> that's<00:03:48.930> super<00:03:49.290> important<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:49.769> that

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
that's that's super important and that

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.099 
that's that's super important and that
right<00:03:50.220> there<00:03:50.250> that's<00:03:50.629> the<00:03:51.629> cool<00:03:51.870> feature

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
right there that's the cool feature

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.349 
right there that's the cool feature
about<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.590> kinect<00:03:52.889> for<00:03:52.980> windows<00:03:53.129> that<00:03:54.090> right

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
about the kinect for windows that right

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.610 
about the kinect for windows that right
there<00:03:54.569> is<00:03:54.599> what's<00:03:55.049> going<00:03:55.199> to<00:03:55.260> change<00:03:55.319> the

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
there is what's going to change the

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.159 
there is what's going to change the
world<00:03:55.769> it's<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:57.060> silly<00:03:57.239> thing<00:03:57.540> it's<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.930> small

what's going on it into any can tell

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.360 
what's going on it into any can tell
right<00:04:06.079> this<00:04:07.079> far<00:04:07.230> away<00:04:07.409> how<00:04:07.590> how<00:04:08.010> far<00:04:08.280> away

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
right this far away how how far away

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.030 
right this far away how how far away
actually<00:04:08.609> am<00:04:08.909> a<00:04:09.150> huge<00:04:10.019> deal<00:04:10.169> and<00:04:10.409> then<00:04:10.949> of

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
actually am a huge deal and then of

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.259 
actually am a huge deal and then of
course<00:04:11.069> i<00:04:11.310> should<00:04:11.579> change<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.909> sperm<00:04:12.120> the

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
course i should change the sperm the

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.659 
course i should change the sperm the
very<00:04:12.419> beginning<00:04:12.750> because<00:04:13.440> i<00:04:13.590> hate<00:04:13.889> you<00:04:14.579> know

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
very beginning because i hate you know

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.909 
very beginning because i hate you know
there's<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.120> rule<00:04:15.299> of<00:04:15.329> thirds<00:04:15.829> until<00:04:16.829> you're

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
there's a rule of thirds until you're

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.800 
there's a rule of thirds until you're
producing<00:04:17.099> and<00:04:17.489> so<00:04:17.940> really<00:04:18.209> my<00:04:18.510> elevation

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
producing and so really my elevation

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.009 
producing and so really my elevation
angle<00:04:19.229> should<00:04:19.349> been<00:04:19.530> way

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
angle should been way

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.379 
angle should been way
further<00:04:21.289> may<00:04:21.470> be<00:04:21.759> down<00:04:22.759> here<00:04:22.789> and<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:23.240> can

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
further may be down here and so you can

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.689 
further may be down here and so you can
change<00:04:23.599> that<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:24.020> see<00:04:24.470> what<00:04:24.949> the<00:04:25.430> actual

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
change that to see what the actual

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.490 
change that to see what the actual
elevation<00:04:26.479> you<00:04:26.569> know<00:04:26.629> what<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.810> angle<00:04:26.960> of<00:04:27.379> the

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
elevation you know what the angle of the

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.619 
elevation you know what the angle of the
connectives<00:04:28.129> and<00:04:28.280> you<00:04:29.060> can<00:04:29.210> control<00:04:29.449> that

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:29.629 
connectives and you can control that

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:32.469 
connectives and you can control that
programmatically<00:04:30.199> too<00:04:30.440> so<00:04:31.340> that<00:04:31.610> is<00:04:31.879> the<00:04:32.300> very

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
programmatically too so that is the very

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.719 
programmatically too so that is the very
intro<00:04:32.960> very<00:04:33.560> basics<00:04:34.250> of<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.490> kinect<00:04:34.669> for
