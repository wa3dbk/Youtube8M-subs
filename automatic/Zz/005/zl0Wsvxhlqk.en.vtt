strength<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.250> dexterity<00:00:56.989> same<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.170> long

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
strength and dexterity same with long

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.979 
strength and dexterity same with long
sword<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:58.949> scales<00:00:59.520> better<00:01:01.399> why<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:03.719> don't

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
sword but it scales better why I I don't

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.840 
sword but it scales better why I I don't
really<00:01:04.290> know<00:01:04.530> why<00:01:04.830> they<00:01:04.860> did<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:05.670> that

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
really know why they did it like that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.670 
really know why they did it like that
just<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.540> make<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.869> different<00:01:07.229> weapon<00:01:07.439> I

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
just to make it a different weapon I

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.270 
just to make it a different weapon I
guess<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:09.630> has<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:10.140> strength<00:01:10.590> requirement<00:01:11.189> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
guess it has a strength requirement of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.899 
guess it has a strength requirement of
12<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.880> dexterity<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.450> 12<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.340> that<00:01:14.340> pretty

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
12 and dexterity of 12 and that pretty

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.660 
12 and dexterity of 12 and that pretty
much<00:01:15.030> sums<00:01:15.180> up<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.900> weapon<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.560> mean<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.490> got

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
much sums up this weapon I mean it's got

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.179 
much sums up this weapon I mean it's got
the<00:01:17.790> exact<00:01:18.210> same<00:01:18.240> move<00:01:18.720> set<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.500> slightly

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the exact same move set it's slightly

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.340 
the exact same move set it's slightly
slower<00:01:20.880> actually<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> be

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
slower actually and that's going to be

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.109 
slower actually and that's going to be
one<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.650> bigger<00:01:22.950> cons<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> weapons

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
one of the bigger cons of the weapons

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.350 
one of the bigger cons of the weapons
second<00:01:24.509> biggest<00:01:24.659> one<00:01:24.960> I'd<00:01:25.110> have<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.380> say<00:01:26.360> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
second biggest one I'd have to say the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.490 
second biggest one I'd have to say the
first<00:01:27.540> biggest<00:01:27.930> kind<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.229> might<00:01:28.350> as<00:01:28.409> well

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
first biggest kind of might as well

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.140 
first biggest kind of might as well
start<00:01:28.799> into<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> pros<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.670> cons<00:01:29.880> now

starting<00:01:30.570> with<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.780> cons<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.170> guess<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
starting with the cons I guess on the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.700 
starting with the cons I guess on the
first<00:01:32.579> main<00:01:33.270> biggest<00:01:34.020> kind<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.409> weapon

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.910 
can understand why well temper rather
you<00:02:10.269> can<00:02:10.599> understand<00:02:10.989> why<00:02:11.170> I'm<00:02:11.500> saying<00:02:11.769> that

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
you can understand why I'm saying that

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.280 
you can understand why I'm saying that
killing<00:02:12.400> him<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:13.030> biggest<00:02:13.360> con<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.750> the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
killing him is the biggest con of the

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.710 
killing him is the biggest con of the
weapon<00:02:14.590> because<00:02:15.519> you<00:02:16.120> have<00:02:16.239> to<00:02:16.330> kill<00:02:16.510> him<00:02:16.599> we

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
weapon because you have to kill him we

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.160 
weapon because you have to kill him we
get<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.930> weapon<00:02:17.200> right<00:02:18.660> other<00:02:19.660> cons<00:02:19.959> the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
get the weapon right other cons the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.600 
get the weapon right other cons the
weapon<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.680> mean<00:02:21.010> sure

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
weapon I mean sure

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.370 
weapon I mean sure
it<00:02:21.760> weighs<00:02:22.030> one<00:02:22.660> unit<00:02:22.930> more<00:02:23.080> than<00:02:23.290> the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
it weighs one unit more than the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.160 
it weighs one unit more than the
longsword<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.120> has<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.540> slightly<00:02:25.930> slower

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
longsword and has a slightly slower

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.009 
longsword and has a slightly slower
swing<00:02:26.650> speed<00:02:26.980> so<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:27.819> guess<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.569> could<00:02:28.750> say

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
swing speed so I guess you could say

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.940 
swing speed so I guess you could say
that<00:02:29.620> on<00:02:30.060> build<00:02:31.060> dedicated<00:02:31.989> to<00:02:32.170> using<00:02:32.769> weapons

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
that on build dedicated to using weapons

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.979 
that on build dedicated to using weapons
that<00:02:33.220> are<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:34.420> only<00:02:34.989> three<00:02:35.470> ways<00:02:35.620> excuse<00:02:36.130> me<00:02:36.310> um

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
that are in only three ways excuse me um

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.390 
that are in only three ways excuse me um
it<00:02:37.989> would<00:02:38.110> be<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> problem<00:02:38.920> you'd<00:02:39.130> end<00:02:39.310> up

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
it would be a problem you'd end up

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.000 
it would be a problem you'd end up
medium<00:02:39.760> rolling<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.360> guess<00:02:40.540> but<00:02:41.049> who<00:02:41.319> does<00:02:41.739> that

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
medium rolling I guess but who does that

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.009 
medium rolling I guess but who does that
I<00:02:42.250> mean<00:02:42.880> I<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:44.260> don't<00:02:45.099> ever<00:02:45.430> think<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.900> I've

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
I mean I I don't ever think that I've

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.449 
I mean I I don't ever think that I've
seen<00:02:47.230> anyone<00:02:47.769> min/max<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:49.000> badly<00:02:49.599> or<00:02:50.459> that

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
seen anyone min/max that badly or that

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.650 
seen anyone min/max that badly or that
well<00:02:51.940> or<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.900> know<00:02:52.989> what<00:02:53.079> I<00:02:53.110> mean<00:02:53.819> really<00:02:54.819> it's

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
well or you know what I mean really it's

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.319 
well or you know what I mean really it's
a<00:02:55.750> good<00:02:55.870> weapon<00:02:56.340> it's<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.549> fun<00:02:57.760> weapon<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.120> use

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
a good weapon it's a fun weapon to use

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.930 
a good weapon it's a fun weapon to use
it's<00:02:58.959> almost<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.739> carbon<00:02:59.920> copy<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.730> long

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
it's almost a carbon copy of the long

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.910 
it's almost a carbon copy of the long
sword<00:03:01.239> though<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:02.760> yeah<00:03:03.989> now<00:03:04.989> another<00:03:05.829> thing

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
sword though so yeah now another thing

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.490 
sword though so yeah now another thing
you<00:03:06.160> could<00:03:06.519> consider<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.359> be<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.510> con<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:08.230> would

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
you could consider to be a con I would

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.490 
you could consider to be a con I would
have<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.709> say<00:03:08.920> would<00:03:09.430> be<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.700> fact<00:03:10.209> that

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
have to say would be the fact that

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.840 
have to say would be the fact that
because<00:03:11.500> it's<00:03:11.709> got<00:03:11.859> a<00:03:11.890> slower<00:03:12.220> swing<00:03:12.459> speed

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
because it's got a slower swing speed

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.910 
because it's got a slower swing speed
they<00:03:13.510> can't<00:03:13.810> combo<00:03:14.260> as<00:03:14.380> well<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.739> that's

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
they can't combo as well and that's

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.920 
they can't combo as well and that's
really<00:03:15.220> what<00:03:15.489> it's<00:03:15.700> moves<00:03:15.910> that<00:03:16.120> relies<00:03:16.450> on<00:03:16.480> a

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
really what it's moves that relies on a

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.680 
really what it's moves that relies on a
lot<00:03:16.959> it<00:03:17.799> really<00:03:18.190> relies<00:03:18.459> on<00:03:18.519> its<00:03:18.880> combos<00:03:19.389> for

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
lot it really relies on its combos for

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.449 
lot it really relies on its combos for
damage<00:03:20.609> because<00:03:21.609> it<00:03:22.060> just<00:03:22.389> works<00:03:22.900> so<00:03:23.139> well<00:03:23.459> now

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
damage because it just works so well now

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.670 
damage because it just works so well now
because<00:03:25.299> you've<00:03:25.630> got<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:25.780> slower<00:03:26.079> swing<00:03:26.380> speed

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
because you've got a slower swing speed

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.449 
because you've got a slower swing speed
you<00:03:26.889> can't<00:03:27.100> combo<00:03:27.489> as<00:03:27.609> well<00:03:27.819> but<00:03:28.720> that<00:03:29.459> being

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
you can't combo as well but that being

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.699 
you can't combo as well but that being
said<00:03:30.760> that's<00:03:30.970> only<00:03:31.209> in<00:03:31.450> comparison<00:03:32.380> sort<00:03:32.620> of

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
said that's only in comparison sort of

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.370 
said that's only in comparison sort of
statement<00:03:33.190> you<00:03:33.850> can<00:03:34.030> still<00:03:34.329> combo<00:03:34.720> incredibly

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
statement you can still combo incredibly

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.960 
statement you can still combo incredibly
well<00:03:35.560> I'm<00:03:35.709> sure<00:03:35.950> you've<00:03:36.160> noticed<00:03:36.340> by<00:03:36.670> now<00:03:36.700> I'm

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
well I'm sure you've noticed by now I'm

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.550 
well I'm sure you've noticed by now I'm
pulling<00:03:37.269> off<00:03:37.420> some<00:03:37.569> pretty<00:03:37.690> decent<00:03:37.989> combos

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
pulling off some pretty decent combos

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.699 
pulling off some pretty decent combos
and<00:03:39.420> sure<00:03:40.420> I've<00:03:40.660> got<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:40.840> slower<00:03:41.139> swing<00:03:41.350> speed

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
and sure I've got a slower swing speed

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.830 
and sure I've got a slower swing speed
sure<00:03:42.040> they<00:03:42.220> can<00:03:42.400> just<00:03:42.639> walk<00:03:43.090> away<00:03:43.120> from<00:03:43.389> some

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
sure they can just walk away from some

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.259 
sure they can just walk away from some
of<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.019> attacks<00:03:44.430> but<00:03:45.430> chances<00:03:45.819> are<00:03:45.970> I'm<00:03:46.150> going

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
of the attacks but chances are I'm going

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.910 
of the attacks but chances are I'm going
to<00:03:46.359> calaman<00:03:46.870> I'm<00:03:47.049> gonna<00:03:47.260> combo<00:03:47.560> them<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:47.829> I'm

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
to calaman I'm gonna combo them and I'm

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.370 
to calaman I'm gonna combo them and I'm
going<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.069> combo<00:03:48.370> them<00:03:48.519> good<00:03:48.819> just<00:03:49.810> like<00:03:49.989> if<00:03:50.170> I

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
going to combo them good just like if I

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.800 
going to combo them good just like if I
was<00:03:50.560> using<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.980> longsword<00:03:51.459> it's<00:03:52.030> really<00:03:52.480> not

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
was using the longsword it's really not

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.569 
was using the longsword it's really not
that<00:03:52.870> much<00:03:53.230> of<00:03:53.410> a<00:03:53.470> difference<00:03:53.829> it<00:03:54.069> really<00:03:54.100> is

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
that much of a difference it really is

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.589 
that much of a difference it really is
so<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.650> don't<00:03:56.650> think<00:03:57.459> it's<00:03:57.609> a<00:03:57.730> big<00:03:58.090> deal<00:03:58.299> in<00:03:58.480> this

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
so I don't think it's a big deal in this

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.750 
so I don't think it's a big deal in this
case

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
case

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.369 
case
really<00:04:01.730> that's<00:04:02.730> kind<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.659> all<00:04:03.930> I've<00:04:04.080> got<00:04:04.260> to

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
really that's kind of all I've got to

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.500 
really that's kind of all I've got to
say<00:04:04.409> on<00:04:04.560> this<00:04:04.799> weapon<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.700> pros<00:04:06.000> are<00:04:06.360> the

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
say on this weapon the pros are the

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.869 
say on this weapon the pros are the
exact<00:04:06.930> same<00:04:07.049> is<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.769> longsword<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.430> got<00:04:08.640> a

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
exact same is the longsword you got a

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.690 
exact same is the longsword you got a
good<00:04:09.450> weapon<00:04:09.659> good<00:04:10.049> move<00:04:10.230> set<00:04:10.530> good<00:04:11.310> combo

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
good weapon good move set good combo

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410

and can hit decently high and those are
all<00:04:22.139> the<00:04:22.260> pros<00:04:22.500> all<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.830> cons<00:04:23.070> they're<00:04:23.490> really

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
all the pros all the cons they're really

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.120 
all the pros all the cons they're really
roughly<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.780> same<00:04:24.960> with<00:04:25.320> a<00:04:25.350> few<00:04:25.440> more<00:04:25.770> added

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
roughly the same with a few more added

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.800 
roughly the same with a few more added
in<00:04:26.250> if<00:04:26.520> you<00:04:26.610> want<00:04:26.790> to<00:04:26.910> compare<00:04:27.389> it<00:04:27.540> to<00:04:27.690> the

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
in if you want to compare it to the

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.710 
in if you want to compare it to the
longsword<00:04:28.400> but<00:04:29.400> really<00:04:29.790> if<00:04:30.240> you<00:04:30.360> didn't<00:04:30.600> know

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
longsword but really if you didn't know

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.040 
longsword but really if you didn't know
any<00:04:30.900> better<00:04:30.960> you<00:04:31.919> probably<00:04:32.699> would<00:04:33.050> barely

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
any better you probably would barely

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.010 
any better you probably would barely
notice<00:04:34.530> if<00:04:35.039> you've<00:04:35.490> noticed<00:04:35.820> at<00:04:36.150> all<00:04:36.300> the

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
notice if you've noticed at all the

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.360 
notice if you've noticed at all the
difference<00:04:37.350> in<00:04:37.470> swing<00:04:37.710> speed<00:04:37.979> so<00:04:38.880> yeah<00:04:40.370> really

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
difference in swing speed so yeah really

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.670 
difference in swing speed so yeah really
it's<00:04:41.820> a<00:04:42.120> it's<00:04:42.539> a<00:04:42.600> good<00:04:42.750> weapon<00:04:42.900> it's<00:04:43.380> a<00:04:43.530> good

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
it's a it's a good weapon it's a good

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.540 
it's a it's a good weapon it's a good
weapon<00:04:43.860> just<00:04:44.340> like<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.639> longsword<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.539> I

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
weapon just like the longsword and I

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.400 
weapon just like the longsword and I
usually<00:04:47.550> don't<00:04:48.090> like<00:04:48.419> weapons<00:04:48.690> that<00:04:49.050> are<00:04:49.199> just

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
usually don't like weapons that are just

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.980 
usually don't like weapons that are just
simply<00:04:49.770> variations<00:04:50.669> of<00:04:50.820> each<00:04:50.940> other<00:04:51.150> but<00:04:51.900> in

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
simply variations of each other but in

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.600 
simply variations of each other but in
this<00:04:52.139> case<00:04:52.350> I<00:04:52.530> don't<00:04:52.740> mind<00:04:52.919> it<00:04:53.100> just<00:04:53.130> because<00:04:53.520> I

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
this case I don't mind it just because I

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.400 
this case I don't mind it just because I
feel<00:04:53.760> like<00:04:53.789> this<00:04:54.060> one<00:04:54.300> has<00:04:54.840> a<00:04:54.870> little<00:04:55.229> bit

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
feel like this one has a little bit

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.680 
feel like this one has a little bit
extra<00:04:55.770> thrown<00:04:56.160> in<00:04:56.340> it<00:04:56.520> does<00:04:56.970> slightly<00:04:57.389> higher

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
extra thrown in it does slightly higher

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.290 
extra thrown in it does slightly higher
damage<00:04:58.199> it's<00:04:58.710> got<00:04:58.860> a<00:04:58.889> slightly<00:04:59.400> longer<00:04:59.820> reach

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
damage it's got a slightly longer reach

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.230 
damage it's got a slightly longer reach
I<00:05:00.479> believe<00:05:00.810> so

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
I believe so

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.210 
I believe so
it's<00:05:03.240> not<00:05:03.449> that<00:05:03.870> big<00:05:04.139> of<00:05:04.169> a<00:05:04.320> deal<00:05:04.440> in<00:05:04.650> this<00:05:04.830> case

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
it's not that big of a deal in this case

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.779 
it's not that big of a deal in this case
in<00:05:05.520> my<00:05:05.820> opinion<00:05:06.440> so<00:05:07.440> that<00:05:07.919> being<00:05:08.130> said<00:05:08.490> I

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
in my opinion so that being said I

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:10.820 
in my opinion so that being said I
really<00:05:09.389> don't<00:05:09.660> feel<00:05:10.110> like<00:05:10.169> recapping

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
really don't feel like recapping

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.140 
really don't feel like recapping
everything<00:05:11.160> just<00:05:11.370> because<00:05:11.639> of<00:05:11.760> this<00:05:11.849> entire

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
everything just because of this entire

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.810 
everything just because of this entire
showcase<00:05:12.720> feels<00:05:13.680> like<00:05:13.950> I'm<00:05:14.099> just<00:05:14.130> recapping

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
showcase feels like I'm just recapping

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.659 
showcase feels like I'm just recapping
the<00:05:15.000> longsword<00:05:15.539> with<00:05:15.960> an<00:05:16.500> extra<00:05:16.919> unit<00:05:17.580> of

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
the longsword with an extra unit of

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.230 
the longsword with an extra unit of
weight<00:05:17.940> added<00:05:18.419> on<00:05:18.570> it<00:05:19.260> really<00:05:19.710> it<00:05:20.610> really<00:05:20.789> just

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
weight added on it really it really just

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.320 
weight added on it really it really just
doesn't<00:05:21.539> feel<00:05:21.780> like<00:05:21.840> its<00:05:22.110> own<00:05:22.260> showcase<00:05:22.770> so<00:05:23.099> I

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
doesn't feel like its own showcase so I

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.520 
doesn't feel like its own showcase so I
don't<00:05:24.330> have<00:05:24.450> anything<00:05:24.660> else<00:05:24.900> to<00:05:25.020> say<00:05:25.110> I'm
