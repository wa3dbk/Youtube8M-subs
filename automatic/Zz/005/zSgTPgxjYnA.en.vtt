00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 three minutes for the biggest battle of 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.500
 our professional lives everything is 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.050
 reduces to we get cured as a team or we 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.820
 we crumbled play-by-play inch to 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.910
 inch now we are in hell 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.320
 Gentleman, we can get out of hell 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.860
 every inch 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.190
 I can not do it for you I'm very 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.190
 old 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.929
 I look around and see those young faces 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.939
 and I think 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:35.710
 I have made all the mistakes that a 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.710
 middle-aged man can commit 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.760
 ji squandered all my video 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.489
 can you believe 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.870
 I have thrown out of my life to everyone who 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.350
 loves 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.790
 but lately not even that cut 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.790
 the face that speaks of waiting 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.579
 look when you get older there are things 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.579
 that are given 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.740
 but you only learn that when you start 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.500
 lose those things 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.710
 you discover that life is a matter of 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.280
 hours 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.260
 this is soccer 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.120
 because in every game life the margin 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.240
 of mistake 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.330
 half a second slower faster if not 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.150
 you get to spend half a second slower 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.030
 or faster if you do not get to take the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.390
 inches that we need to be to our 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.270
 around 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.979
 that are in every moment of the game in 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.979
 every minute in every second 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.200
 in this team we fight for that terrain 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.259
 in this team we leave them the skin 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.920
 us and each other for that 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:57.020
 forged that you win because when 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.899
 we add one after another 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.630
 because we know that if we add those 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:07.030
 inches that's what will mark the 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.030
 Whore difference between winning or losing 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.560
 between living 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.240
 or die 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.960
 It creates one thing in each fight 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.580
 that strong theme is the one that wins that 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.000
 ground 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.400
 and I know life goes on in me it's because 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.700
 I still want to fight and die for that 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.019
 inch 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.790
 because living consists of that 6 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.599
 inches in front of your faces 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.890
 I can not convince you to do it 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:44.170
 you have to look at the one you have at your 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:46.709
 side look him in the eye and willing to 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.300
 win it with you are going to see an uncle 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.959
 who will sacrifice himself for this team 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.650
 because he knows that when the time comes 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.050
 you 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.620
 you parish the same for him 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:05.050
 is that is a team of gentlemen 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:10.510
 or we cure ourselves now as a team 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.510
 or we will die as individuals 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.700
 what are you going to do 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.510
 look
