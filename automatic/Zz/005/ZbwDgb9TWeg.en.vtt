00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
beer level it looks pretty good but as

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.020 
beer level it looks pretty good but as
you<00:00:56.440> can<00:00:56.560> see<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:56.829> beer<00:00:57.040> is<00:00:57.130> very<00:00:57.160> very<00:00:57.790> dark

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030

we're<00:00:58.930> going<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.110> compensate<00:00:59.440> for<00:00:59.800> that<00:00:59.860> by

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
we're going to compensate for that by

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.280 
we're going to compensate for that by
putting<00:01:00.309> a<00:01:00.489> white<00:01:00.670> card<00:01:00.940> behind<00:01:01.300> the<00:01:01.420> glass<00:01:01.660> so

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
putting a white card behind the glass so

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.170 
putting a white card behind the glass so
that<00:01:02.320> looks<00:01:02.680> a<00:01:02.800> little<00:01:02.890> bit<00:01:03.130> better<00:01:03.309> as<00:01:03.550> you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
that looks a little bit better as you

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.760 
that looks a little bit better as you
can<00:01:04.329> see<00:01:04.509> we<00:01:04.629> have<00:01:04.780> our<00:01:04.929> card<00:01:05.170> in<00:01:05.289> place<00:01:05.499> and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
can see we have our card in place and

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.910 
can see we have our card in place and
it's<00:01:06.369> cut<00:01:06.609> to<00:01:06.789> the<00:01:06.880> shape<00:01:07.090> of<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.299> glass

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
it's cut to the shape of the glass

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.590 
it's cut to the shape of the glass
thanks<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:09.009> refraction<00:01:09.460> it<00:01:09.819> doesn't<00:01:10.299> have<00:01:10.450> to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
thanks to refraction it doesn't have to

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.840 
thanks to refraction it doesn't have to
be<00:01:10.719> perfect<00:01:11.170> but<00:01:12.130> now<00:01:12.280> we<00:01:12.340> want<00:01:12.639> to<00:01:12.700> add

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
be perfect but now we want to add

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.789 
be perfect but now we want to add
something<00:01:13.149> else<00:01:13.450> we<00:01:14.020> want<00:01:14.049> to<00:01:14.350> make<00:01:14.469> it<00:01:14.619> look

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
something else we want to make it look

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.669 
something else we want to make it look
cold<00:01:15.100> and<00:01:15.429> in<00:01:16.119> order<00:01:16.389> to<00:01:16.509> do<00:01:16.659> that<00:01:16.869> we're<00:01:17.560> just

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
cold and in order to do that we're just

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:19.550 
cold and in order to do that we're just
going<00:01:17.889> to<00:01:17.979> use<00:01:18.100> water<00:01:18.369> in<00:01:18.609> a<00:01:18.700> spray<00:01:18.969> bottle

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
going to use water in a spray bottle

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.109 
going to use water in a spray bottle
some<00:01:20.560> people<00:01:20.859> choose<00:01:21.039> to<00:01:21.249> add<00:01:21.369> glycerin<00:01:21.999> to

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
some people choose to add glycerin to

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.609 
some people choose to add glycerin to
the<00:01:22.209> water<00:01:22.389> and<00:01:22.659> that<00:01:23.020> will<00:01:23.170> make<00:01:23.289> the<00:01:23.439> water

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
the water and that will make the water

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.949 
the water and that will make the water
beads<00:01:23.829> last<00:01:24.159> a<00:01:24.310> little<00:01:24.429> bit<00:01:24.520> longer<00:01:24.899> but<00:01:25.899> I

00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:25.959 
beads last a little bit longer but I

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:26.849 
beads last a little bit longer but I
don't<00:01:26.109> think<00:01:26.229> we're<00:01:26.319> going<00:01:26.409> to<00:01:26.499> do<00:01:26.619> it<00:01:26.740> this

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
don't think we're going to do it this

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:27.649 
don't think we're going to do it this
time

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
time

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.699 
time
one<00:01:28.659> thing<00:01:28.869> you<00:01:28.959> want<00:01:29.139> to<00:01:29.170> remember<00:01:29.289> about

one thing you want to remember about

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:32.370 
one thing you want to remember about
this<00:01:29.889> effect<00:01:30.279> is<00:01:31.029> you<00:01:31.240> only<00:01:31.479> want<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:31.899> spray<00:01:32.139> up

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
this effect is you only want to spray up

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.999 
this effect is you only want to spray up
to<00:01:32.649> the<00:01:32.770> level<00:01:33.130> of<00:01:33.279> the<00:01:33.579> beer<00:01:33.880> itself<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.770> foam

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
to the level of the beer itself the foam

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.980 
to the level of the beer itself the foam
on<00:01:36.159> top<00:01:36.429> is<00:01:36.700> not<00:01:36.729> going<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.149> be<00:01:37.240> cold<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.810> not

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
on top is not going to be cold and not

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.289 
on top is not going to be cold and not
going<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.259> cause<00:01:38.439> condensation<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:40.060> when<00:01:40.209> you

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
going to cause condensation so when you

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.179 
going to cause condensation so when you
are<00:01:40.450> spraying<00:01:40.749> you<00:01:41.409> just<00:01:41.590> want<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.799> shield<00:01:42.009> it

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
are spraying you just want to shield it

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.769 
are spraying you just want to shield it
with<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.340> card<00:01:42.639> now<00:01:43.209> that<00:01:43.359> the<00:01:43.450> condensation

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:43.779 
with a card now that the condensation

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:46.800 
with a card now that the condensation
effect<00:01:44.409> is<00:01:44.590> on<00:01:44.789> all<00:01:45.789> we<00:01:45.909> have<00:01:46.029> left<00:01:46.209> to<00:01:46.359> do<00:01:46.509> is

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
effect is on all we have left to do is

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.959 
effect is on all we have left to do is
put<00:01:47.049> a<00:01:47.079> head<00:01:47.229> back<00:01:47.469> on<00:01:47.679> the<00:01:47.799> beer<00:01:48.009> and<00:01:48.159> to<00:01:48.849> do
