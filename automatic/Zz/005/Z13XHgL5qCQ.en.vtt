00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.469 

so<00:00:02.810> what<00:00:02.960> do<00:00:03.020> I<00:00:03.139> do<00:00:03.260> when<00:00:03.889> I<00:00:03.919> need<00:00:04.190> a<00:00:04.220> D<00:00:04.460> cell<00:00:04.790> or

00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:05.479 
so what do I do when I need a D cell or

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:09.039 
so what do I do when I need a D cell or
a<00:00:05.509> C<00:00:05.899> cell<00:00:06.200> and<00:00:06.560> all<00:00:06.950> I<00:00:06.980> have<00:00:07.339> is<00:00:07.790> more<00:00:08.629> common

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:09.049 
a C cell and all I have is more common

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:10.799 
a C cell and all I have is more common
double<00:00:09.350> a<00:00:09.469> let<00:00:10.219> me<00:00:10.340> show<00:00:10.519> you

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:10.809 
double a let me show you

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.669 
double a let me show you
obviously<00:00:11.809> these<00:00:11.960> batteries<00:00:12.410> are<00:00:12.590> all

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
obviously these batteries are all

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.410 
obviously these batteries are all
different<00:00:12.889> sizes<00:00:13.160> and<00:00:13.400> you<00:00:13.549> can't<00:00:13.849> just<00:00:14.089> plug

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
different sizes and you can't just plug

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.859 
different sizes and you can't just plug
this<00:00:15.460> double-a<00:00:16.460> cell<00:00:16.790> in<00:00:17.090> the<00:00:17.300> place<00:00:17.509> of<00:00:17.540> these

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
this double-a cell in the place of these

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.320 
this double-a cell in the place of these
D<00:00:18.080> cells<00:00:18.380> or<00:00:18.560> even<00:00:18.800> these<00:00:18.890> C<00:00:19.130> cells<00:00:19.400> so<00:00:20.119> let's

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
D cells or even these C cells so let's

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.920 
D cells or even these C cells so let's
take<00:00:20.480> a<00:00:20.510> device<00:00:20.869> right<00:00:21.650> here<00:00:22.510> that<00:00:23.510> I<00:00:23.539> pulled

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
take a device right here that I pulled

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.529 
take a device right here that I pulled
these<00:00:24.050> two<00:00:24.350> dead<00:00:24.740> D<00:00:25.010> cells<00:00:25.310> out<00:00:25.580> of<00:00:25.609> these<00:00:26.359> are

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
these two dead D cells out of these are

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.040 
these two dead D cells out of these are
goners<00:00:26.810> there's<00:00:27.410> no<00:00:27.619> juice<00:00:27.890> left<00:00:28.840> can't<00:00:29.840> just

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
goners there's no juice left can't just

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.520 
goners there's no juice left can't just
take<00:00:30.199> two<00:00:30.470> doublea's<00:00:31.660> and<00:00:32.660> jam<00:00:33.019> them<00:00:33.199> in<00:00:33.320> there

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
take two doublea's and jam them in there

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.430 
take two doublea's and jam them in there
and<00:00:34.280> expect<00:00:34.820> them<00:00:34.970> to<00:00:35.000> work<00:00:35.269> or<00:00:35.540> even<00:00:36.080> a<00:00:36.260> bad

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
and expect them to work or even a bad

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.770 
and expect them to work or even a bad
seal<00:00:36.799> to<00:00:37.010> hand<00:00:37.220> jam<00:00:37.400> those<00:00:37.640> in<00:00:37.850> there<00:00:38.059> and

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
seal to hand jam those in there and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.229 
seal to hand jam those in there and
expect<00:00:39.199> them<00:00:39.320> to<00:00:39.409> work<00:00:39.589> but<00:00:40.040> there's<00:00:40.879> a<00:00:40.940> quick

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
expect them to work but there's a quick

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.469 
expect them to work but there's a quick
and<00:00:41.420> easy<00:00:41.540> hack<00:00:42.379> if<00:00:42.650> you<00:00:42.769> want<00:00:42.979> to<00:00:43.070> call<00:00:43.220> it<00:00:43.479> so

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:44.479 
and easy hack if you want to call it so

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:45.670 
and easy hack if you want to call it so
I'm<00:00:44.540> going<00:00:44.659> to<00:00:44.690> take<00:00:44.809> a<00:00:44.839> piece<00:00:45.049> of<00:00:45.080> cardboard

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
I'm going to take a piece of cardboard

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.820 
I'm going to take a piece of cardboard
that<00:00:45.940> actually<00:00:46.940> bends<00:00:47.229> so<00:00:48.229> I<00:00:48.290> can<00:00:48.470> roll<00:00:48.619> it<00:00:48.769> up

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
that actually bends so I can roll it up

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
that actually bends so I can roll it up
you<00:00:48.890> don't<00:00:49.070> want<00:00:49.280> one<00:00:49.400> that<00:00:49.430> bends<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.790> other

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
you don't want one that bends the other

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.070 
you don't want one that bends the other
way

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
way

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.079 
way
cardboard<00:00:51.890> bends<00:00:52.190> easier<00:00:52.489> one<00:00:52.670> within<00:00:52.879> the

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
cardboard bends easier one within the

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:54.969 
cardboard bends easier one within the
other<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:53.510> it's<00:00:54.290> going<00:00:54.409> to<00:00:54.470> be<00:00:54.559> just<00:00:54.739> a<00:00:54.769> little

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
other and it's going to be just a little

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:56.590 
other and it's going to be just a little
bit<00:00:55.070> shorter<00:00:55.430> and<00:00:55.580> I'm<00:00:56.089> going<00:00:56.239> to<00:00:56.269> take<00:00:56.420> my<00:00:56.540> two

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
bit shorter and I'm going to take my two

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.079 
bit shorter and I'm going to take my two
batteries<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:57.409> I'm<00:00:58.250> going<00:00:58.400> to<00:00:58.430> make<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:58.879> I<00:00:58.909> can

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
batteries and I'm going to make so I can

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.060 
batteries and I'm going to make so I can
insert<00:00:59.390> these<00:00:59.600> in<00:00:59.780> the<00:00:59.869> middle<00:00:59.960> I'm<00:01:00.890> gonna

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
insert these in the middle I'm gonna

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.170 
insert these in the middle I'm gonna
have<00:01:01.159> to<00:01:01.220> cut<00:01:01.369> this<00:01:01.460> down<00:01:01.519> a<00:01:01.699> little<00:01:01.820> bit<00:01:02.059> I'm

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
have to cut this down a little bit I'm

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.509 
have to cut this down a little bit I'm
going<00:01:02.299> to<00:01:02.360> start<00:01:02.540> the<00:01:02.659> rolling<00:01:03.189> just<00:01:04.189> to<00:01:04.309> get

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
going to start the rolling just to get

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.730 
going to start the rolling just to get
it<00:01:04.640> started<00:01:05.420> without<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:06.170> batteries<00:01:06.530> inside

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
it started without the batteries inside

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.980 
it started without the batteries inside
then<00:01:09.740> we're<00:01:09.830> going<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:09.980> take<00:01:10.160> our<00:01:10.340> two

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
then we're going to take our two

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.740 
then we're going to take our two
doublea's<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:13.700> we're<00:01:13.820> just<00:01:13.910> going<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.210> roll

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
doublea's and we're just going to roll

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:23.260 
doublea's and we're just going to roll
it<00:01:14.780> up<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:20.590> right<00:01:21.590> there<00:01:22.030> we're<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.120> same

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
it up and right there we're the same

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.910 
it up and right there we're the same
size<00:01:23.480> the<00:01:23.630> D<00:01:23.750> size<00:01:23.930> battery<00:01:24.290> you<00:01:24.410> can<00:01:24.530> make<00:01:24.890> a

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
size the D size battery you can make a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.250 
size the D size battery you can make a
longer<00:01:25.160> piece<00:01:25.430> and<00:01:25.640> then<00:01:25.730> just<00:01:25.940> cut<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:26.930> off<00:01:27.080> if

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
longer piece and then just cut it off if

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.210 
longer piece and then just cut it off if
you<00:01:27.320> need<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.730> and<00:01:28.730> it'll<00:01:28.940> take<00:01:29.060> some<00:01:29.210> tape

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
you need to and it'll take some tape

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.910 
you need to and it'll take some tape
let's<00:01:31.220> try<00:01:31.400> this<00:01:31.460> again<00:01:32.170> get<00:01:33.170> this<00:01:33.290> one<00:01:33.470> ready

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:45.000 

roll<00:01:36.920> that<00:01:37.100> up<00:01:38.980> take<00:01:39.980> some<00:01:40.040> tape

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.380 

got<00:01:46.010> it<00:01:46.100> all<00:01:46.220> taped<00:01:46.520> up<00:01:46.670> but<00:01:46.970> now<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.120> problem

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
got it all taped up but now the problem

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.780 
got it all taped up but now the problem
is<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.660> battery<00:01:47.930> is<00:01:47.990> a<00:01:48.080> little<00:01:48.260> short<00:01:48.790> it's

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
is the battery is a little short it's

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.060 
is the battery is a little short it's
actually<00:01:50.090> not<00:01:50.180> that<00:01:50.240> big<00:01:50.450> a<00:01:50.510> deal<00:01:50.950> we'll<00:01:51.950> just

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
actually not that big a deal we'll just

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.250 
actually not that big a deal we'll just
come<00:01:52.220> over<00:01:52.340> here<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:52.580> some<00:01:52.820> aluminum<00:01:53.240> foil

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.770 

grab<00:01:57.260> a<00:01:57.290> random<00:01:57.500> piece<00:01:57.830> and<00:02:01.450> this<00:02:02.450> isn't<00:02:02.600> very

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
grab a random piece and this isn't very

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.270 
grab a random piece and this isn't very
critical<00:02:05.680> but<00:02:06.680> we're<00:02:06.830> just<00:02:06.860> going<00:02:07.040> to<00:02:07.100> make<00:02:07.250> a

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
critical but we're just going to make a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.449 
critical but we're just going to make a
plug<00:02:07.550> for<00:02:07.760> the<00:02:07.880> end<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.950> we're<00:02:13.130> just<00:02:13.250> going<00:02:13.430> to

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
plug for the end and we're just going to

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.000 
plug for the end and we're just going to
jam<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.880> in<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.990> negative<00:02:15.440> end<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.860> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
jam it in the negative end of the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
the little bump on it so now we've got

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.600 
the little bump on it so now we've got
our<00:02:20.959> two<00:02:21.140> cells<00:02:21.380> in<00:02:21.530> there<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:22.280> we<00:02:22.370> got<00:02:22.520> our

swap these batteries out we can take
these<00:02:32.720> batteries<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.440> we<00:02:33.560> can<00:02:34.390> push<00:02:35.390> them

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
these batteries and we can push them
