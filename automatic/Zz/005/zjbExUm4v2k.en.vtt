00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:04.719
 I have 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:10.449
 the increase 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:13.460
 fuel coupled with the economic crisis 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.190
 comes to increase peoples and practices for saving the precious 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.369
 liquid for our vehicles 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.820
 fruit of that concern 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.420
 originates in flights and myths about the formulas that will help us 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.670
 save fuel that in spite of this will not have a real impact on the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.700
 engine consumption 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.090
 Abnormally low tire pressure can increase fuel consumption 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.970
 they attend almost 4% 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.250
 over inflating the tires above adequate expression decreases the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.480
 surface contact with the ground reducing safety and has increased 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.100
 the risk of accidents when that practice does not involve savings 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.100
 significant of mexico 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.780
 the maintenance of the day 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.470
 both for the safety of the users and to prolong the life of the user 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.450
 vehicle 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.520
 It is important enough to take it 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.690
 must include the change of cycle 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.940
 but changing the air filter will not bring a significant reduction 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.270
 in fuel consumption 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.880
 since modern engines electronic management systems compensate the 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.880
 effect that our partners had in other centers 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.700
 the additives for the engine with promises of big reductions of consumption have 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.590
 been studied by many independent entities demonstrating that their 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.590
 Impact on consumption is not official 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.370
 use of air conditioning at home or in the office 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.380
 represents a significant increase in the electricity bill although in the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.120
 vehicle is something very different turn off the air conditioning and circulate with the 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.430
 low windows implies a serious penalty to the aerodynamics of the 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.720
 virus something that will raise consumption to a level similar to using the air 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.250
 conditioned 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.980
 therefore to save fuel their life can be maintained in the 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.040
 windows and asphyxiate heat or choose to connect the air conditioner 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.039
 When necessary and ensure a comfortable and comfortable driving 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.069
 charge fuel at night and take advantage of the higher density 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.689
 fuel that cause the drop in ambient temperature 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:22.679
 autonomic 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:26.259
 since the deposits of the gas stations remain locked underground 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.319
 something that does not cause significant changes in its temperature between 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.319
 day and night and not even in just three seasons 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.369
 keep the engine without accelerating before 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:41.909
 during a stop in order to save gas and other justifications is one 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.429
 of the most widespread myths 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:48.589
 keeping the car idling for more than ten seconds will mean spending 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:51.919
 more gasoline than doing it again

 it is said that the ignited engine keeps the mind the ing 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:13.589
 helping to start the engine easier 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:16.899

 is the catalysts must be hot to function properly 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:34.289
 but the fact that they retain the heat for at least 25 minutes after 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:38.340
 having finished the engine does not justify keeping it running without accelerating joan

 maintaining the engine at idle, incomplete combustion is carried out and

 so much does not improve its performance and duration as this one since they can
