full speed investment fool special
attack<00:01:29.790> investment<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.689> think<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.290> East

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
attack investment and I think for East

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.969 
attack investment and I think for East
and<00:01:32.009> HP<00:01:32.810> not<00:01:33.810> sure<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.170> could<00:01:34.350> be<00:01:34.470> special

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
and HP not sure it could be special

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.030 
and HP not sure it could be special
defense<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.490> or<00:01:35.790> defense<00:01:36.299> or<00:01:36.420> whatever<00:01:37.040> so

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
defense to or defense or whatever so

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.620 
defense to or defense or whatever so
yeah<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.790> actually<00:01:39.060> pretty<00:01:39.180> good<00:01:39.420> because

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
yeah it's actually pretty good because

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.819 
yeah it's actually pretty good because
it<00:01:39.900> gains<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.770> lot<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.220> HP<00:01:41.369> even<00:01:42.090> without<00:01:42.240> ease

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
it gains a lot of HP even without ease

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.010 
it gains a lot of HP even without ease
it's<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:44.009> pretty<00:01:44.579> good<00:01:44.790> stead<00:01:45.329> for<00:01:45.360> special

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
it's a pretty good stead for special

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.469 
it's a pretty good stead for special
attack<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.950> doesn't<00:01:47.430> get<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.939> much<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.390> a

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
attack and it doesn't get that much of a

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.149 
attack and it doesn't get that much of a
speed<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.590> basically<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
speed but it's it's basically like the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.039 
speed but it's it's basically like the
same<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.700> edit<00:01:50.939> or<00:01:51.060> they're<00:01:51.780> not<00:01:51.899> really

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
same for to edit or they're not really

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.139
