got<00:02:30.800> down<00:02:30.980> lower<00:02:31.190> down<00:02:32.290> so<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.470> next<00:02:33.709> part<00:02:33.860> is

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
got down lower down so the next part is

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.860 
got down lower down so the next part is
every<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.730> know<00:02:34.760> every<00:02:35.209> couple<00:02:35.330> measures

every you know every couple measures

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.570 
every you know every couple measures
they<00:02:36.560> go<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.970> part<00:02:38.209> where<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.920> goes<00:02:40.190> to

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
they go to the part where it goes to

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.030 
they go to the part where it goes to
this

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.380 

so<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.099> goes<00:02:47.280> back<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.150> that

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
so it goes back to that so that that

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.990 
so it goes back to that so that that
little<00:02:48.950> milieu<00:02:49.950> pre-chorus<00:02:50.489> or<00:02:50.790> something

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
little milieu pre-chorus or something

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
same as this you still have this finger

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.160 
same as this you still have this finger
most<00:02:56.849> of<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.090> song<00:02:57.299> just<00:02:57.599> has<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:57.870> finger

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
most of the song just has this finger

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.360 
most of the song just has this finger
here<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.870> then<00:03:01.409> instead<00:03:01.799> of<00:03:01.859> strumming<00:03:02.280> this

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
here and then instead of strumming this

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.449 
here and then instead of strumming this
top<00:03:02.640> string<00:03:02.879> here<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:04.140> go<00:03:04.530> down<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:05.220> the

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
top string here you go down to the

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.920 
top string here you go down to the
fourth<00:03:05.790> string<00:03:06.150> here<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:07.819> you<00:03:08.819> put<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.689> put

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
fourth string here and you put you put

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
4th string on the 4th fret so you strum

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.559 
4th string on the 4th fret so you strum
those<00:03:19.950> two<00:03:20.190> instead<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:20.819> the<00:03:20.970> top<00:03:21.150> one<00:03:21.359> so

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
those two instead of the top one so

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.030 
those two instead of the top one so
leave<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:21.930> top<00:03:22.170> one<00:03:22.349> off<00:03:22.500> pretend<00:03:22.829> like<00:03:22.889> it's

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
leave this top one off pretend like it's

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.440 
leave this top one off pretend like it's
not<00:03:23.099> there<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.730> strum<00:03:24.299> these<00:03:24.510> two

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.330 

sound<00:03:27.720> different<00:03:28.470> if<00:03:28.650> you're<00:03:28.890> playing<00:03:29.190> an

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
sound different if you're playing an

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.479 
sound different if you're playing an
acoustic<00:03:29.580> it<00:03:30.480> still<00:03:30.660> sounds<00:03:30.959> cool<00:03:31.170> but<00:03:31.500> the

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
acoustic it still sounds cool but the

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.070 
acoustic it still sounds cool but the
electric<00:03:32.849> has<00:03:32.970> definitely<00:03:33.330> got<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.690> extra

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
electric has definitely got that extra

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.890 
electric has definitely got that extra
distortion<00:03:34.800> and<00:03:34.950> kick<00:03:35.129> to<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:36.540> when<00:03:36.810> you

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
distortion and kick to it so when you

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.690 
distortion and kick to it so when you
have<00:03:37.080> this<00:03:40.790> then<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:42.060> go<00:03:43.010> you<00:03:44.010> move<00:03:44.250> your

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
have this then you go you move your

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.729 
have this then you go you move your
pointer<00:03:44.910> finger<00:03:45.360> right<00:03:45.540> here<00:03:45.840> where<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.200> you

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
pointer finger right here where it you

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.710 
pointer finger right here where it you
know<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.160> bass<00:03:47.580> thing<00:03:47.940> or<00:03:48.120> it's<00:03:48.239> always<00:03:48.510> been

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
know the bass thing or it's always been

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.430 
know the bass thing or it's always been
you<00:03:49.319> move<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.650> down<00:03:49.920> one<00:03:50.610> string<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.440> then

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
you move that down one string and then

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.370 
you move that down one string and then
you<00:03:52.530> take<00:03:52.739> this<00:03:52.890> off<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.959> then<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.080> still

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
you take this off and then you still

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.320 
you take this off and then you still
strum<00:03:55.680> those<00:03:55.860> two<00:03:56.069> strings<00:03:56.489> instead<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.150> the

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
strum those two strings instead of the

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.680 
strum those two strings instead of the
top<00:03:57.510> ones<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.920> go<00:03:59.129> down<00:03:59.489> and<00:03:59.910> you<00:03:59.970> hold<00:04:00.599> it

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
top ones you go down and you hold it

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.910 
top ones you go down and you hold it
down<00:04:00.810> too

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
down too

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.170 
down too
so<00:04:03.920> you<00:04:04.010> go<00:04:04.129> from<00:04:04.250> this

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:17.810 

that's<00:04:09.659> your<00:04:09.900> little<00:04:10.409> vs.<00:04:10.920> thing<00:04:16.400> so<00:04:17.400> that's

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
that's your little vs. thing so that's

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.080 
that's your little vs. thing so that's
pretty<00:04:18.180> much<00:04:18.389> how<00:04:18.720> you<00:04:18.750> do<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:19.400> that's<00:04:20.400> most<00:04:20.820> of

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
pretty much how you do it that's most of

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.129 
pretty much how you do it that's most of
the<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:22.109> verses<00:04:22.949> of<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:24.000> song<00:04:24.030> pretty<00:04:25.020> much

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
the the verses of the song pretty much

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.590 
the the verses of the song pretty much
the<00:04:25.289> first<00:04:25.530> half<00:04:25.770> does<00:04:26.070> that<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.610> then<00:04:27.180> what

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
the first half does that and then what

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.159 
the first half does that and then what
it<00:04:27.720> does<00:04:27.750> is<00:04:28.229> it<00:04:28.440> goes<00:04:28.560> into<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.949> whole<00:04:29.130> nother

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
it does is it goes into a whole nother

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.670 
it does is it goes into a whole nother
type<00:04:31.169> of<00:04:31.350> song<00:04:31.789> it<00:04:32.789> goes<00:04:33.090> into<00:04:33.389> the<00:04:33.690> I<00:04:34.199> guess

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
type of song it goes into the I guess

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.990 
type of song it goes into the I guess
you<00:04:34.710> would<00:04:34.919> call<00:04:34.949> it<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.370> chorus<00:04:35.699> of<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:35.970> song

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
you would call it the chorus of the song

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.060 
you would call it the chorus of the song
so<00:04:36.990> what<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:37.889> does<00:04:38.160> it<00:04:38.460> sounds<00:04:39.030> like<00:04:39.900> this

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.860 

mm<00:04:45.610> that's<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:46.720> lead<00:04:47.220> version<00:04:48.220> of<00:04:48.340> it<00:04:48.490> and<00:04:48.870> the

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
mm that's the lead version of it and the

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.690 
mm that's the lead version of it and the
other<00:04:50.140> way<00:04:50.320> of<00:04:50.440> doing<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:51.100> rhythm<00:04:51.340> guitar

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
other way of doing it the rhythm guitar

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.250 
other way of doing it the rhythm guitar
way<00:04:51.850> of<00:04:51.910> doing<00:04:52.150> it<00:04:52.270> which<00:04:52.510> you<00:04:52.870> would<00:04:52.990> kind<00:04:53.230> of

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
way of doing it which you would kind of

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.570 
way of doing it which you would kind of
have<00:04:53.380> a<00:04:53.410> combination<00:04:53.710> doing<00:04:54.280> because<00:04:54.370> there's

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
have a combination doing because there's

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:06.540 
have a combination doing because there's
two<00:04:54.760> guitars<00:04:56.370> you<00:04:57.370> play<00:04:57.640> both<00:04:58.150> this<00:05:05.490> so<00:05:06.490> you

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
two guitars you play both this so you

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.879 
two guitars you play both this so you
have<00:05:06.850> that<00:05:07.090> part<00:05:07.360> mixed<00:05:07.930> with

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.659
