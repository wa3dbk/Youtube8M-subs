00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.260
 d anjou to water 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.420
 hello very good and bi tejeiro we are in 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:24.000
 what would be part 26 of 'the last of 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.000
 us' the one that is going to be the final part 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.170
 you know the previous video 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.600
 had to die that and to save the 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.110
 humanity but the me he does not want and 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.230
 kill all god but all god and be the 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.820
 It also carries even lies to him what 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.500
 which to me it is not over me 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:47.730
 convince a lot but well let's see 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.730
 let's see how it ends 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.000
 and good as always when I go to 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.530
 finish you out a little my little one 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.620
 opinion of what the game has been and 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.719
 the rest 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.750
 although I already tell you that he does not let me 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.750
 speak 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.730
 wait for me wait manuel 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.740
 but yes very well because I am the one I bring 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:31.720
 here that does not do not do anything for me 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.720
 because I was attracted to this area 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.440
 and so we have arrived 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.140
 that here maybe it was where he lived 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.530
 there is not much left 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.490
 joel but where are you taking me 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.390
 come on let's go now this is the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.390
 last video 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.930
 back to boston 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.159
 when they bit me 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.159
 it's not happening 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.510
 I was my best friend 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.510
 and also life 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.680
 we did not know what to do 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.690
 he already said 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.430
 let's wait 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.150
 we could be poetic and lose the 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.150
 head together 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.780
 I'm still waiting my turn is called bar and 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.709
 she was the first to die 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.709
 and then I saw notes 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.930
 and then things 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.819
 you do not understand it 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.620
 long time 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.620
 I have taken poorly and survive 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.800
 whatever it is 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.300
 you always find something to live for 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.690
 in voucher I know it's not what you want to hear 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.690
 now 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:42.129
 swear to me that everything you told me about 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.129
 the solution to spending is true 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.709
 do not 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.220
 and so ends go 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.090
 until in this 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.519
 Well , as you want 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.810
 a very short video the truth we stop 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.810
 they are so short at the end 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.560
 It has not killed me, it has not been a novelty 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.760
 it does not give the feeling that you have 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.450
 left open how to do 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.450
 many series 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.290
 continue it 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.090
 Certainly until 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.720
 look at the face 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.370
 nothing can 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.370
 my little opinion is that 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.050
 I'm not convinced 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.310
 the graphic quality is amazing the 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.170
 quality of movements 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.170
 the voices of everything everything 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.110
 very 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.650
 the only thing that I do not like has been 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.650
 what I 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.360
 and he lets himself die 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.640
 but also now that I see it and what 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.720
 I really think maybe they have done it 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.260
 bet because of course if he lets her die 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.969
 I'm going to finish the story 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.399
 The humanity 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:32.919
 it's over but of course I guess this 

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:32.919
 they have wanted to do as 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.689
 after he does 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.610
 whatever is 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.210
 and nothing like I tell you as I always have 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.210
 said all 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.530
 and play it and I recommend it 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.530
 I love them 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.620
 he will not leave 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.860
 we liked the favorite X
