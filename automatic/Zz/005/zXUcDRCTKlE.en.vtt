00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
the caster on each side so that

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.550 
the caster on each side so that
everything<00:02:03.220> is<00:02:03.340> even<00:02:04.289> because<00:02:05.289> I'm<00:02:05.410> going<00:02:05.500> to

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
everything is even because I'm going to

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.160 
everything is even because I'm going to
base<00:02:05.740> one<00:02:06.220> of<00:02:06.310> my<00:02:06.399> curved<00:02:06.670> arms<00:02:06.910> off<00:02:07.660> of<00:02:08.020> this

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.250 
base one of my curved arms off of this

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
bar but this will probably all shift

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.710 
bar but this will probably all shift
back<00:02:11.530> as<00:02:11.830> soon<00:02:12.310> as<00:02:12.610> I<00:02:12.760> start<00:02:13.030> having<00:02:13.150> verticals

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
back as soon as I start having verticals

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:31.979 
back as soon as I start having verticals
to<00:02:13.780> it

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:40.289 

it's<00:02:32.989> out<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.260> legs

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:57.339 

these<00:02:41.299> are<00:02:41.480> 30-inch<00:02:41.989> verticals<00:02:56.140> now<00:02:57.140> let's

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
these are 30-inch verticals now let's

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:10.540 
these are 30-inch verticals now let's
add<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.500> crossbar

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:18.440 

now<00:03:11.550> let's<00:03:11.760> add<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.750> front<00:03:13.020> curved

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.670 

I'm<00:03:19.450> only<00:03:19.569> using<00:03:19.989> this<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:21.069> get<00:03:21.220> this<00:03:21.340> clamp

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
I'm only using this to get this clamp

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.229 
I'm only using this to get this clamp
situated<00:03:23.680> left<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.040> right<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:27.610> kerf<00:03:27.970> bar

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
situated left and right the kerf bar

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.089 
situated left and right the kerf bar
it's<00:03:28.659> much<00:03:28.930> more<00:03:29.140> difficult<00:03:29.319> to<00:03:29.739> make<00:03:29.950> it

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
it's much more difficult to make it

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.080 
it's much more difficult to make it
level<00:03:31.680> without<00:03:32.680> driving<00:03:33.099> you<00:03:33.340> absolutely

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
level without driving you absolutely

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:48.000 
level without driving you absolutely
bonkers<00:03:45.359> before<00:03:46.359> I<00:03:46.390> go<00:03:46.689> any<00:03:46.959> further<00:03:47.049> I<00:03:47.799> need

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
bonkers before I go any further I need

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.220 
bonkers before I go any further I need
to<00:03:48.220> make<00:03:48.400> sure<00:03:48.430> that<00:03:48.640> my<00:03:49.569> distance<00:03:49.989> right<00:03:50.200> here

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
to make sure that my distance right here

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.369 
to make sure that my distance right here
is<00:03:51.329> right<00:03:54.540> these<00:03:55.540> feet<00:03:55.780> are<00:03:55.810> gonna<00:03:56.049> fit<00:03:56.349> right

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
is right these feet are gonna fit right

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.649 
is right these feet are gonna fit right
on<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.709> ends<00:03:57.010> I'm<00:03:57.519> gonna<00:03:57.790> fit<00:03:58.000> one<00:03:58.030> right<00:03:58.359> here

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
on the ends I'm gonna fit one right here

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.839 
on the ends I'm gonna fit one right here
and<00:03:59.530> then<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:01.090> ends<00:04:01.389> so<00:04:02.519> they're<00:04:03.519> gonna<00:04:03.609> lay

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
and then the ends so they're gonna lay

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.270 
and then the ends so they're gonna lay
like<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.060> like<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:04.900> tabletop<00:04:05.500> down<00:04:05.859> or<00:04:06.099> something

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
like a like a tabletop down or something

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.399 
like a like a tabletop down or something
like<00:04:06.459> a<00:04:06.519> like<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:07.599> piece<00:04:07.750> of<00:04:07.780> plywood<00:04:08.019> or

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
like a like a piece of plywood or

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:09.839 
like a like a piece of plywood or
something<00:04:08.709> so<00:04:08.829> they<00:04:08.920> can<00:04:08.950> set<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.280> DJ<00:04:09.549> rig<00:04:09.730> up

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
something so they can set the DJ rig up

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.059 
something so they can set the DJ rig up
on<00:04:09.970> top<00:04:10.180> I<00:04:10.510> just<00:04:10.900> need<00:04:11.290> enough<00:04:11.530> space<00:04:11.560> at<00:04:11.980> the

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
on top I just need enough space at the

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.569 
on top I just need enough space at the
very<00:04:12.220> end<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.549> put<00:04:12.730> these<00:04:13.799> feet<00:04:14.799> on<00:04:15.099> the<00:04:15.340> ends

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
very end to put these feet on the ends

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.460 
very end to put these feet on the ends
so<00:04:15.849> I've<00:04:16.150> got<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.389> push<00:04:16.510> everything<00:04:16.870> in<00:04:17.139> just<00:04:17.380> a

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
so I've got to push everything in just a

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:26.590 
so I've got to push everything in just a
little<00:04:17.500> bit

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.770 

now<00:04:27.600> we<00:04:27.660> have<00:04:28.430> our<00:04:29.430> distance<00:04:29.880> and<00:04:32.660> bring<00:04:33.660> this

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
now we have our distance and bring this

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.240 
now we have our distance and bring this
back<00:04:33.990> just<00:04:34.199> a<00:04:34.290> little<00:04:34.320> bit<00:04:36.800> so<00:04:37.800> now<00:04:37.949> I'm<00:04:38.100> gonna

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
back just a little bit so now I'm gonna

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.750 
back just a little bit so now I'm gonna
add<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:39.889> cross<00:04:40.889> support<00:04:41.400> that's<00:04:41.550> gonna

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
add the cross support that's gonna

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.740 
add the cross support that's gonna
connect<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.570> front<00:04:42.810> and<00:04:43.139> back<00:04:44.180> long<00:04:45.180> support

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
connect the front and back long support

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.570 
connect the front and back long support
the<00:04:45.870> horizontal<00:04:46.260> supports<00:04:46.620> there's<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.340> lot<00:04:47.460> of

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
the horizontal supports there's a lot of

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.040 
the horizontal supports there's a lot of
crosses<00:04:47.820> and<00:04:48.120> horizontals<00:04:48.540> going<00:04:48.750> on<00:04:48.870> here

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
crosses and horizontals going on here

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.560 
crosses and horizontals going on here
but<00:04:49.199> you<00:04:49.410> get<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.310> idea<00:04:50.419> okay

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
but you get the idea okay

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.140 
but you get the idea okay
so<00:04:51.810> I<00:04:51.840> found<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.169> height<00:04:52.290> that<00:04:52.440> I<00:04:52.530> want<00:04:53.150> now

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
so I found the height that I want now

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:05.719 
so I found the height that I want now
let's<00:04:54.510> just<00:04:54.660> lock<00:04:55.139> it<00:04:55.350> in<00:04:55.470> place<00:04:55.620> right<00:04:55.979> now<00:05:04.729> so

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
let's just lock it in place right now so

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.870 
let's just lock it in place right now so
now<00:05:05.850> we're<00:05:06.030> gonna<00:05:06.120> add<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:07.620> front<00:05:07.919> long<00:05:08.520> cross

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
now we're gonna add the front long cross

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:22.430 
now we're gonna add the front long cross
support<00:05:09.330> horizontal<00:05:09.810> cross<00:05:09.960> support<00:05:21.440> now

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
support horizontal cross support now

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.090 
support horizontal cross support now
this<00:05:22.620> is<00:05:22.770> how<00:05:22.889> you<00:05:22.949> can<00:05:23.190> tell<00:05:23.370> if<00:05:24.289> this<00:05:25.289> bar<00:05:25.560> if

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
this is how you can tell if this bar if

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.040 
this is how you can tell if this bar if
these<00:05:26.370> these<00:05:26.699> verticals<00:05:27.210> are<00:05:27.419> not<00:05:27.600> tweaked

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
these these verticals are not tweaked

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.450 
these these verticals are not tweaked
they're<00:05:28.289> perfectly<00:05:28.710> level<00:05:29.070> this<00:05:29.190> is<00:05:29.310> how<00:05:29.400> you

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
they're perfectly level this is how you

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.860 
they're perfectly level this is how you
can<00:05:29.610> you<00:05:29.700> just<00:05:29.729> slide<00:05:30.090> the<00:05:30.240> bar<00:05:30.419> up<00:05:30.539> and<00:05:30.720> if<00:05:30.780> it

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
can you just slide the bar up and if it

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.960 
can you just slide the bar up and if it
snags<00:05:31.139> anywhere<00:05:31.530> then<00:05:32.280> you<00:05:32.490> know<00:05:32.610> that<00:05:32.820> one<00:05:32.940> of

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
snags anywhere then you know that one of

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.529 
snags anywhere then you know that one of
the<00:05:33.090> bars<00:05:33.270> isn't<00:05:33.510> exactly<00:05:34.340> going<00:05:35.539> straight

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
the bars isn't exactly going straight

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.129 
the bars isn't exactly going straight
like<00:05:36.810> you<00:05:36.930> want<00:05:37.139> it<00:05:37.200> to<00:05:38.750> see<00:05:39.750> how<00:05:39.810> easy<00:05:40.050> that

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
like you want it to see how easy that

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.170 
like you want it to see how easy that
slid<00:05:40.500> down<00:05:42.860> so<00:05:43.860> before<00:05:44.070> I<00:05:44.130> go<00:05:44.250> any<00:05:44.430> further<00:05:44.460> I

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
slid down so before I go any further I

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.469 
slid down so before I go any further I
want<00:05:45.900> to<00:05:45.930> establish<00:05:46.700> the<00:05:47.700> left<00:05:47.910> and<00:05:48.060> right<00:05:48.210> of

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
want to establish the left and right of

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.000 
want to establish the left and right of
this<00:05:48.630> horizontal<00:05:49.139> bar<00:05:49.200> so<00:05:49.530> I'm<00:05:49.590> gonna<00:05:49.680> use<00:05:49.830> my

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
this horizontal bar so I'm gonna use my

00:05:50.010 --> 00:06:03.040 
this horizontal bar so I'm gonna use my
feet<00:05:50.220> as<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.669> gauge

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.840 

before<00:06:04.050> I<00:06:04.080> go<00:06:04.320> any<00:06:04.350> further<00:06:04.830> I<00:06:05.250> need<00:06:05.340> to

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
before I go any further I need to

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.870 
before I go any further I need to
replace<00:06:06.330> some<00:06:06.960> of<00:06:06.990> the<00:06:07.140> t-bolts<00:06:07.730> with<00:06:08.730> these

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
replace some of the t-bolts with these

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.070 
replace some of the t-bolts with these
hex<00:06:09.090> nuts<00:06:09.330> and<00:06:09.510> these<00:06:09.570> are<00:06:09.630> the<00:06:09.780> ones<00:06:09.960> that

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
hex nuts and these are the ones that

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.260 
hex nuts and these are the ones that
actually<00:06:10.380> come<00:06:10.770> on<00:06:10.980> the<00:06:11.160> multi<00:06:11.460> clamps<00:06:11.820> where

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
actually come on the multi clamps where

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.520 
actually come on the multi clamps where
I'm<00:06:12.420> setting<00:06:12.750> we're<00:06:12.900> going<00:06:13.110> to<00:06:13.170> setting<00:06:13.470> the

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
I'm setting we're going to setting the

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.500 
I'm setting we're going to setting the
tabletop<00:06:13.980> down<00:06:14.190> the<00:06:14.430> plywood<00:06:14.760> down<00:06:15.150> for<00:06:15.420> the

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
tabletop down the plywood down for the

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.200 
tabletop down the plywood down for the
DJ<00:06:15.750> to<00:06:15.810> set<00:06:16.020> his<00:06:16.110> DJ<00:06:16.380> step<00:06:16.590> up<00:06:16.770> on<00:06:16.920> the<00:06:17.730> t-bolts

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
DJ to set his DJ step up on the t-bolts

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.210 
DJ to set his DJ step up on the t-bolts
stick<00:06:18.420> up<00:06:18.570> higher<00:06:18.870> than<00:06:19.500> the<00:06:19.680> rubber<00:06:19.830> mounting

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
stick up higher than the rubber mounting

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.580 
stick up higher than the rubber mounting
feet<00:06:20.490> that<00:06:20.670> we're<00:06:20.790> gonna<00:06:20.880> actually<00:06:21.120> use<00:06:22.020> to

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
feet that we're gonna actually use to

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.450 
feet that we're gonna actually use to
support<00:06:23.010> the<00:06:23.850> plywood<00:06:24.270> so<00:06:24.870> by<00:06:25.800> replacing<00:06:26.010> the

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
support the plywood so by replacing the

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.160 
support the plywood so by replacing the
t-bolts<00:06:26.910> with<00:06:27.030> these<00:06:27.180> hex<00:06:27.390> nuts<00:06:27.630> I'm<00:06:27.780> able<00:06:28.020> to

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.170 
t-bolts with these hex nuts I'm able to

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.440 
t-bolts with these hex nuts I'm able to
lay<00:06:28.500> the<00:06:28.650> lay<00:06:29.100> it<00:06:29.190> down<00:06:29.220> flush<00:06:29.700> so<00:06:30.120> it<00:06:30.210> doesn't

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
lay the lay it down flush so it doesn't

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.870 
lay the lay it down flush so it doesn't
hit<00:06:30.570> the<00:06:30.600> bolts<00:06:31.280> so<00:06:32.280> now<00:06:32.370> we're<00:06:32.520> gonna<00:06:32.640> add<00:06:32.850> our

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
hit the bolts so now we're gonna add our

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.990 
hit the bolts so now we're gonna add our
top<00:06:33.210> bar<00:06:35.780> so<00:06:36.780> here<00:06:36.960> is<00:06:37.080> our<00:06:37.290> front<00:06:37.890> support<00:06:38.850> bar

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
top bar so here is our front support bar

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.540 
top bar so here is our front support bar
which<00:06:39.270> I<00:06:39.540> mean<00:06:40.140> it<00:06:40.320> helps<00:06:40.560> the<00:06:40.920> stability<00:06:41.400> but

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
which I mean it helps the stability but

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.740 
which I mean it helps the stability but
I<00:06:41.580> mean<00:06:41.760> everything<00:06:42.120> else<00:06:42.240> is<00:06:42.360> pretty<00:06:42.480> stable

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
I mean everything else is pretty stable

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.930 
I mean everything else is pretty stable
already<00:06:43.230> since<00:06:43.470> we've<00:06:43.650> got<00:06:43.830> four<00:06:44.520> corners

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
already since we've got four corners

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.940 
already since we've got four corners
connecting<00:06:45.480> but<00:06:46.020> what<00:06:46.380> this<00:06:46.530> does<00:06:46.770> is<00:06:46.920> just

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950 
connecting but what this does is just

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.030 
connecting but what this does is just
gives<00:06:47.130> you<00:06:47.630> more<00:06:48.630> mounting<00:06:49.290> options<00:06:49.710> because

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
gives you more mounting options because

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.010 
gives you more mounting options because
you<00:06:50.190> can<00:06:50.310> start<00:06:50.580> adding<00:06:50.790> a<00:06:51.090> bunch<00:06:51.570> of<00:06:51.750> crap

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
you can start adding a bunch of crap

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.740 
you can start adding a bunch of crap
right<00:06:52.260> off<00:06:52.650> the<00:06:52.800> top<00:06:52.980> of<00:06:53.010> this<00:06:53.280> I<00:06:53.940> think<00:06:54.240> on

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
right off the top of this I think on

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.050 
right off the top of this I think on

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
gonna add one curve bar here just for

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.110 
gonna add one curve bar here just for
cosmetic<00:07:11.070> reasons<00:07:11.250> it<00:07:11.520> has<00:07:11.640> nothing<00:07:11.940> to<00:07:11.970> do

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 
with stability stability is created for

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.280 
with stability stability is created for
the<00:07:14.250> from<00:07:14.880> all<00:07:15.030> the<00:07:15.150> corner<00:07:15.810> posts<00:07:16.140> we've

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.290 
the from all the corner posts we've

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.780 
the from all the corner posts we've
created<00:07:16.470> right<00:07:16.710> here<00:07:16.890> is<00:07:16.980> just<00:07:17.010> just<00:07:17.580> to<00:07:17.670> make

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:17.790 
created right here is just just to make

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.610 
created right here is just just to make
it<00:07:17.820> look<00:07:18.000> pretty<00:07:18.270> you<00:07:18.810> see<00:07:19.080> that<00:07:19.260> there<00:07:19.440> is<00:07:19.590> a

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
it look pretty you see that there is a

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.370 
it look pretty you see that there is a
gap<00:07:20.040> between<00:07:20.340> this<00:07:20.790> middle<00:07:21.150> curve<00:07:21.390> and<00:07:21.810> the

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 
gap between this middle curve and the

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.440 
gap between this middle curve and the
very<00:07:22.680> bottom<00:07:23.130> cross<00:07:23.490> support<00:07:24.030> connecting<00:07:24.390> the

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:24.450 
very bottom cross support connecting the

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.010 
very bottom cross support connecting the
two<00:07:24.630> T<00:07:25.350> leg<00:07:25.530> with<00:07:25.860> casters<00:07:26.370> together<00:07:26.700> well<00:07:27.450> I'm

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 
two T leg with casters together well I'm

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.750 
two T leg with casters together well I'm
gonna<00:07:28.200> bridge<00:07:28.530> that<00:07:28.740> gap<00:07:28.920> by<00:07:29.190> using<00:07:29.400> about<00:07:29.700> a

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:29.760 
gonna bridge that gap by using about a

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.540 
gonna bridge that gap by using about a
10<00:07:30.060> inch<00:07:30.090> piece<00:07:30.300> of<00:07:30.750> cut<00:07:31.170> tube<00:07:31.800> already<00:07:32.400> and

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:32.550 
10 inch piece of cut tube already and

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.040 
10 inch piece of cut tube already and
I'm<00:07:32.610> going<00:07:32.640> to<00:07:32.760> connect<00:07:33.060> it<00:07:33.210> so<00:07:33.240> it<00:07:33.690> makes<00:07:33.930> it

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.050 
I'm going to connect it so it makes it

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.190 
I'm going to connect it so it makes it
even<00:07:34.140> more<00:07:34.230> sturdy<00:07:35.030> and<00:07:36.030> that's<00:07:36.270> the

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:37.200 
even more sturdy and that's the

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.130 
even more sturdy and that's the
construction<00:07:37.800> the<00:07:38.640> frame<00:07:38.910> is<00:07:39.150> done<00:07:39.420> now<00:07:40.080> we

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:40.140 
construction the frame is done now we

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.260 
construction the frame is done now we
just<00:07:40.410> add<00:07:40.530> a<00:07:40.590> couple<00:07:40.890> more<00:07:41.010> little<00:07:41.310> little

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:42.270 
just add a couple more little little

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.500 
just add a couple more little little
feet<00:07:42.570> to<00:07:42.810> each<00:07:43.650> side<00:07:43.920> and<00:07:44.220> then<00:07:45.000> you<00:07:45.150> have<00:07:45.360> your

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:45.510 
feet to each side and then you have your

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.000 
feet to each side and then you have your
platform<00:07:45.990> then<00:07:46.170> all<00:07:46.260> I<00:07:46.290> got<00:07:46.500> to<00:07:46.590> do<00:07:46.710> is<00:07:46.830> just

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.010 
platform then all I got to do is just

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.650 
platform then all I got to do is just
tie<00:07:47.160> to<00:07:47.220> you<00:07:47.310> the<00:07:47.400> rest<00:07:47.580> of<00:07:47.670> it<00:07:47.760> up<00:07:47.880> by<00:07:48.330> cutting

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.660 
tie to you the rest of it up by cutting

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:54.230 
tie to you the rest of it up by cutting
it<00:07:48.810> down
