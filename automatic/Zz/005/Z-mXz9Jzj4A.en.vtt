engineering<00:00:39.810> was<00:00:39.960> always<00:00:40.260> fascinating<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.950> me

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
engineering was always fascinating to me

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.340 
engineering was always fascinating to me
I<00:00:41.430> became<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.150> pilot<00:00:42.630> as<00:00:42.750> soon<00:00:42.900> as<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.110> could<00:00:43.170> I

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
I became a pilot as soon as I could I

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.600 
I became a pilot as soon as I could I
started<00:00:43.770> saving<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:44.130> for<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.340> when<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.489> was

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
started saving up for it when I was

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.250 
started saving up for it when I was
eight<00:00:44.760> years<00:00:44.790> old<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.420> got<00:00:45.510> my<00:00:45.810> license<00:00:46.140> as

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
eight years old and got my license as

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.900 
eight years old and got my license as
soon<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.590> could<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.860> high<00:00:46.980> school<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:47.699> I

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
soon as I could in high school but I

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.729 
soon as I could in high school but I
never<00:00:48.570> really<00:00:48.899> thought<00:00:49.109> that<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.500> would<00:00:49.649> be

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
never really thought that we would be

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.340 
never really thought that we would be
doing<00:00:49.890> something<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.270> loved<00:00:52.079> being

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
doing something like this I loved being

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.500 
doing something like this I loved being
able<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.620> kind<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.890> make<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.579> dream<00:00:54.000> actually

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
able to kind of make that dream actually

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.500 
able to kind of make that dream actually
become<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> reality<00:00:55.649> now<00:00:59.179> right<00:01:00.179> now<00:01:00.329> this

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
become a reality now right now this

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.259 
become a reality now right now this
vehicle<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.989> primarily<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.679> testbed<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:03.120> we're

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
vehicle is primarily a testbed so we're

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.330 
vehicle is primarily a testbed so we're
collecting<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.809> lot<00:01:04.050> of<00:01:04.080> data<00:01:04.230> with<00:01:04.620> it<00:01:04.800> this<00:01:05.129> is

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 
collecting a lot of data with it this is

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.800 
collecting a lot of data with it this is
just<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.670> measure<00:01:05.910> wind<00:01:06.270> speed<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.750> direction

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
just a measure wind speed and direction

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.930 
just a measure wind speed and direction
so<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.500> tell<00:01:07.830> when<00:01:07.980> they're<00:01:08.070> gusts<00:01:08.580> there

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
so we can tell when they're gusts there

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.550 
so we can tell when they're gusts there
are<00:01:09.120> normally<00:01:09.630> folding<00:01:10.050> wings<00:01:10.230> that<00:01:10.530> are

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
are normally folding wings that are

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.520 
are normally folding wings that are
attached<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.370> we've<00:01:11.760> got<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.300> an<00:01:13.020> elevator

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
attached here we've got a an elevator

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.030 
attached here we've got a an elevator
control<00:01:14.070> surface<00:01:14.460> here<00:01:15.140> this<00:01:16.140> actually<00:01:16.440> we've

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
control surface here this actually we've

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.250 
control surface here this actually we've
got<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.310> patent<00:01:18.030> pending<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.450> using<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:18.930> also

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
got a patent pending on using this also

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.410 
got a patent pending on using this also
as<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> bumper<00:01:20.070> incidentally<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.150> four-wheel

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
as a bumper incidentally it's four-wheel

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.819 
as a bumper incidentally it's four-wheel
independent<00:01:21.930> suspension

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
independent suspension

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.429 
independent suspension
we've<00:01:23.520> got<00:01:23.700> sensors<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> shocks<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.110> can

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
we've got sensors on the shocks that can

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.890 
we've got sensors on the shocks that can
tell<00:01:25.650> how<00:01:26.159> far<00:01:26.430> they're<00:01:26.670> displaced<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.780> it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
tell how far they're displaced so it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.719 
tell how far they're displaced so it
runs<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.259> premium<00:01:28.439> unleaded<00:01:28.770> gasoline<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.670> you

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
runs on premium unleaded gasoline so you

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.069 
runs on premium unleaded gasoline so you
can<00:01:29.909> literally<00:01:30.119> just<00:01:30.479> drive<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.899> vehicle

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
can literally just drive this vehicle

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.760 
can literally just drive this vehicle
into<00:01:31.649> the<00:01:31.680> gas<00:01:31.890> station<00:01:32.399> and<00:01:32.579> fill<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.570> up

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
into the gas station and fill it up

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:42.240 
into the gas station and fill it up
right<00:01:34.770> here

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.980

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
the anticipated price of the transition

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.429 
the anticipated price of the transition
is<00:01:45.110> 194<00:01:45.920> thousand<00:01:46.399> dollars<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:46.939> we<00:01:47.750> expect<00:01:48.290> to

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
is 194 thousand dollars and we expect to

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:58.090 
is 194 thousand dollars and we expect to
have<00:01:48.740> a<00:01:48.770> first<00:01:49.159> delivery<00:01:49.520> in<00:01:49.640> 2010<00:01:57.100> it's

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
have a first delivery in 2010 it's

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.340 
have a first delivery in 2010 it's
something<00:01:58.460> that<00:01:58.670> we<00:01:58.789> designed<00:01:59.570> by<00:01:59.780> pilots<00:02:00.170> for

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
something that we designed by pilots for

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.320 
something that we designed by pilots for
pilot<00:02:00.710> David<00:02:00.890> pilots<00:02:01.520> decided<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:01.970> fly<00:02:02.149> more

often or people more people decided to
get<00:02:04.009> their<00:02:04.159> pilot's<00:02:04.460> license<00:02:04.729> because<00:02:04.850> of

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
get their pilot's license because of

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.279 
get their pilot's license because of
this<00:02:05.240> that<00:02:05.390> would<00:02:05.509> be<00:02:05.539> a<00:02:05.630> wonderful<00:02:05.840> success

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
this that would be a wonderful success

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.169

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
but we want to be clear that this is not

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.910
