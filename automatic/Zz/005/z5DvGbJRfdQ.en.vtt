00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.330 

okay<00:00:18.120> so<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.930> what<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.140> did<00:00:19.230> was<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.740> used<00:00:20.040> this

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
okay so so what I did was I used this

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.880 
okay so so what I did was I used this
five-in-one<00:00:20.970> tool<00:00:21.000> here<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.690> use<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.260> add<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
five-in-one tool here I use the add the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.340 
five-in-one tool here I use the add the
edge<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.550> here<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.540> went<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.170> middle

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
edge of it here and I went in the middle

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.420 
edge of it here and I went in the middle
of<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> crack

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
of the crack

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.830 
of the crack
I<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.850> carved<00:00:27.450> it<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.020> I<00:00:28.050> got<00:00:28.950> it<00:00:29.369> in

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
I just carved it in so I got it in

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.869 
I just carved it in so I got it in
deeper<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.680> that's<00:00:31.890> definitely<00:00:32.550> going<00:00:32.760> to

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
deeper so that's definitely going to

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.060 
deeper so that's definitely going to
help<00:00:33.030> because<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.300> want<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.600> get<00:00:33.690> as<00:00:33.809> much

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
help because you want to get as much

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.560 
help because you want to get as much
setting<00:00:35.070> compound<00:00:35.699> in<00:00:35.940> there<00:00:36.120> as<00:00:36.330> possible

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
setting compound in there as possible

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.210 
setting compound in there as possible
because<00:00:36.900> that's<00:00:37.140> what's<00:00:37.650> going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.830> help<00:00:38.010> it

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
because that's what's going to help it

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.250 
because that's what's going to help it
not<00:00:38.430> crack<00:00:38.699> again<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.300> then<00:00:39.780> what<00:00:39.900> I<00:00:39.930> did<00:00:40.020> to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
not crack again and then what I did to

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.470 
not crack again and then what I did to
is<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.500> took<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.710> vacuum<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.400> vacuumed<00:00:42.090> all

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
is that took a vacuum and I vacuumed all

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.280 
is that took a vacuum and I vacuumed all
this<00:00:42.870> out<00:00:43.110> here<00:00:44.239> so<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.390> when<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:45.809> go<00:00:45.960> see

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
this out here so that when we go see

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.500 
this out here so that when we go see
what's<00:00:46.470> skim<00:00:47.220> it<00:00:47.400> you<00:00:47.519> won't<00:00:47.640> get<00:00:47.850> chump<00:00:48.149> chump

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
what's skim it you won't get chump chump

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.020 
what's skim it you won't get chump chump
chumps<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.079> your<00:00:49.230> mud<00:00:49.380> so<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.850> we're<00:00:50.940> going

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
chumps in your mud so what we're going

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.130 
chumps in your mud so what we're going
to<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.180> now<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.540> we're<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> come<00:00:52.110> down

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
to do now is we're going to come down

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
to do now is we're going to come down
here<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.120> going<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.420> mix<00:00:54.600> up<00:00:54.780> some

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
here and I'm just going to mix up some

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.580 
here and I'm just going to mix up some
some<00:00:56.160> mud<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.840> here<00:00:58.110> I<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.320> have

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
some mud here so in here I just have

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.700 
some mud here so in here I just have
all-purpose<00:00:59.340> joint<00:00:59.670> cut<00:00:59.820> along<00:01:00.090> here<00:01:03.710> we're

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
all-purpose joint cut along here we're

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.980 
all-purpose joint cut along here we're
just<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.009> mix<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.550> mud<00:01:06.300> pie<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
just going to mix up a mud pie so that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.260 
just going to mix up a mud pie so that
this<00:01:09.990> takes<00:01:10.289> care<00:01:10.649> of<00:01:10.710> two<00:01:11.100> or<00:01:11.460> three<00:01:11.520> coats<00:01:11.910> up

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
this takes care of two or three coats up

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:25.969 
this takes care of two or three coats up
there<00:01:12.509> so<00:01:13.170> aside<00:01:14.009> time<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.369> go<00:01:14.460> with<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:24.979> you

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
there so aside time we go with that you

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.800 
there so aside time we go with that you
just<00:01:26.100> want<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.429> build<00:01:26.700> build<00:01:27.179> build<00:01:27.330> out<00:01:27.690> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
just want to build build build out the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.279 
just want to build build build out the
banks<00:01:28.170> hair<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.569> it<00:01:30.600> looks<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:31.050> out

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
banks hair so that it looks like out

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:32.900 
banks hair so that it looks like out
there<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.800> don't<00:01:31.890> want<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.160> leave<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.610> any

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
there you don't want to leave in any

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:42.710 
there you don't want to leave in any
joint<00:01:33.179> compound<00:01:33.690> in<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.679> middle<00:01:35.459> there<00:01:41.720> okay

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
joint compound in the middle there okay

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.480 
joint compound in the middle there okay
so<00:01:44.060> it's<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.179> like<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.599> now<00:01:45.929> I<00:01:45.959> just<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.590> just

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
so it's a like that now I just have just

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.969 
so it's a like that now I just have just
water<00:01:47.940> in<00:01:48.300> here<00:01:48.539> and<00:01:48.869> I'm<00:01:49.349> just<00:01:49.530> going<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.679> fill

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
water in here and I'm just going to fill

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.370 
water in here and I'm just going to fill
this<00:01:50.190> up<00:01:50.399> here<00:01:50.759> I'm<00:01:51.660> gonna<00:01:51.780> probably<00:01:51.990> put<00:01:52.200> like

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
this up here I'm gonna probably put like

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.130 
this up here I'm gonna probably put like
a<00:01:52.530> quarter<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.069> an<00:01:53.160> inch<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.490> there<00:01:56.840> just<00:01:57.840> down

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
a quarter of an inch in there just down

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.940 
a quarter of an inch in there just down
and<00:01:58.530> then<00:01:58.739> in<00:01:58.920> here<00:01:59.459> in<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.869> container<00:02:01.590> here

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
and then in here in this container here

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:10.070 
and then in here in this container here
I<00:02:02.160> have<00:02:02.610> plat<00:02:03.599> plaster<00:02:04.440> of<00:02:04.560> Paris<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:08.869> this<00:02:09.869> is

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
I have plat plaster of Paris and this is

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.720 
I have plat plaster of Paris and this is
what<00:02:10.319> makes<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:11.640> adjoint<00:02:12.060> compound<00:02:12.540> set<00:02:12.840> hard

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
what makes the adjoint compound set hard

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.580 
what makes the adjoint compound set hard
so<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.790> just<00:02:14.940> want<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.209> add<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.170> middle

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
so you just want to add it to the middle

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.420 
so you just want to add it to the middle
there

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.970 

now<00:02:23.430> my<00:02:23.670> finger<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.150> going<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.450> push<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.900> out<00:02:25.590> to

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
now my finger is going to push it out to

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.630 
now my finger is going to push it out to
the<00:02:26.190> banks

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.350 

and<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.240> want<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.510> water<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:35.160> absorb<00:02:36.160> all<00:02:36.910> the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
and you want the water to absorb all the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.570 
and you want the water to absorb all the
plaster<00:02:37.930> now<00:02:38.560> when<00:02:38.740> I'm<00:02:38.830> pushing<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.370> out<00:02:39.550> to

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
plaster now when I'm pushing it out to

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.190 
plaster now when I'm pushing it out to
the<00:02:39.880> banks<00:02:40.180> here<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.420> don't<00:02:40.510> want<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.840> push<00:02:41.020> it

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
the banks here you don't want to push it

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.530 
the banks here you don't want to push it
on<00:02:41.350> on<00:02:41.770> to<00:02:42.040> this<00:02:42.190> joint<00:02:42.580> joint<00:02:42.910> compound<00:02:43.270> here

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
on on to this joint joint compound here

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.690 
on on to this joint joint compound here
you<00:02:44.470> just<00:02:44.680> want<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.890> push<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.520> edge

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
you just want to push it to that edge

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.790 
you just want to push it to that edge
there<00:02:45.970> where<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.360> water<00:02:46.630> starts<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.290> pull<00:02:47.530> up

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
there where the water starts to pull up

00:02:47.800 --> 00:03:01.530

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
wife and when you go to mix it just get

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.020 
wife and when you go to mix it just get
like<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.260> little<00:03:56.560> bit<00:03:56.650> it's<00:03:57.040> me<00:03:57.280> harder<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:57.820> mix

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
like a little bit it's me harder to mix

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.310 
like a little bit it's me harder to mix
because<00:03:58.269> it's<00:03:58.480> going<00:03:58.600> to<00:03:58.660> be<00:03:58.720> dry<00:03:58.900> missing

chunks in it so just give that a few

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.150 
chunks in it so just give that a few
minutes<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.350> my<00:04:02.440> setup<00:04:02.739> and<00:04:04.530> once<00:04:05.530> again<00:04:05.709> I<00:04:05.860> did

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
minutes to my setup and once again I did

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.550 
minutes to my setup and once again I did
this<00:04:06.489> stuff<00:04:06.760> is<00:04:06.910> great<00:04:07.180> here<00:04:08.280> because

again I can do all my mixing on mixing

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.449 
again I can do all my mixing on mixing
board<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.700> not<00:04:14.090> have<00:04:14.390> to<00:04:14.510> clean<00:04:14.810> up<00:04:14.989> any<00:04:15.459> any

on the previous team tape job so so if
you<00:04:57.530> use<00:04:57.740> this<00:04:58.040> the<00:04:58.669> joint<00:04:59.060> compound<00:04:59.540> will<00:04:59.870> go

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
you use this the joint compound will go

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.560 
you use this the joint compound will go
through<00:05:00.440> all<00:05:00.740> these<00:05:02.740> Criss<00:05:03.740> crosses<00:05:04.250> here<00:05:04.570> so

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
through all these Criss crosses here so

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.629 
through all these Criss crosses here so
it's<00:05:05.930> just<00:05:06.020> it's<00:05:06.290> like<00:05:06.470> a<00:05:06.620> lot<00:05:06.830> easier<00:05:07.280> to

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
it's just it's like a lot easier to

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.909 
it's just it's like a lot easier to
embed<00:05:08.060> it<00:05:08.240> then<00:05:09.020> with<00:05:09.229> the<00:05:09.320> paper<00:05:09.500> tape<00:05:09.770> but

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
embed it then with the paper tape but

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.870 
embed it then with the paper tape but
you<00:05:10.010> can<00:05:10.160> use<00:05:10.370> either<00:05:10.700> or<00:05:11.979> so<00:05:12.979> I<00:05:13.010> have<00:05:13.400> two<00:05:13.729> of

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
you can use either or so I have two of

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:21.430 
you can use either or so I have two of
these<00:05:14.000> pre<00:05:14.570> pre<00:05:14.960> cut<00:05:15.260> here<00:05:15.669> and<00:05:19.990> and<00:05:20.990> again

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
these pre pre cut here and and again

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.250 
these pre pre cut here and and again
it's<00:05:22.160> uh<00:05:22.370> it's<00:05:22.669> it's<00:05:23.090> not<00:05:23.270> very<00:05:23.479> important<00:05:23.990> to

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
it's uh it's it's not very important to

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
it's uh it's it's not very important to
gouge<00:05:24.919> that<00:05:25.370> crap<00:05:25.729> that<00:05:26.120> back<00:05:26.539> in<00:05:26.780> again

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
gouge that crap that back in again

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.390 
gouge that crap that back in again
because<00:05:28.280> if<00:05:28.880> you<00:05:29.360> don't<00:05:29.680> then<00:05:30.680> you're<00:05:30.950> putting

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
because if you don't then you're putting

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.490 
because if you don't then you're putting
just<00:05:31.729> joint<00:05:32.060> compound<00:05:32.479> on<00:05:32.750> top<00:05:33.169> of<00:05:33.410> the

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
just joint compound on top of the

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.690 
just joint compound on top of the
surface<00:05:33.789> but<00:05:34.789> the<00:05:35.030> the<00:05:35.560> crap<00:05:36.560> lies<00:05:37.010> underneath

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
surface but the the crap lies underneath

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.820 
surface but the the crap lies underneath
