00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.310 

and<00:00:10.550> we'll<00:00:10.880> always<00:00:11.180> wanted<00:00:11.540> a<00:00:11.630> career<00:00:11.780> to

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
and we'll always wanted a career to

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.530 
and we'll always wanted a career to
involve<00:00:12.650> animals<00:00:13.250> and<00:00:13.520> science<00:00:13.969> and<00:00:14.150> so<00:00:14.450> I've

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
involve animals and science and so I've

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.000 
involve animals and science and so I've
gotten<00:00:14.750> together<00:00:14.870> and<00:00:15.200> watch<00:00:15.350> their<00:00:15.559> back<00:00:15.740> and

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
gotten together and watch their back and

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.830 
gotten together and watch their back and
I<00:00:16.670> did<00:00:16.820> though<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:17.029> working<00:00:17.330> person<00:00:17.480> I<00:00:17.750> was

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
I did though the working person I was

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.499 
I did though the working person I was
about<00:00:18.020> 16<00:00:18.500> or<00:00:18.619> 17<00:00:18.680> and<00:00:19.220> after<00:00:20.090> doing<00:00:20.270> that<00:00:20.450> I

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509 
about 16 or 17 and after doing that I

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:21.910 
about 16 or 17 and after doing that I
decided<00:00:20.660> without<00:00:21.140> with<00:00:21.380> testing<00:00:21.710> that<00:00:21.800> I

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
decided without with testing that I

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.950 
decided without with testing that I
wanted<00:00:22.160> to<00:00:22.279> do<00:00:22.509> it's<00:00:23.509> really<00:00:23.750> good<00:00:23.869> at

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
here because it's involved in a college

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.580 
here because it's involved in a college
system<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:34.879> you<00:00:34.940> have<00:00:35.170> individualize<00:00:36.170> excuse

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
system so you have individualize excuse

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.020 
system so you have individualize excuse

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
really up to date and you know all

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.479 
really up to date and you know all
that's<00:00:41.180> going<00:00:41.420> on<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:41.780> quick

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.580 

and<00:00:49.090> well<00:00:49.600> I<00:00:49.629> kind<00:00:49.899> of<00:00:49.960> looked<00:00:50.140> around<00:00:50.230> more

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
and well I kind of looked around more

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.520 
and well I kind of looked around more
and<00:00:51.000> had<00:00:52.000> a<00:00:52.030> really<00:00:52.300> good<00:00:52.420> look<00:00:52.570> and<00:00:52.930> I've

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
and had a really good look and I've

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.950 
and had a really good look and I've
narrowed<00:00:53.739> it<00:00:53.920> down<00:00:53.949> to<00:00:54.129> that<00:00:54.460> small<00:00:54.790> slice<00:00:55.030> and

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
narrowed it down to that small slice and

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.330 
narrowed it down to that small slice and
then<00:00:56.290> I<00:00:56.379> just<00:00:56.530> went<00:00:56.649> through<00:00:56.920> them<00:00:57.129> and

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
then I just went through them and

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.460 
then I just went through them and
decided<00:00:57.640> which<00:00:57.910> ones<00:00:58.180> folks<00:00:58.750> really<00:00:59.140> like

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
decided which ones folks really like

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.619 
decided which ones folks really like
seeing<00:01:00.040> myself<00:01:00.190> living<00:01:00.579> in<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:01.329> I<00:01:01.449> really

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
seeing myself living in and I really

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.330 
seeing myself living in and I really
like<00:01:01.719> sound<00:01:01.989> pretty<00:01:02.469> small<00:01:02.739> but<00:01:03.070> it's<00:01:03.250> not

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
like sound pretty small but it's not

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.490 
like sound pretty small but it's not
people<00:01:03.790> get<00:01:04.269> frustrated<00:01:04.960> but<00:01:05.140> you<00:01:05.199> feel

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
people get frustrated but you feel

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.380 
people get frustrated but you feel

and<00:01:12.979> I've<00:01:13.979> been<00:01:14.100> really<00:01:14.280> involved<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.760> rowing

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
and I've been really involved in rowing

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.540 
and I've been really involved in rowing
and<00:01:15.390> that's<00:01:16.110> been<00:01:16.290> really<00:01:16.440> fun<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.400> also

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
and that's been really fun and but also

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.700 
and that's been really fun and but also
I<00:01:17.940> really<00:01:18.150> enjoy<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> course<00:01:18.690> because<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
I really enjoy the course because the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
lecturers are really good in there like

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.060 
lecturers are really good in there like
top<00:01:21.630> researchers<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.320> their<00:01:22.440> field

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.930 

and<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.880> hard<00:01:31.060> like<00:01:31.780> moment<00:01:32.200> probably<00:01:32.350> been

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
and the hard like moment probably been

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.370 
and the hard like moment probably been
examined<00:01:33.940> during<00:01:34.180> sometimes<00:01:34.780> everyone<00:01:35.230> gets

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
examined during sometimes everyone gets

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.200 
examined during sometimes everyone gets
really<00:01:35.560> stressed<00:01:35.830> he<00:01:36.100> was<00:01:36.220> not<00:01:36.400> virtually<00:01:36.940> and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
really stressed he was not virtually and

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.810 
really stressed he was not virtually and
but<00:01:38.050> actually<00:01:38.380> after<00:01:39.100> you<00:01:39.220> download<00:01:39.610> and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
but actually after you download and

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.210 
but actually after you download and
you've<00:01:39.910> done<00:01:40.180> to<00:01:40.360> get<00:01:40.510> your<00:01:40.930> results<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:41.500> kind

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
you've done to get your results and kind

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:51.929 
you've done to get your results and kind
of<00:01:42.250> made<00:01:42.460> week<00:01:42.670> still<00:01:43.000> really<00:01:43.180> fun<00:01:43.420> and

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.029 

um<00:01:52.149> if<00:01:52.780> you<00:01:52.990> do<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:53.200> for<00:01:53.409> me<00:01:53.500> probably<00:01:53.860> going<00:01:53.979> to

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
and people who might be a supervisor

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.010 
and people who might be a supervisor
together<00:02:00.670> they<00:02:00.970> might<00:02:01.180> want<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.479> be<00:02:01.689> just<00:02:01.869> to
