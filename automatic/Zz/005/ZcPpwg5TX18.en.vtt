going to show you how you can make an
easy<00:00:06.319> infinity<00:00:07.220> bracelet<00:00:07.669> so<00:00:08.600> let's<00:00:08.900> get

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
easy infinity bracelet so let's get

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:20.180 
easy infinity bracelet so let's get
started

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.570

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.570 

go<00:00:23.180> get<00:00:23.390> some<00:00:23.600> 20<00:00:23.870> gauge<00:00:23.900> wire<00:00:24.350> and<00:00:24.710> some<00:00:25.370> beads

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
go get some 20 gauge wire and some beads

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.310 
go get some 20 gauge wire and some beads
and<00:00:25.910> it<00:00:26.030> doesn't<00:00:26.300> really<00:00:26.510> matter<00:00:26.750> you<00:00:26.930> can<00:00:27.290> use

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
and it doesn't really matter you can use

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.440 
and it doesn't really matter you can use
large<00:00:27.800> beads<00:00:28.100> or<00:00:28.250> small<00:00:28.580> just<00:00:29.090> one<00:00:29.270> of<00:00:29.390> the

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
large beads or small just one of the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.240 
large beads or small just one of the
components<00:00:29.990> that<00:00:30.020> I<00:00:30.170> had<00:00:30.350> made<00:00:30.560> before<00:00:30.740> my

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
components that I had made before my

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.540 
components that I had made before my
computer<00:00:31.670> crashed<00:00:32.050> but<00:00:33.050> I<00:00:33.080> lost<00:00:33.350> that<00:00:33.830> video

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
computer crashed but I lost that video

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.220 
computer crashed but I lost that video
so<00:00:34.970> now<00:00:35.300> I'm<00:00:35.360> going<00:00:35.540> to<00:00:35.630> have<00:00:35.720> to<00:00:35.840> make<00:00:35.989> another

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
so now I'm going to have to make another

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.100 
so now I'm going to have to make another
one<00:00:36.470> to<00:00:36.680> show<00:00:36.710> you<00:00:36.950> so<00:00:37.940> you<00:00:38.000> could<00:00:38.660> have<00:00:38.780> used

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
one to show you so you could have used

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.290 
one to show you so you could have used
some<00:00:39.320> small<00:00:39.470> beads<00:00:39.890> like<00:00:40.309> this<00:00:40.340> I'm<00:00:40.970> going<00:00:41.210> to

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
some small beads like this I'm going to

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.530 
some small beads like this I'm going to
use<00:00:41.450> these<00:00:41.750> iridescent<00:00:42.170> ones<00:00:43.150> I'm<00:00:44.150> not<00:00:44.210> sure

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
use these iridescent ones I'm not sure

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.420 
use these iridescent ones I'm not sure
how<00:00:44.750> long<00:00:44.809> a<00:00:45.020> piece<00:00:45.290> of<00:00:45.470> wire<00:00:45.680> you'll<00:00:46.010> need<00:00:46.250> so

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
how long a piece of wire you'll need so

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.979 
how long a piece of wire you'll need so
you<00:00:46.489> could<00:00:46.700> always<00:00:46.850> use<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.330> wire<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:47.840> leave

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
you could always use the wire and leave

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.260 
you could always use the wire and leave
it<00:00:48.140> connected<00:00:48.290> to<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.739> spool<00:00:49.190> but<00:00:49.940> I'm<00:00:50.059> just

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
it connected to the spool but I'm just

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
it connected to the spool but I'm just
going<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.420> go<00:00:50.570> ahead<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:50.960> I'm<00:00:51.020> going<00:00:51.200> to

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
going to go ahead and I'm going to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.979 
going to go ahead and I'm going to
thread<00:00:51.559> some<00:00:51.949> beads<00:00:52.190> onto<00:00:52.550> a<00:00:53.059> piece<00:00:53.600> of<00:00:53.780> wire

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
thread some beads onto a piece of wire

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.710 
thread some beads onto a piece of wire
that<00:00:54.260> I've<00:00:54.379> cut<00:00:55.090> so<00:00:56.090> I'm<00:00:56.180> just<00:00:56.360> going<00:00:56.540> to<00:00:56.570> go

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
that I've cut so I'm just going to go

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.870 
that I've cut so I'm just going to go
ahead<00:00:56.840> off-camera<00:00:57.470> and<00:00:57.770> thread<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:58.400> beads<00:00:58.579> on

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
ahead off-camera and thread the beads on

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.030 
ahead off-camera and thread the beads on
okay<00:00:59.180> I've<00:00:59.329> gone<00:00:59.510> ahead<00:00:59.690> my<00:00:59.930> foot<00:01:00.140> on<00:01:00.230> 32<00:01:00.770> beads

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
okay I've gone ahead my foot on 32 beads

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.460 
okay I've gone ahead my foot on 32 beads
oh<00:01:01.399> here's<00:01:02.210> another<00:01:02.300> quick<00:01:02.750> tip<00:01:02.930> if<00:01:03.140> you're

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
oh here's another quick tip if you're

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.859 
oh here's another quick tip if you're
working<00:01:03.950> on<00:01:04.070> beading<00:01:04.580> on<00:01:04.729> wire<00:01:05.300> just<00:01:05.690> make<00:01:05.840> a

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
working on beading on wire just make a

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.510 
working on beading on wire just make a
loop<00:01:06.110> on<00:01:06.290> each<00:01:06.350> end<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:07.130> in<00:01:07.280> case<00:01:07.460> you

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
loop on each end so that in case you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.120 
loop on each end so that in case you
drop<00:01:07.850> it<00:01:08.210> then<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.960> beach<00:01:09.170> won't<00:01:09.530> go<00:01:09.649> fall<00:01:09.920> off

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
drop it then the beach won't go fall off

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.880 
drop it then the beach won't go fall off
okay<00:01:10.790> after<00:01:11.180> I<00:01:11.450> put<00:01:11.630> on<00:01:11.720> about<00:01:11.840> 32<00:01:12.440> beads

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
okay after I put on about 32 beads

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.790 
okay after I put on about 32 beads
I<00:01:12.950> just<00:01:13.220> sort<00:01:13.520> of<00:01:13.640> wound<00:01:14.509> it<00:01:14.869> around<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:15.770> my

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
I just sort of wound it around in my

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.080 
I just sort of wound it around in my
hand<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:18.250> 16<00:01:19.250> seemed<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:19.790> be<00:01:19.910> the<00:01:20.060> right

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
hand and 16 seemed to be the right

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.370 
hand and 16 seemed to be the right
amount<00:01:20.330> now<00:01:20.690> that's<00:01:20.869> going<00:01:21.050> to<00:01:21.110> be<00:01:21.170> different

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
amount now that's going to be different

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.380 
amount now that's going to be different
for<00:01:22.009> everybody<00:01:22.280> because<00:01:22.670> it's<00:01:22.970> all<00:01:23.090> going<00:01:23.360> to

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
for everybody because it's all going to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.749 
for everybody because it's all going to
depend<00:01:23.570> on<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.110> size<00:01:24.290> beads<00:01:24.680> you<00:01:24.890> use<00:01:25.130> bring

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
depend on the size beads you use bring

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.240 
depend on the size beads you use bring
this<00:01:26.000> together<00:01:26.450> like<00:01:26.720> that<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.229> I<00:01:27.770> want<00:01:28.069> to

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
this together like that and I want to

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.460 
this together like that and I want to
leave<00:01:28.429> a<00:01:28.610> little<00:01:28.819> bit<00:01:29.060> of<00:01:29.240> room<00:01:29.569> because<00:01:30.319> I'm

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
leave a little bit of room because I'm

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.440 
leave a little bit of room because I'm
going<00:01:30.709> to<00:01:30.830> be<00:01:30.950> making<00:01:31.190> a<00:01:31.520> twist<00:01:31.850> in<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.119> center

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
going to be making a twist in the center

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.850 
going to be making a twist in the center
and<00:01:32.569> it's<00:01:32.690> going<00:01:32.869> to<00:01:32.959> need<00:01:33.050> some<00:01:33.410> room<00:01:33.619> with

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
and it's going to need some room with

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.050 
and it's going to need some room with
the<00:01:34.009> wire<00:01:34.220> so<00:01:35.090> I'm<00:01:35.360> just<00:01:35.600> going<00:01:35.929> to<00:01:37.030> make<00:01:38.030> a

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
the wire so I'm just going to make a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.199 
the wire so I'm just going to make a
little<00:01:38.300> pier<00:01:39.520> I'm<00:01:40.520> also<00:01:40.700> going<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:41.030> make<00:01:41.149> a

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
little pier I'm also going to make a

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:44.350 
little pier I'm also going to make a
loop<00:01:41.420> on<00:01:41.569> this<00:01:42.470> end<00:01:42.890> then<00:01:43.819> I'm<00:01:43.940> going<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:44.209> need

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
loop on this end then I'm going to need

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.699 
loop on this end then I'm going to need
some<00:01:44.509> cutters<00:01:44.899> so<00:01:45.140> that<00:01:45.289> I<00:01:45.380> can<00:01:45.590> cut<00:01:45.890> this<00:01:46.509> and

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
some cutters so that I can cut this and

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
some cutters so that I can cut this and
then<00:01:48.709> turn<00:01:48.979> this<00:01:49.220> into<00:01:49.459> a<00:01:49.610> loop<00:01:54.640> tighten<00:01:55.640> up

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
then turn this into a loop tighten up

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.580 
then turn this into a loop tighten up
that<00:01:56.000> loop<00:01:58.840> now<00:01:59.840> I'm<00:01:59.899> going<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.229> cut<00:02:00.410> this

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
that loop now I'm going to cut this

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.520 
that loop now I'm going to cut this
other<00:02:00.800> side<00:02:01.209> I'm<00:02:02.209> going<00:02:02.599> to<00:02:02.690> make<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:02.899> loop<00:02:03.200> like

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
other side I'm going to make a loop like

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.779 
other side I'm going to make a loop like
that

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
that

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.940 
that
now<00:02:05.330> I'm<00:02:05.420> going<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:05.690> open<00:02:05.869> it<00:02:06.140> up<00:02:06.259> so<00:02:06.470> that<00:02:06.619> that

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
now I'm going to open it up so that that

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.669 
now I'm going to open it up so that that
is<00:02:07.190> in<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.459> center<00:02:08.110> I'm<00:02:09.110> going<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.470> bring

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
is in the center I'm going to bring

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.800 
is in the center I'm going to bring
those<00:02:09.800> together<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:10.610> then<00:02:11.330> I'm<00:02:11.480> going<00:02:11.720> to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
those together and then I'm going to

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.640 
those together and then I'm going to
make<00:02:11.930> one<00:02:12.200> twist<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.990> that's<00:02:15.290> going<00:02:15.560> to

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
make one twist like that that's going to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.270 
make one twist like that that's going to
give<00:02:15.800> me<00:02:15.920> my<00:02:16.099> infinity<00:02:16.910> design<00:02:18.040> that's<00:02:19.040> going

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
give me my infinity design that's going

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.360 
give me my infinity design that's going
to<00:02:19.400> fit<00:02:19.640> there<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.530> have<00:02:21.530> another<00:02:21.739> video<00:02:22.160> for

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
to fit there I have another video for

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.370 
to fit there I have another video for
making<00:02:22.670> your<00:02:22.819> own<00:02:22.849> chains

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.860 

and<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:29.040> also<00:02:29.250> have<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:30.000> video<00:02:30.330> on<00:02:30.570> how<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.750> make

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
and I also have a video on how to make

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.330 
and I also have a video on how to make
your<00:02:30.990> own<00:02:31.170> class

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.710 

so<00:02:38.340> now<00:02:38.520> I'm<00:02:38.640> just<00:02:38.820> going<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.240> connect<00:02:39.570> these

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
so now I'm just going to connect these

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.690 
so now I'm just going to connect these
on<00:02:39.930> both<00:02:40.080> sides<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.710> my<00:02:41.010> infinity<00:02:41.790> design<00:02:43.700> plus

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
on both sides of my infinity design plus

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.040 
on both sides of my infinity design plus
that<00:02:44.970> loop<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:47.300> connect<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.450> chain<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:48.870> this

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
that loop and connect the chain on this

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.400 
that loop and connect the chain on this
side<00:02:49.940> wear<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.690> will<00:02:51.870> be<00:02:52.050> on<00:02:52.350> the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
side wear it so that this will be on the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.680 
side wear it so that this will be on the
underneath<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.490> won't<00:02:53.610> show<00:02:53.940> there<00:02:54.540> you

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
underneath so that won't show there you

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.080 
underneath so that won't show there you
go<00:02:54.870> that's<00:02:55.050> how<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.380> can<00:02:55.530> make<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.710> very<00:02:56.010> easy

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
go that's how you can make a very easy

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.750 
go that's how you can make a very easy
infinity<00:02:57.380> bracelet

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
infinity bracelet

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.030 
infinity bracelet
and<00:03:00.270> you<00:03:00.420> could<00:03:00.599> also<00:03:00.750> make<00:03:01.349> these<00:03:01.530> into

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
and you could also make these into

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:12.620 
and you could also make these into
necklaces

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.690
