00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.250
 yeah 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.940
 me 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.940
 me 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.480
 me 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.500
 The book is that day and hair quality 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.630
 Then I assume various things 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.200
 In all books 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.790
 Without error 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:41.020
 It is very difficult to shake pages and send pages automatically. 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.410
 But to reduce human intervention as much as possible 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.840
 Page feed 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:52.790
 I did what to devise to reduce errors 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.640
 Describe the error of page turning 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:01:01.250
 As a page turning error that occurs with this method 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.089
 There are two people one is 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:11.630
 se dare when sucked up the page 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:13.900
 And got sucked up multiple pages at the same time instead of just one page which this every large 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.650
 I will be turning pages 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.220
 Multipage feed error 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.830
 There is that 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.980
 This is the most annoying thing, and I took about two measures for this 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:33.330
 Then one more kind of page sale 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.330
 Fail to suck up this page 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.310
 With the power of the magic ball 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.610
 Page is good 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.290
 Not in the form of say this is not sucked up 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.380
 An error occurs 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.740
 This is a paper with a thick hair 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:56.380
 It is expected from it 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:58.560
 At the beginning or end of a book that has a relatively hard cover 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.710
 Sakura beautiful is 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.659
 I took measures for this 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.200
 So first 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:11.610
 Describe multi- page feed errors 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.170
 There are two major measures 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.210
 one 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:23.360
 Backling motion 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:28.330
 That's how this box moves 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.810
 Not only simply suck up the page up 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.010
 The way to in 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.600
 Lower the Latin box a little 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.290
 I bend God like this 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:46.710
 The extra page peels off at that time 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:49.670
 For example, the operation of this page, which went this fall when bending when it has become this kind of wind 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.670
 I'm adding 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.290
 Then one more point 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.460
 You Yes with a thing called air separator 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:07.770
 this is 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:10.819
 Blow air inward from this gate on the page 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.840
 It is this part 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:18.090
 In this part to by blowing air 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:23.819
 It's about opening pages and pages 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:26.890
 Let's see where it actually moves Let's look at buckling motion 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:31.230
 It does not go down 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.230
 It will rise and fall 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:40.980
 Go down 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.980
 One of the people who came up and dropped off here 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.950
 It is a motor of air page separator 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:59.750
 The air blows into the corner of the book and the page flutters 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:04.540
 Pages and pages peel off 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.540
 Balpage feed disappears 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:14.540
 There is a little reflection and it is hard to see , but this is installed in the platen box 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:19.220
 It is a barometric pressure sensor 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.620
 Where is the white plate looks like where it looks 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:27.870
 this is 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:31.510
 By sucking the air through the platen box when trying to pick up the page 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:36.350
 If the page can not be picked up well 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:43.240
 Reported as an error because the air pressure does not decrease 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.240
 Barometric pressure sensor comes with for detecting an error in the page pickup 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:56.540
 I failed in the page pickup now 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:59.880
 If page pickup fails, it will retry without taking a picture 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:07.730
 Successful in the first retry 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:07.730
 Stop the scanner and notify the operator if it fails three or more times 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.080
 Ray 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.000
 me 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.270
 me 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.270
 yeah yeah 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.710
 me 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:30.440
 uh 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.310
 me 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.390
 me 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.129
 ana 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.000
 me 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:38.750
 yeah yeah 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.750
 me
