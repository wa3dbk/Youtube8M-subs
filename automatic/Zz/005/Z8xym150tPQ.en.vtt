going to kind of work the edges into
place<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.590> make<00:00:52.770> sure<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.250> all

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
place and make sure that it all

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.049 
place and make sure that it all
appropriately<00:00:54.620> fits<00:00:55.620> into<00:00:55.949> its<00:00:56.670> kind<00:00:57.000> of

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
appropriately fits into its kind of

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.610 
appropriately fits into its kind of
groove<00:00:57.420> here<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.960> once<00:00:58.140> you've<00:00:58.320> done<00:00:58.559> that

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
groove here and once you've done that

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.380 
groove here and once you've done that
and<00:00:58.920> i<00:00:58.980> think<00:00:59.219> i<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.370> that's<00:01:00.090> all<00:01:00.210> there<00:01:00.329> is

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.630 
and i think i have that's all there is
to<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.410> take<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> look<00:01:02.160> at<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
bumper is just that it just kind of

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.800 
bumper is just that it just kind of
protects<00:01:04.890> all<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.430> edges<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.600> see
