00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
 good 

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.359
 Juan Pablo is a friend and chef 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.279
 Professional follower of the blog since 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.259
 a few days and he sends me a message to the 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.780
 website where it says literally what 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:13.730
 next taking advantage of that we have so 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.100
 good fruit why not post a 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.830
 passion fruit pie recipe a dessert 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.869
 light but powerful the ideal flavor for 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.660
 end a good Sunday afternoon at 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.060
 side of friends and family and has a lot 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.189
 reason this passion fruit country of today is 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.670
 ideal to share an afternoon in 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.680
 company of friends and family 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.170
 I had never made a loaf so it has 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.690
 been a challenge I finally achieved a 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.650
 very very good taste although it was not 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.350
 perfectly circular I will need 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.199
 about 170 grams of milk biscuits 60 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.780
 grams of butter 200 milliliters of 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.800
 milk cream 2 gelatin sachets without 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:57.040
 flavor 300 grams of cream cheese 80 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.720
 grams of sugar 3 passion fruit and a pinch 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.180
 of salt 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.430
 I'm going to make the base of the cookie the most 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.150
 fun of the recipe so I put in 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.200
 a container the cookies already crush 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.690
 It can also be done with a blender 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.200
 or in a shredder I did it with the 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.320
 hand 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.450
 crushing 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.700
 when I have it well crushed add the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.200
 butter to me it began to hold me 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.840
 a little bit because it was next to the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.120
 oven while it was on but not 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.280
 matter in fact it is much better that you are 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.960
 well blandita if it were done with the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.350
 butter freshly taken out of the fridge 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.759
 it's almost impossible to undo it so 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.770
 better to have it out a couple of hours 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.520
 before starting the preparation or 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.219
 melt it a little 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.200
 once I have it incorporated I put it 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.390
 on the mold and crushed well with the 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.340
 hands I am using this mold 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.619
 disposable since the hardest part 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.649
 of this recipe is to unmold the country 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.070
 so I thought about using one that could 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.930
 cut 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.200
 I take the mold with the cookie to the 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.200
 fridge 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.170
 yes 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.470
 Now I'm going to extract the juice from a 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.060
 passion fruit and half sack the pulp and good 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.540
 and a few to nourish last a long time 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.310
 seeds I do not add water or anything just 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.330
 I want the concentrate of the fruit that 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.330
 Sneak and reserve 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.360
 the other passion fruit and a half I'm going to 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.800
 mix with two teaspoons of sugar and 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.800
 I also save it in the fridge 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.280
 I continue with the cream I'm going to beat 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.890
 almost completely cold is 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.800
 fundamental to doing it better then 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.170
 leave an hour in the freezer the cream 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.090
 of milk and also the container of 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.310
 glass and the beater I'm going to use 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.840
 start to beat and when you start to 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.330
 make a little foam 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.819
 I add half of the sugar ie 40 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.330
 grams more or less and the rest I reserve 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.670
 for later 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.730
 I continue to do with patience and without 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.040
 stop and I study beating about 10 or 12 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.190
 minutes each time it becomes more 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.950
 thick and its volume increases 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.380
 will be ready when it is no longer liquid 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.200
 when it's rather fluffy and this is 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.840
 basically a chantilly cream 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.930
 shift of the gelatin that I dissolve in a 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.800
 warm water well and stir well 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.800
 I also reserve it 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.550
 and I'm missing the cream cheese that I'm going to 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.490
 remove to the bathroom of Mary stirring 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.920
 well when it's well melted removal 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.530
 from the pot and in that same container I'm going 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.980
 to mix everything first the cream 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.980
 chantilly 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.060
 then the gelatin dissolved in water 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.340
 then the strained extract of the juice of 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.410
 passion fruit and finally sugar 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.550
 and stir everything up until it 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.550
 incorporate perfectly 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.190
 I take out the base of the cookie from the fridge 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.580
 and on it pour the country mix 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.550
 slowly and I return to the fridge by 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.009
 2 hours minimum 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.979
 after two hours I take out the fridge 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:33.080
 in the end even though I had the mold 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.690
 disposable I did not dare to unmold what 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.150
 completely so just the cut in the 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.370
 edges and I left the base by the 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.680
 manipulation I'm left with this form 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.389
 circular not perfect 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.340
 He took the passion fruit from the fridge 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.680
 stirred with the sugar and put it on 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.419
 the country and that's it 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.729
