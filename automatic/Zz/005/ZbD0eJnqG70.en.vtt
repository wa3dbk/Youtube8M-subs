00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:09.769
 quadia truth i am you 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.769
 you are me 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:17.270
 we are us 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.270
 are together 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.120
 what is your buttock 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.120
 my people become limitations 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.790
 what do you think of when you see me 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:54.399
 well out of the well 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:10.580
 are you people but the limit sometimes 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.490
 I take the time to express myself freely 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.479
 the atmosphere that is lost then can be found freely 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.320
 use solved in mind then kun 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.700
 you with me 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.899
 expect from us I am exactly that 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.479
 tap the table of my life 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.310
 sometimes a poem only takes a while 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.940
 but precisely because you cannot cope with times 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.850
 I sometimes do not understand escape 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.330
 that hurts it anyway understand 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.509
 I still have what I committed to 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.560
 because every time again and again 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.830
 more 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.789
 text comes on paper every time 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.179
 not much at all in writing every day 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.179
 because of this 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.340
 some people say i have one 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.400
 have a limitation 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.950
 but what is a limit 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.950
 my life is not your life 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.940
 just on a permanent job 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.290
