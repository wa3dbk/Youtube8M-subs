00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.270 
fact that after night 3 to the knight on
f3<00:01:12.280> is<00:01:12.790> very<00:01:13.570> difficult<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:14.350> protect<00:01:14.980> and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
f3 is very difficult to protect and

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.840 
f3 is very difficult to protect and
that's<00:01:16.240> why<00:01:16.570> he<00:01:17.080> played<00:01:17.350> Bishop<00:01:18.160> takes<00:01:18.670> h3

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
suddenly we realize that after G takes

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.940 
suddenly we realize that after G takes
h3<00:01:24.730> Queen<00:01:25.180> takes<00:01:25.210> a<00:01:25.660> tree<00:01:25.990> there<00:01:26.350> is<00:01:26.470> no<00:01:26.650> peace
