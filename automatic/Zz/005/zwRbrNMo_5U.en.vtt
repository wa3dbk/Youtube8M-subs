their<00:02:46.760> 656<00:02:47.330> paper<00:02:47.570> pad<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.500> designs<00:02:48.890> are<00:02:49.100> the

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
their 656 paper pad the designs are the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.449 
their 656 paper pad the designs are the
same<00:02:49.520> size<00:02:49.940> they<00:02:50.390> are<00:02:50.420> not<00:02:50.690> reduced<00:02:51.230> its<00:02:51.890> but

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
same size they are not reduced its but

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.760 
same size they are not reduced its but
they<00:02:52.550> are<00:02:52.640> double-sided<00:02:53.470> but<00:02:54.470> like<00:02:54.650> for

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
they are double-sided but like for

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.350 
they are double-sided but like for
instance<00:02:54.950> like<00:02:55.280> this<00:02:55.340> one<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:55.820> saw<00:02:56.060> it's

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
instance like this one that you saw it's

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.060 
instance like this one that you saw it's
just<00:02:56.630> each<00:02:56.780> one<00:02:56.959> of<00:02:56.989> those<00:02:57.080> quadrants<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:57.860> cut

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
just each one of those quadrants is cut

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.979 
just each one of those quadrants is cut
into<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.370> different<00:02:58.670> paper<00:03:01.300> rather<00:03:02.300> than<00:03:02.540> being

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
into a different paper rather than being

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.840 
into a different paper rather than being
a<00:03:03.260> reduced<00:03:04.010> size<00:03:04.190> of<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:04.549> hole<00:03:04.700> pattern<00:03:06.850> how'd

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
a reduced size of the hole pattern how'd

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:08.890 
a reduced size of the hole pattern how'd
I<00:03:07.880> do<00:03:08.060> like<00:03:08.180> that<00:03:08.330> they're<00:03:08.450> double-sided

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
I do like that they're double-sided

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.949 
I do like that they're double-sided
that's<00:03:09.170> pretty<00:03:09.350> cool<00:03:09.700> like<00:03:10.700> this<00:03:10.880> report<00:03:11.750> card

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
that's pretty cool like this report card

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.729 
that's pretty cool like this report card
one<00:03:12.549> is<00:03:13.549> a<00:03:13.610> little<00:03:13.880> weird<00:03:14.470> because<00:03:15.470> it's<00:03:15.680> just

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
one is a little weird because it's just

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.270 
one is a little weird because it's just
parts<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.250> pieces<00:03:16.370> of<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:18.040> but<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.130> get<00:03:19.220> the

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
parts and pieces of it but you get the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.330 
parts and pieces of it but you get the
idea<00:03:19.570> then<00:03:20.570> there<00:03:20.750> are<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:21.230> this<00:03:21.530> layered

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
idea then there are is this layered

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.860 
idea then there are is this layered
chipboard<00:03:22.610> which<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:23.090> really<00:03:23.239> cool<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:23.510> it

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
chipboard which is really cool and it

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.180 
chipboard which is really cool and it
has<00:03:24.200> this<00:03:24.350> really<00:03:24.440> cool<00:03:24.590> little<00:03:24.920> felt

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
has this really cool little felt

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.390 
has this really cool little felt
addition<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:25.910> which<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.120> really<00:03:26.269> liked<00:03:26.540> I

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
addition to it which I really liked I

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.880 
addition to it which I really liked I
ended<00:03:28.400> up<00:03:28.489> taking<00:03:28.790> some<00:03:29.180> felt<00:03:29.959> from<00:03:30.530> fancy

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
ended up taking some felt from fancy

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.199 
ended up taking some felt from fancy
pants<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.340> i<00:03:31.370> had<00:03:31.549> laying<00:03:31.730> around<00:03:31.910> in<00:03:32.120> my

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209
