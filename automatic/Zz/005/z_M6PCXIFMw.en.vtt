right now Wi-Fi is turned off without
your<00:03:05.610> help<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.910> can't<00:03:06.120> see<00:03:06.269> any<00:03:06.420> Wi-Fi<00:03:06.720> networks

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
your help I can't see any Wi-Fi networks

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.869 
your help I can't see any Wi-Fi networks
and<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.319> actually<00:03:07.470> says<00:03:07.799> that<00:03:07.950> up<00:03:08.040> here<00:03:08.400> as

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
and it actually says that up here as

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.400 
and it actually says that up here as
well<00:03:09.209> so<00:03:09.299> when<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.480> go<00:03:09.599> back<00:03:09.629> to<00:03:09.840> turn<00:03:10.019> on<00:03:10.200> Wi-Fi

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
well so when I go back to turn on Wi-Fi

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.410 
well so when I go back to turn on Wi-Fi
it'll<00:03:11.340> kick<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:11.579> on<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:11.819> let's<00:03:12.000> say<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.269> know

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
we turn on Wi-Fi and we'll make a test

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.890 
we turn on Wi-Fi and we'll make a test
phone<00:03:14.370> call<00:03:14.579> so<00:03:14.700> it's<00:03:14.790> kicking<00:03:14.970> on<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.780> my

switches over let's say Wi-Fi calls when

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.789 
switches over let's say Wi-Fi calls when
I<00:03:51.150> turn<00:03:51.359> Wi-Fi<00:03:51.569> off<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.650> should

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
I turn Wi-Fi off and it should

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.920 
I turn Wi-Fi off and it should
seamlessly<00:03:53.280> transition<00:03:53.880> over<00:03:54.329> to<00:03:54.780> the

see<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:10.079> call<00:04:10.290> still<00:04:10.560> maintained<00:04:11.040> itself

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
see that call still maintained itself

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.430 
see that call still maintained itself
even<00:04:11.669> though<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.790> transitioned<00:04:12.450> off<00:04:12.599> from<00:04:13.290> the

even though I transitioned off from the
Wi-Fi<00:04:13.829> network<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.310> can<00:04:14.459> probably<00:04:14.639> hear<00:04:14.970> the

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
Wi-Fi network you can probably hear the

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.969 
Wi-Fi network you can probably hear the
echo<00:04:15.359> of<00:04:15.389> me<00:04:15.540> talking<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.109> both<00:04:16.260> microphones

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
echo of me talking and both microphones

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.159 
echo of me talking and both microphones
which<00:04:17.669> is<00:04:17.880> not<00:04:18.150> ideal<00:04:18.570> so<00:04:18.810> go<00:04:19.019> ahead<00:04:19.079> and

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
which is not ideal so go ahead and

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.509 
which is not ideal so go ahead and
disconnect<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.620> call<00:04:19.769> but<00:04:19.919> you<00:04:19.979> get<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.190> idea

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
disconnect the call but you get the idea

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.279 
disconnect the call but you get the idea
