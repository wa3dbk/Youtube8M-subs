00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
kind of smooth then go somewhere else if

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.149 
kind of smooth then go somewhere else if
that<00:00:53.359> kind<00:00:53.600> of<00:00:53.690> smooth<00:00:53.899> and<00:00:54.019> walk<00:00:54.620> around<00:00:54.800> that

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
of metal that are there where the little

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.930 
of metal that are there where the little
eyes<00:01:18.170> used<00:01:18.440> to<00:01:18.560> be<00:01:18.680> for<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:20.110> cable<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:22.820> get

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
eyes used to be for the cable so to get

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:36.160 
eyes used to be for the cable so to get
it<00:01:23.060> smooth

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.460 

I'm<00:01:37.170> using<00:01:37.880> 120-grit<00:01:38.880> at<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> moment<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.380> I'll

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
I'm using 120-grit at the moment so I'll

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.260 
I'm using 120-grit at the moment so I'll
have<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.710> go<00:01:40.860> over<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.220> slightly<00:01:41.940> finer

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
have to go over that a slightly finer

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.310 
have to go over that a slightly finer
grid<00:01:42.660> before<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.020> spread<00:01:44.840> do<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.900> want<00:01:46.080> to<00:01:46.170> get

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
grid before I spread do you want to get

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.090 
grid before I spread do you want to get
it<00:01:46.440> as<00:01:47.030> smooth<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.390> flat<00:01:49.140> or<00:01:49.650> even<00:01:49.680> as

it as smooth and flat or even as
possible<00:01:50.580> you<00:01:51.420> know<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:51.660> more<00:01:52.020> time<00:01:52.050> you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
possible you know the more time you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.260 
possible you know the more time you
spend<00:01:52.410> doing<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.670> better<00:01:53.820> your<00:01:54.000> paint

job<00:01:54.360> will<00:01:54.600> be<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:56.360> doing<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> straight<00:01:57.720> path

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
job will be and doing the straight path

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.530 
job will be and doing the straight path
is<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.680> easy<00:01:58.830> part<00:01:58.950> actually<00:01:59.370> it's<00:01:59.700> fits<00:02:00.390> like

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
is the easy part actually it's fits like

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.950 
is the easy part actually it's fits like
this<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.890> here<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.880> there<00:02:03.060> every

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
this and this and here and there every

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:12.920 
this and this and here and there every
corner<00:02:04.410> basically<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.210> difficult<00:02:11.930> yesterday

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
corner basically is difficult yesterday

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.570 
corner basically is difficult yesterday

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
I put metal primer on all the parts that

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.250 
I put metal primer on all the parts that
didn't<00:02:20.550> have<00:02:20.640> any<00:02:20.790> paint<00:02:21.090> on<00:02:21.270> them<00:02:21.450> so<00:02:22.110> now
