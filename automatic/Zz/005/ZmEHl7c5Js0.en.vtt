00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
in a few ways so let's try and figure

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.599 
in a few ways so let's try and figure
out<00:00:57.600> which<00:00:57.840> one<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.260> truly<00:00:58.590> best<00:00:58.859> first<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.489> all

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
over from there

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.690 
over from there
one<00:02:12.170> interesting<00:02:12.439> area<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.189> ARX

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
one interesting area that the ARX

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.309 
one interesting area that the ARX
actually<00:02:14.120> has<00:02:14.299> the<00:02:14.510> upper<00:02:14.719> hand<00:02:14.750> in<00:02:15.109> is

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
1.56 which is the highest of the assault

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.789 
1.56 which is the highest of the assault

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
1.4 times multiplier so at very close

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.140 
1.4 times multiplier so at very close
range<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.890> fa<00:02:25.159> d<00:02:25.219> will<00:02:25.519> still<00:02:25.760> take<00:02:25.939> three

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
shots even to the head whereas the ARX

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.890 
shots even to the head whereas the ARX
will<00:02:28.069> take<00:02:28.219> two<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:28.730> as<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.299> back<00:02:29.450> up<00:02:29.659> they

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
will take two and as you back up they

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.569 
will take two and as you back up they
will<00:02:30.049> both<00:02:30.230> take<00:02:30.469> one<00:02:30.709> last<00:02:30.889> bullet<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.430> there

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
will both take one last bullet and there

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.699 
will both take one last bullet and there
is<00:02:31.700> one<00:02:31.969> tiny<00:02:32.329> range<00:02:32.689> where<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.079> ARX<00:02:33.500> has

is one tiny range where the ARX has

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.500 
is one tiny range where the ARX has
potential<00:02:34.129> to<00:02:34.159> take<00:02:34.430> only<00:02:34.670> two<00:02:34.939> shots<00:02:35.239> in<00:02:35.420> a

recoil of these weapons actually

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.500

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
surprised me a bit the ARX goes straight

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.030 
surprised me a bit the ARX goes straight
up<00:02:41.569> vertically<00:02:42.019> as<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.349> can<00:02:42.469> see<00:02:42.590> in<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.769> test

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
up vertically as you can see in the test

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.470 
up vertically as you can see in the test

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
and if we look at the wall test you can

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.479 
and if we look at the wall test you can
see<00:02:44.510> even<00:02:44.930> more<00:02:45.079> clearly<00:02:45.349> whereas<00:02:45.919> the<00:02:46.040> fa<00:02:46.310> d

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.250 
see even more clearly whereas the fa d
has<00:02:46.700> more<00:02:46.879> visual<00:02:47.269> recoil<00:02:47.510> than<00:02:47.930> actual

has more visual recoil than actual

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.289 
has more visual recoil than actual
recoil<00:02:48.829> as<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.189> wall<00:02:49.370> tests<00:02:49.700> aren't<00:02:49.849> actually

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
recoil as the wall tests aren't actually

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.449 
recoil as the wall tests aren't actually
too<00:02:50.450> bad<00:02:50.720> now<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.319> AR<00:02:51.680> X<00:02:51.889> actually<00:02:52.129> has<00:02:52.430> a

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
built in laser sight as well so I added

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.349 
built in laser sight as well so I added

the hipfire category for this weapon

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.869 
the hipfire category for this weapon
comparison<00:02:57.079> surprisingly<00:02:57.919> even<00:02:58.370> after<00:02:58.609> a<00:02:58.639> few

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.459 
comparison surprisingly even after a few
tests<00:02:59.180> there<00:02:59.419> wasn't<00:02:59.810> much<00:02:59.930> of<00:02:59.959> a<00:03:00.139> difference

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:00.469 
tests there wasn't much of a difference

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.800 
tests there wasn't much of a difference

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
for the AR X these statistics definitely

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.520 
for the AR X these statistics definitely
show<00:03:28.639> as<00:03:28.849> the<00:03:29.000> F<00:03:29.120> ad<00:03:29.329> is<00:03:29.629> a<00:03:29.750> noticeably<00:03:30.260> better

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
two weapons to unlock I would definitely

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:35.979 
two weapons to unlock I would definitely
go<00:03:34.250> with<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.489> F<00:03:34.609> ad<00:03:34.819> not<00:03:35.299> only<00:03:35.599> is<00:03:35.689> it<00:03:35.750> better

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
go with the F ad not only is it better

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.509 
go with the F ad not only is it better
but<00:03:36.229> you're<00:03:36.319> gonna<00:03:36.439> save<00:03:36.709> for<00:03:36.979> squad<00:03:37.280> points

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519

overall I feel like they wanted people

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:41.080 
overall I feel like they wanted people
to<00:03:39.560> think<00:03:39.680> that<00:03:39.979> the<00:03:40.099> AR<00:03:40.400> X<00:03:40.579> was<00:03:40.790> gonna<00:03:40.909> be<00:03:41.060> a

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
to think that the AR X was gonna be a

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.149 
to think that the AR X was gonna be a
great<00:03:41.359> gun<00:03:41.689> because<00:03:41.989> of<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.169> built-in<00:03:42.620> recoil

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599
