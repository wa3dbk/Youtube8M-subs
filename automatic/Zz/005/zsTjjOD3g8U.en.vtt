00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
a sound they're familiar with better

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.750

then<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.310> go

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.420 

you<00:03:12.989> know<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.200> don't<00:03:13.769> you<00:03:13.920> kind<00:03:14.160> of<00:03:14.220> get<00:03:14.310> it

your<00:03:16.050> head<00:03:16.530> down<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.220> your<00:03:17.280> fingertips<00:03:17.849> it's<00:03:18.090> a

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
your head down to your fingertips it's a

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.940 
your head down to your fingertips it's a
lot<00:03:18.420> easier<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:18.780> switch<00:03:19.080> but<00:03:19.379> at<00:03:19.470> first<00:03:19.739> it's

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
lot easier to switch but at first it's

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.290
