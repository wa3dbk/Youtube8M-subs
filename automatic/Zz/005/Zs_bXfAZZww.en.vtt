 strike with 2 x 0 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.280
 left for should be here in our 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.680
 second place in our second position is a 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.199
 chip-based game that can be 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.060
 played in multiplayer online that put 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.099
 to fight the infected 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.570
 who are people turned into 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.699
 killing machines by a mysterious 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.500
 videos with four members 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.139
 the team needs to work together to 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.039
 escape the city taken by 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.330
 infected and recently the guy 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:09.620
 individuality is because you know how it is 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.639
 survivor atmosphere is quite expressive 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.169
 setting in a contemporary version 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.690
 from United States 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.669
 varying between urban and rural 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.680
 of each campaign, it is necessary to wait in 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:23.410
 by a rescue vehicle 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.970
 It's the coolest moment in the game because 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.000
 everything that would make the guy 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.039
 the game that limit on fear issue 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.020
 explain the step - and more means there before 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.610
 to move to the next stage because 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.590
 this rubbish 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.770
 either one or two will most likely 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.930
 to run in pretty psychic but despite 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.120
 A lot of people have already played here. 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.610
 my recommendation to astronauts who 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.970
 should be opting for land that does not 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:51.310
 played this masterpiece of the games climb and 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.759
 in the first place we have a 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:58.150
 Great game of the super avoidable franchise in the 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:06:01.240

 police police Anamara highlight 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.389
 but I do not know what is the thing that 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.289
 you can feel the taste of being 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.240
 in a war 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:19.210
 choose the army and enter the fight with 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.690

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.039
 advanced vehicles 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.800
 counting with multiplayer of up to 64 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:38.289
 players whose own I still do not have 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.310
 sure you are on a map to follow 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.810
 mentions 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.599
 according to the number of players 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:46.900
 in the start-up of a 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:49.240
 patents is a mere film with certainty 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.460
