00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
actually do fail to acknowledge and if

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.300 
actually do fail to acknowledge and if
you're<00:01:33.869> riding<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.350> 2k<00:01:34.740> train<00:01:35.040> people

actually fail to acknowledge that we've

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.510 
actually fail to acknowledge that we've
mostly<00:01:37.890> received<00:01:38.960> cosmetic<00:01:40.280> improvements<00:01:41.280> by

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
mostly received cosmetic improvements by

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.160 
mostly received cosmetic improvements by
2k<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.290> minor<00:01:43.290> tweaks<00:01:43.799> which<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.880> well<00:01:45.720> may

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
2k and minor tweaks which can well may

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.039 
2k and minor tweaks which can well may
still<00:01:46.590> improve<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.250> game<00:01:47.479> experience<00:01:48.479> but

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
still improve the game experience but

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.050 
still improve the game experience but
can<00:01:49.200> also<00:01:49.290> be<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.220> next<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.549> exploit

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
can also be in in the next and exploit

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.420 
can also be in in the next and exploit
so<00:01:51.840> at<00:01:52.079> one<00:01:52.259> point<00:01:52.439> they<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.770> fix<00:01:53.009> maybe<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
so at one point they can fix maybe the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.219 
so at one point they can fix maybe the
center's<00:01:53.790> but<00:01:54.270> then<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.630> end<00:01:54.780> up<00:01:54.899> being<00:01:55.110> an

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
center's but then I can end up being an

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.469 
center's but then I can end up being an
exploit<00:01:55.619> where<00:01:55.920> they<00:01:56.100> try<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.460> abuse<00:01:57.030> certain

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
exploit where they try to abuse certain

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.580 
exploit where they try to abuse certain
things<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.899> game<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.320> doesn't<00:01:58.530> really

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
things in the game so it doesn't really

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.700 
things in the game so it doesn't really
matter<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.250> mean<00:02:00.000> that's<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.020> problem<00:02:01.320> here

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
matter I mean that's the problem here

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.069 
matter I mean that's the problem here
now<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.640> reason<00:02:03.030> why<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.360> feel<00:02:03.810> like

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
now this is the reason why I feel like

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.749 
now this is the reason why I feel like
 in<00:02:04.740> real<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.610> reason

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
 in real this is the reason

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.600 
 in real this is the reason
why<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:05.939> feel<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.960> people<00:02:07.200> do<00:02:07.799> not<00:02:08.069> want<00:02:08.520> to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
why I feel that people do not want to

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.249 
why I feel that people do not want to
give<00:02:08.879> NBA<00:02:09.209> live<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> chance<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.959> let<00:02:10.110> me<00:02:10.229> just

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
give NBA live a chance and let me just

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.780 
give NBA live a chance and let me just
say<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.500> again<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.920> not<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> video<00:02:11.340> trying

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
say this again it's not a video trying

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.370 
say this again it's not a video trying
to<00:02:11.879> shed<00:02:12.450> some<00:02:12.480> light<00:02:12.810> on<00:02:12.930> 2k

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
to shed some light on 2k

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.750 
to shed some light on 2k
on<00:02:13.440> me<00:02:13.710> alive<00:02:13.950> I'm<00:02:14.100> just<00:02:14.280> trying<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.550> really

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
on me alive I'm just trying to really

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.000 
on me alive I'm just trying to really
open<00:02:14.940> up<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.390> lot<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.660> people's<00:02:15.900> minds<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.350> have

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
open up a lot of people's minds and have

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.920 
open up a lot of people's minds and have
them<00:02:17.160> open<00:02:17.340> their<00:02:17.490> eyes<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.730> see<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.510> lot

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
them open their eyes to see that a lot

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.760 
them open their eyes to see that a lot
of<00:02:19.320> people<00:02:19.500> actually<00:02:20.540> don't<00:02:21.540> think<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:22.230> be

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
of people actually don't think to be

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.500 
of people actually don't think to be
alive<00:02:23.040> ain't<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.120> than<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.390> because

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
alive ain't this than that because

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.690 
alive ain't this than that because
of<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.780> graphics<00:02:25.380> but<00:02:26.190> let<00:02:26.310> me<00:02:26.340> just<00:02:26.430> tell<00:02:26.580> you

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
of the graphics but let me just tell you

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.370 
of the graphics but let me just tell you
that<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.300> graphics<00:02:27.840> don't<00:02:28.050> determine

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
that the graphics don't determine

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.920 
that the graphics don't determine
whether<00:02:28.800> or<00:02:28.890> not<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.460> game<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.210> simulation

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
whether or not a game is simulation

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.470 
whether or not a game is simulation
people<00:02:31.920> thought<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.490> people<00:02:32.880> think<00:02:33.210> that

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
people thought and people think that

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.600 
people thought and people think that
because<00:02:33.630> 2k<00:02:34.380> is<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:34.830> accurate<00:02:35.100> with<00:02:35.430> their

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
because 2k is so accurate with their

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.210 
because 2k is so accurate with their
visuals<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.750> players<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.380> it's

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
visuals and the players that it's

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.140 
visuals and the players that it's
simulative<00:02:39.060> know<00:02:39.470> just<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.590> yo<00:02:41.310> there's<00:02:41.880> been

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
simulative know just be yo there's been

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.750 
simulative know just be yo there's been
plenty<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.720> games<00:02:42.990> Sims<00:02:43.740> they<00:02:44.520> don't<00:02:44.700> look

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
plenty of games Sims they don't look

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.670 
plenty of games Sims they don't look
like<00:02:44.820> identical<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.600> real<00:02:45.780> humans<00:02:46.230> but<00:02:46.500> that's

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
like identical to real humans but that's

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.890 
like identical to real humans but that's
a<00:02:46.770> simulation<00:02:47.400> game<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:48.240> that'll<00:02:48.510> make<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:48.780> any

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
a simulation game so that'll make it any

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.560 
a simulation game so that'll make it any

let<00:03:09.810> me<00:03:09.840> tell<00:03:10.050> you<00:03:10.140> something<00:03:10.440> you've<00:03:10.860> seen

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
let me tell you something you've seen

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.090 
let me tell you something you've seen
videos<00:03:11.640> you've<00:03:12.120> seen<00:03:12.330> chases<00:03:12.780> videos<00:03:13.140> when

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
videos you've seen chases videos when

videos you've seen chases videos when
you<00:03:14.220> see<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.670> point<00:03:14.880> guard<00:03:15.210> is<00:03:15.330> getting

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
you see that the point guard is getting

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.480 
you see that the point guard is getting
the<00:03:15.750> rebounds<00:03:16.350> over<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.890> center's<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.460> the

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
the rebounds over the center's and the

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.160 
the rebounds over the center's and the
center's<00:03:17.820> look<00:03:17.910> like<00:03:18.030> dummies<00:03:18.450> come<00:03:18.660> on<00:03:18.900> man

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
center's look like dummies come on man

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.730 
center's look like dummies come on man
that's<00:03:19.920> not<00:03:20.280> simulation<00:03:21.030> that's<00:03:21.630> unreal<00:03:22.200> also

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
that's not simulation that's unreal also

that's not simulation that's unreal also
I've<00:03:22.950> done<00:03:23.160> this<00:03:23.280> plenty<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.610> times<00:03:23.700> where<00:03:24.060> I'm

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:15.530 
was definitely an improvement but they

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.790 
was definitely an improvement but they
