too hot and when Wade and there was a
few<00:01:45.560> that<00:01:45.680> I<00:01:45.770> definitely<00:01:46.310> lifted<00:01:46.610> off<00:01:46.730> fast<00:01:47.000> to

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
few that I definitely lifted off fast to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.090 
few that I definitely lifted off fast to
the<00:01:47.210> early<00:01:47.450> but<00:01:48.050> you<00:01:48.080> know<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.470> first<00:01:48.680> run<00:01:48.890> I

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
the early but you know the first run I

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.860 
the early but you know the first run I
think<00:01:49.160> is<00:01:49.400> an<00:01:49.490> 8<00:01:49.610> ft<00:01:49.760> 4<00:01:50.120> um<00:01:50.270> I'm<00:01:50.510> quite<00:01:50.780> happy

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
think is an 8 ft 4 um I'm quite happy

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.280 
think is an 8 ft 4 um I'm quite happy
with<00:01:51.110> that

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
with that

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.810 
with that
I<00:01:51.440> thought<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.800> road<00:01:51.950> looked<00:01:52.160> a<00:01:52.250> bit<00:01:52.280> faster

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
I thought the road looked a bit faster

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.820 
I thought the road looked a bit faster
in<00:01:52.880> previous<00:01:53.300> years<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:53.870> I<00:01:54.200> would<00:01:54.380> seem<00:01:54.740> to

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
in previous years and I would seem to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.320 
in previous years and I would seem to
think<00:01:55.010> that<00:01:55.190> that's<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.670> fastest<00:01:56.060> I've<00:01:56.150> gone

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
think that that's the fastest I've gone

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330 
think that that's the fastest I've gone
up<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.690> year<00:01:56.840> at<00:01:56.990> for<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.260> first<00:01:57.440> run<00:01:57.770> so<00:01:58.160> what

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
up the year at for the first run so what

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.250 
up the year at for the first run so what
we'll<00:01:58.490> get<00:01:58.640> down<00:01:58.820> to<00:01:59.060> who<00:01:59.240> knows<00:01:59.420> but<00:01:59.750> I<00:01:59.810> mean<00:02:00.230> I

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
we'll get down to who knows but I mean I

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.510 
we'll get down to who knows but I mean I
would<00:02:00.470> tend<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.740> think<00:02:00.830> that<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.190> 8<00:02:01.310> minute

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
would tend to think that the 8 minute

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.610 
would tend to think that the 8 minute

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
game to where we thought we would be I

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.890 
game to where we thought we would be I
think<00:02:57.430> it's<00:02:57.880> a<00:02:58.090> hell<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.690> lot<00:02:58.810> of

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
think it's a hell of a lot of

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.330 
think it's a hell of a lot of
concentration<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.709> speed<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.010> come<00:03:00.160> up<00:03:00.250> the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
concentration the speed you come up the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.690 
concentration the speed you come up the
hell<00:03:00.489> us<00:03:00.670> it's<00:03:01.090> seriously<00:03:01.900> impressive<00:03:02.470> so

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
hell us it's seriously impressive so

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:23.990 
hell us it's seriously impressive so
great<00:03:03.700> fun<00:03:03.940> enjoying<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:04.840> their<00:03:05.170> witch

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.490 

there<00:03:24.600> was<00:03:24.690> some<00:03:24.810> spots<00:03:25.050> here<00:03:25.260> where<00:03:25.290> we

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
there was some spots here where we

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.720 
there was some spots here where we
certainly<00:03:25.830> picked<00:03:26.010> up<00:03:26.130> some<00:03:26.280> time<00:03:26.460> there<00:03:26.640> was

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
certainly picked up some time there was

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.010 
certainly picked up some time there was
a<00:03:26.760> couple<00:03:26.940> of<00:03:27.060> corners<00:03:27.240> I<00:03:27.390> probably<00:03:27.660> didn't

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
a couple of corners I probably didn't

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.230 
a couple of corners I probably didn't
get<00:03:28.110> as<00:03:28.230> neat<00:03:28.440> as<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.770> first<00:03:28.950> run<00:03:29.190> so<00:03:29.490> look<00:03:30.210> to

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
get as neat as the first run so look to

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.520 
get as neat as the first run so look to
be<00:03:30.420> honest<00:03:30.630> when<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:30.810> got<00:03:30.960> to<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.110> top<00:03:31.140> on<00:03:31.410> that

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
be honest when I got to the top on that

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.960 
be honest when I got to the top on that
run<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.710> thought<00:03:32.010> I'd<00:03:32.220> be<00:03:32.340> comfortable<00:03:32.550> with<00:03:32.880> a

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
run I thought I'd be comfortable with a

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.340 
run I thought I'd be comfortable with a
sort<00:03:33.180> of<00:03:33.210> an<00:03:33.330> eight<00:03:33.420> forty<00:03:33.900> out<00:03:34.020> of<00:03:34.230> eight

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350

twenty nine earlier but to come away and

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.950 
twenty nine earlier but to come away and
find<00:03:35.970> out<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.150> was<00:03:36.300> three<00:03:36.450> seconds<00:03:36.750> picker

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960
