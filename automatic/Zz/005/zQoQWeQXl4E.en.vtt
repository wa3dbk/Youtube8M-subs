redstone world here I'm gonna take a

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.990 
redstone world here I'm gonna take a
look<00:00:09.150> at<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.950> proper<00:00:10.950> showcase<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.550> guess<00:00:11.730> if<00:00:11.880> my

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
look at a proper showcase I guess if my

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.770 
look at a proper showcase I guess if my
new<00:00:12.500> wrong<00:00:13.500> button<00:00:13.920> creation<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.599> a

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
new wrong button creation and that is a

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.279 
new wrong button creation and that is a
working<00:00:16.170> Star<00:00:16.770> Trek<00:00:17.039> transporter<00:00:18.140> now<00:00:19.140> this

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
working Star Trek transporter now this

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.900 
working Star Trek transporter now this
has<00:00:19.410> been<00:00:19.590> done<00:00:19.770> before<00:00:20.130> but<00:00:20.279> I've<00:00:20.430> never<00:00:20.460> seen

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
has been done before but I've never seen

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.320 
has been done before but I've never seen
any<00:00:21.470> proper<00:00:22.470> overview<00:00:23.039> as<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.820> how<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.180> works

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
any proper overview as to how it works

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.599 
any proper overview as to how it works
that<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.660> video<00:00:24.990> based<00:00:25.320> and/or<00:00:25.920> picture<00:00:26.369> based

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
that is video based and/or picture based

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.179 
that is video based and/or picture based
other<00:00:27.019> like<00:00:28.019> I've<00:00:28.170> seen<00:00:28.320> brief<00:00:28.650> text-based

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
other like I've seen brief text-based

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.330 
other like I've seen brief text-based
walkthroughs<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.170> or<00:00:31.230> explanations<00:00:32.099> but<00:00:32.219> I'm

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
walkthroughs but or explanations but I'm

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.560 
walkthroughs but or explanations but I'm
gonna<00:00:32.460> try<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.820> go<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> little<00:00:33.210> bit<00:00:33.420> more

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
gonna try to go a little bit more

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.810 
gonna try to go a little bit more
in-depth<00:00:34.230> without<00:00:34.649> making<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.460> video<00:00:35.730> too

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
in-depth without making this video too

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.660 
in-depth without making this video too
long<00:00:36.620> so<00:00:37.620> first<00:00:37.890> off<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.190> guess<00:00:38.340> we'll<00:00:38.460> step

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
long so first off I guess we'll step

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.030 
long so first off I guess we'll step
into<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> room<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:40.170> didn't<00:00:40.379> really<00:00:40.649> go<00:00:40.800> for

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
into the room and I didn't really go for

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.680 
into the room and I didn't really go for
style<00:00:41.340> here<00:00:41.700> other<00:00:42.210> than<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.719> circle<00:00:43.469> and

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
style here other than the circle and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.020 
style here other than the circle and
this<00:00:45.690> design<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.379> sort<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.739> based<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.670> reddit

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
this design is sort of based on a reddit

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.410 
this design is sort of based on a reddit
post<00:00:48.059> if<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.930> find<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.620> original<00:00:49.739> link<00:00:50.420> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
post if I can find the original link the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.660 
post if I can find the original link the
poster<00:00:52.140> also<00:00:52.500> said<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.980> was<00:00:53.160> fully<00:00:53.430> functional

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
poster also said it was fully functional

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.250 
poster also said it was fully functional
but<00:00:54.059> again<00:00:54.860> no<00:00:55.860> details<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.699> uh<00:00:57.079> yeah<00:00:58.079> so

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
but again no details so uh yeah so

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.080 
but again no details so uh yeah so
that's<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> style<00:00:58.739> with<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.340> ring<00:00:59.550> here<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
that's the style with the ring here and

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.209 
that's the style with the ring here and
the<00:01:00.270> clear<00:01:00.539> blocks<00:01:00.870> obviously<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> beacon

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the clear blocks obviously the beacon

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.109 
the clear blocks obviously the beacon
needs<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.670> see<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.460> sea<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> sky<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
needs to see the sea the sky I have to

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.750 
needs to see the sea the sky I have to
have<00:01:06.240> skylight<00:01:06.689> level<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.110> put<00:01:07.500> oh<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:08.460> tell

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
have skylight level so I put oh I tell

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.219 
have skylight level so I put oh I tell
imported<00:01:09.060> myself<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:10.880> yeah<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.420> anyway<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
imported myself there yeah so anyway the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.550 
imported myself there yeah so anyway the
beacon<00:01:13.560> needs<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.920> see<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.189> guy<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:15.119> I've<00:01:16.080> put

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
beacon needs to see this guy so I've put

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.550 
beacon needs to see this guy so I've put
Pistons<00:01:17.340> up<00:01:17.490> here<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.380> Pistons<00:01:19.380> are

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
Pistons up here and Pistons are

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.620 
Pistons up here and Pistons are
transparent<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.759> allows<00:01:21.119> everything<00:01:21.509> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
transparent so that allows everything to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.649 
transparent so that allows everything to
see<00:01:22.340> this<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.520> our<00:01:23.640> selector<00:01:24.150> here<00:01:24.420> so

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
see this is our selector here so

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.039 
see this is our selector here so
obviously<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.229> had<00:01:25.320> one<00:01:25.619> selected<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.430> that

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
obviously I had one selected and that

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.960 
obviously I had one selected and that
teleported<00:01:28.049> me<00:01:28.200> through<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.890> machine<00:01:29.460> you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
teleported me through the machine you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.740 
teleported me through the machine you
can<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.270> select<00:01:30.540> five<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:33.450> soon<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
can just select five and as soon as the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.050 
can just select five and as soon as the
beacon<00:01:34.020> switches<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.220> step<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.820> and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
beacon switches we can step on in and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.370 
beacon switches we can step on in and
that<00:01:36.990> will<00:01:37.079> teleport<00:01:37.350> us<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> new<00:01:37.979> position

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
that will teleport us to a new position

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.310 
that will teleport us to a new position
how<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.530> works<00:01:40.939> is<00:01:41.939> when<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> beacon<00:01:43.200> is

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
how this works is when the beacon is

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.710 
how this works is when the beacon is
activated<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.070> will<00:01:45.030> start<00:01:45.180> over<00:01:45.270> here<00:01:45.540> first

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
activated I will start over here first

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.800 
activated I will start over here first
when<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> beacon<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.350> activated<00:01:46.920> a

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
when the beacon is activated a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.740 
when the beacon is activated a
corresponding<00:01:50.149> torch<00:01:51.149> here<00:01:51.540> will<00:01:51.659> be

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
corresponding torch here will be

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.240 
corresponding torch here will be
deactivated<00:01:52.439> based<00:01:52.619> on<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.860> piston

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
deactivated based on this piston

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.550 
deactivated based on this piston
selector<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.630> will<00:01:54.780> deactivate<00:01:54.960> this

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
selector so this will deactivate this

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.100 
selector so this will deactivate this
torch<00:01:55.920> where<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> rest<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.149> these<00:01:57.210> are<00:01:57.270> active

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
torch where the rest of these are active

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.380 
torch where the rest of these are active
and<00:01:58.340> this<00:01:59.340> will<00:01:59.490> come<00:01:59.640> along<00:01:59.820> here<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.270> this

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
and this will come along here to this

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.660 
and this will come along here to this
command<00:02:00.689> block<00:02:02.149> when<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.689> user<00:02:04.579> departed<00:02:05.579> me

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
command block when the user departed me

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.809 
command block when the user departed me
when<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.880> user<00:02:06.060> steps<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:07.819> teleportation

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
when the user steps on the teleportation

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.430 
when the user steps on the teleportation
pad<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.060> guess<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.539> teleports<00:02:09.869> them<00:02:10.050> over<00:02:10.319> to

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
pad I guess it teleports them over to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.990 
pad I guess it teleports them over to
here<00:02:11.150> this<00:02:12.150> pad

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
here this pad

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.340 
here this pad
is<00:02:13.090> wired<00:02:13.690> up<00:02:13.900> close<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.410> these<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:17.260> know

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
is wired up close to these you know

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.180 
is wired up close to these you know
pardon<00:02:17.830> me

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
pardon me

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.220 
pardon me
when<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:18.760> when<00:02:19.510> these<00:02:19.600> pressure<00:02:19.840> pads<00:02:20.110> are

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
when that when these pressure pads are

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.600 
when that when these pressure pads are
powered<00:02:20.530> this<00:02:20.740> will<00:02:20.890> power<00:02:21.100> this<00:02:21.310> line<00:02:21.490> of

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
powered this will power this line of

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.490 
powered this will power this line of
redstone<00:02:21.880> deactivating<00:02:22.630> all<00:02:22.810> these<00:02:23.050> torches

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
redstone deactivating all these torches

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.850 
redstone deactivating all these torches
but<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:24.520> acts<00:02:24.700> like<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.910> NAND<00:02:25.120> gate<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:26.410> only

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
but this acts like a NAND gate so only

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.160 
but this acts like a NAND gate so only
this<00:02:27.250> torch<00:02:27.520> will<00:02:27.670> become<00:02:27.880> active<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.420> then

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
this torch will become active and then

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.640 
this torch will become active and then
this<00:02:29.410> will<00:02:30.370> then<00:02:30.550> teleport<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.990> user<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.500> the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
this will then teleport the user to the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.960 
this will then teleport the user to the
appropriate<00:02:33.100> spot<00:02:34.020> oh<00:02:35.610> yeah

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
appropriate spot oh yeah

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.920 
appropriate spot oh yeah
also<00:02:37.620> when<00:02:38.620> this<00:02:38.860> torch<00:02:39.130> is<00:02:39.370> active<00:02:40.060> this<00:02:40.750> will

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
also when this torch is active this will

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.830 
also when this torch is active this will
send<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.170> power<00:02:41.350> down<00:02:41.590> this<00:02:41.830> line<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:43.180> both<00:02:43.510> the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
send a power down this line to both the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.770 
send a power down this line to both the
piston<00:02:44.290> activating<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.160> beacon<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:45.780> another

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
piston activating the beacon and another

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.690 
piston activating the beacon and another
and<00:02:47.050> gate<00:02:47.910> which<00:02:48.910> powers<00:02:49.330> this<00:02:49.540> command<00:02:49.870> block

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
and gate which powers this command block

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.949 
and gate which powers this command block
which<00:02:51.700> will<00:02:51.880> activate<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.390> command<00:02:52.750> block

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
which will activate that command block

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.010 
which will activate that command block
rather<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:54.030> when<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.180> user<00:02:55.360> stands<00:02:55.690> above

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.280 
view but anyway - sniffing it's with
zero<00:03:03.459> health<00:03:03.760> villagers<00:03:04.630> with<00:03:04.780> zero<00:03:04.959> health

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
zero health villagers with zero health

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.900 
zero health villagers with zero health
will<00:03:05.680> start<00:03:05.890> spawning<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.400> all<00:03:06.520> these<00:03:06.670> paths

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
will start spawning and all these paths

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.620 
will start spawning and all these paths
all<00:03:07.180> these<00:03:07.390> pods<00:03:07.630> here<00:03:07.959> and<00:03:08.880> yeah<00:03:09.880> so<00:03:10.540> that's

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
all these pods here and yeah so that's

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.199 
all these pods here and yeah so that's
how<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:12.100> works<00:03:12.280> just<00:03:12.430> rapid<00:03:12.910> spawning

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
how that works just rapid spawning

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.910 
how that works just rapid spawning
villagers<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.050> course<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.739> can<00:03:14.860> only

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
villagers and of course you can only

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.880 
villagers and of course you can only
have<00:03:15.100> one<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.310> these<00:03:15.370> active<00:03:15.700> at<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.850> time<00:03:16.890> it

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
have one of these active at a time it

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.699 
have one of these active at a time it
would<00:03:18.100> have<00:03:18.190> been<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:19.049> potentially<00:03:20.049> could<00:03:20.350> have

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
would have been I potentially could have

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.150 
would have been I potentially could have
done<00:03:20.920> this<00:03:21.100> with<00:03:21.910> one<00:03:22.450> command<00:03:22.900> block<00:03:23.160> however

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
done this with one command block however

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.190 
done this with one command block however
I<00:03:24.250> wanted<00:03:24.549> to<00:03:24.670> avoid<00:03:24.790> with<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.750> whole<00:03:25.930> bunch<00:03:26.110> of

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
I wanted to avoid with a whole bunch of

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.620 
I wanted to avoid with a whole bunch of
players<00:03:26.440> in<00:03:26.650> here<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.890> wrong<00:03:27.040> player<00:03:27.630> getting

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
players in here the wrong player getting

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.280 
players in here the wrong player getting
teleported<00:03:29.350> as<00:03:29.530> best<00:03:30.400> as<00:03:30.549> I<00:03:30.640> could<00:03:30.880> because<00:03:31.840> if

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
teleported as best as I could because if

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.080 
teleported as best as I could because if
you<00:03:32.410> had<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.560> player<00:03:32.799> in<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.340> transporter<00:03:33.970> and

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
you had a player in the transporter and

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.460 
you had a player in the transporter and
a<00:03:34.660> player<00:03:34.870> over<00:03:35.080> here<00:03:35.620> at<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.760> same<00:03:36.970> time<00:03:37.470> this

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
a player over here at the same time this

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.740 
a player over here at the same time this
player<00:03:38.860> would<00:03:39.250> be<00:03:39.280> closer<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.450> command

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
player would be closer to the command

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.810 
player would be closer to the command
blocks<00:03:41.130> so<00:03:42.130> by<00:03:42.400> using<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.760> @p<00:03:43.530> I<00:03:44.670> could<00:03:45.670> have

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
blocks so by using the @p I could have

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.870 
blocks so by using the @p I could have
done<00:03:46.230> player<00:03:47.230> centered<00:03:47.980> around<00:03:48.100> here<00:03:48.579> with

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
done player centered around here with

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.850 
done player centered around here with
about<00:03:49.120> what<00:03:49.390> a<00:03:49.420> two<00:03:50.140> block<00:03:50.410> three<00:03:50.680> block

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
about what a two block three block

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.520 
about what a two block three block
radius<00:03:51.480> like<00:03:52.480> that<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:52.900> I'm<00:03:52.959> flying<00:03:53.260> so<00:03:53.440> it

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
radius like that and I'm flying so it

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.800 
radius like that and I'm flying so it
didn't<00:03:53.709> activate<00:03:54.120> but<00:03:55.120> you<00:03:55.390> know<00:03:55.480> this<00:03:55.660> is<00:03:55.750> how

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
didn't activate but you know this is how

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.979 
didn't activate but you know this is how
I<00:03:55.870> chose<00:03:56.079> to<00:03:56.260> do<00:03:56.380> it<00:03:56.410> it's<00:03:56.799> not<00:03:57.010> perfect<00:03:57.989> yet

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
I chose to do it it's not perfect yet

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.440 
I chose to do it it's not perfect yet
there's<00:03:59.650> some<00:03:59.890> delay<00:04:00.160> in<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.400> spawns<00:04:00.700> and<00:04:01.180> I

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
there's some delay in the spawns and I

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.170 
there's some delay in the spawns and I
think<00:04:02.190> like<00:04:03.190> one<00:04:03.430> or<00:04:03.549> two<00:04:03.579> of<00:04:03.790> these<00:04:03.880> doesn't

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
think like one or two of these doesn't

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.650 
think like one or two of these doesn't
work<00:04:04.299> and<00:04:04.420> I'm<00:04:04.510> not<00:04:04.630> sure<00:04:04.780> why<00:04:05.519> but<00:04:06.519> yeah<00:04:07.450> and

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
work and I'm not sure why but yeah and

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.490 
work and I'm not sure why but yeah and
obviously<00:04:09.269> yeah<00:04:10.269> there's<00:04:10.510> some<00:04:10.810> delay<00:04:11.049> here

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
obviously yeah there's some delay here

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.479 
obviously yeah there's some delay here
usually<00:04:12.489> it'll<00:04:13.030> work<00:04:13.680> but<00:04:14.680> yeah<00:04:14.920> it's<00:04:15.340> not

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
usually it'll work but yeah it's not

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.960 
usually it'll work but yeah it's not
perfect<00:04:15.850> it<00:04:16.419> is<00:04:16.540> working<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.140> I<00:04:17.350> aim<00:04:17.530> to

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
perfect it is working and I aim to

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.159 
perfect it is working and I aim to
obviously<00:04:18.970> clean<00:04:19.209> it<00:04:19.329> up<00:04:19.450> this<00:04:19.630> is<00:04:19.810> not<00:04:19.959> my

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
obviously clean it up this is not my

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.880 
obviously clean it up this is not my
best<00:04:20.729> wiring<00:04:21.729> something<00:04:22.030> I<00:04:22.120> threw<00:04:22.240> together

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
best wiring something I threw together

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.770 
best wiring something I threw together
but<00:04:23.890> hopefully<00:04:24.370> that<00:04:24.490> is<00:04:24.640> giving<00:04:25.539> you<00:04:25.599> some

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
but hopefully that is giving you some

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.730 
but hopefully that is giving you some
sort<00:04:25.960> of<00:04:26.050> insight<00:04:26.349> as<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:26.530> how

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
sort of insight as to how

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.779 
sort of insight as to how
these<00:04:26.889> things<00:04:27.099> work<00:04:27.569> oh<00:04:28.569> yeah<00:04:29.349> I<00:04:29.789> mentioned

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
these things work oh yeah I mentioned

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:31.830 
these things work oh yeah I mentioned
the<00:04:30.849> two<00:04:30.880> stiff<00:04:31.150> Achatz<00:04:31.360> spawning<00:04:31.599> there's

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
the two stiff Achatz spawning there's

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.330 
the two stiff Achatz spawning there's
just<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.050> whole<00:04:32.169> bunch<00:04:32.289> of<00:04:32.440> spawners<00:04:32.710> down<00:04:33.039> here

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
just a whole bunch of spawners down here

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.640 
just a whole bunch of spawners down here
with<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.449> think<00:04:34.539> these<00:04:34.660> are<00:04:34.780> four<00:04:35.080> blocks<00:04:35.289> below

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
with I think these are four blocks below

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.159 
with I think these are four blocks below
or<00:04:36.039> five<00:04:36.280> blocks<00:04:36.520> below<00:04:36.849> the<00:04:37.330> teleportation

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
or five blocks below the teleportation

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.800 
or five blocks below the teleportation
pad<00:04:38.440> so<00:04:38.650> they've<00:04:38.770> got<00:04:38.889> a<00:04:38.919> six<00:04:39.220> block<00:04:39.370> radius<00:04:39.810> to

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
pad so they've got a six block radius to

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.680 
pad so they've got a six block radius to
let<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:41.530> test<00:04:41.740> difficut<00:04:42.069> spawn<00:04:42.360> but<00:04:43.360> anyway

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
let the test difficut spawn but anyway

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.089 
let the test difficut spawn but anyway
hopefully<00:04:44.020> that<00:04:44.199> has<00:04:44.380> given<00:04:44.620> you<00:04:44.710> some<00:04:44.919> kind

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
hopefully that has given you some kind

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.360 
hopefully that has given you some kind
of<00:04:45.220> insight<00:04:45.580> as<00:04:46.020> to<00:04:47.020> how<00:04:47.169> this<00:04:47.380> works<00:04:47.440> and<00:04:47.979> you

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
of insight as to how this works and you

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.890 
of insight as to how this works and you
can<00:04:48.400> potentially<00:04:49.300> build<00:04:49.479> something<00:04:49.780> for

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
can potentially build something for

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.270 
can potentially build something for
yourself<00:04:50.199> this<00:04:50.380> isn't<00:04:50.560> a<00:04:50.680> finished<00:04:50.979> product

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
yourself this isn't a finished product

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.430 
yourself this isn't a finished product
so<00:04:52.150> I<00:04:52.180> won't<00:04:52.419> be<00:04:52.539> posting<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:52.990> world<00:04:53.199> download

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
so I won't be posting a world download

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.550 
so I won't be posting a world download
for<00:04:53.949> it<00:04:54.069> but<00:04:55.060> uh<00:04:55.090> other<00:04:55.780> Matt<00:04:56.080> if<00:04:56.259> you<00:04:56.349> made<00:04:56.470> it
