the national style in general I mean I

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.940 
the national style in general I mean I
do<00:01:48.000> enjoy<00:01:48.270> albums<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.229> boxer<00:01:49.710> but

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
do enjoy albums like the boxer but

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.569 
do enjoy albums like the boxer but
honestly<00:01:50.850> since<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.899> record<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.590> don't<00:01:53.100> see

what<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.180> band<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.509> doing<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.409> that

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
what the band is doing that is is that

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.620 
what the band is doing that is is that
captivating<00:01:56.490> obviously<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> didn't<00:01:57.390> really

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
captivating obviously I didn't really

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.810 
captivating obviously I didn't really
care<00:01:57.810> for<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> new<00:01:58.110> Kanye<00:01:58.439> album<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.610> much

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.940 
care for the new Kanye album that much
there<00:02:00.030> were<00:02:00.149> strong<00:02:00.570> reactions<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.710> but

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
there were strong reactions to that but

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.289 
there were strong reactions to that but
I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.310> there<00:02:02.520> may<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:02.909> been<00:02:03.090> even

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
I think there may have been even

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.350 
I think there may have been even
stronger<00:02:03.630> reactions<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:05.040> my<00:02:05.579> feelings<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
stronger reactions to my feelings on the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.300 
stronger reactions to my feelings on the
new<00:02:06.479> Jay<00:02:06.689> Cole<00:02:06.990> LP<00:02:07.439> especially<00:02:07.920> since<00:02:08.129> that

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
new Jay Cole LP especially since that

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.529 
new Jay Cole LP especially since that
was<00:02:08.539> traditionally<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> lot<00:02:09.629> more<00:02:09.899> agree

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
was traditionally a lot more agree

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.540 
was traditionally a lot more agree
for<00:02:10.959> sure<00:02:11.080> my<00:02:11.230> ghost<00:02:11.530> album<00:02:11.980> review<00:02:12.310> caught

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
for sure my ghost album review caught

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.460 
for sure my ghost album review caught
some<00:02:12.819> negative<00:02:13.209> reactions<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.930> really<00:02:14.230> think

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
some negative reactions I really think

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.789 
some negative reactions I really think
the<00:02:14.620> band<00:02:15.090> missed<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.569> mark<00:02:16.840> on<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.230> record

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
the band missed the mark on that record

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.309 
the band missed the mark on that record
by<00:02:18.190> bringing<00:02:18.610> in<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:18.879> bigger<00:02:19.090> budget<00:02:19.390> bringing

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
in more bells and whistles and just not

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.539 
in more bells and whistles and just not
keeping<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:22.750> songwriting<00:02:23.440> up<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:24.069> snuff<00:02:24.340> in

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
keeping the songwriting up to snuff in

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.550 
keeping the songwriting up to snuff in

album didn't really do anything for me

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.030 
album didn't really do anything for me
which<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.299> did<00:02:49.660> get<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.260> lot<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:50.650> negative

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
which I did get a lot of negative

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.250 
which I did get a lot of negative
responses<00:02:51.640> for<00:02:51.849> not<00:02:52.209> enjoying<00:02:52.569> quite<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.049> much

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
responses for not enjoying quite so much

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.220 
responses for not enjoying quite so much
and<00:02:53.650> even<00:02:54.609> though<00:02:54.849> I<00:02:54.879> didn't<00:02:55.239> really<00:02:55.480> dislike

and even though I didn't really dislike

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.869 
and even though I didn't really dislike
it<00:02:56.799> I<00:02:56.920> think<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.310> lot<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.579> people<00:02:57.790> were

it I think a lot of people were
expecting<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.510> much<00:02:58.750> more<00:02:58.930> positive<00:02:59.170> review

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
underrated them and also the third part

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.089 
underrated them and also the third part
of<00:03:13.060> this<00:03:13.180> that<00:03:13.959> I<00:03:13.989> definitely<00:03:14.500> wanted<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.859> talk

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
of this that I definitely wanted to talk

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.069 
of this that I definitely wanted to talk
about<00:03:15.280> our<00:03:15.639> LPS<00:03:16.120> that<00:03:16.599> I<00:03:16.660> didn't<00:03:16.989> necessarily

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
about our LPS that I didn't necessarily

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.009 
about our LPS that I didn't necessarily
love<00:03:17.799> that<00:03:18.549> I<00:03:18.819> didn't<00:03:19.150> necessarily<00:03:19.239> want<00:03:19.750> to

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
love that I didn't necessarily want to

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.900 
love that I didn't necessarily want to
shove<00:03:20.290> down<00:03:20.530> your<00:03:20.799> throats<00:03:21.220> but<00:03:21.609> but<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:21.819> do

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
shove down your throats but but I do

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.360 
shove down your throats but but I do
think<00:03:22.299> deserved<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:23.169> little<00:03:23.410> bit<00:03:23.560> more<00:03:23.829> credit

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
think deserved a little bit more credit

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.920 
think deserved a little bit more credit
and<00:03:24.489> attention<00:03:25.060> than<00:03:25.180> they<00:03:25.299> actually<00:03:25.450> got

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
and attention than they actually got
