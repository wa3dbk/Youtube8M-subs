the paprika comes in contact with the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.410 
the paprika comes in contact with the
pan<00:01:17.009> will<00:01:17.189> actually<00:01:17.520> start<00:01:17.729> kind<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.000> giving

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
pan will actually start kind of giving

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.109 
pan will actually start kind of giving
it<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.570> little<00:01:18.869> roasted<00:01:19.439> flavor<00:01:20.030> so<00:01:21.030> we're

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
it a little roasted flavor so we're

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.080 
it a little roasted flavor so we're
looking<00:01:21.299> pretty<00:01:21.390> even<00:01:21.780> here<00:01:21.960> now<00:01:22.909> once<00:01:23.909> we're

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
looking pretty even here now once we're

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.580 
looking pretty even here now once we're
pretty<00:01:25.310> pretty<00:01:26.310> much<00:01:26.399> done<00:01:26.819> with<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:28.380> paprika

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
pretty pretty much done with the paprika

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.669 
pretty pretty much done with the paprika
stage<00:01:29.130> then<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:30.060> add<00:01:30.179> our<00:01:30.209> flour<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:31.319> really

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
stage then we add our flour it's really

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:32.809 
stage then we add our flour it's really
really<00:01:31.860> important<00:01:32.220> when<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.399> add<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> flour

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
really important when you add the flour

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.039 
really important when you add the flour
that<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.200> don't<00:01:34.740> get<00:01:34.830> any<00:01:34.979> clumps<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.990> I'm

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
that you don't get any clumps so I'm

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.130 
that you don't get any clumps so I'm
going<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.259> add<00:01:37.319> it<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.740> waves<00:01:38.929> to<00:01:39.929> little

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
going to add it in waves to little

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.809 
going to add it in waves to little
stages<00:01:40.500> should<00:01:40.679> be<00:01:40.770> about<00:01:40.920> right<00:01:43.700> just<00:01:44.700> make

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
stages should be about right just make

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.990 
stages should be about right just make
sure<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.920> know<00:01:46.920> what<00:01:47.130> should<00:01:47.850> happen

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
sure that you know what should happen

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.270 
sure that you know what should happen
here<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.390> as<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.750> add<00:01:48.929> it<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.890> wait<00:01:50.009> until<00:01:50.159> you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
here is as you add it you wait until you

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.830 
here is as you add it you wait until you
can't<00:01:50.459> really<00:01:50.580> see<00:01:50.670> any<00:01:50.970> more<00:01:51.090> flour<00:01:51.299> then<00:01:51.689> you

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
can't really see any more flour then you

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.690 
can't really see any more flour then you
add<00:01:51.959> more<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:52.979> keep<00:01:53.129> stirring<00:01:53.489> it<00:01:53.550> till

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
add more so you keep stirring it till

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.040 
add more so you keep stirring it till
you<00:01:53.759> can't<00:01:53.940> see<00:01:54.090> any<00:01:54.239> more<00:01:54.420> then<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.810> add<00:01:54.959> the

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
you can't see any more then you add the

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.990 
you can't see any more then you add the
rest<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.560> think<00:01:56.550> probably<00:01:57.950> too<00:02:00.080> little<00:02:02.000> time

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
rest I think probably too little time

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.900 
rest I think probably too little time
should<00:02:03.300> be<00:02:03.330> enough<00:02:03.629> here<00:02:04.580> so<00:02:05.580> I'm<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:05.759> kind

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
should be enough here so I'm just kind

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.339 
should be enough here so I'm just kind
of<00:02:05.940> keep<00:02:06.060> stirring<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.539> until<00:02:06.929> I<00:02:06.959> can't<00:02:07.200> see

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
of keep stirring this until I can't see

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.570 
of keep stirring this until I can't see
the<00:02:07.440> flower<00:02:07.649> anymore<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:11.340> I'm<00:02:11.430> gonna<00:02:11.519> let

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
the flower anymore and I'm gonna let
