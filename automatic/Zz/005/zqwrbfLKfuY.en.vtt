00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.849
 hi all with you again, I'm Julia I've been 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.550
 I really wanted to do a vlog about what I 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.400
 I found the bags and now I received a request from 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.189
 which I could not resist therefore 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.350
 The theme of today's video is that I take 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.960
 with me for what's in my bag when i go 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.359
 walk with the child a little preface 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.759
 when I have a walk with my baby 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.040
 girls still small a year and a half 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.149
 Of course we go for a walk in a wheelchair and 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.480
 not in the yard 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.649
 as if far from the broth so when 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.210
 we will not need anything often 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.660
 come back home and take what we need 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.420
 After all, and so here I take with me a bag knock 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.699
 necessarily small or are you there 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.340
 some clutch and you are not a wallet from 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.739
 which I can carry with me because 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.989
 it is not safe to leave it in a wheelchair 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.559
 open the first thing in my bag 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.140
 running 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.990
 this is a phone and then what else do I have here 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.180
 comb take with me in this comb 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.030
 Godzilla I like her very much 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.159
 good at combing your hair and honestly 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.159
 saying I'm in love with her and not a step from 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.369
 I do not go to take it 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.810
 not always with you if she does not hold 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.200
 savers there in a small handbag then i 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.670
 leave this comb in the pack at all 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.569
 comb then change to the amount 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.630
 this lipstick from max factor is my 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:37.789
 favorite red tint of it 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.140
 bright red us cracks and on the other 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:44.270
 sides to pale pink mother of pearl 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.719
 shade to and the game is constantly very 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.780
 like very resistant does not roll down 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:54.909
 super lipstick this is my all-terrain vehicle everywhere too 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:59.299
 I also take a bag of blush from dior 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:02.450
 Here is a shade Here, in principle, and sat down 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.119
 I don't have a sampler here 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.840
 an oven but these are necessary things that 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:12.230
 I take for myself, but what's for my daughter until 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.410
 daughters of course i have everything in my bag not 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.230
 I carry with me this package 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.709
 I leave you inside the stroller and not at all 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.139
 walk me five minutes not 10 minutes there 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.000
 not even an hour in my program, we 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.500
 must walk at least two and a half 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.989
 hours and therefore 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.760
 I have to carry out my program to him 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.650
 walk and meet two and a half three 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.470
 o'clock 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.930
 so during this time, a lot of things to me 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.419
 there is a need to change the diaper and more 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.980
 something but in general let's start what i take for 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:48.109
 baby for baby first 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.910
 our kids all love the liver and because 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:54.530
 my can eat immediately 10 pieces at a time 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.540
 at least it seems to me come on come on a 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.660
 she will still have something to eat 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.349
 there is still a spare cap for knowing 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.519
 cap 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:06.260
 well, growing up suddenly we lose panama 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.139
 Much case you do it I'm such a mom 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.410
 I collect everything useful and I need everything 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:16.609
 Do I have a spare cap too 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.889
 I must take a hooded sweater 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.349
 general suddenly the wind blows or starts 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:24.109
 the rain in general will be suddenly cold I take 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.120
 baby sure i'm putting in the package 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.519
 juice any hatch given 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.630
 Now that I have the juice of millions 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.650
 apple eugene k 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:39.769
 I also take the usual water with me 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:42.229
 some August water to a glass in such 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.509
 the straw is louder than the Soviet by the straw 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:49.759
 Closes neprolivayka very good 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:51.799
 I recommend a cup of Windows conveniently 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:56.739
 and that by the way he is very much together we are 300 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:04:00.829
 milliliters and long enough water so 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:03.979
 let's get down to the most interesting yes so 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:07.489
 that i take spare diapers 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:09.620
 but just in case it happens well, if very 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.690
 hot then i just take the panties and you on 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.039
 case if it is very hot tanya under will 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.769
 I also have to take away Lena 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:23.300
 the diaper does not cover us too 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:26.180
 the case is covered with a stroller general diaper 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.770
 but of course wet wipes are true 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.289
 the method is a little crying and in general I have 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.530
 a whole bunch of baby napkins come in handy 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.569
 take at the moment I have here 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.720
 green tea by the way is a very pleasant aroma 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:40.310
 my wet wipes universal them 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.250
 bodies fresh well, that seems to be all 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:48.350
 told the package let my bag is empty 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:52.880
 of course so of course except for these things I 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.620
 on the weather take a review and if we go to 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.240
 lunchtime walks then i will 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.080
 take in boxing 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.330
 hot meal for baby there spoon a mug 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.639
 I can take the general things like this 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.639
 depending on the situation but standard 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.620
 a set of things that I take when we go 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.780
