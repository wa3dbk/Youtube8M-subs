00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.260 
if it's a deep ball you don't catch it
early<00:02:18.530> then<00:02:18.680> you<00:02:18.770> have<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.010> back<00:02:19.190> away<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:20.060> you

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
early then you have to back away and you

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:28.330 
early then you have to back away and you
wait<00:02:20.510> behind<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.900> baseline<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:27.410> move<00:02:27.860> forward

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
wait behind the baseline so move forward

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.710 
wait behind the baseline so move forward
and<00:02:28.640> you're<00:02:28.820> cutting<00:02:29.000> off<00:02:29.300> those<00:02:29.630> angles

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.480 

the<00:02:36.020> third<00:02:36.350> advantage<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:37.040> playing<00:02:37.250> the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
the third advantage of playing the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.760 
the third advantage of playing the
tennis<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.150> this<00:02:38.420> is<00:02:38.600> huge<00:02:38.870> you<00:02:39.230> are<00:02:39.380> taking

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
tennis and this is huge you are taking

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.250 
tennis and this is huge you are taking
time<00:02:39.980> away<00:02:40.220> from<00:02:40.430> your<00:02:40.760> opponent<00:02:41.260> essentially

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
time away from your opponent essentially

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:53.610 
time away from your opponent essentially
making<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:42.770> slower

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.930 

the<00:02:54.620> fourth<00:02:54.920> advantage<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.520> these<00:02:55.700> cell

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
the fourth advantage of these cell

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.090 
the fourth advantage of these cell
tennis<00:02:56.300> by<00:02:56.870> cutting<00:02:57.200> off<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.470> ball<00:02:57.650> earlier

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
tennis by cutting off the ball earlier

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.710 
tennis by cutting off the ball earlier
you<00:02:58.670> actually<00:02:59.030> don't<00:02:59.210> have<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.420> move<00:02:59.690> as<00:02:59.870> far

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.330 

which<00:03:05.720> perhaps<00:03:06.020> could<00:03:06.380> save<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.740> energy<00:03:06.860> in<00:03:07.250> a

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
which perhaps could save you energy in a

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.460 
which perhaps could save you energy in a
long<00:03:07.520> match<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:08.600> if<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.870> are<00:03:08.930> getting<00:03:09.080> pushed

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
long match so if you are getting pushed

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.980 
long match so if you are getting pushed
all<00:03:09.740> over<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.520> court<00:03:10.820> remember<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.810> move

all over the court remember to move

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.650 
all over the court remember to move
smarter<00:03:12.530> by<00:03:12.860> incorporating<00:03:13.250> B<00:03:13.970> star<00:03:14.300> tennis
