00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
lose them even if they get busted so but

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.649 
lose them even if they get busted so but
is<00:03:34.430> actually<00:03:34.549> quite<00:03:34.879> a<00:03:34.970> big<00:03:35.239> improvement

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:35.659 
is actually quite a big improvement

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:37.270 
is actually quite a big improvement
because<00:03:35.959> of<00:03:36.169> course<00:03:36.349> we<00:03:36.409> actually<00:03:36.829> did<00:03:37.040> lose

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
because of course we actually did lose

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.219 
because of course we actually did lose
weapons<00:03:37.729> when<00:03:37.909> we<00:03:38.000> get<00:03:38.180> busted<00:03:38.359> usually<00:03:38.989> but

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:39.229 
weapons when we get busted usually but

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.710 
weapons when we get busted usually but
this<00:03:39.470> won't<00:03:39.680> be<00:03:39.859> happening<00:03:39.889> in<00:03:40.370> GTA<00:03:40.729> 5<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.299> one

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
this won't be happening in GTA 5 and one

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.360 
this won't be happening in GTA 5 and one
so<00:03:41.810> if<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:41.989> guys<00:03:42.139> didn't<00:03:42.440> know<00:03:42.500> when<00:03:43.010> you<00:03:43.159> run

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
actually throw away the weapon you

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.649 
actually throw away the weapon you
actually<00:03:49.459> get<00:03:49.639> to<00:03:49.669> keep<00:03:49.909> the<00:03:50.090> weapon<00:03:50.269> but<00:03:50.569> of

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
actually get to keep the weapon but of

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.180 
actually get to keep the weapon but of
course<00:03:50.870> you<00:03:50.930> just<00:03:51.139> won't<00:03:51.290> have<00:03:51.440> any<00:03:51.620> ammo<00:03:51.889> in

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
course you just won't have any ammo in

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.800 
course you just won't have any ammo in
it<00:03:52.310> so<00:03:52.549> that<00:03:52.760> is<00:03:52.879> good<00:03:53.060> you<00:03:53.120> will<00:03:53.389> never<00:03:53.569> lose

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
it so that is good you will never lose

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.420 
it so that is good you will never lose
that<00:03:53.870> weapon<00:03:54.440> so<00:03:54.680> for<00:03:54.859> instance<00:03:54.949> if<00:03:55.280> you're

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
that weapon so for instance if you're

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.530 
that weapon so for instance if you're
doing<00:03:55.609> a<00:03:55.669> mission<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:56.150> find<00:03:56.389> like<00:03:56.510> a

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
doing a mission and you find like a

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.780 
doing a mission and you find like a
really<00:03:56.900> awesome<00:03:57.049> weapon<00:03:57.650> but<00:03:57.829> the<00:03:58.250> ammo<00:03:58.519> is

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
really awesome weapon but the ammo is

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.460 
really awesome weapon but the ammo is
really<00:03:59.120> low<00:03:59.299> even<00:03:59.659> if<00:03:59.750> that<00:03:59.780> runs<00:04:00.109> out<00:04:00.319> you<00:04:00.349> can

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
really low even if that runs out you can

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.750 
really low even if that runs out you can
still<00:04:00.859> keep<00:04:01.040> that<00:04:01.220> weapon<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.639> just

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
still keep that weapon and just

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.550 
still keep that weapon and just
basically<00:04:02.120> go<00:04:02.389> to<00:04:02.419> your<00:04:02.750> nearby<00:04:03.169> and<00:04:03.409> your

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
basically go to your nearby and your

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.589 
description below and I found some more
information<00:04:15.409> on<00:04:15.889> it<00:04:16.039> so<00:04:16.280> another<00:04:16.880> some<00:04:17.299> fact

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:17.599 
information on it so another some fact

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:19.539 
information on it so another some fact
is<00:04:17.780> there<00:04:18.049> is<00:04:18.079> no<00:04:18.349> longer<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:18.889> large<00:04:19.190> search

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
is there is no longer a large search

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.430 
is there is no longer a large search
radius<00:04:19.970> from<00:04:20.450> which<00:04:20.690> one<00:04:20.930> must<00:04:21.109> escape

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
radius from which one must escape

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.649 
radius from which one must escape
instead<00:04:22.310> every<00:04:22.639> police<00:04:22.940> car<00:04:23.180> and<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.450> police

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
helicopter has it

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.070 
helicopter has it
vision<00:04:25.340> code<00:04:25.550> which<00:04:26.090> is<00:04:26.120> displayed<00:04:26.749> on<00:04:26.780> the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
vision code which is displayed on the

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.260 
vision code which is displayed on the
mini-map<00:04:27.349> so<00:04:27.740> what<00:04:27.919> this<00:04:28.039> means<00:04:28.340> is<00:04:28.550> like<00:04:29.090> in

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
mini-map so what this means is like in

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.480 
mini-map so what this means is like in
GTA<00:04:29.629> 4<00:04:29.930> where<00:04:30.110> we<00:04:30.229> had<00:04:30.439> our<00:04:30.590> mini<00:04:31.009> map<00:04:31.219> and<00:04:31.400> of

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
GTA 4 where we had our mini map and of

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.459 
GTA 4 where we had our mini map and of
course<00:04:31.669> when<00:04:31.819> we<00:04:32.090> had<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.300> cops<00:04:32.629> wanting<00:04:33.349> to

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:33.469

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.080 
course when we had the cops wanting to
get<00:04:33.590> us<00:04:33.770> of<00:04:34.219> course<00:04:34.460> flash<00:04:34.699> then<00:04:34.909> we<00:04:34.969> had<00:04:35.060> to

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
get us of course flash then we had to

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.510 
get us of course flash then we had to
escape<00:04:35.300> that<00:04:35.599> particular<00:04:35.900> circle<00:04:36.770> or<00:04:36.919> area

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
escape that particular circle or area

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.489 
escape that particular circle or area
where<00:04:37.789> you<00:04:37.939> guys<00:04:38.060> wish<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.389> say<00:04:38.539> instead<00:04:39.110> the

where you guys wish to say instead the

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:40.989 
where you guys wish to say instead the
police<00:04:39.740> have<00:04:39.949> their<00:04:40.129> own<00:04:40.340> so<00:04:40.639> we<00:04:40.759> have<00:04:40.879> to

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:40.999 
police have their own so we have to

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:43.149 
police have their own so we have to
escape<00:04:41.180> that<00:04:41.629> bears<00:04:41.930> and<00:04:42.199> the<00:04:42.560> last<00:04:42.740> part<00:04:42.949> two
