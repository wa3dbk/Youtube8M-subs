00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
it in to equalized for i ax a really

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.970 
it in to equalized for i ax a really
good<00:00:54.510> goal<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.870> when<00:00:55.140> i<00:00:55.170> was<00:00:55.410> making<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.739> run

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
good goal and when i was making that run

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.099 
good goal and when i was making that run
actually<00:00:56.280> thought<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.879> was<00:00:57.030> outside<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.750> if

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
actually thought it was outside and if

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.380 
actually thought it was outside and if
you<00:00:58.230> look<00:00:58.410> at<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.649> replay<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:59.219> it's<00:01:00.030> pretty

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
you look at the replay it's it's pretty

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.959 
you look at the replay it's it's pretty
close<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.170> still<00:01:01.500> leaning<00:01:01.800> towards<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
close but it's still leaning towards the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.460 
close but it's still leaning towards the
fact<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.449> might<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.750> been<00:01:03.870> upside<00:01:04.260> but

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
fact that it might have been upside but

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.390 
fact that it might have been upside but
i<00:01:04.530> think<00:01:04.890> PES<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.489> year<00:01:05.700> has<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.420> um<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
i think PES this year has a um a

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.620 
i think PES this year has a um a
different<00:01:08.400> style<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.790> calling<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> upside

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
different style of calling the upside

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.710 
different style of calling the upside
the<00:01:09.869> rule<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.830> they<00:01:11.040> seem<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.360> not<00:01:12.360> call<00:01:12.689> a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the rule because they seem to not call a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.539 
the rule because they seem to not call a
lot<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.080> them<00:01:13.140> if<00:01:13.320> they're<00:01:13.530> really<00:01:13.860> close<00:01:14.070> but

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
lot of them if they're really close but

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.039 
lot of them if they're really close but
allergy<00:01:15.000> which<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.360> guess<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.810> kind<00:01:15.990> of

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
allergy which is I guess it's kind of

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.840 
allergy which is I guess it's kind of
good<00:01:16.110> because<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:17.189> know<00:01:17.220> affecting<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
good because it's you know affecting the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.670 
good because it's you know affecting the
play<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.299> because<00:01:18.509> goalkeepers<00:01:19.500> and

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
play with because goalkeepers and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.600 
play with because goalkeepers and
everything<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.159> game<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.490> so

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
everything in this game is so

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.179 
everything in this game is so
overpowered<00:01:21.150> already<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:21.750> as<00:01:21.979> you<00:01:22.979> saw<00:01:23.159> there

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
overpowered already but as you saw there

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.340 
overpowered already but as you saw there
with<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> long<00:01:23.850> shot<00:01:24.119> from<00:01:24.270> closure<00:01:24.509> but

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
with the long shot from closure but

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.410 
with the long shot from closure but
Creek<00:01:25.710> gets<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.189> ball<00:01:26.400> here<00:01:26.610> inside<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.180> box

subbed and the de young which is I asked
if<00:03:55.440> he<00:03:55.590> actually<00:03:55.860> is<00:03:56.250> pronounced<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:56.760> way<00:03:56.880> I

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
if he actually is pronounced that way I

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.300 
if he actually is pronounced that way I
know<00:03:57.150> he's<00:03:57.480> not<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.810> dude<00:03:58.020> from<00:03:58.230> uh<00:03:58.440> from<00:03:58.680> a

just thought they might have different
pronunciations<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.380> for<00:04:04.710> the<00:04:04.800> name<00:04:04.950> because

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
pronunciations to for the name because

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.130 
pronunciations to for the name because
