PDK<00:00:34.360> okay<00:00:35.360> so<00:00:35.900> what<00:00:36.110> does<00:00:36.320> CVT<00:00:36.950> technology<00:00:37.610> has

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
PDK okay so what does CVT technology has

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.930 
PDK okay so what does CVT technology has
to<00:00:38.210> do<00:00:38.330> with<00:00:38.450> Formula<00:00:39.080> One<00:00:39.230> technology<00:00:39.940> the

power curve is totally unproductive this
is<00:07:29.849> the<00:07:30.029> reason<00:07:30.389> why<00:07:30.779> if<00:07:31.020> you<00:07:31.229> drive<00:07:31.559> a<00:07:31.589> CVT

00:07:32.179 --> 00:07:32.189 
is the reason why if you drive a CVT

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:34.579 
is the reason why if you drive a CVT
vehicle<00:07:32.879> you'll<00:07:33.270> hear<00:07:33.539> the<00:07:33.719> engine<00:07:34.080> Rev<00:07:34.289> quite

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:34.589 
vehicle you'll hear the engine Rev quite

00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:36.889 
vehicle you'll hear the engine Rev quite
high<00:07:34.800> on<00:07:35.069> first<00:07:35.339> gear<00:07:35.639> as<00:07:35.789> it<00:07:36.240> starts<00:07:36.659> picking

high on first gear as it starts picking
up<00:07:37.169> speed<00:07:37.969> the<00:07:38.969> intention<00:07:39.509> here<00:07:39.779> is<00:07:39.929> to

up speed the intention here is to

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:42.019 
up speed the intention here is to

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:42.029 
educate you into making the right

many<00:07:45.179> cases<00:07:45.719> the<00:07:46.169> paddle<00:07:46.469> shifting<00:07:46.919> on<00:07:47.069> a<00:07:47.099> CVT

00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:47.729 
many cases the paddle shifting on a CVT

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:50.179 
many cases the paddle shifting on a CVT
is<00:07:47.759> an<00:07:47.999> extra<00:07:48.419> and<00:07:48.599> not<00:07:49.019> worth<00:07:49.289> the<00:07:49.499> cost<00:07:49.800> as<00:07:50.039> it

00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:50.189 
is an extra and not worth the cost as it

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:53.659 
is an extra and not worth the cost as it
negates<00:07:50.550> the<00:07:50.789> benefits<00:07:51.269> of<00:07:51.419> a<00:07:51.509> CVT<00:07:52.069> if<00:07:53.069> used<00:07:53.429> in

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:53.669 
negates the benefits of a CVT if used in

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:56.029 
negates the benefits of a CVT if used in
normal<00:07:53.909> driving<00:07:54.179> the<00:07:54.809> CVT<00:07:55.319> will<00:07:55.740> give<00:07:55.919> you

normal driving the CVT will give you

00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:58.800 
normal driving the CVT will give you
satisfaction<00:07:56.249> and<00:07:56.969> years<00:07:57.360> of<00:07:57.539> fuel<00:07:57.809> economy
