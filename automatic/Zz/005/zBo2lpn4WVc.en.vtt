really impressive of footage from Tinker
really<00:06:52.439> was<00:06:52.669> the<00:06:53.669> zoning<00:06:54.539> out<00:06:54.629> of<00:06:54.780> the<00:06:54.900> void

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.050 
really was the zoning out of the void
and<00:06:55.500> complete<00:06:55.949> like<00:06:56.219> the<00:06:56.550> fact<00:06:56.699> that<00:06:56.789> he<00:06:56.940> had

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 
and complete like the fact that he had

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.749 
and complete like the fact that he had
to<00:06:57.150> go<00:06:57.240> mid<00:06:57.449> lane<00:06:57.629> to<00:06:58.139> steal<00:06:58.530> experience<00:06:59.250> from

his sniper huge and then I think the

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.890 
his sniper huge and then I think the
weakness<00:07:02.550> of<00:07:02.669> the<00:07:02.849> draft<00:07:03.090> as<00:07:03.330> well<00:07:03.479> was<00:07:03.719> shown
