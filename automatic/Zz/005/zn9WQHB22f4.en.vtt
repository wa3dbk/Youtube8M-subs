00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:04.669
 in this task we will learn to generate a presentation three photographs 

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:06.770
 starting from flick 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.320
 for this you need two virgin planets we have right now in 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.999
 screen 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:12.579
 the first of them 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:17.019
 this is what the flickr user code will provide us with 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.679
 what is necessary to make said presentation 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:21.780
 and the second 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.359
 presented the generator of the presentation itself 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.789
 we go directly to the first 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.910
 i and it without the space that we have for it 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.850
 We write the full address of the user whose presentation we want 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.370
 create we have the search button 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.510
 and the tool itself automatically generates the code could 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.910
 even rich 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.370
 we select 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.400
 and we copy it 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.570
 the second tool is in front of us at this moment 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.280
 efe with this we are going to generate the html code 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.790
 that we will use our vote later 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.960
 in the first of the boxes we enter the user identifier 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.970
 from flickr com that we have obtained the previous step simply by testing it 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.850
 we give you the vote to generate 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.130
 automatically generates the html code that we need 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.270
 we do not select and we copy it while we look like in the part of the 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.650
 right 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.650
 in case the fund was foreseen and the presentation 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.960
 the third step we will give it in the pro's address panel 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.890
 we have written the optical article the brief 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.080
 and in the html edition tab we just have to copy below the text 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.050
 sorry to paste below the text 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.050
 the code that we have previously copied 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.220
 if you look here I have changed here the height and width of the sea koke in which 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.010
 is going to see the presentation previously appeared 500 euros all 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.240
 they tried it 400 because it fits better to receive ideas from my blog 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.240
 once all this is done we have to publish the post 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.890
 i can go directly to see in the prologue the presentation of spam 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.970
