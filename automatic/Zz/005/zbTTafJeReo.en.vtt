of free space on the sides of the
included<00:00:49.170> battery<00:00:51.020> meaning<00:00:52.020> they<00:00:52.170> could<00:00:52.350> have

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
included battery meaning they could have

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.990 
included battery meaning they could have
put<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> much<00:00:52.800> larger<00:00:53.219> one<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:53.879> they

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
put a much larger one in there have they

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.590 
put a much larger one in there have they
chosen<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.829> but<00:00:55.829> those<00:00:56.039> bastards<00:00:56.280> put<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.760> 1500

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
chosen to but those bastards put a 1500

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.959 
chosen to but those bastards put a 1500
milliamp<00:00:58.020> battery<00:00:58.079> instead<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.890> even<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.190> 2500

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
milliamp battery instead of even a 2500

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.029 
milliamp battery instead of even a 2500
that<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.390> buy<00:01:00.570> separately<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.890> they

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
that you can buy separately so they

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.160 
that you can buy separately so they
evidently<00:01:02.430> wanted<00:01:03.270> people<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.750> spend<00:01:03.989> some

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
evidently wanted people to spend some

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.570 
evidently wanted people to spend some
money<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.559> their<00:01:04.710> high<00:01:04.860> capacity<00:01:05.460> battery

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
money on their high capacity battery

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.859 
money on their high capacity battery
that's<00:01:05.939> why<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.119> only<00:01:06.270> get<00:01:06.420> two<00:01:06.540> hours<00:01:06.689> of

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
that's why you only get two hours of

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.859 
that's why you only get two hours of
life<00:01:07.020> out<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> controller<00:01:08.600> but<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.720> got

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
life out of the controller but it's got

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.590 
life out of the controller but it's got
easy<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.229> remove<00:01:10.740> pull<00:01:11.369> tab<00:01:11.610> here<00:01:11.909> put<00:01:12.570> your

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
easy to remove pull tab here put your

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.609 
easy to remove pull tab here put your
finger<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.460> pull<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.549> out<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.320> pop<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
finger in it pull it out and you pop the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.850 
finger in it pull it out and you pop the
battery<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:18.320> there's<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> old<00:01:19.530> battery

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
battery up there's the old battery

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.999 
battery up there's the old battery
compared<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> new<00:01:20.520> one

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
compared to the new one

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.260 
compared to the new one
that's<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.189> how<00:01:23.250> capacity<00:01:23.820> works<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.119> need

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
that's just how capacity works you need

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.160 
that's just how capacity works you need
more<00:01:24.390> space<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:24.720> more<00:01:25.020> capacity<00:01:27.020> we<00:01:28.020> will

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
more space for more capacity we will

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.380 
more space for more capacity we will
just<00:01:28.340> slide<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.820> really<00:01:29.970> can't<00:01:30.299> go

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
just slide that and you really can't go

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.880 
just slide that and you really can't go
wrong<00:01:30.570> with<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.900> installation<00:01:34.159> top<00:01:35.159> first

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
I've read six to eight I've also heard

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.259 
I've read six to eight I've also heard
some<00:02:38.350> complaints<00:02:38.980> about<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.340> battery<00:02:39.700> meter

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
some complaints about the battery meter

some complaints about the battery meter
not<00:02:40.510> showing<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.140> full<00:02:41.530> charge<00:02:41.920> only

three-quarters<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.180> way<00:02:43.300> up<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:43.750> think

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
three-quarters of the way up I think

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.509 
three-quarters of the way up I think
that's<00:02:44.230> just<00:02:44.350> because<00:02:44.470> either<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.070> system<00:02:45.280> or

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
that's just because either the system or

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.400 
that's just because either the system or
the<00:02:45.610> controller<00:02:45.940> doesn't<00:02:46.870> come<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.230> ship

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
the controller doesn't come and ship

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.000 
the controller doesn't come and ship

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
probably normally works within the 1,500

you're having that problem it'll it'll

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.840 
you're having that problem it'll it'll
recalibrate<00:03:00.069> and<00:03:00.190> you'll<00:03:00.310> get<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.550> full<00:03:00.730> of
