00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.299
 speaks youtube guys all right 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.460
 You're here today to say a word. 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.450
 bit about the scene with the limit 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.020
 fleet walks a high seascape 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.640
 power of resistance against inclement weather 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.470
 mainly reference to water and 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:35.260
 resistance to atmospheric environments 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.210
 the body of the vehicle and 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.180
 it is indicated mainly for 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.580
 Boats well this scene from my friend 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.949
 everton already enjoys the video for 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.830
 thank him thank you everton 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.479
 by the present and you who are 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.159
 providing that we can 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.440
 test this material 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.780
 at that point in the channel and may be 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.670
 talking a little about him too 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.769
 good any idea and decide to pass 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.780
 some tips on how to apply this 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.720
 a scenario of using this being is expensive 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.409
 here in the national market unfortunately the 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.840
 people have access to some 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.270
 big brands some products a little 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.770
 best with different characteristics 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.829
 What do we have on the national market? 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.990
 is this type of characteristic 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:22.509
 related to durability protection or 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.009
 increase of brightness ease of some 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.719
 more professional product with a 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.020
 result in a short period of time. 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:31.869
 different characteristics of the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.869
 that we have in most of the products 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.229
 independent national brand 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.359
 we need to spend a little more 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.659
 eventually pay a very expensive price 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:46.420
 investment may very well be 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.039
 buy a good product already 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.549
 closing the subject 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.310
 the reflection on there we will focus the 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.340
 be the first question why do I 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.399
 I chose to get a scene like this 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.799
 Here is a personal durability will 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.710
 more rigid because I say it's a 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.539
 stiffer scene it protects too much 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.230
 better the bodywork of your car if 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:13.360
 compared some carnauba wax to 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.030
 even being so prevents us from having 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.640
 in the market is one will be focused on protection 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.099
 it withstands weather and 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.310
 it's a difficult scene for you to apply and 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.470
 to remove 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.260
 she needs some basic care 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.849
 at the time of application and at the time of 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.489
 application you will understand why 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.380
 I say it 's more rigid and why she 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.910
 becomes a bit difficult to apply 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.520
 the first point you should work 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.280
 always in very small areas with this 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.340
 blindness and you do not have a 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.880
 cure for the removal of extended wax or 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.580
 whatever my tip you work 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.250
 in areas of 20 by 20 cm areas 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.410
 until you get the hang of it. 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.390
 to work with this wax so that 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.720
 ensures that you can illustrate the 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.810
 surface remove surface wax 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.060
 having protected it without the stains of 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.280
 scene in the piece unlike many 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.140
 scenes that we have pasta on the market 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.690
 where we apply in the whole play and 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.730
 then we expect a period of 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.190
 time and makes removal with this be 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.620
 If you work in these small areas 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.230
 already removed right after you applied 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.760
 if it will only dry on the surface 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.739
 with degreasers for you 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.290
 removing difficult spear from you 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.530
 remove illustrating it when it 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.450
 had practically no microfiber 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.030
 tickles her when we are 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.739
 trying to remove it after drying 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.450
 vehicle paint it finishes 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.739
 fitting into the scenery a bit more 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.900
 where you look for features 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.209
 to use a product or 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.480
 either in my case I seek protection 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.150
 extreme against water greater protection 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.880
 of what I have with common scenes in 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.069
 national market and obviously it's a scene 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.040
 that it resists much more the washing of 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.440
 which resists the natural carnauba bases 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.660
 that we have around and many others 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.780
 if they too are the 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.519
 liquid or synthetic in peace then 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.790
 to close staff if you are looking for a 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.739
 scene with high protection power 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.720
 existing washes have a 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.570
 to invest in a scene starts here 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.940
 certainly fits into our question is 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.580
 a scene that does not let them paint the 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.740
 tact as it was already possible to see in the videos 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.610
 I 'm leaving the link here at 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.439
 description of the 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.500
 comparing it with the 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:36.169
 crystallizing the ns ocs and I recommend 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.900
 that you use those 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.789
 foam that fits them here 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.430
 neither there that you can leave it is 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.289
 stored directly on the 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.629
 wax so you do not have to stay 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.270
 washing it all the time until the process of 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:52.370
 microfiber applicator wash 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.919
 after using a scene from this one 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.439
 if you have too much access from the 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.840
 wax it hard you need 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:02.659
 possibly heat the water stops 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.300
 Sauce in hot water with a shampoo 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:07.340
 a very strong decrease in the 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.240
 you can remove this waste 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.090
 due to the high protection power that 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.860
 this will have good points 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.560
 durability and protection 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.050
 points that may be negative for 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.479
 some difficulty in applying it because 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.120
 I find it takes more time when 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.699
 you are applying requires much more 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.669
 Attention also at this moment for you 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:34.099
 avoiding inconvenience and avoiding 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.089
 product without knowing how to use a 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.610
 correct 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:40.460
 so it's not a very practical scene 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.810
 you apply you need to demand more 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.690
 time for you to make an application 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.029
 correct being a standard of being a bit 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.860
 more selective it certainly fits into the 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:51.740
 more professional environment 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.800
 where do you work with a 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.930
 to your customer and these 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.599
 were my impressions and my 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.159
 tips on this specific product 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.349
