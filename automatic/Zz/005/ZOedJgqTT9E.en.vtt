00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.260 

we're<00:00:04.380> in<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.529> demo<00:00:04.770> lab<00:00:04.920> with<00:00:05.100> Lonnie<00:00:05.370> where

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
we're in the demo lab with Lonnie where

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.400 
we're in the demo lab with Lonnie where
he's<00:00:06.480> going<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.810> mix<00:00:07.309> cane<00:00:08.309> sugar<00:00:08.730> and

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
he's going to mix cane sugar and

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.669 
he's going to mix cane sugar and
sulphuric<00:00:10.410> acid<00:00:10.849> so<00:00:11.849> sugar<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.840> carbon

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
sulphuric acid so sugar is a carbon

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.300 
sulphuric acid so sugar is a carbon
compound<00:00:14.480> sulfuric<00:00:15.480> acid<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.740> strongly

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
compound sulfuric acid is a strongly

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.730 
compound sulfuric acid is a strongly
dehydrating<00:00:18.240> agent<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.320> will<00:00:19.470> remove

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
dehydrating agent so it will remove

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.929 
dehydrating agent so it will remove
water<00:00:20.359> from<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:22.050> sugar<00:00:22.580> when<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.670> remove

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
water from the sugar when you remove

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.420 
water from the sugar when you remove
water<00:00:24.180> from<00:00:24.269> sugar<00:00:24.660> what's<00:00:25.560> left<00:00:25.800> behind<00:00:25.920> is

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
water from sugar what's left behind is

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.800 
water from sugar what's left behind is
essentially<00:00:27.330> just<00:00:27.590> elemental<00:00:28.590> carbon<00:00:29.390> so<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
essentially just elemental carbon so the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.549 
essentially just elemental carbon so the
mixture<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.439> sugar<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.730> sulfuric<00:00:33.149> acid<00:00:33.690> will

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
mixture of sugar and sulfuric acid will

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.280 
mixture of sugar and sulfuric acid will
produce<00:00:34.890> black<00:00:35.550> elemental<00:00:36.329> carbon<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
produce black elemental carbon in a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.889 
produce black elemental carbon in a
rather<00:00:37.469> dramatic<00:00:37.739> fashion<00:00:38.420> let's<00:00:39.420> watch<00:00:39.660> as

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
rather dramatic fashion let's watch as

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.900 
rather dramatic fashion let's watch as
Lonnie<00:00:40.110> mixes<00:00:40.559> these<00:00:40.739> two<00:00:40.920> compounds<00:00:43.910> here's

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
Lonnie mixes these two compounds here's

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.290 
Lonnie mixes these two compounds here's
the<00:00:45.120> sulfuric<00:00:45.570> acid<00:00:45.980> being<00:00:46.980> mixed<00:00:47.879> with<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
the sulfuric acid being mixed with the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.760 
the sulfuric acid being mixed with the
sugar<00:00:50.449> forming<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.539> slurry<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.500> see<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
sugar forming a slurry you can see the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.160 
sugar forming a slurry you can see the
reaction<00:00:53.250> beginning<00:00:53.840> lawn<00:00:54.840> you'll<00:00:55.020> add<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
reaction beginning lawn you'll add a

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.799 
reaction beginning lawn you'll add a
little<00:00:55.500> bit<00:00:55.649> more<00:00:55.730> sulfuric<00:00:56.730> acid<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:59.809> you

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
little bit more sulfuric acid and you

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.160 
little bit more sulfuric acid and you
can<00:01:00.989> already<00:01:01.260> see<00:01:02.149> black<00:01:03.149> carbon<00:01:03.629> beginning

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
can already see black carbon beginning

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.060 
can already see black carbon beginning
to<00:01:04.290> form<00:01:05.090> this<00:01:06.090> reaction<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.810> fairly

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
to form this reaction is fairly

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.359 
to form this reaction is fairly
exothermic<00:01:08.780> so<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.140> will<00:01:10.350> proceed<00:01:10.530> with<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
exothermic so it will proceed with the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.469 
exothermic so it will proceed with the
expansion<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:13.350> forming<00:01:13.770> carbon<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:15.450> form

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
expansion of the forming carbon to form

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.670 
expansion of the forming carbon to form
a<00:01:15.900> rapid<00:01:16.460> expansion<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.180> long<00:01:18.450> snake<00:01:19.409> of

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
a rapid expansion of a long snake of

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:50.730 
a rapid expansion of a long snake of
black<00:01:19.740> carbon<00:01:20.670> let's<00:01:21.270> watch<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.509> happen

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.340 

there<00:01:51.280> we<00:01:51.430> have<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.760> formation<00:01:52.060> of<00:01:52.350> elemental

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
there we have the formation of elemental

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.640 
there we have the formation of elemental
carbon<00:01:53.560> by<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.520> dehydration<00:01:55.270> of<00:01:55.540> sugar<00:01:55.869> with

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
carbon by the dehydration of sugar with

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.549 
carbon by the dehydration of sugar with
sulfuric<00:01:57.190> acid
