00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
like I really think that so the only

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.130 
like I really think that so the only
issue<00:02:19.820> with<00:02:20.030> this<00:02:20.300> cause<00:02:20.600> really<00:02:20.780> lightweight

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
issue with this cause really lightweight

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.380 
issue with this cause really lightweight
and<00:02:21.350> chiffon<00:02:22.270> kind<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:24.020> I<00:02:24.110> use<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:25.390> coral

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
and chiffon kind of and I use the coral

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.520 
and chiffon kind of and I use the coral
on<00:02:26.510> here<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.810> match<00:02:26.930> with<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.200> tank<00:02:27.470> top

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
on here to match with the tank top

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.080 
on here to match with the tank top
because<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.160> don't<00:02:28.400> want<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.700> do<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:28.880> like

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
because I don't want to do this like

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.390 
because I don't want to do this like
playing<00:02:29.390> white<00:02:29.630> or<00:02:30.530> black<00:02:30.800> with<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.340> think

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
playing white or black with it I think

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.850 
playing white or black with it I think
taking<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.150> color<00:02:32.450> from<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.870> makes<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:33.709> look

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
taking a color from it makes it look

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.540 
taking a color from it makes it look
nicer

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
nicer

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.470 
nicer
