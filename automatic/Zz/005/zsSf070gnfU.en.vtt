00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.269
 the transaction in this video is about 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.920
 a mysterious dlc which of that 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.960
 where there is sector of franklin and of that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.340
 respect of Michael was announced 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.930
 stay tuned worthwhile in any case for 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.369
 further information in front of it, however, still quite 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.869
 short the year i know mine 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.099
 last as pretty inactive off only 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.109
 pretty little videos made for you 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.310
 but that's just because I say 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.570
 directly, I just had the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.890
 Last days no desire at all 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.360
 to record any videos 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.530
 I want to be completely honest I do 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.670
 actually only videos if I like 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.809
 On it I have mine I have to yes 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.980
 I'm not lucky from youtube 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.149
 Do not need the money what you do with it 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.469
 therefore probably always deserves 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.520
 only yes i just always do it 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.899
 videos if the city has bock on it 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.399
 and I have to say honestly now 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.110
 after the gamescom I was really like that 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.219
 destroyed the last day and was just in the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.020
 bed shared and i just had 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.640
 do not mind to do that because 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.750
 if i will do videos now if 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.710
 I'm not bothered then I'll 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.670
 I'm not really happy with that either 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.320
 the videos and now I have too 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.670
 right back roswitha samson and 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.199
 That's why I finally get in touch now 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.520
 back again with a new video 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.199
 and that's why I would say look 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.640
 Just send us the post by wolfsegg 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.500
 the to me I'm just now times 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.030
 both fade in the background first 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.470
 here from franklin from the instagram 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.960
 page and he has this picture 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.970
 posted here straight out across street 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.350
 So Michael is the new sector of 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.049
 Michael just posted this picture 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.729
 think straight outta so still think 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.409
 and that looks personal to me 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.330
 quite suspicious of a dlc out 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.799
 and a dc based on the movie 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.630
 straight outta compton which is now in 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.830
 summer will come out and I was as 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.090
 I saw these two pictures I have 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.070
 was too i was really in disguise 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.570
 really pleased because of this movie 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.619
 straight or come and maybe have 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.100
 you already trailer about this movie 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.600
 seen 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.159
 this is really a movie where I am 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.479
 really run into the cinema right now because of me 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.579
 this movie apathetic money when in 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.380
 This movie is just about hip 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.610
 hop drugs and this whole geneva as in 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.380
 America between them 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.700
 afro-americans this was so fit and 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.990
 would therefore save even more 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.360
 and I really think it either 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.460
 simply great fit in the skating 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.600
 So if rockstar games and dlc like in 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.430
 This movie would do that to you 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.930
 How to hide drugs does not have a clue 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.890
 must rap or somehow so thing 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.090
 I might not do something 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.320
 every case has me in the extreme 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.479
 first moment really bad looking forward 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.000
 but it comes the disappointment of people 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.890
 No such a dlc will come the two 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.509
 So today , that may be the sector of 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.860
 franklin and sekte michael this 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.270
 Both just have this picture 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.500
 Posted because you are currently in the 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.180
 Internet makes it easy 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.800
 many of these minis give these straight 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.590
 outta at 1 here you can for example 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.790
 see straight outta or something else 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.710
 in style so there is really right 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.450
 many currently on the internet and that is 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.590
 unfortunately no announcement to a dlc 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.300
 but it should just be like that 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.160
 be funny effort but fool of 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.660
 This film is a weapon of the film 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.980
 straight outta compton has unfortunately 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.300
 a bit disappointed because as me 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.190
 The've really seen in the first tape 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.540
 I was just over the grass that had 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.890
 I was so happy about that because I was 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.300
 I'm celebrating this movie 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.860
 Weather really go to the cinema right away 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.240
 as soon as it comes out you can you so 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.200
 I like to watch trailer I can do it 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.490
 you unfortunately not in this video 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.420
 insert because then I strike from 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.220
 youtube would get 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.480
 I'm So as I said I would have to 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.709
 any case about the braid if so 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.570
 what would happen because you just because 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.980
 Just putting this gang in the middle could make this hip 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.640
 hop scene and as public as I said 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.350
 accuracy 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.850
 but as people said when you're in that 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.920
 future in the internet should see to it 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.840
 such pictures for example for example 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.090
 straight outta big rietz straight outta 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.190
 unfortunately there are no announcements 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.110
 to a story mode dlc and not 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.550
 elsewhere remote dlc which and twelve 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.470
 already promised days ago 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.450
 because it's just plain 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.070
 a mini of the two voice actors 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.540
 because you just do it right now 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.950
 on the internet, yes, people do a lot 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.299
 pity, but now you can count on everyone 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.560
 case no longer be despised if 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.910
 Make someone want to turn 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.260
 as I said, I hope, of course 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.519
 always that I liked the video 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.200
 if we scream then who on the 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.330
 like-button movie wholesaler himself up 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.330
 then it's pure people or creamy
