00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
we're on the US version and let's say

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.110 
we're on the US version and let's say
for<00:04:01.540> example<00:04:02.080> that<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:03.190> wanted<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.640> find<00:04:04.000> a

for example that you wanted to find a

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.119 
for example that you wanted to find a
movie<00:04:04.269> but<00:04:05.140> it's<00:04:05.260> not<00:04:05.470> on<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.620> American

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
movie but it's not on the American

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.430 
movie but it's not on the American
version<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:07.330> it<00:04:07.450> could<00:04:07.660> possibly<00:04:07.840> be<00:04:08.110> on

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
version and it could possibly be on

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.440 
version and it could possibly be on
another<00:04:08.620> version<00:04:08.860> of<00:04:09.010> Netflix<00:04:09.400> so<00:04:10.120> this<00:04:10.269> is<00:04:10.420> a
