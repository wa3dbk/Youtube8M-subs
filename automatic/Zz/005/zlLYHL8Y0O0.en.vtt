00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.470 

here's<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.410> very<00:00:05.310> good<00:00:05.549> example<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.330> how

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
here's the very good example of how

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.709 
here's the very good example of how
research<00:00:06.870> can<00:00:07.589> get<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.309> way<00:00:08.490> actually<00:00:09.179> we

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
research can get in the way actually we

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.020 
research can get in the way actually we
took<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:10.080> out<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.440> consumers<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.400> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
took this out to consumers and the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.400 
took this out to consumers and the
consumer<00:00:12.480> said<00:00:12.660> well<00:00:12.840> you're<00:00:13.019> saying

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
consumer said well you're saying

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.519 
consumer said well you're saying
Avis<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.130> only<00:00:14.309> number<00:00:14.519> two<00:00:15.109> and<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.230> vapors

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
Avis is only number two and the vapors

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.349 
Avis is only number two and the vapors
is<00:00:16.680> number<00:00:16.949> two<00:00:17.130> they're<00:00:17.340> not<00:00:17.369> number<00:00:17.940> one<00:00:18.180> you

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
is number two they're not number one you

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.429 
is number two they're not number one you
know<00:00:18.449> they're<00:00:18.720> not<00:00:18.810> number<00:00:19.109> one<00:00:19.260> you're

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
know they're not number one you're

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.029 
know they're not number one you're
obviously<00:00:19.590> not<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.250> best<00:00:21.470> well<00:00:22.470> we<00:00:22.619> looked<00:00:22.859> at

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
obviously not the best well we looked at

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.340 
obviously not the best well we looked at
this<00:00:23.189> research<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.480> think<00:00:24.750> perhaps<00:00:24.930> that

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
this research and I think perhaps that

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.109 
this research and I think perhaps that
the<00:00:25.590> most<00:00:25.890> organizations<00:00:26.760> would<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:26.970> said

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
the most organizations would have said

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.070 
the most organizations would have said
if<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> dangerous<00:00:28.199> campaign<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.949> run

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
if this is a dangerous campaign to run

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.380 
if this is a dangerous campaign to run
however<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.650> take<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.099> conclusion<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:33.239> we

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
however we take the conclusion that we

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.229 
however we take the conclusion that we
should<00:00:33.630> run<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.430> went<00:00:35.430> ahead<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.880> it

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
should run it and we went ahead with it

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.900 
should run it and we went ahead with it
and<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:36.840> probably<00:00:37.440> ran<00:00:37.950> one<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> great

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
and we probably ran one of the great

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.630 
and we probably ran one of the great
great<00:00:39.239> money-making<00:00:39.600> campaigns<00:00:40.500> but<00:00:41.460> we

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
great money-making campaigns but we

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.369 
great money-making campaigns but we
started<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.149> campaign<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.809> company<00:00:43.230> was

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
started this campaign this company was

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.049 
started this campaign this company was
three<00:00:43.620> million<00:00:43.829> dollars<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> red<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
three million dollars in the red and

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.400 
three million dollars in the red and
about<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> year<00:00:45.600> later<00:00:45.809> they<00:00:46.050> were<00:00:46.140> over<00:00:46.350> a

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
about a year later they were over a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.590 
about a year later they were over a
million<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.770> quarter<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> black<00:00:47.550> now<00:00:48.390> what

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
million a quarter in the black now what

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.500 
million a quarter in the black now what
did<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:49.190> all<00:00:50.190> campaign<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:50.969> not<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.329> for

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
did this all campaign is not that for

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.279 
did this all campaign is not that for
number<00:00:51.809> two

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
number two

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.990 
number two
how<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> pain<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.370> truly<00:00:53.670> caught

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
how can a pain is that we truly caught

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.660 
how can a pain is that we truly caught
her<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:55.500> know<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.250> human<00:00:56.640> nature

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
her and we know that it's human nature

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.349 
her and we know that it's human nature
to<00:00:57.210> believe<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.530> if<00:00:58.649> you're<00:00:58.800> number<00:00:59.039> two<00:00:59.399> you

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
to believe that if you're number two you

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.270 
to believe that if you're number two you
will<00:01:00.570> try<00:01:00.960> hard<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.770> number<00:01:01.920> one

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
will try hard to get to be number one

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.090 
will try hard to get to be number one
it's<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.420> nature<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.750> human<00:01:04.500> beings<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.949> be

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
it's the nature of human beings to be

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.399 
it's the nature of human beings to be
ambitious<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.939> try<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.180> get<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> top

and<00:01:07.680> people<00:01:08.220> believe<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.939> now<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.420> addition

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
and people believe this now in addition

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.410 
and people believe this now in addition
to<00:01:10.340> believing<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.729> are<00:01:11.760> ambitious<00:01:12.330> and
