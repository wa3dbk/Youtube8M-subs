hey guys what's going on this is mike
with<00:00:02.159> my<00:00:02.310> review<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.300> iphone<00:00:03.810> 6

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.060 

so<00:00:39.780> I'll<00:00:39.900> be<00:00:40.020> breaking<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.380> review<00:00:40.770> into

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
so I'll be breaking this review into

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.400 
so I'll be breaking this review into
four<00:00:41.309> parts<00:00:41.520> hardware<00:00:42.210> software<00:00:42.570> pricing<00:00:43.290> and

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
four parts hardware software pricing and

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.290 
four parts hardware software pricing and
availability<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:44.220> my<00:00:44.460> final<00:00:44.730> thoughts<00:00:45.090> at

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
availability and my final thoughts at

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.420 
availability and my final thoughts at
the<00:00:45.449> end<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.170> starting<00:00:46.470> off<00:00:46.559> with<00:00:46.800> design<00:00:47.190> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the end so starting off with design the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.610 
the end so starting off with design the
iphone<00:00:47.730> 6<00:00:47.970> changes<00:00:48.480> from<00:00:48.629> sharp<00:00:49.020> edges<00:00:49.290> on<00:00:49.590> the

iphone 6 changes from sharp edges on the
iPhone<00:00:50.010> 5s<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.670> smooth<00:00:50.970> rounded<00:00:51.390> edges<00:00:51.720> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
iPhone 5s to smooth rounded edges the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.780 
iPhone 5s to smooth rounded edges the
glass<00:00:52.350> actually<00:00:52.620> curves<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.489> smallest

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
glass actually curves just the smallest

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.790 
glass actually curves just the smallest
amount<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.270> meet<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.540> aluminum<00:00:54.960> sides<00:00:55.199> this

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
amount to meet the aluminum sides this

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.200 
amount to meet the aluminum sides this
change<00:00:56.100> makes<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.460> big<00:00:56.699> difference<00:00:57.059> when

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
change makes a big difference when

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.729 
change makes a big difference when
