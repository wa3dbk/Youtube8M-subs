to give you a show you inside the tank
too<00:02:16.760> so<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.450> can<00:02:17.510> just<00:02:17.600> see<00:02:17.870> where<00:02:18.020> some<00:02:18.170> of

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
too so you can just see where some of

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.479 
too so you can just see where some of
the<00:02:18.550> flow<00:02:19.550> areas<00:02:19.910> i'm<00:02:20.060> having<00:02:20.300> trouble<00:02:20.330> with

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
the flow areas i'm having trouble with

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.150 
the flow areas i'm having trouble with
alright<00:02:22.489> so<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.820> show<00:02:23.600> you<00:02:23.860> some<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.980> flow

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
alright so to show you some of the flow

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.100 
alright so to show you some of the flow
problems<00:02:25.580> i<00:02:25.700> have<00:02:25.880> here<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.510> can<00:02:26.690> see<00:02:26.870> this<00:02:26.959> is

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
problems i have here you can see this is

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.280 
problems i have here you can see this is
behind<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.560> main<00:02:27.739> rock<00:02:27.950> cluster<00:02:28.459> or<00:02:29.360> why

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
behind the main rock cluster or why

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.140 
behind the main rock cluster or why
algae<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:30.709> grows<00:02:30.980> back<00:02:31.220> their<00:02:31.459> stuff<00:02:31.970> gets

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
algae that grows back their stuff gets

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.900 
algae that grows back their stuff gets
trapped<00:02:35.320> down<00:02:36.320> here<00:02:36.350> this<00:02:37.070> is<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.370> main<00:02:37.880> uh

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
trapped down here this is the main uh

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.440 
trapped down here this is the main uh
it's<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.540> right<00:02:38.720> side<00:02:39.250> there's<00:02:40.250> like<00:02:40.790> i<00:02:40.970> can<00:02:41.150> i

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
it's the right side there's like i can i

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.949 
it's the right side there's like i can i
can<00:02:41.870> kind<00:02:42.830> of<00:02:43.209> swirl<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.360> sand<00:02:44.600> around<00:02:44.720> a

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
can kind of swirl the sand around a

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.449 
can kind of swirl the sand around a
little<00:02:45.080> bit<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.650> next<00:02:45.860> day<00:02:45.980> it'll<00:02:46.310> be<00:02:46.430> a

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
little bit and the next day it'll be a

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.550 
little bit and the next day it'll be a
build<00:02:46.700> up<00:02:46.850> right<00:02:47.060> there<00:02:47.270> still<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:48.110> seems<00:02:48.320> like

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
build up right there still it seems like

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.080 
build up right there still it seems like
it<00:02:48.680> just<00:02:48.709> never<00:02:49.100> gets<00:02:49.340> quite<00:02:49.640> enough<00:02:49.850> flow

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
it just never gets quite enough flow

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.750 
it just never gets quite enough flow
there<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:51.770> course<00:02:51.830> got<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.250> algae<00:02:52.520> all<00:02:52.610> of

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
there and of course got the algae all of

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.140 
there and of course got the algae all of
these<00:02:52.880> rocks<00:02:53.150> on<00:02:53.420> this<00:02:54.230> side<00:02:54.440> particularly

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
these rocks on this side particularly

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.360 
these rocks on this side particularly
and<00:02:56.150> there's<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.420> coils<00:02:56.840> up<00:02:56.989> here<00:02:57.260> which<00:02:58.040> have

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
and there's the coils up here which have

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.490 
and there's the coils up here which have
decent<00:02:58.760> flow<00:02:59.000> but<00:02:59.180> still<00:02:59.989> gets<00:03:00.140> quite<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.380> bit

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
decent flow but still gets quite a bit

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.580 
decent flow but still gets quite a bit
of<00:03:00.590> algae<00:03:02.170> on<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:04.010> left<00:03:04.220> side<00:03:05.290> from<00:03:06.290> Kenya

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
of algae on the left side from Kenya

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.650 
of algae on the left side from Kenya
tree<00:03:06.800> there<00:03:06.980> back<00:03:07.430> in<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.640> corner<00:03:08.030> there's<00:03:08.570> a

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
tree there back in the corner there's a

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.150 
tree there back in the corner there's a
lot<00:03:08.750> of<00:03:08.840> buildup<00:03:09.140> on<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.320> sand

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
lot of buildup on the sand

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.440 
lot of buildup on the sand
um<00:03:10.220> on<00:03:11.000> that<00:03:11.270> rock<00:03:11.480> particularly<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:13.270> then<00:03:14.270> in

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
um on that rock particularly and then in

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.300 
um on that rock particularly and then in
between<00:03:14.570> these<00:03:15.050> two<00:03:15.350> rocks<00:03:15.650> I<00:03:15.950> get<00:03:16.100> a<00:03:16.130> lot<00:03:16.250> of

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
between these two rocks I get a lot of

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.510 
between these two rocks I get a lot of
algae<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:16.880> grows<00:03:17.090> all<00:03:17.270> over<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.480> side<00:03:19.150> and

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
algae it grows all over the side and

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.120 
algae it grows all over the side and
collection<00:03:22.520> stuff<00:03:23.150> i<00:03:23.450> removed<00:03:24.110> like<00:03:24.830> i<00:03:24.920> said<00:03:24.980> a

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
collection stuff i removed like i said a

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.560 
collection stuff i removed like i said a
couple<00:03:25.310> pieces<00:03:25.520> of<00:03:25.700> rock<00:03:25.970> from<00:03:26.270> right<00:03:26.450> around

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
couple pieces of rock from right around

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.530 
couple pieces of rock from right around
here<00:03:27.100> here<00:03:28.100> you<00:03:28.220> can<00:03:28.340> see<00:03:28.610> a<00:03:28.640> view<00:03:29.240> from<00:03:29.450> the

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
here here you can see a view from the

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.100 
here here you can see a view from the
right<00:03:29.780> side<00:03:30.220> of<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.400> tank<00:03:31.750> now<00:03:32.750> have<00:03:32.960> the

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
right side of the tank now have the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.880 
right side of the tank now have the
rocks<00:03:33.320> stacked<00:03:34.330> see<00:03:35.330> I'm<00:03:35.420> thinking<00:03:35.810> you<00:03:36.800> know

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
rocks stacked see I'm thinking you know

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.780 
rocks stacked see I'm thinking you know
I'm<00:03:36.980> trying<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.250> think<00:03:37.280> of<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.460> better<00:03:37.550> way<00:03:37.760> to

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
I'm trying to think of a better way to

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.900 
I'm trying to think of a better way to
stack<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.270> rock<00:03:39.280> might<00:03:40.280> help<00:03:40.460> the<00:03:40.640> flu<00:03:40.880> but

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
stack the rock might help the flu but

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.070 
stack the rock might help the flu but
i'll<00:03:41.390> punish<00:03:41.810> any<00:03:42.020> more<00:03:42.170> power<00:03:42.350> heads<00:03:42.680> or<00:03:43.010> um

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
i'll punish any more power heads or um

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.870 
i'll punish any more power heads or um
what<00:03:45.080> but<00:03:45.890> i'm<00:03:46.070> hoping<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:46.430> guys<00:03:46.520> can<00:03:46.700> help<00:03:46.820> me

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.360 
what but i'm hoping you guys can help me
out<00:03:47.060> with<00:03:47.180> that<00:03:47.440> you<00:03:48.440> can<00:03:48.590> see<00:03:48.830> I've<00:03:49.040> got<00:03:49.220> a

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
out with that you can see I've got a

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.160 
out with that you can see I've got a
bunch<00:03:49.550> of<00:03:49.640> button<00:03:49.880> call<00:03:50.600> ups<00:03:50.780> here<00:03:50.930> which

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
bunch of button call ups here which

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.750 
bunch of button call ups here which
still<00:03:51.500> get<00:03:51.650> lots<00:03:51.830> of<00:03:51.920> algae<00:03:52.190> growth<00:03:52.400> on<00:03:52.580> them

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
still get lots of algae growth on them

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.210 
still get lots of algae growth on them
back<00:03:52.940> there
