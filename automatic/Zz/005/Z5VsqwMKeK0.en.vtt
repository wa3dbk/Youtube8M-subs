00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
a very very decisive part as far as I'm

a very very decisive part as far as I'm
concerned<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.610> know<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.760> player<00:02:21.060> should<00:02:21.299> have

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
concerned you know a player should have

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.880 
concerned you know a player should have
the<00:02:21.599> right<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.810> supposed<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.500> choose<00:02:22.739> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
the right I supposed to choose the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.500 
the right I supposed to choose the
national<00:02:23.220> team<00:02:23.400> he<00:02:23.430> wants<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.819> play<00:02:23.940> for<00:02:24.060> but

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
national team he wants to play for but

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.649 
national team he wants to play for but
it<00:02:25.260> would<00:02:25.379> it<00:02:25.890> would<00:02:25.950> seem<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.340> me<00:02:26.459> that<00:02:26.659> having

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
it would it would seem to me that having

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.170 
it would it would seem to me that having
played<00:02:27.989> for<00:02:28.260> every<00:02:28.409> level<00:02:28.680> England<00:02:29.069> so<00:02:29.250> far<00:02:29.549> it
