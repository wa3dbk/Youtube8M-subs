here your top and the bottom one of the
other<00:00:10.120> stands<00:00:10.599> the<00:00:11.590> bottom<00:00:11.950> just<00:00:12.100> fits<00:00:12.370> right

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:12.550 
other stands the bottom just fits right

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.080 
other stands the bottom just fits right
into<00:00:12.730> the<00:00:12.910> top<00:00:13.470> now<00:00:14.470> again<00:00:15.400> it<00:00:15.520> doesn't<00:00:15.670> fit<00:00:15.940> as

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
into the top now again it doesn't fit as

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.759 
into the top now again it doesn't fit as
smoothly<00:00:16.600> together<00:00:16.900> as<00:00:17.289> some<00:00:17.470> of<00:00:17.560> the<00:00:17.619> other

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:17.769 
smoothly together as some of the other

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.090 
smoothly together as some of the other
stands<00:00:18.130> but<00:00:18.460> it<00:00:18.850> seems<00:00:19.420> that<00:00:19.630> summit<00:00:20.100> knows

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
stands but it seems that summit knows

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.260 
stands but it seems that summit knows
that<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:22.420> so<00:00:22.450> they<00:00:22.750> provide<00:00:23.110> you<00:00:23.320> this<00:00:23.530> little

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
that and so they provide you this little

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.189 
that and so they provide you this little
green<00:00:25.949> bungee<00:00:26.949> thing<00:00:27.690> which<00:00:28.690> you<00:00:28.840> then<00:00:28.990> just

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
green bungee thing which you then just

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.859 
green bungee thing which you then just
take<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:29.680> wrap<00:00:29.800> around<00:00:29.860> this<00:00:30.369> thing<00:00:30.640> which

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
take and wrap around this thing which

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.900 
take and wrap around this thing which
basically<00:00:31.869> replaces<00:00:32.469> the<00:00:32.739> bungee<00:00:33.579> cord<00:00:33.820> that

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
basically replaces the bungee cord that

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.360 
basically replaces the bungee cord that
you<00:00:34.000> have<00:00:34.180> on<00:00:34.329> your<00:00:34.420> seat<00:00:34.750> which<00:00:35.020> would<00:00:35.230> do<00:00:36.220> the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
you have on your seat which would do the

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.460 
you have on your seat which would do the
same<00:00:36.550> purpose<00:00:37.000> on<00:00:37.180> an<00:00:37.270> older<00:00:37.510> summit<00:00:38.020> stand<00:00:38.260> so

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
same purpose on an older summit stand so

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.799 
same purpose on an older summit stand so
that<00:00:38.620> keeps<00:00:38.800> that<00:00:39.149> nice<00:00:40.149> and<00:00:40.360> tight

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
that keeps that nice and tight

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.080 
that keeps that nice and tight
and<00:00:41.470> then<00:00:41.890> they<00:00:42.130> also<00:00:42.250> give<00:00:42.579> you<00:00:42.700> a<00:00:42.730> green

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
and then they also give you a green

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.700 
and then they also give you a green
strap<00:00:43.630> that<00:00:43.809> you<00:00:43.930> feels<00:00:44.200> like<00:00:44.260> a<00:00:44.380> buckle<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:45.820> I

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
strap that you feels like a buckle but I

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.900 
strap that you feels like a buckle but I
don't<00:00:47.710> like<00:00:47.800> to<00:00:47.920> use<00:00:47.950> that<00:00:48.100> because<00:00:48.430> one<00:00:48.760> it

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
don't like to use that because one it

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.660 
don't like to use that because one it
takes<00:00:49.090> too<00:00:49.270> much<00:00:49.390> time<00:00:49.450> and<00:00:49.980> -<00:00:50.980> it's<00:00:51.430> hard<00:00:51.640> to

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
takes too much time and - it's hard to

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.700 
takes too much time and - it's hard to
keep<00:00:51.850> tight<00:00:52.149> so<00:00:52.450> I<00:00:52.480> just<00:00:52.809> get<00:00:52.989> a<00:00:53.020> a<00:00:53.290> bungee<00:00:53.680> cord

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
keep tight so I just get a a bungee cord

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.220 
keep tight so I just get a a bungee cord
that<00:00:54.070> actually<00:00:54.430> fits<00:00:55.239> nicely<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:57.190> I<00:00:58.079> put<00:00:59.079> that

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
that actually fits nicely and I put that

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.880 
that actually fits nicely and I put that
together

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
together

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.770 
together
this<00:01:00.670> way<00:01:00.879> as<00:01:01.059> soon<00:01:01.239> as<00:01:01.300> I<00:01:01.329> get<00:01:01.450> this<00:01:01.600> stick

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
this way as soon as I get this stick

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.539 
this way as soon as I get this stick
made<00:01:04.780> it<00:01:04.869> just<00:01:05.049> comes<00:01:05.259> down<00:01:05.469> here<00:01:05.829> locks

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
made it just comes down here locks

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:07.980 
made it just comes down here locks
together<00:01:06.760> what<00:01:07.150> that<00:01:07.299> does<00:01:07.479> is<00:01:07.600> keeps<00:01:07.810> this

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
together what that does is keeps this

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.480 
together what that does is keeps this
top<00:01:08.260> part<00:01:08.500> from<00:01:08.710> kind<00:01:08.920> of<00:01:09.010> rattling<00:01:09.340> when

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
top part from kind of rattling when

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.609

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
with this thing and it's it's perfectly

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.530 
with this thing and it's it's perfectly
quiet<00:01:14.460> one<00:01:15.460> of<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.640> things<00:01:15.850> that<00:01:16.030> I<00:01:16.119> did<00:01:16.330> do

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
quiet one of the things that I did do

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.060 
quiet one of the things that I did do
which<00:01:16.930> is<00:01:17.080> there's<00:01:17.350> nice<00:01:17.590> features<00:01:18.040> that

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
which is there's nice features that

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.590 
which is there's nice features that
these<00:01:18.430> pads<00:01:18.729> are<00:01:19.979> zipper<00:01:20.979> based<00:01:21.570> rather<00:01:22.570> than

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
these pads are zipper based rather than

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.539 
these pads are zipper based rather than
zip<00:01:25.600> tie<00:01:25.780> based<00:01:26.049> so<00:01:26.860> one<00:01:27.010> of<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.159> things<00:01:27.400> that

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
zip tie based so one of the things that

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.810 
zip tie based so one of the things that
I<00:01:27.640> did<00:01:27.850> in<00:01:28.000> order<00:01:28.150> to<00:01:28.270> make<00:01:29.140> it<00:01:29.290> a<00:01:29.350> little<00:01:29.470> less

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
I did in order to make it a little less

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.210 
I did in order to make it a little less
loud<00:01:30.820> was<00:01:31.150> I<00:01:31.270> took<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:32.409> zipper<00:01:32.740> when<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:33.040> came

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
loud was I took the zipper when it came

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.710 
loud was I took the zipper when it came
on<00:01:33.250> this<00:01:33.549> treestand<00:01:34.000> it<00:01:34.150> was<00:01:34.240> down<00:01:34.420> on<00:01:34.450> this

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
on this treestand it was down on this

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.600 
on this treestand it was down on this
end<00:01:34.930> so<00:01:35.110> I<00:01:35.140> just<00:01:35.380> unzipped<00:01:36.009> it<00:01:36.159> flipped<00:01:36.490> it

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
end so I just unzipped it flipped it

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.550 
end so I just unzipped it flipped it
around<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:37.119> put<00:01:37.600> it<00:01:37.630> up<00:01:37.810> here<00:01:38.049> so<00:01:38.229> that<00:01:38.380> the

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
around and put it up here so that the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.620 
around and put it up here so that the
zipper<00:01:38.710> wouldn't<00:01:39.130> flip<00:01:39.280> around<00:01:39.430> and<00:01:39.820> hit<00:01:40.420> the

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
zipper wouldn't flip around and hit the

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.840 
zipper wouldn't flip around and hit the
actual<00:01:41.590> bottom<00:01:41.920> stand<00:01:42.159> but<00:01:42.340> then<00:01:42.460> I<00:01:42.549> just<00:01:42.729> took

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
actual bottom stand but then I just took

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.149 
actual bottom stand but then I just took
a<00:01:42.909> piece<00:01:43.150> of<00:01:43.270> duct<00:01:43.450> tape<00:01:43.509> and<00:01:43.960> duct<00:01:44.830> tape<00:01:44.979> that

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
a piece of duct tape and duct tape that

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.340 
a piece of duct tape and duct tape that
that<00:01:45.640> zipper<00:01:46.000> down<00:01:46.150> completely<00:01:46.689> so<00:01:46.930> that<00:01:47.259> it

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
that zipper down completely so that it

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.219 
that zipper down completely so that it
wouldn't<00:01:47.670> flip<00:01:48.670> and<00:01:48.820> make<00:01:48.939> any<00:01:49.090> noise<00:01:49.299> I'm

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.650 
just slides right in here and I always
get<00:02:02.250> my<00:02:02.400> thumb<00:02:02.610> down<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.030> here<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.480> just

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
get my thumb down on here and it just

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.600 
get my thumb down on here and it just
slides<00:02:03.900> in<00:02:04.110> like<00:02:04.260> that<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:05.220> locks<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.940> on<00:02:07.610> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
slides in like that and locks in on the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.200 
slides in like that and locks in on the
tree<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:09.350> always<00:02:10.350> like<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.740> get<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.820> stuck<00:02:12.060> on

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
tree I always like this get it stuck on

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:21.280 
tree I always like this get it stuck on
the<00:02:12.300> tree<00:02:12.500> like<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.740> because<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:20.460> then

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
the tree like that because it and then

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.420 
the tree like that because it and then
come<00:02:22.290> over<00:02:22.320> here<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:25.680> lock<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.070> into<00:02:26.220> the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
come over here and you lock it into the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.290 
come over here and you lock it into the
link<00:02:27.360> that<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.570> want<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.260> have<00:02:28.380> a

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
link that you want so that you have a

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.930 
link that you want so that you have a
decent<00:02:30.300> angle<00:02:30.600> for<00:02:31.160> climbing<00:02:32.160> but<00:02:32.340> again

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
decent angle for climbing but again

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.220 
decent angle for climbing but again
works<00:02:33.180> pretty<00:02:33.480> much<00:02:33.600> just<00:02:33.780> like<00:02:33.930> any<00:02:34.080> other

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
works pretty much just like any other

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.770 
works pretty much just like any other
summit<00:02:34.620> staying<00:02:34.830> if<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.070> ever<00:02:35.160> add<00:02:35.340> one

climbing with this tree stand works the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.920 
climbing with this tree stand works the
same<00:02:38.130> as<00:02:38.310> any<00:02:38.490> other<00:02:38.550> one<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.540> only<00:02:39.690> thing

that is really nice about this is the

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.770 
that is really nice about this is the
seat<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:43.370> much<00:02:44.370> more<00:02:44.610> quiet<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.300> much<00:02:45.570> more

your top for the tree stand in a
comfortable<00:03:15.300> spot<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:15.990> when<00:03:16.110> you're

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
comfortable spot so that when you're

comfortable spot so that when you're
sitting

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.760 

you're<00:03:19.510> not<00:03:19.660> gonna<00:03:19.780> have<00:03:19.990> the<00:03:20.020> front<00:03:20.560> of<00:03:20.650> this

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
you're not gonna have the front of this

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.440 
you're not gonna have the front of this
digging<00:03:21.190> into<00:03:21.310> your<00:03:21.400> legs<00:03:21.640> along<00:03:21.940> with<00:03:22.360> the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
digging into your legs along with the

digging into your legs along with the
sling<00:03:22.690> see<00:03:22.930> tits<00:03:23.080> look<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.560> little<00:03:23.860> different

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
sling see tits look a little different

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.500 
sling see tits look a little different
cuz<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:24.460> don't<00:03:24.520> have<00:03:24.670> any<00:03:24.820> adjustments<00:03:25.390> on

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
cuz you don't have any adjustments on

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.870 
cuz you don't have any adjustments on
there<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:25.900> takes<00:03:26.110> a<00:03:26.200> little<00:03:26.320> longer

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
there so it takes a little longer

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.650 
there so it takes a little longer
typically<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:28.910> like<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.150> get<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.810> point

as you can see when I'm sitting up here
you<00:03:46.019> don't<00:03:46.170> quite<00:03:46.349> have<00:03:46.409> as<00:03:46.709> much<00:03:46.860> spaces<00:03:47.489> some

version so if you finally get into a
comfortable<00:03:52.939> sitting<00:03:53.269> position<00:03:53.359> I<00:03:53.930> like<00:03:53.959> to

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
comfortable sitting position I like to

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.410 
comfortable sitting position I like to
keep<00:03:54.409> the<00:03:54.620> stand<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:55.280> that<00:03:55.459> my<00:03:56.150> knees<00:03:56.390> are

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
keep the stand so that my knees are

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.119 
keep the stand so that my knees are
pretty<00:03:56.719> close<00:03:57.049> to<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.319> bar<00:03:57.560> because<00:03:57.829> then

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
pretty close to the bar because then

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.770

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079

used<00:04:09.349> to<00:04:09.469> have<00:04:09.560> a<00:04:09.590> problem<00:04:10.040> with<00:04:10.129> the<00:04:10.219> shooting

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
used to have a problem with the shooting

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.849 
used to have a problem with the shooting
the<00:04:11.510> bow<00:04:11.719> would<00:04:11.870> hit<00:04:12.019> on<00:04:12.139> the<00:04:12.260> stand<00:04:12.500> as<00:04:12.739> you

most<00:05:20.860> at<00:05:21.860> this<00:05:22.039> stand<00:05:22.339> so<00:05:22.729> if<00:05:22.819> you're

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969 
most at this stand so if you're

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:24.969 
most at this stand so if you're

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
upgrading like I did there's a little

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.339 
upgrading like I did there's a little
buckle<00:05:25.309> down<00:05:25.459> here<00:05:25.869> and<00:05:26.869> it<00:05:27.110> just

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
buckle down here and it just

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:28.779 
buckle down here and it just
unbuckles<00:05:27.829> just<00:05:28.009> like<00:05:28.159> the<00:05:28.339> seats<00:05:28.579> from<00:05:28.699> the

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
unbuckles just like the seats from the

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.119 
unbuckles just like the seats from the
older<00:05:29.089> versions<00:05:29.449> of<00:05:29.569> stand<00:05:29.809> are<00:05:30.050> so<00:05:30.319> if<00:05:30.979> you

older versions of stand are so if you

it squeaks up against the tree I notice

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:54.069 
it squeaks up against the tree I notice
that<00:05:52.490> the<00:05:52.610> older<00:05:52.849> summit<00:05:53.179> Vipers<00:05:53.509> do<00:05:53.689> that<00:05:53.869> too

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:55.929 
that the older summit Vipers do that too
but<00:05:54.349> I<00:05:54.559> don't<00:05:54.889> know<00:05:55.069> if<00:05:55.129> it's<00:05:55.369> this<00:05:55.550> paint<00:05:55.849> that

00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:55.939 
but I don't know if it's this paint that

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.609 
but I don't know if it's this paint that
they<00:05:56.119> have<00:05:56.300> on<00:05:56.479> here<00:05:56.509> and<00:05:56.839> once<00:05:57.229> this<00:05:57.409> gets

00:05:57.609 --> 00:05:57.619 
they have on here and once this gets

00:05:57.619 --> 00:05:59.350 
they have on here and once this gets
worn<00:05:57.889> in<00:05:58.069> down<00:05:58.249> here<00:05:58.519> it'll<00:05:58.639> stop<00:05:58.879> doing<00:05:59.209> that

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
worn in down here it'll stop doing that

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.779 
worn in down here it'll stop doing that
but<00:05:59.629> that's<00:06:00.439> the<00:06:00.619> only<00:06:00.709> that's<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:01.579> only

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:01.789 
but that's the only that's the only

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:03.429 
but that's the only that's the only
thing<00:06:01.999> that<00:06:02.179> really<00:06:02.419> drives<00:06:02.990> me<00:06:03.169> crazy

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:03.439 
thing that really drives me crazy

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:05.049 
thing that really drives me crazy
occasionally<00:06:04.129> is<00:06:04.219> when<00:06:04.399> I<00:06:04.429> get<00:06:04.639> into<00:06:04.789> a<00:06:04.879> real

00:06:05.049 --> 00:06:05.059
