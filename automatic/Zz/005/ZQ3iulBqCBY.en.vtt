00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.090 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.350 

I<00:00:07.350> was<00:00:08.350> going<00:00:08.590> to<00:00:08.680> do<00:00:08.770> this<00:00:08.920> review<00:00:09.640> with<00:00:09.910> some

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
I was going to do this review with some

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.240 
I was going to do this review with some
actual<00:00:10.630> gameplay<00:00:11.080> footage<00:00:11.559> but<00:00:11.980> since

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.250 
actual gameplay footage but since

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.000 
actual gameplay footage but since
YouTube<00:00:13.210> recently<00:00:13.510> declined<00:00:14.170> my<00:00:14.380> application

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.010 
YouTube recently declined my application

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.890 
YouTube recently declined my application
to<00:00:15.070> become<00:00:15.190> a<00:00:15.310> partner<00:00:15.640> because<00:00:15.880> I<00:00:16.090> had<00:00:16.450> video

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
to become a partner because I had video

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.940 
to become a partner because I had video
of<00:00:16.960> video<00:00:17.650> games<00:00:18.010> being<00:00:18.460> played<00:00:19.110> I'm<00:00:20.110> not<00:00:20.410> so

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
of video games being played I'm not so

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.440 
of video games being played I'm not so
you<00:00:21.010> just<00:00:21.160> get<00:00:21.310> a<00:00:21.340> picture<00:00:21.580> of<00:00:21.880> the<00:00:22.000> Skyrim

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
you just get a picture of the Skyrim

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.900 
you just get a picture of the Skyrim
logo<00:00:22.920> which<00:00:23.920> is<00:00:24.010> probably<00:00:24.250> all<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:24.670> better

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
logo which is probably all the better

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.000 
logo which is probably all the better
because<00:00:25.000> the<00:00:25.480> Skyrim<00:00:25.960> visuals<00:00:26.470> are<00:00:26.619> kind<00:00:26.890> of

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
because the Skyrim visuals are kind of

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.750 
because the Skyrim visuals are kind of
sucky<00:00:27.520> at<00:00:27.880> least<00:00:28.300> on<00:00:28.480> the<00:00:28.630> Xbox<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:30.279> Xbox

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
sucky at least on the Xbox the Xbox

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.510 
sucky at least on the Xbox the Xbox
suffers<00:00:31.330> from<00:00:31.720> some<00:00:32.529> definite<00:00:33.040> issues<00:00:33.370> when

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
suffers from some definite issues when

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.299 
suffers from some definite issues when
you're<00:00:33.640> playing<00:00:33.910> Skyrim<00:00:34.750> the<00:00:35.140> pc<00:00:35.620> version<00:00:35.650> is

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
you're playing Skyrim the pc version is

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.430 
you're playing Skyrim the pc version is
probably<00:00:37.000> a<00:00:37.120> much<00:00:37.390> better<00:00:37.720> version<00:00:38.199> of<00:00:38.290> the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
probably a much better version of the

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.380 
probably a much better version of the
game<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:39.010> having<00:00:39.190> played<00:00:39.489> both<00:00:39.760> i<00:00:40.030> would<00:00:40.180> say

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
game and having played both i would say

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.440 
game and having played both i would say
that<00:00:40.690> if<00:00:41.230> you<00:00:41.440> have<00:00:41.680> both<00:00:41.950> platforms<00:00:42.450> pick

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
that if you have both platforms pick

this up on the pc not on the xbox 360
the<00:00:48.040> pc<00:00:48.430> version<00:00:48.460> of<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:49.000> game<00:00:49.180> has<00:00:49.600> its<00:00:49.930> own

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
the pc version of the game has its own

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.229 
the pc version of the game has its own
problems<00:00:50.469> the<00:00:50.890> faces<00:00:51.190> are<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.520> little<00:00:51.670> blocking

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
problems the faces are a little blocking

some<00:00:52.390> of<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.510> textures<00:00:53.020> are<00:00:53.170> over<00:00:53.410> compressed

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
some of the textures are over compressed

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.920 
some of the textures are over compressed
but<00:00:54.790> for<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.000> most<00:00:55.149> part<00:00:55.239> it<00:00:55.450> plays<00:00:55.660> pretty

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
but for the most part it plays pretty

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.810 
but for the most part it plays pretty
well<00:00:56.200> and<00:00:56.469> the<00:00:56.680> environment<00:00:57.460> in<00:00:57.790> general

advantage<00:03:00.639> of<00:03:00.760> this<00:03:00.939> was<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:01.389> when<00:03:01.510> he

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
advantage of this was that when he

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.089 
advantage of this was that when he

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
prepared is a much better experience on

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.820 
prepared is a much better experience on
the<00:04:26.950> pc<00:04:27.340> than<00:04:27.610> it<00:04:27.700> is<00:04:27.789> on<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:28.029> xbox<00:04:28.510> but<00:04:29.500> the

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
the pc than it is on the xbox but the

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.850 
the pc than it is on the xbox but the
controls<00:04:30.340> on<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:31.210> pc<00:04:31.659> are<00:04:32.020> gimped<00:04:32.529> by<00:04:32.680> the

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
controls on the pc are gimped by the

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.260 
controls on the pc are gimped by the
fact<00:04:33.039> that<00:04:33.219> they've<00:04:33.370> made<00:04:33.400> them<00:04:33.849> basically

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
fact that they've made them basically

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.089 
fact that they've made them basically
the<00:04:34.479> same<00:04:34.659> as<00:04:34.870> they<00:04:34.990> were<00:04:35.050> on<00:04:35.229> the<00:04:35.349> Xbox<00:04:35.830> so

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
the same as they were on the Xbox so

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.159 
the same as they were on the Xbox so
probably<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.610> best<00:04:36.789> thing<00:04:36.909> to<00:04:37.060> do<00:04:37.240> is<00:04:37.750> play<00:04:38.050> on

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
probably the best thing to do is play on

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.270 
probably the best thing to do is play on
the<00:04:38.259> pc<00:04:38.650> using<00:04:39.099> an<00:04:39.310> xbox<00:04:39.759> controller
