00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.270
 here is the dance I heard that some 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.370
 apart it's not one in what would be 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.870
 very healthy 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:15.570
 occasionally we can see it 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:19.500
 there is not a very defined here as 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.300
 above even though she is on the internet 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.710
 but it is different from what 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.429
 what is being done here appalaches bosnia the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.050
 romania so I'm going I'm going 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.670

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.469
 impresses putting the music here 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.469
 so I heard that somewhere 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:56.789
 Border Coach 2 or 3 3 zigzag to 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.399
 what war 4.5 5.5 have fallen from 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.969
 right knee bent numbers that's 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:08.479
 pretty much a rotation a movement 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:16.100
 fast and a new start 2 3 3 3 4 4 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:16.100
 4.5 5.5 knee knee as soon as a rotation 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.220

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.500

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.880
 have made the bar this passion of the 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.880
 music 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.170

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.510
 noses 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
 j 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.710
 g 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.010
