00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 The house is all right with you, here it is. 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.410
 daiane oliveira and today I'll teach you 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.440
 to draw the elza of the frozen step a 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.670
 step that frozen princess of the 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.670
 disney america 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.120
 let's start 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.420
 so let's start by the sketch 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.850
 and do not do 15 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.700
 now we already have this circle to 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:33.680
 people are going to walk here the rest of the format 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:37.010
 of the face of the body is the 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.400
 and here where you will begin to ear 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.270
 she 's just a little beauty people 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.460
 already has the first base of her head 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.320
 Here now I will mark the where will 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.910
 nose to mouth and eyes and 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:59.410
 her hair to put some 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.410
 I came here to address her speech 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.729
 only now that I have this sketch 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.740
 initial 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.110
 I'll leave it to who you are 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.690
 you are doing on paper or you can 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.100
 a light table or you can wake up a 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.380
 Bit by rubber 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.590
 so the computer is just letting you read more 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.750
 weak and put the law on top now that 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.750
 I will begin to tell the eye causes it 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.450
 I'll do the eyebrow is it 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.060
 first I will make the mark that has the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.560
 their eyes and even doing makeup 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:47.790
 coc teaching school 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:49.860
 now I'm going to make her husband forever 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.720
 playing fairly quietly today is 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.130
 a reference because it is a character 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:07.950
 very delicate and I'll ever get 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:09.720
 her second eye during the drawing 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.480
 I see something that 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.850
 It bothers me, I really go and do the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:24.570
 and that's not even 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:31.739
 redesigning always provides a bit of 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:34.200
 this eye here is a little bit of it and if 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.420
 created a 3d character in the character 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.100
 when we are doing it 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.870
 in 1-1 with the different pt is 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.840
 building something that we are seeing 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.850
 without lines turning into something with 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.850
 lines is a beautiful exercise too. 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:05.120
 as I go by adjusting format of the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:09.910
 face of elza and today I'm starting to 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.910
 make the hair contour with the head 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:20.120
 who set fire to some lines to 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:29.090
 give the illusion these hairs to 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:31.400
 give a better volume to start making the 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.790
 braid she has on her head 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.239
 this part was always has a sound in 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.730
 each stroke well positioned 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.040
 basically are several stars that you 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.890
 misses deadlines that have the format of 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.230
 file you are positioning and france 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.810
 is taking shape and here it is going to do 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.760
 some traits to give that allusion to the 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:04:08.690
 hair volume a kind of 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:10.910
 in the hair I gave this trait 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.900
 the overall volume announced a 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.489
 hair is always in the right direction 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:22.660
 be smart about this not to 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.660
 lose to not lose the pace of France 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.320
 just now we have the top neighbors 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.320
 in this line of drawing 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.190
 now I'm going to put some scale 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:05:03.110
 of gray so we can see 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:05:05.630
 better this elza at the base of the drawing 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.479
 got ready now you can make the 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.580
 difference in coloring what you prefer 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:13.070
 did you have trouble drawing the 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.889
 elza if yes maybe you need 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.780
 exercise your perception a little more 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.970
 I wrote a book with 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.550
