is a quick game of World of Tanks where
I<00:00:05.700> try<00:00:05.970> using<00:00:06.180> high-explosive<00:00:06.990> shells<00:00:07.230> with

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
I try using high-explosive shells with

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.020 
I try using high-explosive shells with
the<00:00:07.680> m2<00:00:08.010> medium<00:00:08.400> tank<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:10.160> can<00:00:11.160> being<00:00:11.460> used<00:00:11.759> as

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
the m2 medium tank I can being used as

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.140 
the m2 medium tank I can being used as
the<00:00:12.179> 75<00:00:12.660> millimeter<00:00:13.080> howitzer<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.920> this<00:00:14.910> map

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
the 75 millimeter howitzer and this map

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.080 
the 75 millimeter howitzer and this map
is<00:00:15.330> called<00:00:15.360> malinovka

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.520 

some<00:00:21.090> distinguishing<00:00:21.570> features<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.200> this<00:00:22.290> map

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.530 
some distinguishing features of this map

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.120 
some distinguishing features of this map
is<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:23.330> going<00:00:24.330> straight<00:00:24.960> forward<00:00:25.410> into<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
is that going straight forward into the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.590 
is that going straight forward into the
middle<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.730> lab<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.780> suicide<00:00:29.030> at<00:00:30.030> least<00:00:30.240> for<00:00:30.480> me

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
middle of lab is suicide at least for me

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.490 
middle of lab is suicide at least for me
anyway

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.620 

so<00:00:37.040> instead<00:00:37.280> of<00:00:37.340> going<00:00:37.700> into<00:00:37.970> the<00:00:38.150> middle<00:00:38.300> or

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
so instead of going into the middle or

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.360 
so instead of going into the middle or
camping<00:00:39.490> behind<00:00:40.490> some<00:00:40.790> houses<00:00:41.390> or<00:00:41.960> walls<00:00:42.860> I'll

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
camping behind some houses or walls I'll

00:00:43.370 --> 00:01:06.679 
camping behind some houses or walls I'll
try<00:00:43.760> to<00:00:43.820> flank<00:00:44.210> them<00:00:44.800> on<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:46.100> right<00:00:46.310> side

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.080 

now<00:01:07.200> 75<00:01:07.649> millimeter<00:01:08.039> howitzer<00:01:08.219> on<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.850> tank

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
now 75 millimeter howitzer on this tank

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.859 
now 75 millimeter howitzer on this tank
is<00:01:10.009> not<00:01:11.009> very<00:01:11.249> accurate<00:01:12.679> so<00:01:14.450> I'm<00:01:15.450> gonna<00:01:15.600> try

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
is not very accurate so I'm gonna try

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.719 
is not very accurate so I'm gonna try
pushing<00:01:16.259> forward<00:01:18.469> to<00:01:19.469> get<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.649> bit<00:01:19.829> closer<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.340> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
pushing forward to get a bit closer so I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:49.790 
pushing forward to get a bit closer so I
can<00:01:20.759> take<00:01:21.060> some<00:01:21.119> shots<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:22.729> enemy<00:01:23.729> tanks

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.470 

so<00:01:50.800> there<00:01:50.980> we<00:01:51.100> go<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.280> beefy<00:01:52.090> sounding<00:01:52.690> shot<00:01:53.020> for

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
so there we go a beefy sounding shot for

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.760 
so there we go a beefy sounding shot for
practically<00:01:55.770> 80%<00:01:56.770> of<00:01:57.010> the<00:01:58.410> hazard<00:01:59.410> to<00:01:59.590> his

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
practically 80% of the hazard to his

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:13.010 
practically 80% of the hazard to his
health

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.360 

and<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:14.130> usually<00:02:14.490> play<00:02:14.700> tank<00:02:14.940> destroyers<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:16.370> he

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
and I usually play tank destroyers so he

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.310 
and I usually play tank destroyers so he
was<00:02:17.490> my<00:02:17.610> attempt<00:02:18.000> at<00:02:18.060> sniping<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:24.170> still<00:02:25.170> got

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
was my attempt at sniping I still got

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.090 
was my attempt at sniping I still got
the<00:02:25.470> guy<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.340> was<00:02:26.760> pretty<00:02:27.000> surprised<00:02:28.100> at

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
the guy but I was pretty surprised at

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.400 
the guy but I was pretty surprised at
how<00:02:29.340> far<00:02:31.760> I'm<00:02:32.760> pretty<00:02:32.790> sure

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.370 

over<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.740> mist<00:02:35.980> several<00:02:36.460> more<00:02:36.640> times<00:02:37.170> if<00:02:38.170> not

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
over the mist several more times if not

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:53.970 
over the mist several more times if not
for<00:02:38.620> love

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.590 

of<00:02:54.980> course<00:02:55.220> I'm<00:02:55.760> getting<00:02:55.970> quite<00:02:56.390> a<00:02:56.510> few

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
of course I'm getting quite a few

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.460 
of course I'm getting quite a few
long-range<00:02:57.530> shots<00:02:57.800> at<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.130> moment<00:03:01.300> so<00:03:02.470> seems

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
long-range shots at the moment so seems

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:11.500 
long-range shots at the moment so seems
I'm<00:03:03.770> very<00:03:04.010> lucky<00:03:04.190> in<00:03:04.430> this<00:03:04.700> game<00:03:09.910> not<00:03:10.910> true<00:03:11.210> for

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
I'm very lucky in this game not true for

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:26.810 
I'm very lucky in this game not true for
moving<00:03:12.080> targets<00:03:12.620> though

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.910 

I'm<00:03:27.820> assuming<00:03:28.180> that<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.720> t57<00:03:29.350> hasn't<00:03:29.800> moved

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
I'm assuming that the t57 hasn't moved

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.150 
I'm assuming that the t57 hasn't moved
from<00:03:30.100> his<00:03:30.250> current<00:03:30.460> spot<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.590> sort<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:32.920> blind

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
from his current spot so I sort of blind

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.260 
from his current spot so I sort of blind
firing<00:03:33.430> into<00:03:33.820> there<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:35.160> miss<00:03:36.160> both<00:03:36.340> shots<00:03:36.670> so

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
firing into there and miss both shots so

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.410 
firing into there and miss both shots so
I'm<00:03:37.540> gonna<00:03:37.630> keep<00:03:37.840> moving<00:03:38.260> just<00:03:39.070> in<00:03:39.310> case<00:03:39.550> he's

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
I'm gonna keep moving just in case he's

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.970 
I'm gonna keep moving just in case he's
going<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.720> be<00:03:40.810> looking<00:03:41.140> in<00:03:41.500> my<00:03:41.650> general

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
going to be looking in my general

00:03:41.980 --> 00:04:03.540 
going to be looking in my general
direction

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.830 

so<00:04:04.150> there's<00:04:04.300> a<00:04:04.420> t57<00:04:04.960> again<00:04:05.350> not<00:04:05.560> looking<00:04:06.840> so

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
so there's a t57 again not looking so

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:15.080 
so there's a t57 again not looking so
take<00:04:08.500> a<00:04:08.530> chance<00:04:08.770> and<00:04:08.980> shoot<00:04:09.340> him<00:04:09.460> and<00:04:09.990> kill<00:04:11.100> it

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.370 

here's<00:04:16.090> another<00:04:16.209> guy<00:04:16.540> and<00:04:16.810> I<00:04:16.959> take<00:04:17.260> a<00:04:17.290> chance

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
here's another guy and I take a chance

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.760 
here's another guy and I take a chance
at<00:04:17.890> shooting<00:04:18.459> a<00:04:18.520> moving<00:04:18.850> target<00:04:19.200> got<00:04:20.200> lucky

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:20.770 
at shooting a moving target got lucky

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:41.760 
at shooting a moving target got lucky
killed<00:04:21.130> him<00:04:21.280> in<00:04:21.400> one<00:04:21.549> shot<00:04:21.760> as<00:04:21.850> well

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.399 

here<00:04:42.770> I'm<00:04:42.919> using<00:04:42.949> a<00:04:43.400> bit<00:04:43.639> of<00:04:43.669> a<00:04:43.849> dip<00:04:44.060> for

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
here I'm using a bit of a dip for

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:49.439 
here I'm using a bit of a dip for
additional<00:04:45.409> cover<00:04:46.750> almost<00:04:47.750> killed<00:04:48.139> the<00:04:48.259> t46

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
additional cover almost killed the t46

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.480 
additional cover almost killed the t46
and<00:04:50.449> somebody<00:04:51.439> else<00:04:51.560> gets<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:52.039> blast<00:04:52.280> you

and somebody else gets the blast you
left<00:04:52.969> it

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.780
