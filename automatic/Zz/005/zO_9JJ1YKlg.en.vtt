00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.299
 mana welcome to a new content of 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.340
 gamers tv and then we have a 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.740
 special because although this is nothing 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.910
 go playstation 4 planet there's a lot 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.949
 band that is still going to stay 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.630
 clinging to his playstation 3 and put together 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.000
 to your friend because there are very good titles 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.710
 exclusive big planet and that's why they 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.930
 we prepare this special with the top ten 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.489
 of the best exclusive games that 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.890
 we saw in this console clinging to a 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.329
 excellent excellent console and that 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.340
 still with a couple of years of life 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.730
 it is clear I think that in Mexico up 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.160
 36 million the transition is going to be a 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.930
 Direct little I know there are bands that just 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.640
 trying amps and without three and it's because 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.970
 that we made our list 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.800
 especially because there are the arts and 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.829
 the big planet books' if the net band 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.690
 is that if they did not enter the play 3 ar 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.280
 in his time being in very good time 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.450
 not very good time especially because 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.239
 right now is this line of 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.280
 playstation favorites and that lamp 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.530
 are also the price of the 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.090
 Playstation 3 line is very competitive and 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.219
 I'm sure specifically in 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.420
 these Christmas holidays will be of the 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:16.310
 things the most wanted because there 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.229
 great exclusive titles 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.060
 also this great tourism for this or not 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.000
 kuni as well says a charter 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.950
 plastics and bouquet that we can say of 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.590
 hardware that I stay in particular 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.020
 with the third installment like that but I do not know 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.189
 say more let's see the best titles 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.890
 of playstation 3 and we are seeing them 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:41.179
 special gamers the best games of the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.460
 Playstation 3 after the resounding success 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.399
 and popularity of the play 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.649
 station 1 and 2 it was expected that the third 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.229
 sony console will continue with said 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.659
 success from the beginning but had a 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.149
 I start a little slow since its high 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.069
 cost and tough competition did 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.250
 that his first months were not the 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.380
 better for them they still managed 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.619
 recover and they showed that theirs 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.869
 are the video games it was complicated the 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.849
 choice but here is our list of 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.049
 the best exclusive games of the 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:17.120
 playstation 3 with charter 2 is not only 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:20.120
 one of the best street games 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.370
 but also of the generation made 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.330
 for the study this game has not been 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.550
 demonstrated what the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.710
 I was only able to do with graphics 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.260
 first level and an entertaining story 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.360
 he became the envy of many 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.370
 hollywood producers 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.410
 if in itself the hardware games 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.200
 had been spectacular in the 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.060
 playstation 2 the third installment exceeded 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.520
 our expectations with the big 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.410
 battles against the giants leading the 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.750
 credit history up to the highest 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.050
 from olympus where there is no one who 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.790
 I managed to get off that career so it's not 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.250
 there is a better simulator than the great tourism 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.530
 a series that has not lacked in any 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.690
 sound console in the fifth installment 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.550
 the best technology was used 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.830
 moment achieving that each of 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.580
 we became a pilot 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.040
 professional 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.620
 It was a difficult decision as to 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.990
 shooting games but that are still two 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.420
 It is our choice as the best 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.550
 this generation was the perfect test 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.070
 that not only do you need to have 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.500
 amazing graphics but also a 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.630
 entertaining gameplay that keeps us 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.800
 immersed in their levels for hours and 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.200
 hours 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.330
 hideo kojima did his thing once 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.300
 more and he gave us one of his works 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.060
 teachers in metal gear solid 4 guns of 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.010
 the patriots is a game that captivated us 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.380
 both for its history and for its great 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.930
 production quality the study the 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.580
 game company had already shown us what 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.770
 relaxing that could be the 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.990
 videogames with flower but it was in 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.150
 journey where they really expanded the 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.430
 concept and they gave us one of the 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.140
 better experiences where they are not 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.910
 necessary dialogues for 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.150
 communicate with others 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.160
 the littlebigplanet series changed by 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.110
 complete the way to play the titles 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.660
 of platforms because of all the 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.760
 content generated by users and 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.860
 it was the second part that expanded the 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.940
 concept where you could create games 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.850
 whole 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.959
 generous your community continues in 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.199
 increase 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.000
 of the tapas took us in a depressing 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:25.449
 but spectacular journey through 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.580
 survival he and joel must overcome 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.280
 all the obstacles by the decadence 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.300
 of civilization to discover if 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.479
 to live in this world is worth it 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.460
 what would I do if I suddenly had 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.650
 superpowers that we discovered in the 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.020
 game of prevented where we could 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.389
 explore a whole city of 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.819
 very entertaining way I depend on you 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:51.479
 using those powers for good or 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:53.789
 for evil and to close I could not 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.889
 missing a good Japanese role - playing game the 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.379
 better than we saw was the case of not even 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:01.319
 kuni developed by level fight in 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:03.240

 several more years of life playstation 3 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.870
 will continue to have games that 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.659

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.340
