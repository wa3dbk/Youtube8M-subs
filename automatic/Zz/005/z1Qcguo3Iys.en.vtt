hey guys thank you for tuning it again
and<00:00:03.770> today<00:00:04.770> we're<00:00:05.520> looking<00:00:05.730> at<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.240> dark<00:00:06.750> of

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
and today we're looking at the dark of

the moon deluxe class record topspin now
this<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.210> one<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.719> my<00:00:13.349> favorite<00:00:14.210> records<00:00:15.210> out

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
this is one of my favorite records out

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.460 
this is one of my favorite records out
of<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.260> three<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.850> just<00:00:17.850> love<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.960> mechanized

of the three I just love the mechanized

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.750 
of the three I just love the mechanized
look<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.689> versus<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.779> other<00:00:21.869> one<00:00:22.519> was<00:00:23.519> kind

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
look to it versus the other one was kind

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.509 
look to it versus the other one was kind
of<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:23.939> more<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.269> plane<00:00:24.570> NASCAR<00:00:25.310> this<00:00:26.310> one

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
of just more of a plane NASCAR this one

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.290 
of just more of a plane NASCAR this one
definitely<00:00:26.849> takes<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.869> cake<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.970> he<00:00:29.970> comes

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
definitely takes the cake and he comes

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.290 
definitely takes the cake and he comes
with<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.810> course<00:00:30.990> his<00:00:31.199> mechtech<00:00:31.650> weapon<00:00:32.070> which

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
with of course his mechtech weapon which

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.810 
with of course his mechtech weapon which
just<00:00:33.300> kind<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.719> like<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> claw<00:00:34.290> weapon<00:00:37.820> again

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
just kind of like a claw weapon again

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.330 
just kind of like a claw weapon again
not<00:00:39.000> too<00:00:39.180> big<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> Mech<00:00:39.780> Tech<00:00:39.809> weapons<00:00:40.350> now

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
not too big on the Mech Tech weapons now

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.610 
not too big on the Mech Tech weapons now
his<00:00:41.670> size<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.149> actually<00:00:42.570> fairly<00:00:42.899> good<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> mean

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
his size is actually fairly good I mean

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.580 
his size is actually fairly good I mean
next<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.070> premium<00:00:45.030> bumblebee<00:00:45.750> he's<00:00:46.230> not

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
next to the premium bumblebee he's not

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.279 
next to the premium bumblebee he's not
that<00:00:46.770> much<00:00:46.950> smaller<00:00:47.730> they<00:00:48.690> actually<00:00:48.840> fit

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
that much smaller they actually fit

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.220 
that much smaller they actually fit
perfectly<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.890> scale<00:00:50.129> i<00:00:50.160> think<00:00:51.230> his

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
perfectly in scale i think his

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.740 
perfectly in scale i think his
transformation<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:53.100> actually<00:00:53.910> very<00:00:53.940> simple<00:00:54.480> i

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
transformation is actually very simple i

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.049 
transformation is actually very simple i
mean<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.160> actually<00:00:56.309> transform<00:00:56.789> with<00:00:56.969> all

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
mean you can actually transform with all

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.729 
mean you can actually transform with all
these<00:00:57.180> cannons<00:00:57.690> attached<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.170> them<00:00:58.289> what<00:00:58.620> you

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
these cannons attached to them what you

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.319 
these cannons attached to them what you
want<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.190> first<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.609> take<00:00:59.820> up<00:01:00.000> this

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
want to do is first you take up this

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.529 
want to do is first you take up this
right<00:01:00.629> here<00:01:00.949> kind<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.070> fold<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.579> up<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.059> bend

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
they actually become very solid in a

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.240 
they actually become very solid in a
very<00:01:48.750> interesting<00:01:49.049> way<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.530> fold<00:01:50.100> down<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
very interesting way you fold down the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.789 
very interesting way you fold down the
foot<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.810> take<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.350> fold

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
foot like so and you take this and fold

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.859 
foot like so and you take this and fold
it<00:01:52.979> up<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.659> there<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:54.780> his<00:01:55.259> foot<00:01:55.619> and

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
it up and there you have his foot and

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.330 
it up and there you have his foot and
for<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> other<00:01:58.110> foot<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.439> just<00:01:58.829> take<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.219> down

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
for the other foot you just take it down

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.319 
for the other foot you just take it down
like<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.149> rotate<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.840> upward<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.670> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
like so and rotate this upward so you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.679 
like so and rotate this upward so you
have<00:02:03.450> us<00:02:03.570> feet<00:02:04.700> very<00:02:05.700> interesting<00:02:06.360> how<00:02:06.509> they

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
have us feet very interesting how they

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.850 
have us feet very interesting how they
incorporated<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.530> into<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
incorporated that into the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.960 
incorporated that into the
transformation<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:10.830> next<00:02:11.160> part<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.580> mean<00:02:11.730> it

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
transformation the next part I mean it

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.790 
transformation the next part I mean it
gets<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.300> little<00:02:12.420> bit<00:02:12.599> easier

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
gets a little bit easier

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.090 
gets a little bit easier
I come<00:02:14.040> up<00:02:14.190> here<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.490> his<00:02:14.940> arms<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.860> just<00:02:16.860> take

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
I come up here to his arms and just take

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.540 
I come up here to his arms and just take
those<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.580> like<00:02:17.820> this<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:19.100> fold<00:02:20.100> them<00:02:20.250> down<00:02:20.310> to

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
those in like this and fold them down to

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.170 
those in like this and fold them down to
the<00:02:20.640> side<00:02:20.880> like<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.880> then<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:23.970> want<00:02:24.060> to

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
the side like so and then you want to

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.360 
the side like so and then you want to
come<00:02:24.360> up<00:02:24.390> here<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.340> actually<00:02:26.520> want<00:02:27.360> to

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
come up here and you actually want to

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.270 
come up here and you actually want to
split<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:29.580> at<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> top<00:02:30.120> like<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.560> you

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
split this at the top like so and you

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.470 
split this at the top like so and you
have<00:02:32.460> that<00:02:32.670> going<00:02:32.910> on<00:02:33.290> it's<00:02:34.290> like<00:02:34.380> giant<00:02:34.830> wings

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
have that going on it's like giant wings

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.260 
have that going on it's like giant wings
the<00:02:36.480> ones<00:02:36.660> here<00:02:36.780> there<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.440> allows<00:02:37.710> you<00:02:37.860> to

rotate<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.110> downward<00:02:43.440> like<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:46.280> rotate

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
rotate it downward like so and rotate

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.500 
rotate it downward like so and rotate
his<00:02:47.430> shoulder<00:02:48.080> rotate<00:02:49.080> downward<00:02:49.410> like<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.510> and
