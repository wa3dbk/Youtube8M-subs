00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.740
 water with green dye 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.520

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:25.730

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.730
 Corinthian will vote for him 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.990
 ae 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:56.240
 it's no longer pre sense I 've been locked here 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.670
 Because we're good, right? Who does not want to? 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.469
 right of way 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:06.380
 the ball is now we put the water 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:35.890
 as green parati was fired green only 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:03:00.670
 I'll train because the leave because 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:03:00.670
 here is now 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.700
 down the hunt 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.269
 it's a honey rate 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.269
 the rain 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:32.040
 and there everything is not staying yet is not 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:33.299
 Exit explains trad attack is not 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:54.260
 computed 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:54.260
 I left the talk not to close on low 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:27.590
 the rest but me is equal the eyeos to him 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:30.190
 now the alcohol that looks like juice 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.190
 orange 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:38.770
 We will not use the osei booker. 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.770
 because the time since kaka 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:05:03.740
 I talked about this, I'm just calling one of the 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:11.300
 angles or never 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:15.820
 so you just click there it 's a charade 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.820
 it's not for me 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:38.909
 and there was four points wherever 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.180
 use 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:51.460
 I do not care, I 'll go up. 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:53.710
 Look at the water here. Look here here. 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.379
 seems to mix a little but it 's duty 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.449
 of foresight because I do not know anymore 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:00.310
 mix a little here but it's because the 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.849
 cup was too high and we did not have 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.460
 glucose is only 350 ml 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.990
 So we dump here but it seems 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.199
 he is mixing alone and is 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:15.789
 bubbling more became orange red 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:21.629
 that does not look like a green and orange that 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:21.629
 got the bye glucose won the required
