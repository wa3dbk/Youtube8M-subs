to<00:00:19.119> assemble<00:00:19.449> our<00:00:19.630> ingredients<00:00:20.259> I<00:00:20.439> have<00:00:20.740> the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
to assemble our ingredients I have the

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.980 
to assemble our ingredients I have the
outside<00:00:21.400> of<00:00:21.580> a<00:00:21.640> bag<00:00:21.849> which<00:00:22.330> I'm<00:00:22.480> using<00:00:22.660> as<00:00:22.839> my

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
outside of a bag which I'm using as my

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.470 
outside of a bag which I'm using as my
base<00:00:23.230> to<00:00:23.980> open<00:00:24.429> prints<00:00:24.789> and<00:00:25.029> you<00:00:25.179> can<00:00:25.330> use

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
base to open prints and you can use

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.419 
base to open prints and you can use
solid<00:00:25.900> colors<00:00:26.169> if<00:00:26.289> you<00:00:26.410> want<00:00:26.589> and<00:00:26.800> I<00:00:27.220> are<00:00:27.339> not

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:27.429 
solid colors if you want and I are not

solid colors if you want and I are not
interfacing<00:00:28.029> I'm<00:00:28.630> gonna<00:00:28.749> make<00:00:28.869> a<00:00:28.900> really

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
interfacing I'm gonna make a really

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.470 
interfacing I'm gonna make a really
basic<00:00:29.380> pattern<00:00:30.009> for<00:00:30.189> an<00:00:30.249> applique<00:00:30.669> one<00:00:31.329> of<00:00:31.419> my

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
basic pattern for an applique one of my

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.790 
basic pattern for an applique one of my
applications<00:00:31.929> is<00:00:31.990> going<00:00:32.140> to<00:00:32.200> be<00:00:32.290> a<00:00:32.320> heart<00:00:32.590> so

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
applications is going to be a heart so

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.110 
applications is going to be a heart so
I'm<00:00:32.860> going<00:00:33.010> to<00:00:33.040> fold<00:00:33.340> a<00:00:33.460> piece<00:00:33.579> of<00:00:33.760> paper<00:00:33.880> in

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
I'm going to fold a piece of paper in

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.970 
I'm going to fold a piece of paper in
half<00:00:34.300> I<00:00:34.660> already<00:00:34.930> have<00:00:35.050> half<00:00:35.289> a<00:00:35.500> heart<00:00:35.530> drawn

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
half I already have half a heart drawn

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.100 
half I already have half a heart drawn
on<00:00:36.129> it<00:00:36.180> just<00:00:37.180> a<00:00:37.239> piece<00:00:37.390> of<00:00:37.539> scrap<00:00:37.780> paper<00:00:37.809> and

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
on it just a piece of scrap paper and

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.740 
on it just a piece of scrap paper and
I'm<00:00:38.590> going<00:00:38.710> to<00:00:38.739> cut<00:00:38.920> it<00:00:39.039> out<00:00:39.539> and<00:00:40.539> you<00:00:40.660> can

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
I'm going to cut it out and you can

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.420 
I'm going to cut it out and you can
really<00:00:40.960> do<00:00:41.109> any<00:00:41.410> shape<00:00:41.770> that<00:00:41.829> you<00:00:42.039> want

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
really do any shape that you want

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.920 
really do any shape that you want
hearts<00:00:42.789> pretty<00:00:43.059> easy<00:00:43.239> when<00:00:43.449> I<00:00:43.510> start<00:00:43.780> with

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
hearts pretty easy when I start with

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.990 
hearts pretty easy when I start with
because<00:00:44.140> it's<00:00:44.379> pretty<00:00:44.770> basic<00:00:44.980> but<00:00:45.430> you<00:00:45.879> can

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
because it's pretty basic but you can

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.220 
because it's pretty basic but you can
get<00:00:46.090> pretty<00:00:46.239> detailed<00:00:46.480> with<00:00:46.750> appliques<00:00:47.199> or

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
get pretty detailed with appliques or

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.779 
get pretty detailed with appliques or
just<00:00:47.500> take<00:00:47.649> a<00:00:47.680> little<00:00:47.890> longer<00:00:48.129> for<00:00:48.760> example

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
just take a little longer for example

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.119 
just take a little longer for example
I'm<00:00:49.480> going<00:00:49.719> to<00:00:49.809> do<00:00:49.960> a<00:00:50.289> pair<00:00:50.769> of<00:00:50.800> eighth<00:00:51.010> notes

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
I'm going to do a pair of eighth notes

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.490 
I'm going to do a pair of eighth notes
for<00:00:51.460> my<00:00:51.550> second<00:00:52.000> applique<00:00:52.390> I<00:00:52.629> went<00:00:53.199> ahead<00:00:53.260> and

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
for my second applique I went ahead and

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.889 
for my second applique I went ahead and
cut<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.739> second<00:00:54.010> applique<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:54.760> I<00:00:55.719> have<00:00:55.870> a

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
cut the second applique and I have a

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.779 
cut the second applique and I have a
piece<00:00:56.140> of<00:00:56.260> iron<00:00:56.379> on<00:00:56.500> interfacing<00:00:56.649> I'm<00:00:57.550> going

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
piece of iron on interfacing I'm going

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:58.799 
piece of iron on interfacing I'm going
to<00:00:57.879> lay<00:00:57.969> them<00:00:58.120> on<00:00:58.149> the<00:00:58.269> side<00:00:58.449> that<00:00:58.600> doesn't

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
to lay them on the side that doesn't

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.150 
to lay them on the side that doesn't
have<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.170> glue<00:00:59.350> on<00:00:59.530> it<00:00:59.559> because<00:00:59.920> it's<00:01:00.039> gonna

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
have the glue on it because it's gonna

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.740 
have the glue on it because it's gonna
be<00:01:00.280> easier<00:01:00.579> to<00:01:00.670> trace<00:01:00.910> around<00:01:01.059> it<00:01:01.269> that<00:01:01.420> way<00:01:01.570> I

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
be easier to trace around it that way I

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.350 
be easier to trace around it that way I
would<00:01:02.620> suggest<00:01:02.800> using<00:01:03.219> an<00:01:03.489> actual<00:01:03.820> fabric

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
would suggest using an actual fabric

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.480 
would suggest using an actual fabric
tracing<00:01:04.900> pen<00:01:05.140> when<00:01:05.350> you<00:01:05.410> do<00:01:05.560> this<00:01:05.710> I<00:01:05.950> only<00:01:06.220> use

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
tracing pen when you do this I only use

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.250 
tracing pen when you do this I only use
a<00:01:06.520> sharpie<00:01:06.880> because<00:01:07.120> my<00:01:07.270> fabric<00:01:07.780> pen<00:01:07.960> wouldn't

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
a sharpie because my fabric pen wouldn't

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.410 
a sharpie because my fabric pen wouldn't
show<00:01:08.410> up<00:01:08.440> on<00:01:08.620> video<00:01:08.980> when<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.880> Sharpie<00:01:10.180> really

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
show up on video when the Sharpie really

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.550 
show up on video when the Sharpie really
should<00:01:10.570> be<00:01:10.690> okay<00:01:10.990> I<00:01:11.020> don't<00:01:11.290> think<00:01:11.440> it<00:01:11.500> will

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
should be okay I don't think it will

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.870 
should be okay I don't think it will
bleed<00:01:11.800> if<00:01:11.980> I<00:01:12.070> get<00:01:12.190> it<00:01:12.280> wet<00:01:12.430> because<00:01:12.460> it<00:01:12.730> is

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
bleed if I get it wet because it is

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.760 
bleed if I get it wet because it is
permanent<00:01:13.390> but<00:01:13.720> I<00:01:14.050> don't<00:01:14.290> want<00:01:14.410> to<00:01:14.440> take<00:01:14.590> any

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
permanent but I don't want to take any

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.560 
permanent but I don't want to take any
chances<00:01:15.190> with<00:01:15.370> ruining<00:01:15.850> my<00:01:15.940> project<00:01:16.420> so<00:01:16.540> I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
chances with ruining my project so I

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.770 
chances with ruining my project so I
would<00:01:16.780> normally<00:01:16.990> use<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.770> fabric<00:01:18.100> tracing<00:01:18.520> pen

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
would normally use a fabric tracing pen

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.720 
would normally use a fabric tracing pen
now<00:01:19.780> I've<00:01:19.930> got<00:01:20.140> both<00:01:20.170> shapes<00:01:20.890> traced<00:01:21.430> I'm

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
now I've got both shapes traced I'm

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.700 
now I've got both shapes traced I'm
going<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:21.940> cut<00:01:22.090> them<00:01:22.210> out<00:01:22.330> if<00:01:22.600> you<00:01:23.230> wanted<00:01:23.590> you

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
going to cut them out if you wanted you

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.110 
going to cut them out if you wanted you
could<00:01:23.860> iron<00:01:24.160> this<00:01:24.280> to<00:01:24.400> your<00:01:24.520> fabric<00:01:24.700> right<00:01:24.940> now

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
could iron this to your fabric right now

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.910 
could iron this to your fabric right now
before<00:01:25.570> you<00:01:25.690> cut<00:01:25.840> them<00:01:25.960> out<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:26.350> then<00:01:26.770> once

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
before you cut them out and then once

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.740 
before you cut them out and then once
they're<00:01:27.070> fused<00:01:27.460> you<00:01:27.820> can<00:01:28.000> cut<00:01:28.210> around<00:01:28.330> both

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
they're fused you can cut around both

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.780 
they're fused you can cut around both
pieces<00:01:29.080> all<00:01:29.440> at<00:01:29.560> once<00:01:29.740> save<00:01:30.130> yourself<00:01:30.460> a<00:01:30.520> step

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
pieces all at once save yourself a step

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.670 
pieces all at once save yourself a step
you<00:01:31.000> get<00:01:31.570> ten<00:01:31.780> points<00:01:32.020> right<00:01:32.320> now<00:01:32.440> if<00:01:32.590> you

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
you get ten points right now if you

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.320 
you get ten points right now if you
realize<00:01:32.980> the<00:01:33.130> stupid<00:01:33.490> mistake<00:01:33.820> I've<00:01:34.030> already

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
realize the stupid mistake I've already

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.360 
realize the stupid mistake I've already
made<00:01:34.510> which<00:01:35.350> I'll<00:01:35.500> point<00:01:35.650> out<00:01:35.770> in<00:01:35.890> a<00:01:35.950> minute<00:01:36.220> so

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
made which I'll point out in a minute so

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.910 
made which I'll point out in a minute so
you<00:01:36.430> don't<00:01:36.610> make<00:01:36.730> it<00:01:36.760> too<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.380> here<00:01:38.560> are<00:01:38.710> two

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
you don't make it too so here are two

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.490 
you don't make it too so here are two
shapes<00:01:39.220> cut<00:01:39.580> out<00:01:39.730> in<00:01:39.940> interfacing<00:01:40.570> now<00:01:41.380> I've

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
shapes cut out in interfacing now I've

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.350 
shapes cut out in interfacing now I've
cut<00:01:41.710> two<00:01:41.920> smaller<00:01:42.310> pieces<00:01:42.580> of<00:01:42.760> our<00:01:42.910> woven

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
cut two smaller pieces of our woven

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.510 
cut two smaller pieces of our woven
fabrics<00:01:43.810> big<00:01:44.230> enough<00:01:44.410> to<00:01:44.560> fare<00:01:44.740> appliques<00:01:45.250> and

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
fabrics big enough to fare appliques and

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.460 
fabrics big enough to fare appliques and
I'm<00:01:46.180> going<00:01:46.300> to<00:01:46.330> flip<00:01:46.510> those<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:47.200> that<00:01:47.230> they're

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
I'm going to flip those so that they're

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.760 
I'm going to flip those so that they're
wrong<00:01:47.800> sides<00:01:48.190> are<00:01:48.490> facing<00:01:49.060> up<00:01:49.210> and<00:01:49.650> I'm<00:01:50.650> going

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
wrong sides are facing up and I'm going

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.800 
wrong sides are facing up and I'm going
to<00:01:50.830> take<00:01:50.950> our<00:01:51.100> interfacing<00:01:51.700> making<00:01:52.450> sure<00:01:52.660> the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
to take our interfacing making sure the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.190 
to take our interfacing making sure the
glue<00:01:53.110> side<00:01:53.380> is<00:01:53.590> down<00:01:54.540> put<00:01:55.540> it<00:01:55.630> on<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.810> fabric

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
glue side is down put it on the fabric

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.710 
glue side is down put it on the fabric
and<00:01:56.380> iron<00:01:56.980> and<00:01:57.640> right<00:01:58.210> now<00:01:58.330> you<00:01:58.390> might<00:01:58.690> be

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
and iron and right now you might be

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.960 
and iron and right now you might be
figuring<00:01:59.170> out<00:01:59.230> what<00:01:59.470> I've<00:01:59.590> done<00:01:59.770> wrong<00:02:00.010> the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
figuring out what I've done wrong the

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.420 
figuring out what I've done wrong the
way<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:01.120> traced<00:02:01.510> out<00:02:01.690> my<00:02:01.900> eighth<00:02:02.290> notes<00:02:02.620> they're

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
way I traced out my eighth notes they're

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.070 
way I traced out my eighth notes they're
going<00:02:03.550> to<00:02:03.610> wind<00:02:03.760> up<00:02:03.880> being<00:02:04.030> backwards<00:02:04.690> of

going to wind up being backwards of

going to wind up being backwards of
course<00:02:05.710> I'm<00:02:05.920> not<00:02:06.100> paying<00:02:06.400> very<00:02:06.730> close

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
course I'm not paying very close

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.580 
course I'm not paying very close
attention<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.690> I<00:02:07.720> have<00:02:07.900> not<00:02:08.140> quite<00:02:08.440> figured

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
attention and I have not quite figured

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.949 
attention and I have not quite figured
it<00:02:09.039> out<00:02:09.160> yet<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:10.450> I'm<00:02:10.539> going<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.690> go<00:02:10.810> on<00:02:10.840> my

complicated shapes especially things

like<00:02:21.430> letters<00:02:21.990> make<00:02:22.990> sure<00:02:23.140> you're<00:02:23.260> drawing

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
like letters make sure you're drawing

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.890 
like letters make sure you're drawing
the<00:02:23.590> reverse<00:02:23.950> or<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.370> mirror<00:02:24.670> image<00:02:25.060> on<00:02:25.330> the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
interfacing and here's where I realized

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.960 
interfacing and here's where I realized
I<00:02:30.160> did<00:02:30.310> something<00:02:30.580> wrong

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
I did something wrong

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.750 
I did something wrong
now<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:31.570> fixed<00:02:32.050> my<00:02:32.110> eighth<00:02:32.620> notes<00:02:32.950> we're

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
now that I fixed my eighth notes we're

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.300 
now that I fixed my eighth notes we're
going<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.180> place<00:02:34.750> our<00:02:34.960> appliques<00:02:35.500> just<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.130> see

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
going to place our appliques just to see

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.960 
going to place our appliques just to see
how<00:02:36.370> they<00:02:36.520> look

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
how they look

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.970 
how they look
and<00:02:37.330> remember<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.720> take<00:02:37.900> into<00:02:38.080> account<00:02:38.380> where

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
and remember to take into account where

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.380 
and remember to take into account where
these<00:02:39.250> will<00:02:39.370> be<00:02:39.430> place<00:02:39.700> once<00:02:40.000> everything<00:02:40.360> is

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
these will be place once everything is

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.720 
these will be place once everything is
put<00:02:40.480> together<00:02:40.810> things<00:02:41.530> like<00:02:41.740> seam<00:02:42.130> allowances

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
put together things like seam allowances

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.430 
put together things like seam allowances
and<00:02:43.000> folds<00:02:43.420> can<00:02:43.540> really<00:02:43.750> affect<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.170> final

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
and folds can really affect the final

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.620 
and folds can really affect the final
placement<00:02:45.010> of<00:02:45.130> your<00:02:45.280> applique<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:46.390> once<00:02:46.540> you

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
placement of your applique so once you

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.300 
placement of your applique so once you
decide<00:02:46.720> on<00:02:46.960> placement<00:02:47.380> pin<00:02:47.710> your<00:02:47.860> applique<00:02:48.250> in

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
decide on placement pin your applique in

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.370 
decide on placement pin your applique in
place<00:02:48.610> since<00:02:49.390> my<00:02:49.540> appliques<00:02:49.959> are<00:02:50.080> going<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.290> be

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
place since my appliques are going to be

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.140 
place since my appliques are going to be
layered<00:02:50.680> I'm<00:02:50.980> doing<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.310> bottom<00:02:51.640> layer<00:02:51.790> first

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150

layered I'm doing the bottom layer first
and<00:02:52.840> I'm<00:02:52.900> actually<00:02:53.050> going<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.320> show<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:53.500> two

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
and I'm actually going to show you two

different stitch options for an applique
on<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.590> heart<00:02:56.800> I'm<00:02:56.980> going<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.190> use<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.340> satin

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790

the<00:03:08.230> heart<00:03:08.530> about<00:03:08.740> an<00:03:08.950> inch<00:03:09.130> from<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.430> point

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
the heart about an inch from the point

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.070 
the heart about an inch from the point
and<00:03:10.180> once<00:03:10.300> you<00:03:10.390> get<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:10.660> point<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:10.990> the

make sure your needles down and then

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.160 
make sure your needles down and then
pivot<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.420> other<00:03:16.540> side<00:03:16.720> of<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:16.900> heart<00:03:17.080> and

pivot to the other side of the heart and

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.230 
pivot to the other side of the heart and
start<00:03:17.770> stitching<00:03:18.010> again<00:03:18.190> when<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.090> get<00:03:19.180> to

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
start stitching again when you get to

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.610 
start stitching again when you get to
the<00:03:19.390> curved<00:03:19.630> part<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.990> your<00:03:20.050> applique<00:03:20.410> you're

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
the curved part to your applique you're

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.729 
the curved part to your applique you're
going<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:20.800> slowly<00:03:21.130> guide<00:03:21.670> your<00:03:21.940> fabric<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:23.530> the

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
going to slowly guide your fabric so the

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.030 
going to slowly guide your fabric so the
needle<00:03:24.040> follows<00:03:24.340> around<00:03:24.850> that<00:03:25.150> shape<00:03:26.040> don't

outside of the corner make sure the
needle<00:03:36.220> is<00:03:36.250> down<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:36.670> then<00:03:36.760> pivot<00:03:37.150> again<00:03:37.239> and

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
needle is down and then pivot again and

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.470 
needle is down and then pivot again and
again<00:03:38.530> on<00:03:38.620> these<00:03:38.769> curved<00:03:39.160> edges<00:03:39.400> just<00:03:40.030> gently

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
again on these curved edges just gently

again on these curved edges just gently
guide<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.810> fabric<00:03:41.350> under<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.620> needle

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
guide the fabric under the needle

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.520 
guide the fabric under the needle
following<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.150> shape<00:03:43.420> when<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.200> get<00:03:44.410> back

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
following that shape when you get back

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.110 
following that shape when you get back
to<00:03:44.620> where<00:03:44.709> you<00:03:44.769> started<00:03:45.250> go<00:03:45.580> ahead<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:45.850> stitch

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
to where you started go ahead and stitch

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.030 
to where you started go ahead and stitch
over<00:03:46.570> your<00:03:46.810> original<00:03:46.900> stitches<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.650> little<00:03:47.890> bit

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
over your original stitches a little bit

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.420 
over your original stitches a little bit
and<00:03:48.250> then<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:49.180> can<00:03:49.360> back<00:03:49.660> stitch<00:03:50.100> my<00:03:51.100> machine

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
and then you can back stitch my machine

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.520 
and then you can back stitch my machine
is<00:03:51.610> a<00:03:51.640> butthole<00:03:52.030> and<00:03:52.390> will<00:03:52.870> not<00:03:53.049> let<00:03:53.260> me<00:03:53.350> do<00:03:53.500> a

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
is a butthole and will not let me do a

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.960 
is a butthole and will not let me do a
reverse<00:03:53.890> zigzag<00:03:54.370> so<00:03:54.580> I<00:03:54.610> have<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:54.820> do<00:03:54.940> a

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
reverse zigzag so I have to do a

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.960 
reverse zigzag so I have to do a
straight<00:03:55.480> stitch<00:03:55.810> when<00:03:55.989> I<00:03:56.080> backstitch<00:03:56.970> but

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
straight stitch when I backstitch but

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.460 
straight stitch when I backstitch but
either<00:03:58.090> one<00:03:58.299> will<00:03:58.480> work<00:03:58.510> so<00:03:59.110> now<00:03:59.230> I'm<00:03:59.290> going<00:03:59.410> to

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
either one will work so now I'm going to

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.500 
either one will work so now I'm going to
take<00:03:59.590> applique<00:03:59.980> number<00:04:00.220> two<00:04:00.400> place<00:04:01.239> it<00:04:01.390> where

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
take applique number two place it where

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.350 
take applique number two place it where
I<00:04:01.540> want<00:04:01.780> it<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.019> then<00:04:02.769> pin<00:04:03.190> around<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:04.269> I

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
I want it and then pin around it and I

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.610 
I want it and then pin around it and I
wanted<00:04:04.570> to<00:04:04.660> point<00:04:04.810> out<00:04:04.989> that<00:04:05.140> I<00:04:05.200> didn't<00:04:05.500> give

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
wanted to point out that I didn't give

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.530 
wanted to point out that I didn't give
any<00:04:05.769> specific<00:04:06.430> numbers<00:04:06.880> for<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.269> stitch

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
any specific numbers for the stitch

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.990 
any specific numbers for the stitch
width<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:08.170> stitch<00:04:08.500> length<00:04:08.860> for<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.610> satin

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
width and stitch length for the satin

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.090 
width and stitch length for the satin
stitch<00:04:10.239> and<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.570> reason<00:04:10.870> is<00:04:10.959> because

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
stitch and the reason is because

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.370 
stitch and the reason is because
machines<00:04:12.100> are<00:04:12.250> going<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.430> vary<00:04:12.640> quite<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.120> bit

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
machines are going to vary quite a bit

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.780 
machines are going to vary quite a bit
so<00:04:14.380> what<00:04:14.500> I'd<00:04:14.650> suggest<00:04:14.680> doing<00:04:15.190> instead<00:04:15.580> is

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
so what I'd suggest doing instead is

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.280 
so what I'd suggest doing instead is
getting<00:04:16.030> scrap<00:04:16.330> piece<00:04:16.510> of<00:04:16.540> fabric<00:04:16.690> and

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
getting scrap piece of fabric and

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.740 
getting scrap piece of fabric and
testing<00:04:18.070> out<00:04:18.220> various<00:04:18.880> stitch<00:04:19.209> lengths<00:04:19.630> and

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
testing out various stitch lengths and

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.150 
testing out various stitch lengths and
widths<00:04:19.900> until<00:04:20.290> you<00:04:20.380> get<00:04:20.560> one<00:04:20.739> that<00:04:20.859> you<00:04:20.919> like

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
widths until you get one that you like

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.610 
widths until you get one that you like
now<00:04:21.790> for<00:04:22.030> a<00:04:22.060> second<00:04:22.390> applique<00:04:22.810> I'm<00:04:23.169> not<00:04:23.470> going

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
now for a second applique I'm not going

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.020 
now for a second applique I'm not going
to<00:04:23.710> do<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.800> satin<00:04:24.220> stitch<00:04:24.250> I'm<00:04:24.640> just<00:04:24.849> going<00:04:24.970> to

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
to do a satin stitch I'm just going to

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.719 
to do a satin stitch I'm just going to
do<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.479> straight<00:04:26.229> stitch<00:04:26.530> in<00:04:26.890> a<00:04:27.130> contrasting

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729

the edges of this one will probably

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.780 
the edges of this one will probably
eventually<00:04:31.470> fray<00:04:32.040> even<00:04:32.460> though<00:04:32.520> we<00:04:32.640> do<00:04:32.760> have
