takes this overhead perspective and it's

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.190 
takes this overhead perspective and it's
neat<00:00:44.670> seeing<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.149> 3d<00:00:45.420> effect<00:00:45.450> react<00:00:45.960> when

neat seeing the 3d effect react when

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.779 
neat seeing the 3d effect react when
Mario<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.680> jumping<00:00:46.950> towards<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> screen<00:00:47.610> if

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
there is definitely one genre which

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.709 
there is definitely one genre which
benefits<00:00:50.219> from<00:00:50.309> having<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.670> 3d<00:00:50.940> effect<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.480> a

benefits from having a 3d effect it's a
3d<00:00:51.989> platformer<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:53.010> game<00:00:53.190> shows<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.550> off

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
3d platformer and this game shows it off

in a big way the only notable downsides
to<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> visuals<00:00:57.420> are<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> lack<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.899> good

to the visuals are the lack of good
anti-aliasing<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.489> fact<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.910> game

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
anti-aliasing and the fact that the game

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.310 
anti-aliasing and the fact that the game
doesn't<00:01:00.120> look<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.719> good<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:00.930> some<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.230> the

much fun as it is there's just something

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.360 
much fun as it is there's just something

satisfying about taking your time

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.890 
satisfying about taking your time
through<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.700> level<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.120> exploring<00:03:44.569> the<00:03:44.630> 3d

they weren't hidden that well and the

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.270 
they weren't hidden that well and the
challenge<00:03:50.870> was<00:03:51.019> in<00:03:51.230> your<00:03:51.290> execution<00:03:51.920> to<00:03:52.130> get

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
challenge was in your execution to get

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.370 
challenge was in your execution to get
them<00:03:52.489> I<00:03:52.670> far<00:03:53.299> preferred<00:03:53.630> this<00:03:53.810> setup<00:03:54.019> of

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
them I far preferred this setup of

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.960 
them I far preferred this setup of
having<00:03:54.709> them<00:03:54.829> slightly<00:03:55.069> harder<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.519> find<00:03:55.760> but

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
having them slightly harder to find but

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.259 
having them slightly harder to find but
easier<00:03:56.359> to<00:03:56.450> pick<00:03:56.599> up<00:03:56.780> once<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:57.319> do<00:03:57.440> find<00:03:57.680> them

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
easier to pick up once you do find them

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.580 
easier to pick up once you do find them
there<00:03:59.269> is<00:03:59.389> no<00:03:59.569> multiplayer<00:03:59.900> for<00:04:00.260> this<00:04:00.410> game

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
there is no multiplayer for this game

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.050 
there is no multiplayer for this game
but<00:04:00.980> I<00:04:01.040> personally<00:04:01.519> don't<00:04:01.639> think<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:01.970> would

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
but I personally don't think it would

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.849 
but I personally don't think it would
have<00:04:02.150> added<00:04:02.269> that<00:04:02.480> much<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:03.410> street<00:04:03.650> past

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.050 
have added that much the street past
feature<00:04:04.099> makes<00:04:04.430> up<00:04:04.639> for<00:04:04.819> the<00:04:04.849> lack<00:04:04.910> of

feature makes up for the lack of
leaderboards<00:04:05.690> in<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:05.930> sense<00:04:06.109> that<00:04:06.200> pretty

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
leaderboards in the sense that pretty
