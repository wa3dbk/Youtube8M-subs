circle only so here I'm using very easy

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.510 
circle only so here I'm using very easy
designs<00:00:51.390> here<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.800> my<00:00:52.949> center<00:00:53.340> point

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
designs here so this is my center point

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.430 
designs here so this is my center point
this<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.030> my<00:00:54.059> center<00:00:54.480> point<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.260> made

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
this is my center point and I have made

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.150 
this is my center point and I have made
that<00:00:56.000> round<00:00:57.000> petal<00:00:57.539> structure<00:00:58.020> with<00:00:58.260> my<00:00:58.440> using

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
that round petal structure with my using

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.709 
that round petal structure with my using
my<00:00:59.280> color<00:00:59.550> palette<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.690> just

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
my color palette and so you can just

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.139 
my color palette and so you can just
make<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> round<00:01:02.039> circle<00:01:02.309> instead<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.789> this

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
make a round circle instead of this

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.479 
make a round circle instead of this
petal<00:01:03.600> design<00:01:03.960> then<00:01:04.860> after<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.460> can

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
petal design then after that you can

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.960 
petal design then after that you can
just<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:06.390> start<00:01:07.110> increasing<00:01:08.040> your<00:01:08.460> Mundell

petals<00:02:02.490> here<00:02:02.729> these<00:02:03.390> are<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:03.719> water<00:02:03.960> drop

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
petals here these are like water drop

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.880 
petals here these are like water drop
petals<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.009> I'm<00:02:05.460> making<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.329> petal<00:02:06.750> on<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
petals and I'm making this petal on the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.100 
petals and I'm making this petal on the
corners<00:02:08.459> on<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.879> corners<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.629> round

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
corners on the corners of that round

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.990 
corners on the corners of that round
petals<00:02:10.560> now<00:02:10.770> I'm<00:02:11.069> making<00:02:11.340> another<00:02:11.640> bigger

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
petals now I'm making another bigger

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.990 
petals now I'm making another bigger
better<00:02:12.270> around<00:02:12.599> the

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
better around the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.180 
better around the
smaller<00:02:13.300> one<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.080> can<00:02:14.350> say<00:02:14.560> this<00:02:14.770> is<00:02:14.830> no

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
smaller one so you can say this is no

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.640 
smaller one so you can say this is no
complex<00:02:15.640> detail<00:02:16.030> here<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.450> very<00:02:16.690> easy<00:02:16.930> to

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
complex detail here this is very easy to

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.220 
complex detail here this is very easy to
draw<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.160> now<00:02:18.790> I'll<00:02:19.060> fill<00:02:19.540> these<00:02:19.840> petals

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
draw and now I'll fill these petals

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.470 
draw and now I'll fill these petals
again<00:02:20.800> with<00:02:21.010> some<00:02:21.280> lines<00:02:21.640> they're<00:02:22.270> just

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
again with some lines they're just

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.480 
again with some lines they're just
simple<00:02:22.840> lines<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.320> that<00:02:23.470> because<00:02:23.800> otherwise

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
simple lines so that because otherwise

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.060 
simple lines so that because otherwise
it'll<00:02:24.820> feel<00:02:25.270> very<00:02:25.540> black<00:02:25.990> so<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:26.440> don't<00:02:26.650> want<00:02:26.890> to

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
it'll feel very black so I don't want to

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.890 
it'll feel very black so I don't want to
leave<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.490> blank<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:28.150> just<00:02:28.360> want<00:02:28.570> to<00:02:28.690> give<00:02:28.870> it

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
leave it blank I just want to give it

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.040 
leave it blank I just want to give it
more<00:02:29.230> detail<00:02:29.800> structure<00:02:30.490> and<00:02:30.970> design<00:02:31.540> so

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
more detail structure and design so

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.740 
more detail structure and design so
that's<00:02:32.170> why<00:02:32.380> I'm<00:02:32.500> using<00:02:32.530> my<00:02:33.130> line<00:02:34.120> structure

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
that's why I'm using my line structure

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.900 
that's why I'm using my line structure
over<00:02:34.990> here<00:02:35.020> so<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:35.709> can<00:02:35.770> fill<00:02:36.130> my<00:02:36.370> bundle

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
with more my new details so I'll make it

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.100 
with more my new details so I'll make it
more<00:02:41.050> darker<00:02:41.530> now<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.910> make<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.180> more<00:02:43.330> darkest

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
more darker now to make it more darkest

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:58.710 
more darker now to make it more darkest
structure<00:02:54.959> as<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:57.040> can<00:02:57.250> see<00:02:57.400> i<00:02:57.430> magnin<00:02:57.850> again

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
structure as you can see i magnin again

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.930

the<00:02:59.230> round<00:02:59.380> petals<00:02:59.920> here<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.459> I'm<00:03:00.610> joining

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
the round petals here and I'm joining

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.150 
the round petals here and I'm joining
the<00:03:01.209> round<00:03:01.420> petals<00:03:01.900> with<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.470> drop<00:03:02.739> petal

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
the round petals with the drop petal

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.430 
the round petals with the drop petal
structure<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:03.970> I'm<00:03:04.540> again<00:03:04.870> filling<00:03:05.260> the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
structure and I'm again filling the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.260 
structure and I'm again filling the
round<00:03:05.890> petal<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.550> it<00:03:06.700> will<00:03:06.820> not<00:03:07.000> look

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
round petal so that it will not look

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.530 
round petal so that it will not look
very<00:03:07.810> blank<00:03:08.230> or<00:03:08.739> just<00:03:09.430> without<00:03:09.760> any<00:03:09.820> texture

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
very blank or just without any texture

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.710 
very blank or just without any texture
so<00:03:10.750> I'm<00:03:10.840> just<00:03:11.110> making<00:03:11.590> some<00:03:11.800> smaller<00:03:12.720> minut

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
so I'm just making some smaller minut

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.720

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
details over here I'm just giving a

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.060 
details over here I'm just giving a
minor<00:03:15.940> details<00:03:16.390> here<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:16.870> that's<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.890> I'm

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
minor details here and that's it I'm

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.460 
minor details here and that's it I'm
just<00:03:18.549> filling<00:03:18.760> again<00:03:19.060> I'm<00:03:19.540> filling<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.200> inner

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
just filling again I'm filling the inner

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.170 
just filling again I'm filling the inner
structure<00:03:20.680> because<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.040> don't<00:03:21.220> like<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:22.000> is

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
structure because I don't like it is

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.120

very<00:03:22.390> it<00:03:22.690> is<00:03:22.810> looking<00:03:23.019> very<00:03:23.140> blank<00:03:23.590> so<00:03:23.920> that's

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
very it is looking very blank so that's

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.250 
very it is looking very blank so that's
why<00:03:24.310> I'm<00:03:24.400> giving<00:03:24.580> more<00:03:25.180> my<00:03:25.690> new<00:03:25.870> details

so<00:04:08.280> that's<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.790> way<00:04:08.970> how<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.299> can<00:04:09.569> grow<00:04:10.049> your

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
so that's the way how you can grow your

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.890 
so that's the way how you can grow your
Mundell<00:04:10.980> from<00:04:11.370> your<00:04:11.549> center<00:04:12.000> point<00:04:12.269> towards

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
Mundell from your center point towards

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.530 
Mundell from your center point towards

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
outside so on the outside now this is

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.449 
outside so on the outside now this is
the<00:04:15.659> last<00:04:15.870> circle<00:04:16.320> I'm<00:04:16.470> drawing<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:17.070> I'm

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
the last circle I'm drawing and I'm

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.490 
the last circle I'm drawing and I'm
connecting<00:04:18.030> my<00:04:18.209> petals<00:04:18.630> with<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:18.989> circle

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
connecting my petals with that circle

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.670 
connecting my petals with that circle
and<00:04:19.970> now<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.510> can<00:04:21.690> see<00:04:21.900> there<00:04:22.139> is<00:04:22.260> so<00:04:22.470> much

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
and now you can see there is so much

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.219 
and now you can see there is so much
blank<00:04:23.130> space<00:04:23.490> over<00:04:23.850> here<00:04:23.880> in<00:04:24.360> my<00:04:24.419> circle<00:04:25.050> so

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
blank space over here in my circle so

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.100 
blank space over here in my circle so
I'll<00:04:25.410> fill<00:04:25.710> this<00:04:25.949> up<00:04:26.190> with<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:27.090> little<00:04:27.510> bit<00:04:27.750> more

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
I'll fill this up with a little bit more

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.590 
I'll fill this up with a little bit more
darker<00:04:28.919> color<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.550> will<00:04:29.970> give<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.360> more

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
darker color I will give it a more

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.900 
darker color I will give it a more

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910
