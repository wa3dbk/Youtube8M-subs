00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.360
 connect profession and hobby that is before 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.210
 all in the riding a big wish 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.790
 many young riders training to 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.400
 Horse host is one way around too 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.380
 to be close to the partner horse in the profession 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.330
 this is in the training between 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.970
 various specializations the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.099
 horse husbandry horse breeding or the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.700
 classic equestrian education distinguished 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.690
 holger hetzel is country coach in 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.790
 North Rhine-Westphalia and has been forming 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.739
 years affect young people on horseback 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.140
 out 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.079
 I basically strike everyone formally 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.159
 so 14 days three weeks in my company 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.489
 to work 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:53.949
 once so I get to know him better 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.890
 and so that one sees it again 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.379
 three weeks here from morning to evening 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.420
 looks to work under full steam and 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.430
 that one looks like it's working 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.439
 is often twice the then good 100 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.850
 quite simply or he already knows 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.990
 maybe two days he comes sometimes 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.890
 certainly not again , he said 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.340
 because I think quite differently presented the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.850
 work and the job as a horse host 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.729
 really a very hard job yes 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.959
 nothing at all with 36 hours a week 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.970
 You really have to do it for a horse 

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:31.240
 be all day because 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.679
 horses need constant care there is 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.870
 no free day there is no 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.090
 weekend 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.280
 Sinn is a rider out of passion and 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.460
 has been sitting on this since his childhood 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.620
 At the moment he is doing an internship in the 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.630
 operation of the state coach from the 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.700
 School life was during the internship 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.909
 a twelve-hour day six times a week 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.180
 I'm at half past eight and then he leads 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.229
 mostly dirt then we give today and 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.990
 then we'll do the first one 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:05.820
 four machine due and so far 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:09.690
 already standard if then soon 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.819
 more horses ready and then I ride in 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.910
 during the day I still know three 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:19.049
 up to four horses and at noon and in the evening 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:22.799
 Feeding me and Eugen twelve hours 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:25.140
 Daily clean blessing semitrailer 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.870
 keep horses in order 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.519
 the training to the horse host requires 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.540
 the apprentice and the trainee 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.159
 Interns do four physical work 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.819
 Of course you are on the whole day 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:41.459
 legs and there are no other ones 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.650
 Working hours because sometimes have to be very 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.760
 Ill or you are on tournament longer 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.109
 or customer and there and yes and it is 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.640
 generally very exhausting 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.739
 Underestimates what you're sitting in school 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.269
 actually only whole on the chair and looks 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.519
 to 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.129
 and here at steinberg branches all over 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.019
 day and you can tell if you are in the evening 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.000
 bed next to the physical 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.420
 Requirements must be a prospective 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.500
 horse host unlike other 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.329
 Vocational training already 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.040
 equestrian evidence 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:15.540
 can 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:19.739
 a two- or three-year apprenticeship is enough 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:23.159
 not to ride from the 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.290
 zero on a hundred to learn so the riding 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.780
 knowledge must have basic knowledge and 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.170
 Basic knowledge must be available 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.739
 this exam at the end of the three years 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.829
 to be able to exist 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.700
 only he who is ready to live his life 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.129
 to prescribe 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.909
 also on weekends and holidays too 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.909
 work 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.519
 do not be shy about physical work 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.680
 can and irregular working hours in 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.760
 Buying takes also the nice pages 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.069
 that of the profession brings with it enjoy 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.579
 I think that's fascinating about that 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.019
 occupation is always that one with the 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.150
 horse works and there are certainly 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.319
 also like in the other colleges and 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.680
 less beautiful pages 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.209
 but I can not imagine that 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.799
 Nice time to be a hobby 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.129
 can do a job where else can you do that? 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.989
 as pronounced as working because one is 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:16.410
 the whole day is traveling together as with 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.470
 more remove and is well each has 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.910
 one of Massas special look up 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.500
 and if you have the chance 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.400
 then you should do this too 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.400
 perceive if you want that
