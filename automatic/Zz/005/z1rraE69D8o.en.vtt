00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello friends of you tube today I will teach you to put adÃ³n salgar same 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.220
 Adon means for example weapons mpc vehicles beaches models exeter a xd 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.800
 pacense for my channel and its screen and if you want to play with me send me a 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.259
 message to my channel or private remember I have three garris mod the digital zone 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.289
 and the cti carex but without root 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.359
 let's start I have a couple of submachine guns and beloved kermit is the extracted what 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.359
 important here is that what will come out of the extracted 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.470
 once extracted depends on what has come out for example if you got a 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.920
 folder you cut only copies and go to the folder where you have saved elgarrista 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.850
 You enter rhythm saga 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.850
 in the glue senators how I'm going to do it now 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.470
 once done you already have the weapons kermit is in your warfare 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.940
 whatever they want to call him 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.550
 and if they want to install players they extract it and winners but sometimes there 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.370
 if you install it like this it will not work for you to work, you enter the 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.810
 extracted folder and cut everything in there, such as lua 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.490
 modern materials short everything that is inside and what sticks hiking there 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.740
 where he will ask you to combine the folders and you give him as well as what 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.740
 I'm doing 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.950
 well that's it now I'll show you how to install maps you have a map 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.870
 anyone extract it and if you get a folder with materials match models this 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.460
 they do the same thing as with the players they cut everything inside and they stick it in 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.430
 garris mod there times that work putting the senators but in my case 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.430
 I put it in garris models with wine 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.129
 toa baja 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.700
 Canada will consist of another map 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.769
 without you see the material folders max exeter to but if he 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.440
 came out a file only that means it's the map cut the file were going to 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.440
 give them momax and stick it in max 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.449
 is able to use 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.169
 It is not an exact science 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:32.239
 The escape 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.600
 when arriving at the center 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.450
 well, now 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.680
 we put fear and for obama they have worked what we have put 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.150
 As you can see, the maccabi city installed in the form of the players worked 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:06.939

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.939
