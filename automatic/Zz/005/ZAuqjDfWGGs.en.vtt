00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
some paper I've picked for patterns that

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.290 
some paper I've picked for patterns that
I<00:00:45.899> like<00:00:46.230> from<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.920> paper<00:00:47.160> rubbery<00:00:47.579> collection

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
and we are going to cut them at

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.490 
and we are going to cut them at
five-and-a-half<00:00:54.059> inches<00:00:54.239> by<00:00:54.719> twelve<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.350> let

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
five-and-a-half inches by twelve so let

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.270 
five-and-a-half inches by twelve so let
me<00:00:55.620> cut<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.930> this<00:00:57.930> strip<00:00:58.289> off<00:00:58.469> first<00:00:58.859> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
me cut this this strip off first and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.490 
me cut this this strip off first and
then<00:00:59.370> we're<00:00:59.520> going<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.670> cut<00:00:59.989> it<00:01:00.989> at

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
then we're going to cut it at

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.730 
then we're going to cut it at
five-and-a-half<00:01:02.160> inches<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.180> need<00:01:04.339> four

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
five-and-a-half inches and you need four

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.039 
five-and-a-half inches and you need four
four<00:01:07.740> strips<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.369> paper<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.970> each<00:01:09.180> pattern<00:01:09.600> so

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
four strips of paper for each pattern so

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.160 
four strips of paper for each pattern so
there's<00:01:10.229> my<00:01:10.439> first<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.600> then<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.140> my

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
there's my first and then here is my

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.310 
there's my first and then here is my
second<00:01:17.119> I'm<00:01:18.119> going<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.450> set<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.689> aside<00:01:18.750> this

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
second I'm going to set this aside this

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.270 
second I'm going to set this aside this
trimmer<00:01:20.210> then<00:01:21.210> from<00:01:21.570> here<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.470> are<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:23.040> to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
trimmer then from here you are going to

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.249 
trimmer then from here you are going to
roll<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.790> paper<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.450> think<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:24.840> easiest

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
roll the paper and I think it's easiest

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.410 
roll the paper and I think it's easiest
just<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.740> use<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.909> pencil

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
just to use a just a pencil

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.950 
just to use a just a pencil
it<00:01:28.170> helps<00:01:28.530> me<00:01:28.740> anyway<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.540> I'm<00:01:30.540> going<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.720> just

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
it helps me anyway and I'm going to just

it helps me anyway and I'm going to just
roll<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.500> paper<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:34.079> pencil<00:01:34.530> once<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
roll that paper on the pencil once you

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.319 
roll that paper on the pencil once you
get<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.220> started<00:01:35.630> you<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.810> roll<00:01:37.200> that

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.700

for each side you can do that where you
can<00:02:27.090> do<00:02:27.180> them<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:27.420> same<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.019> then<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.680> just<00:02:29.190> put

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
can do them the same and then I just put

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.069 
can do them the same and then I just put
some<00:02:29.730> adhesive<00:02:29.940> down<00:02:31.310> kind<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.340> just<00:02:32.579> randomly

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.430 

and<00:02:37.220> this<00:02:38.220> takes<00:02:38.549> a<00:02:38.730> second<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.209> dry<00:02:39.480> but<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.989> it

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
and this takes a second to dry but it it

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.880 
and this takes a second to dry but it it
dries<00:02:40.890> really<00:02:41.069> well<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.849> holds<00:02:42.209> them<00:02:42.390> well

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
dries really well and it holds them well

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.970 
dries really well and it holds them well
so<00:02:43.890> then<00:02:44.099> I<00:02:44.340> will<00:02:44.640> place<00:02:45.000> each<00:02:45.420> one<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.829> want

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
so then I will place each one you want

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.080 
so then I will place each one you want
the<00:02:47.100> tape<00:02:47.450> portion<00:02:48.450> down<00:02:48.720> on<00:02:52.220> my<00:02:53.220> frames<00:02:53.639> just

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
the tape portion down on my frames just

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.460 
the tape portion down on my frames just
side<00:02:54.389> by<00:02:54.420> side<00:02:55.340> this<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:56.880> easy<00:02:57.389> to<00:02:57.630> do<00:02:57.989> this

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
side by side this is so easy to do this

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.670 
side by side this is so easy to do this
is<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> fun<00:02:58.980> project<00:02:59.160> especially<00:03:00.060> for<00:03:00.239> kids

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
is a fun project especially for kids

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.229 
is a fun project especially for kids
because<00:03:01.680> they<00:03:01.889> can<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.579> know<00:03:02.700> help<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:03.030> glue

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
because they can you know help you glue

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.199 
because they can you know help you glue
this<00:03:03.389> down<00:03:03.720> just<00:03:04.040> going<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.130> hear<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.639> and

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
this down just going to hear that and

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.870 
this down just going to hear that and
then<00:03:06.359> I'm<00:03:06.480> going<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.690> do<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.959> again<00:03:07.350> on<00:03:07.880> this

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
then I'm going to do that again on this

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:17.320 
then I'm going to do that again on this
side<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:11.370> put<00:03:11.760> your<00:03:11.880> glue<00:03:12.150> down

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.020 

and<00:03:18.020> then<00:03:19.540> again<00:03:20.540> kind<00:03:20.810> of<00:03:20.870> create<00:03:21.230> your<00:03:21.260> own

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
and then again kind of create your own

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.730 
and then again kind of create your own
pattern<00:03:23.410> for<00:03:24.410> this<00:03:24.560> last<00:03:24.830> side<00:03:26.320> put<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.350> tape

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
pattern for this last side put the tape

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.040 
pattern for this last side put the tape
down<00:03:28.010> at<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.490> bottom<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:29.210> you<00:03:29.270> can't<00:03:29.570> see<00:03:29.840> that

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
down at the bottom so you can't see that

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.860 
down at the bottom so you can't see that
and<00:03:30.970> then<00:03:31.970> you're<00:03:32.150> going<00:03:32.240> to<00:03:32.330> want<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:32.630> set

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
and then you're going to want to set

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.330 
and then you're going to want to set
this<00:03:32.990> aside<00:03:33.200> and<00:03:33.470> let<00:03:33.860> it<00:03:33.890> dry<00:03:35.320> completely

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
this aside and let it dry completely

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.810 
this aside and let it dry completely
before<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.820> you<00:03:38.720> stick<00:03:39.020> your<00:03:39.170> picture<00:03:39.590> in<00:03:39.820> but
