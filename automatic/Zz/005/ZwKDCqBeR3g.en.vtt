 With that they were able to collect Komsomol Marije who brought their mother here 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.410

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.999
 And although it feels like this due to the fact that the farmer 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:56.010
 together with the cooperation ajax it is only getting worse that is quite 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:00.509
