00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
which I have so visibility it looks like

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.630 
which I have so visibility it looks like
there's<00:02:50.720> some<00:02:50.900> white<00:02:51.200> stuff<00:02:51.430> floating<00:02:52.430> around

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.570 
there's some white stuff floating around
in<00:02:53.060> there<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:54.170> lot<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:54.709> times<00:02:55.010> that's<00:02:55.220> when<00:02:55.489> it

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
in there a lot of times that's when it

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.170 
in there a lot of times that's when it
has<00:02:55.810> creatine<00:02:56.810> in<00:02:56.959> it<00:02:57.080> but<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.260> didn't<00:02:58.690> see<00:02:59.690> any

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
has creatine in it but I didn't see any

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.880 
has creatine in it but I didn't see any
creatine<00:03:02.180> listed<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:06.260> right<00:03:06.440> now<00:03:06.470> my<00:03:06.739> biggest

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
creatine listed so right now my biggest

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.599 
creatine listed so right now my biggest
ability<00:03:07.519> is<00:03:07.820> you<00:03:08.359> know<00:03:08.950> six<00:03:09.950> out<00:03:10.220> of<00:03:10.250> 10

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
ability is you know six out of 10

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.340 
ability is you know six out of 10
because<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:11.000> can<00:03:11.209> see<00:03:11.450> white<00:03:11.690> stuff<00:03:12.019> floating

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350
