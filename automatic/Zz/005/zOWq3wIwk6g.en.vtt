00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.980
 Hello Natalia Popova with you 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.820
 and you watch the project online by better 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.410
 today's topic is animal science zoology 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.050
 the term itself is a pledge of Greek 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.650
 origin it consists of two words 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.380
 words zolan means animal and words 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.340
 Logos means science, that is, pledge 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.100
 this is animal science zoology is studying 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.110
 animal anatomy or their internal 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.850
 structure 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.750
 studies the morphology of animals or their 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.690
 external structure studies ethology 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.289
 animal behavior or functioning 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.270
 organs and organ systems inside 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.539
 animal organism or physiology a 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.739
 also animal reproduction 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.190
 individual animal origin 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.670
 or ontogeny and the effect of animals on 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.420
 human life all animals are united in 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.030
 animal kingdom all animals except type 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.659
 chordates refers to no vertebrates 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.020
 animal similarities are such 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.060
 and animals and plants are made of one and 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.600
 the same inorganic substances and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.710
 organic molecules such as proteins 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.920
 fats and carbohydrates and plants and animals 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.020
 made up of cells while unicellular 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.750
 plants and animals may consist of 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.060
 single cell multicellular plants and 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.490
 animals consist of many cages 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.130
 but in any case those and those and y 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.740
 other structural unit is 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.950
 cage and animals and plants 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.979
 represent an open system then 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.579
 there are some elements they absorb 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.659
 inside 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:01.070
 some substances excrete something 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.329
 there is a metabolism with the medium and 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.170
 animals and plants possess 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.580
 irritability you that is opportunity 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.180
 respond to external 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.310
 and to the wife living organisms and plants and 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.120
 animals are able to reproduce themselves 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.330
 similar at the same time in plants and in 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.130
 animals have their differences there 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.570
 differences in both cell composition in 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.850
 chemical composition 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.800
 if we talk about the metabolic processes 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.490
 most plants are auto 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.500
 corpses 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.440
 that is, they can synthesize 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.080
 organic matter from inorganic 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.250
 while all animals refer 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.490
 heterotrophs they should be getting 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.800
 organic matter along with food and 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.200
 cannot synthesize them on their own 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.060
 reproduction type most animals 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.310
 diploid ie in their cells 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.160
 contains two identical sets 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.590
 chromosomes while in plants 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.170
 there are two stages of haploid and 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.420
 diploid developmental stage in animals 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.420
 irritation response is 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.750
 movement complex motor acts 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.140
 implemented through 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.370
 effects of the nervous system exist 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.510
 unicellular and multicellular animals 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.910
 in unicellular animals the whole body 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.310
 they are represented by a single cell and one 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.580
 the cell performs all the functions completely 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.500
 which are necessary for vital activity 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.489
 this animal 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.790
 unicellular animal refers to 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:33.420
 the simplest animals and it is critical 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.810
 eukaryotic cells mean that they have 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.730
 there is a decorated core 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.000
 multicellular animals consist of 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.959
 cell sets and these cells 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.480
 differentiated ie every group 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.410
 cell performs its necessary 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.840
 functions in multicellular animals 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.510
 development comes from zygotes 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.590
 either from a non-fertilized egg at 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.209
 parthenogenesis 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.739
 and then gradually by the type of division and 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.640
 differentiated curd 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.230
 differentiation of cells from zygotes 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.230
 adult organ develops
