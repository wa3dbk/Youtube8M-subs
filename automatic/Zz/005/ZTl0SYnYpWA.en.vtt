00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
i'm really not happy about that because

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.819 
i'm really not happy about that because
if<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.390> didn't<00:00:51.600> know<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> air21<00:00:52.110> did<00:00:52.530> get<00:00:52.800> a

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
if you didn't know the air21 did get a

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.590 
if you didn't know the air21 did get a
deduction<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.460> clip<00:00:53.640> size<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> few<00:00:54.210> months<00:00:54.360> ago

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
deduction in clip size a few months ago

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.260 
deduction in clip size a few months ago
and<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:55.770> another<00:00:56.129> minus<00:00:56.460> 2<00:00:56.610> clip<00:00:56.820> size<00:00:57.030> it's

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
and with another minus 2 clip size it's

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.029 
and with another minus 2 clip size it's
going<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.539> be<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> very<00:00:58.050> very<00:00:58.320> small<00:00:58.530> clip<00:00:58.890> i

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
going to be a very very small clip i

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.279 
going to be a very very small clip i
think<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.399> puts<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.359> range<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.690> 14<00:01:01.170> to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
think that puts it in the range of 14 to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.100 
think that puts it in the range of 14 to
18<00:01:01.320> bullet<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.280> each<00:01:02.399> mag<00:01:02.760> which<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.180> not<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.750> lot

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
18 bullet in each mag which is not a lot

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.570 
18 bullet in each mag which is not a lot
at<00:01:04.650> all<00:01:05.159> at<00:01:05.430> all<00:01:05.600> indeed<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:07.140> i<00:01:07.350> +<00:01:08.189> free<00:01:08.340> range

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
at all at all indeed but i + free range

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.370 
at all at all indeed but i + free range

legendary definitely definitely is not
good<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:16.920> if<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:17.490> take<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.850> look<00:01:17.909> at<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.689> image

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
good but if we take a look at the image

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.260 
good but if we take a look at the image
look<00:01:19.920> at<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> heirs<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.490> one<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.790> looks<00:01:20.970> very

look at the heirs and one it looks very

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.850 
look at the heirs and one it looks very
bright<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.840> doesn't<00:01:22.200> look<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.680> should<00:01:22.830> be

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
bright it doesn't look like it should be

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.710 
bright it doesn't look like it should be
there<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.310> doesn't<00:01:23.460> look<00:01:23.729> like<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.180> if<00:01:24.630> you

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
there it doesn't look like it if you

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.840 
there it doesn't look like it if you
look<00:01:24.840> at<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.990> PDW<00:01:25.290> crusher<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.040> looks<00:01:26.250> dark<00:01:26.580> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
look at a PDW crusher it looks dark and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.399 
look at a PDW crusher it looks dark and
set<00:01:27.090> into<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> background<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.110> look<00:01:28.320> at

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
set into the background but then look at

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.690 
set into the background but then look at
the<00:01:28.500> air<00:01:28.590> some<00:01:28.770> one<00:01:28.860> guy<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.250> looks<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:29.460> it's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the air some one guy it looks like it's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.670 
the air some one guy it looks like it's
been<00:01:29.759> placed<00:01:30.180> there<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.689> that's<00:01:31.200> why<00:01:31.350> that's

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
been placed there and that's why that's

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.100 
been placed there and that's why that's
why<00:01:31.740> i<00:01:31.829> think<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.189> may<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.850> fake<00:01:33.390> image<00:01:33.810> but
