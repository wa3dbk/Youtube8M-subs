into this what I've created and I

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.230 
into this what I've created and I
already<00:00:23.010> like<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.519> its<00:00:23.670> first<00:00:23.910> time<00:00:24.090> I've<00:00:24.150> ever

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
already like it its first time I've ever

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.370 
already like it its first time I've ever
made<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.080> style<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.180> on<00:00:27.180> DC<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.400> I<00:00:29.400> used

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
made a style and on DC and I used

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.600 
made a style and on DC and I used
different<00:00:31.380> things<00:00:31.800> from<00:00:32.189> different<00:00:32.279> places

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
different things from different places

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.720 
different things from different places
and<00:00:33.770> yeah<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.860> think<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.340> good<00:00:35.520> with<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
and yeah I think it's good with the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.380 
and yeah I think it's good with the
white<00:00:36.570> aura<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.260> all<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.649> colors<00:00:38.149> like<00:00:39.149> three

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
white aura and all the colors like three

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.299 
white aura and all the colors like three
different<00:00:39.570> colors<00:00:39.780> together<00:00:40.170> well<00:00:41.010> for

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
different colors together well for

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.840 
different colors together well for
including<00:00:41.760> black<00:00:43.160> ya<00:00:44.160> think<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.610> kind<00:00:44.789> of

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
including black ya think it kind of

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.410 
including black ya think it kind of
looks<00:00:45.059> sort<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.110> like<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:47.460> wings<00:00:47.879> look<00:00:48.180> sort

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and fee I used Kryptonian a bit much but

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.620 
and fee I used Kryptonian a bit much but
unlike<00:01:37.590> cover<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> top<00:01:38.220> things<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.790> think<00:01:39.479> it

unlike cover the top things I think it

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.230 
unlike cover the top things I think it
makes<00:01:39.780> more<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.020> an<00:01:40.140> impact<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:42.030> back

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
makes more of an impact and the back

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.800 
makes more of an impact and the back
which<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.290> sort<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.189> wings<00:01:44.430> which<00:01:45.329> looks

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.899 
which is that sort of wings which looks
like<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.170> dripping<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:46.950> really<00:01:47.729> cool

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
like it's dripping and it's really cool

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
that's fates faith and the Bell is

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.560 
that's fates faith and the Bell is
Aquaman<00:01:52.950> which<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> bit<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.850> wig<00:01:54.030> mixture

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
Aquaman which is a bit of a wig mixture

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.109 
Aquaman which is a bit of a wig mixture
but<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.110> kind<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.860> suits<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.759> mix<00:01:56.850> all<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
but it kind of suits it and mix all the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.420 
but it kind of suits it and mix all the
colors<00:01:57.390> together<00:01:57.680> and<00:01:58.680> yeah<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.250> got

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
colors together and yeah and it's got

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.720 
colors together and yeah and it's got
white<00:01:59.640> /<00:01:59.850> like<00:02:00.210> i<00:02:00.360> said<00:02:00.600> and

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
white / like i said and

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.520 
white / like i said and
yeah<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.600> been<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.840> few<00:02:04.080> things<00:02:04.290> mixed

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
yeah it's been a few things mixed

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.170 
yeah it's been a few things mixed
together<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.130> kept<00:02:05.400> it<00:02:05.610> with<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.880> theme<00:02:06.150> of

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
together but I kept it with the theme of

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.730 
together but I kept it with the theme of
like<00:02:07.020> spike<00:02:07.440> eNOS<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.130> bit<00:02:09.050> alien-like<00:02:10.050> and

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
like spike eNOS and bit alien-like and

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.940 
like spike eNOS and bit alien-like and
so<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.760> think<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:12.420> calm<00:02:13.050> quite<00:02:13.380> creative

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
so I think it's calm quite creative

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.090 
so I think it's calm quite creative
anyway<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.990> first<00:02:16.260> time<00:02:16.530> feat<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:16.890> quite

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
anyway so the first time feat is quite

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.280 
anyway so the first time feat is quite
good<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.690> tell<00:02:18.960> me<00:02:18.990> what<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.200> think
