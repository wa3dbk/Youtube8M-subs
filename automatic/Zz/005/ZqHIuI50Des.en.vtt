00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.830
 you know the tacos burritos like it 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.990
 they almost call a Mexican 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.770
 composed of a sort of piadina del 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.700
 meat chicken and very spaced 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.680
 delicious to eat even with 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.960
 vegetables slightly outlines this well 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.140
 video in short we will explain how to do 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.059
 ok then to make this recipe 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.030
 we need the following ingredients 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:36.890
 durum wheat semolina then yeast 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.100
 the beers the pizza is prepared for 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.829
 boiled but the eggs not centrally the 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.980
 chicken breast and extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.980
 olive 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.070
 ok then let's start by passing 250 g 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.629
 flour another container then 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.100
 we prepare 120 ml of water and we go to 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.739
 melt warm water in a 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.200
 melt a teaspoon of salt immediately 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.110
 in the meantime we pour a sachet of 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.970
 yeast equivalent to 25 grams each 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.979
 flour and let's add 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.979
 the equivalent of 2 3 teaspoons of oil 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.820
 meanwhile the salt is melting 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.399
 in warm water 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.439
 ok now first start mixing 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.210
 add the water and the salt that 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.770
 we have prepared previously is still 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.179
 help of a ladle of the hands 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.179
 I started mixing it 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.159
 ok now work a little with your hands for 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.810
 about 10 minutes so that the finger 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.640
 etc. this yeast also requires 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.860
 a teaspoon of sugar because yes 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.070
 active better after they left 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:54.140
 rest about 10 minutes 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.180
 we go to get it dirty and 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.009
 fun we go to dirty our own 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.020
 I work well and prepare it for 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.970
 divide it into several loaves that 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.649
 then in the year expenses for making 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.560
 I tortillas with myself a knife and using 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.900
 the method of the cutting section b to me 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:22.060
 still half through until 8 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:26.040
 ok baubles 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.040
 ok so let's see that they are eight 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.670
 great 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.040
 so now we take it individually with 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.180
 rolling pin with the help of the rolling pin and 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.739
 of a little flour because you don't 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.170
 attacks we go to spend them to make him 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.310
 in short, take a desired shape 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.480
 basically it must be circular 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.360
 be careful not to ruin them when you do 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.799
 they raise because it is simple also because 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.799
 we make them quite thin 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.180
 ok it's now one at a time we do them 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.590
 all and I won't let you see all of them 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.720
 networks that I have already made them in linen 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.310
 aside we do them one at a time and 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.810
 paolo we use to dirty them every 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.470
 layer with a little flour so that 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:14.370
 do not stick and now we move on to 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.700
 chicken preparation as you can 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.920
 to see the already cut chicken I had 500 g 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.540
 chicken breast cut it on 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.710
 trash all in and of the width of 2 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.730
 about centimeters 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:30.960
 for the overall width of the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.670
 chicken breast and now let's go to cook 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.040
 the 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.260
 the piadine in our expectation 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.670
 non-stick oil does not need to be added 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.230
 but we need to add nothing or support 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.970
 we simply wait for them to cook 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.160
 we see that after a couple of minutes 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.660
 already starting to be a little more 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.810
 crunchy takes on a consistency 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.880
 better and let them cook until 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.890
 I don't assume that typical color in short 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.200
 of the cracks on a point if you already know 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.140
 of tortillas and then see from a 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.190
 side are a bit like spotted because 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.959
 It is precisely the abrupt a bit the side 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.739
 meanwhile in another canvas we pour 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:15.180
 extra virgin olive oil and we prepare ourselves 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.650
 to cook our chicken the chicken 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.280
 that we have already cut the over before 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.290
 we are in this greased pan and it 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.040
 let's cook for about ten 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.080
 minutes until we see the 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.180
 wrists given weight to the typical color 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.919
 whitish chicken at this point 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.889
 add the water 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.750
 add and about 200 ml of water and the 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.190
 compound for burritos this is another 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.900
 that each seasonings in powder 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.050
 really good though a little too much 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.330
 however spicy today is in short in the 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.360
 complex and now we get it mixed 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.030
 for ten 10 20 minutes until it does 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.819
 we see that it almost absorbed the chicken 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.620
 has a unique consistency with dough that 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:59.830
 if you have created 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.750
 ok now it is boiling for 10 minutes 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.840
 we get them so I always have a little monster 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.729
 with the perfect ladle after about 10 15 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.550
 in short, it depends what fire you have 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.590
 we see that the chicken is ready to pull 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.790
 down and in the meantime also the wraps l 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.790
 yes if he hasn't cooked and twitter 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.389
 here we have now implanted these 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.960
 500 g of chicken see this do not you 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.280
 really good ok then we have there 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.080
 we put about an hour a 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.900
 prepare everything but you saw me 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.270
 made the chicken all over again and put on 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.310
 on the fifth last I have been made by 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.639
 finally zero with the flour 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.010
 the time has come for this art via vi 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.910
 i will let you know how they came and good 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.910
