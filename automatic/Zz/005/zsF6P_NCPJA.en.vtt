today to give you a tutorial on how to
make<00:00:12.690> these<00:00:13.259> three-dimensional<00:00:13.799> paper

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
make these three-dimensional paper

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.300 
make these three-dimensional paper
flowers<00:00:14.960> to<00:00:15.960> start<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.440> need<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.740> square<00:00:17.010> of

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
flowers to start you need to square of

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.820 
flowers to start you need to square of
pattern<00:00:17.789> paper<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.390> needs<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.869> be<00:00:19.020> even<00:00:19.560> all

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
pattern paper it needs to be even all

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.320 
pattern paper it needs to be even all
the<00:00:19.859> way<00:00:19.980> around<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.789> one<00:00:20.910> i'm<00:00:21.029> using<00:00:21.060> here

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
the way around so the one i'm using here

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.710 
the way around so the one i'm using here
is<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.750> 4<00:00:22.230> inch<00:00:22.410> square<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.300> you<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.449> want<00:00:24.689> to

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
is a 4 inch square and you just want to

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.480 
is a 4 inch square and you just want to
fold<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.199> diagonally<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.859> half<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.310> i'm

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
fold it diagonally in half like i'm

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.779 
fold it diagonally in half like i'm
doing<00:00:26.640> there<00:00:27.619> i<00:00:28.619> usually<00:00:29.310> use<00:00:29.340> double<00:00:29.760> sided

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
doing there i usually use double sided

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.099 
doing there i usually use double sided
pattern<00:00:30.269> paper<00:00:30.449> but<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.779> doesn't<00:00:31.019> really

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
pattern paper but it doesn't really

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.170 
pattern paper but it doesn't really
matter<00:00:31.489> because<00:00:32.489> you're<00:00:32.730> not<00:00:32.820> going<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.030> see

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
matter because you're not going to see

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.060 
matter because you're not going to see
the<00:00:33.510> inside<00:00:33.960> when<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> flowers<00:00:34.649> finished

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
the inside when the flowers finished

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.880 
the inside when the flowers finished
anyway<00:00:35.840> so<00:00:36.840> once<00:00:37.079> you've<00:00:37.200> done<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.410> full

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
anyway so once you've done that full

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.650 
anyway so once you've done that full
diagonally<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.730> want<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.180> fold<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
diagonally you want to just fold up the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.319 
diagonally you want to just fold up the
two<00:00:39.840> ends<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:40.770> I'm<00:00:40.890> doing<00:00:41.190> there<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.610> I

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
two ends just like I'm doing there and I

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.209 
two ends just like I'm doing there and I
tend<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.840> use<00:00:42.930> my<00:00:43.170> bone<00:00:43.320> folder<00:00:43.350> once<00:00:44.010> I've

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
tend to use my bone folder once I've

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.069 
tend to use my bone folder once I've
made<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.670> made<00:00:45.000> all<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.149> folds<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.899> kind

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
made it made all the folds just to kind

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.510 
made it made all the folds just to kind
of<00:00:46.170> give<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.440> good<00:00:46.590> crease<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.399> know

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
of give it a good crease so that I know

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.970 
of give it a good crease so that I know
that<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:47.969> going<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.360> keep<00:00:49.350> its<00:00:49.530> shape<00:00:49.590> once

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
that it's going to keep its shape once

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.299 
that it's going to keep its shape once
we're<00:00:50.190> ready<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.460> go<00:00:51.199> so<00:00:52.199> now<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.039> part

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
we're ready to go so now to do this part

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.950 
we're ready to go so now to do this part
here<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:53.940> want<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> lift<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.780> that

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
here you just want to lift up that

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.319 
here you just want to lift up that
folded<00:00:55.410> piece<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.820> there<00:00:57.030> and

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
folded piece that you have there and

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.470 
folded piece that you have there and
actually<00:00:57.629> push<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.260> down<00:00:58.500> flat<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
actually push it down flat so that the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.310 
actually push it down flat so that the
center<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.379> actually<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.160> creased<00:01:02.550> scene

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
center of it is actually a creased scene

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.560 
center of it is actually a creased scene
from<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.470> original<00:01:04.949> fold<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.519> then<00:01:06.060> you're

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
from the original fold and then you're

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.609 
from the original fold and then you're
going<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.780> want<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.990> take<00:01:07.080> your<00:01:07.200> bone<00:01:07.409> folder

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
going to want to take your bone folder

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.740 
going to want to take your bone folder
again<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.610> kind<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.939> crease<00:01:09.180> those<00:01:09.450> down

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
again and just kind of crease those down

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.429

so<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.110> they're<00:01:10.350> nice<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.770> folded<00:01:11.159> tight

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
so that they're nice and folded tight

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.590 
so that they're nice and folded tight
this<00:01:13.439> next<00:01:13.740> part<00:01:13.920> here<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.939> folding<00:01:15.270> down

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
this next part here is the folding down

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.830 
this next part here is the folding down

of the little peeks at the top of those

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.510 
of the little peeks at the top of those
triangle<00:01:18.840> pieces<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.500> when<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.460> you

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
triangle pieces and when you do this you

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.060 
triangle pieces and when you do this you
want<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.509> kind<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.049> just<00:01:22.590> kind<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.799> open

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
do that to each side sometimes you got

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.310 
do that to each side sometimes you got
to<00:01:42.210> kind<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.600> play<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.960> paper<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.259> little

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
to kind of play with the paper a little

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.960 
to kind of play with the paper a little
bit<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.740> get<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.040> fold<00:01:44.250> down<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.610> there<00:01:44.759> but

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
bit to get it to fold down in there but

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.850 
bit to get it to fold down in there but
once<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.720> do<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> couple<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.350> get<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> hang<00:01:46.740> of

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
once you do a couple you get the hang of

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.310 
once you do a couple you get the hang of
it<00:01:46.950> pretty<00:01:47.009> easily<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.990> I'm<00:01:48.990> just<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.259> to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
it pretty easily so I'm just going to

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.440 
it pretty easily so I'm just going to
increase<00:01:49.680> those<00:01:49.890> down<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.460> then<00:01:50.880> once<00:01:51.210> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
increase those down and then once you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.090 
increase those down and then once you
get<00:01:51.689> those<00:01:51.869> done<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.710> want<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.950> take

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
get those done you just want to take

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.999 
get those done you just want to take
those<00:01:54.020> two<00:01:55.020> side<00:01:55.259> pieces<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.799> you're<00:01:55.890> going

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
those two side pieces and you're going

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.770 
those two side pieces and you're going
to<00:01:56.070> actually<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.520> fold<00:01:56.820> them<00:01:56.909> over<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
to actually just fold them over on the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.179 
to actually just fold them over on the
crease<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.409> already<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
crease that you already have in the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.130 
crease that you already have in the
center<00:01:59.369> from<00:02:00.329> when<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.570> had<00:02:00.689> folded<00:02:01.020> it

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
center from when you had folded it

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.840 
center from when you had folded it
previously<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.979> you're<00:02:02.430> going<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.700> that

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
previously and you're going to do that

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.069 
previously and you're going to do that
on<00:02:02.969> both<00:02:03.000> sides<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:05.479> then<00:02:06.479> once<00:02:06.719> you've<00:02:06.899> done

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
on both sides and then once you've done

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.680 
on both sides and then once you've done
that<00:02:07.140> you're<00:02:07.860> going<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.250> crease<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.209> again<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
that you're going to crease it again and

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.180 
that you're going to crease it again and
then<00:02:09.989> you're<00:02:10.200> going<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.470> kind<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.860> use<00:02:11.009> your

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
then you're going to kind of use your

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.910 
then you're going to kind of use your
fingers<00:02:12.000> and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
fingers and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.500 
fingers and
push<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.070> into<00:02:14.220> each<00:02:14.460> other<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.970> give<00:02:15.180> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
push it into each other to give the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.800 
push it into each other to give the
pedal<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.230> little<00:02:16.290> bit<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:17.070> play<00:02:17.970> when<00:02:18.390> it's

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
pedal a little bit of play when it's

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.300 
pedal a little bit of play when it's
time<00:02:18.960> to<00:02:18.990> glue<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.620> just<00:02:19.740> kind<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.040> want<00:02:20.220> to

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
time to glue it you just kind of want to

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.460 
time to glue it you just kind of want to
make<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.150> shape<00:02:21.330> now<00:02:21.660> ahead<00:02:21.990> of<00:02:22.110> time<00:02:22.260> before

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
make the shape now ahead of time before

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.670 
make the shape now ahead of time before
you<00:02:22.710> get<00:02:22.890> your<00:02:22.980> hot<00:02:23.160> glue<00:02:23.370> going<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.680> so

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
you get your hot glue going on to it so

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.920 
you get your hot glue going on to it so
you<00:02:26.610> can<00:02:26.850> use<00:02:26.970> whatever<00:02:27.090> adhesive<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.750> would

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
you can use whatever adhesive you would

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.170 
you can use whatever adhesive you would
like<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.290> do<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.800> always<00:02:29.100> use<00:02:29.550> my<00:02:29.790> hot<00:02:30.030> glue

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
like to do this I always use my hot glue

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.600 
like to do this I always use my hot glue
just<00:02:30.750> because<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.410> paper<00:02:31.709> is<00:02:31.860> very<00:02:32.250> thick

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
just because the paper is very thick

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.120 
just because the paper is very thick
once<00:02:32.910> folded<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.630> you're<00:02:34.410> forcing<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:35.100> to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
once folded and you're forcing it to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.280 
once folded and you're forcing it to
kind<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.550> push<00:02:35.760> together<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.330> hold<00:02:36.660> like<00:02:37.260> a

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
kind of push together and hold like a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.860 
kind of push together and hold like a
round<00:02:37.860> shape<00:02:38.190> there<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.850> don't<00:02:39.450> want<00:02:39.660> the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
round shape there so you don't want the

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.260 
round shape there so you don't want the
adhesive<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.410> let<00:02:40.560> go<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:41.550> find<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.090> the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
adhesive to let go so I find that the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.270 
adhesive to let go so I find that the
glue<00:02:42.450> gun<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.840> definitely<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.470> best<00:02:43.709> option

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
glue gun is definitely the best option

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.640 
glue gun is definitely the best option
so<00:02:44.550> if<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.820> have<00:02:44.970> one<00:02:45.209> that's<00:02:45.500> exactly<00:02:46.500> what<00:02:46.620> I

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
so if you have one that's exactly what I

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.130 
so if you have one that's exactly what I
would<00:02:46.739> recommend<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.370> use<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.870> just

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
would recommend that you use so you just

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.380 
would recommend that you use so you just
want<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.380> go<00:02:49.530> ahead<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:50.010> glue<00:02:50.580> those<00:02:50.760> together

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
want to go ahead and glue those together

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.150 
want to go ahead and glue those together
just<00:02:51.900> like<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.260> just<00:02:52.290> did<00:02:52.560> there<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.070> that's

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
just like I just did there and that's

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.340 
just like I just did there and that's
actually<00:02:54.150> going<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.360> be<00:02:54.480> one<00:02:54.720> petal<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.200> your

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
actually going to be one petal of your

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.920 
actually going to be one petal of your
flower<00:02:55.730> now<00:02:56.730> I've<00:02:56.880> went<00:02:57.150> ahead<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.510> pre-made

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
flower now I've went ahead and pre-made

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.920 
flower now I've went ahead and pre-made
up<00:02:58.230> for<00:02:59.010> more<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.340> them<00:02:59.520> I<00:02:59.730> tend<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.510> do<00:03:00.660> five

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
up for more of them I tend to do five

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.900 
up for more of them I tend to do five
petal<00:03:01.350> flowers<00:03:01.770> I<00:03:02.040> just<00:03:02.340> like<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.610> look<00:03:02.640> of

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
petal flowers I just like the look of

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.360 
petal flowers I just like the look of
those<00:03:03.120> but<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.110> can<00:03:04.290> do<00:03:04.380> any<00:03:04.590> size<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:05.340> you

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
those but you can do any size that you

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.270 
those but you can do any size that you
want<00:03:06.020> by<00:03:07.020> just<00:03:07.380> increasing<00:03:07.560> or<00:03:08.070> decreasing

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
want by just increasing or decreasing

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.030 
want by just increasing or decreasing
how<00:03:08.850> many<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.510> petal<00:03:09.930> pieces<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.010> you

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
how many of the petal pieces that you

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.180 
how many of the petal pieces that you
make<00:03:11.480> so<00:03:12.480> now<00:03:12.840> once<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.230> we<00:03:13.470> have<00:03:13.650> those<00:03:13.860> all

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
make so now once that we have those all

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.010 
make so now once that we have those all
created<00:03:14.760> we<00:03:15.180> actually<00:03:15.390> have<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.780> glue<00:03:15.900> them

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
created we actually have to glue them

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.780 
created we actually have to glue them
together<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.380> make<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.769> flower<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.430> do

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
together to make the flower so to do

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.949 
together to make the flower so to do
that<00:03:17.820> you're<00:03:18.120> just<00:03:18.209> going<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.450> run<00:03:18.660> your<00:03:18.810> hot

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
that you're just going to run your hot

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.979 
that you're just going to run your hot
glue<00:03:19.110> gun<00:03:19.350> down<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:20.160> inside<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.090> one<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.900> the

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
glue gun down the inside of one of the

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.840 
glue gun down the inside of one of the
pedal<00:03:22.260> pieces<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.709> you've<00:03:22.830> made<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.250> then

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
pedal pieces that you've made and then

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.060 
pedal pieces that you've made and then
just<00:03:24.239> lay<00:03:24.690> just<00:03:25.140> like<00:03:25.260> I'm<00:03:25.380> doing<00:03:25.650> there<00:03:25.799> just

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
just lay just like I'm doing there just

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.979 
just lay just like I'm doing there just

glue sets and then you're just going to

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.640 
glue sets and then you're just going to
repeat<00:03:36.600> this<00:03:36.959> all<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.260> way<00:03:37.290> around<00:03:37.440> the
