00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:14.399
 we already assumed that the Pokémon franchise can be opened to 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:18.490
 several genres away from the original concept and for sample the third 

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:22.289
 pokemon mysterious world edition on nintendo ds with the subtitle of 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.759
 sky explorers 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.849
 as in explorers of time and darkness 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.059
 we will experience an adventure in the first person through the eyes of a 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.600
 boy or girl who has become pokémon after suffering an accident in the 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.290
 sea 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.660
 a friendly pokémon does not contract and will help us recover 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.780
 from here the adventure will take us through an unexplored world that 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.990
 we will have to discover under the orders of maestro luis brito 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.750
 delpo what guild 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.950
 at the time of starting a game for the first time in pokémon mysterious world 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.280
 they will give us a small personality test with which they will determine 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.930
 the pokémon that will star in the rest of the adventure will then leave us 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.630
 choose voluntarily from the pokémon partner 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.080
 these two main characters were irreplaceable for the rest of the game 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.800
 to complete it for the first time so it's convenient to think a good 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.080
 combination for the couple 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.240
 from here and as in the previous episodes we have a 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.780
 small town to explore to which they have added new venues to 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.990
 expand a little more the gameplay as is the spitak cafe where 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.400
 we can manufacture utensils or recycle them 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.460
 next to this we will have others already known as selective link and the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.030
 slogan cangas can 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.360
 or to the bank of the sculpture époque guild we will have three types of missions 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.740
 to meet in the dungeons 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.860
 those that are mandatory and allow the plot to advance then 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.540
 are pokémon commissions like escort them to certain floors of 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.560
 the dungeon 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.780
 or return lost items 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.260
 finally we will have the rewards two we will catch pokémon evildoers 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.000
 the most delinquent from the first to the last 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.360
 they have a constant number of floors according to which we visit 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.390
 but the floors will be formed to crack and will change every time we visit them 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.870
 well in which a few necessary to the huge with few hallways 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.269
 and other times the opposite happens 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.089
 at the end of each dungeon we will await an important find for the game 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.269
 a final enemy that will test our patience and our ability 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.229
 strategic 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.129
 the pokémon will move in the dungeons by means of a grid 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.039
 invisible 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.199
 and we can move in eight directions 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:26.429
 the pokémon 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.529
 to attack with his classic attacks of the franchise climb to levels 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.790
 and will learn attacks by the same methods as the main madman of 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.979
 pokémon including technical machines 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:40.629
 however in this game the attacks will have special effects related 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:41.679
 with the environment 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:44.679
 how to attack from a distance or only up close 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:46.439
 accept an enemy only 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.439
 or because now all the adversaries of the same room 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.129
 skills that better standards seem useless now can save our lives 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.129
 the game's argument has hardly changed 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:58.630
 also 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.980
 another important problem is that we can not evolve to any of 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.809
 our pokémon although they have increased their level enough 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:07.949
 de vido events in history 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:11.950
 the Pokémon will evolve when we have finished the game for the first time 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.550
 which makes many more morra frustrating something that recruits sa 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.299
 pokémon suitable in the guild 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.980
 both the graphic and the sound aspect remain unchanged 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.189
 since we are talking about a third version 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.889
 even so they could have added some graphical improvement or changes in the story 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.629
 there will not even be sounds emitted by the pokémon the duration of the game 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.509
 can be very extensive this month the player will continue the plot after 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:36.379
 finish the adventure for the first time 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.729
 since that's when interesting things 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.529
 putin to recruit legendary pokémon get into more secret morra 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:47.519
 we find special objects and your recruits will evolve but not 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.779
 reports all this having to previously overcome the adventure 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:51.539
 principal 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:53.840
 also in case we lack duration 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.729
 we can still play special episodes exclusive to this version 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:01.649
 where we will play with predefined teams that appear in the main plot 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.159
 but these adventures are more interesting 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.039
 for the story they tell more than for the young woman 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:12.109
 pokémon mysterious world sky explorers is a very difficult title and 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:13.219
 slow to play 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.449
 you have to take into account many factors 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.880
 and above all, it will depend on your good luck when it comes to exploring the 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:23.310
 dungeons and cut allies the title can cost a lot to the perimeter 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:25.770
 abandon it for being very frustrating 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.280
 Whoever wants to get hold of him should know that he is not so quick and easy to play 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.340
 like the original games and that you have to be more strategist 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.930
 those who played to previous deliveries that know that it's more than 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:36.610
 same 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.129
 a copy with unattractive additions and already have a previous edition 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.279
 On the other hand if you are a fan of the strategy and it seems striking that 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:47.150
 is little populated genre has been adorned with pets 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.890
 Interchangeable Nintendo 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.760
 is a game that fits your needs
