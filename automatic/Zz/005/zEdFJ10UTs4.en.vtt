00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.060 
I just stacked my games in them and this
works<00:01:50.750> really<00:01:51.109> well<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:51.590> make<00:01:51.740> sure<00:01:51.770> you

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
works really well you make sure you

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.429 
works really well you make sure you
don't<00:01:52.189> poke<00:01:52.579> holes<00:01:52.909> in<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.929> bag<00:01:54.109> with<00:01:54.409> the

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
don't poke holes in the bag with the

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.260 
don't poke holes in the bag with the
corners<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:55.310> they<00:01:55.520> got<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:55.729> be<00:01:55.820> kind<00:01:55.969> of<00:01:56.149> loose

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
corners so they got to be kind of loose

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.929 
corners so they got to be kind of loose
in<00:01:56.509> there<00:01:56.719> but<00:01:57.530> once<00:01:58.189> you<00:01:58.310> pack<00:01:58.490> them<00:01:58.610> up<00:01:58.759> like

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
in there but once you pack them up like

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.020 
in there but once you pack them up like
this<00:01:59.530> totally<00:02:00.530> better<00:02:00.679> to<00:02:00.920> store<00:02:01.219> easier<00:02:01.909> to

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
this totally better to store easier to

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.359 
this totally better to store easier to
manage<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:02.479> handle<00:02:02.689> -<00:02:03.079> I<00:02:03.109> mean<00:02:03.439> I'm<00:02:03.860> holding

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
manage and handle - I mean I'm holding

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.469 
manage and handle - I mean I'm holding
20<00:02:05.240> uh<00:02:06.009> Atari<00:02:07.009> 2600<00:02:07.459> carts<00:02:07.969> you<00:02:08.060> know<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.179> stack

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
20 uh Atari 2600 carts you know a stack

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.210 
20 uh Atari 2600 carts you know a stack
of<00:02:08.509> 2600<00:02:09.319> cards<00:02:09.560> you'd<00:02:09.679> be<00:02:09.799> trying<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.069> balance

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
of 2600 cards you'd be trying to balance

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.910 
of 2600 cards you'd be trying to balance
and<00:02:10.610> you<00:02:10.940> know<00:02:11.030> pack<00:02:11.480> away<00:02:11.660> but<00:02:12.470> this<00:02:12.590> is<00:02:12.769> much

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
and you know pack away but this is much

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.559 
and you know pack away but this is much
better<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:13.220> can<00:02:13.489> completely<00:02:13.940> submerge<00:02:14.330> this

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
better you can completely submerge this

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.680 
better you can completely submerge this
in<00:02:14.629> water<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.560> games<00:02:15.830> would<00:02:16.069> be<00:02:16.129> fine

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
in water the games would be fine

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.030 
in water the games would be fine
and<00:02:18.019> then<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.260> just<00:02:18.410> put<00:02:18.560> them<00:02:18.650> in<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:18.830> tote

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
and then you just put them in the tote

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.339 
and then you just put them in the tote
with<00:02:19.760> all<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.390> other<00:02:20.540> ones<00:02:20.750> there's<00:02:21.170> some

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349

Coleco<00:02:21.860> games<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.730> their<00:02:23.390> eyes<00:02:23.540> about<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.930> add

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
Coleco games and their eyes about to add

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.350 
Coleco games and their eyes about to add
some<00:02:24.349> Famicom<00:02:24.829> cartridges<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.840> here<00:02:27.200> we<00:02:27.290> go

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
some Famicom cartridges and here we go

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.089 
some Famicom cartridges and here we go
I've<00:02:29.360> just<00:02:29.660> packed<00:02:29.870> away<00:02:31.090> 100<00:02:32.090> Famicom<00:02:32.540> carts

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.250 
I've just packed away 100 Famicom carts
and<00:02:34.099> it<00:02:34.220> was<00:02:34.310> that<00:02:34.489> easy<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:35.660> that's<00:02:36.140> something

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
and it was that easy so that's something

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.509 
and it was that easy so that's something
to<00:02:36.380> consider<00:02:36.470> when<00:02:36.829> you<00:02:36.950> pack<00:02:37.130> your<00:02:37.340> game

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
to consider when you pack your game

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.130 
to consider when you pack your game
consoles<00:02:37.970> in<00:02:38.120> these<00:02:38.299> you<00:02:38.599> can<00:02:38.750> also<00:02:38.900> if<00:02:39.110> you

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
consoles in these you can also if you

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.620 
consoles in these you can also if you
want<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.410> add<00:02:39.530> an<00:02:39.709> extra<00:02:40.130> layer<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.340> protection

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
want to add an extra layer of protection

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.970 
want to add an extra layer of protection
put<00:02:41.630> them<00:02:41.720> in<00:02:41.810> garbage<00:02:41.959> bags<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.680> just<00:02:42.799> tie

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
put them in garbage bags and just tie

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.280 
put them in garbage bags and just tie
really<00:02:43.250> tight<00:02:43.610> knots<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:44.870> doesn't<00:02:45.200> mean

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
really tight knots that doesn't mean

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.100 
really tight knots that doesn't mean
there's<00:02:45.519> 100%<00:02:46.519> waterproof<00:02:47.209> because<00:02:47.810> water

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
there's 100% waterproof because water

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.720 
there's 100% waterproof because water
could<00:02:48.349> slip<00:02:48.560> through<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.920> night<00:02:49.160> but<00:02:49.489> I<00:02:49.519> mean

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
could slip through that night but I mean

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.160 
could slip through that night but I mean
it<00:02:49.819> would<00:02:49.940> have<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.150> be<00:02:50.180> completely<00:02:50.480> submerged

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
it would have to be completely submerged

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.289 
it would have to be completely submerged
for<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.100> long<00:02:52.250> period<00:02:52.609> of<00:02:52.639> time<00:02:52.700> before<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.180> could

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
for a long period of time before I could

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.460 
for a long period of time before I could
really<00:02:53.480> do<00:02:53.630> some<00:02:53.780> damage<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:54.109> the<00:02:54.260> console<00:02:54.769> so

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
really do some damage to the console so

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.870 
really do some damage to the console so
until<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:57.620> can<00:02:57.650> pull<00:02:57.950> them<00:02:58.069> out<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.280> slam<00:02:58.609> or

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
until you can pull them out and slam or

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.400 
until you can pull them out and slam or
if<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:59.030> just<00:02:59.060> have<00:02:59.299> stuff<00:02:59.840> that<00:03:00.079> you<00:03:00.290> know
