00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.340
 good I will not go by four 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.350
 paths 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.180
 rayman 3 and in my opinion one of the best 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.320
 rayman is up to date I mean 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.969
 as much as the first emanates was 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.260
 excellent so much the rayman released 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.480
 recently daddy are good or even 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.619
 very good and as much on mm3 is the one that 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.199
 I will remember in all cases of 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.310
 figure good game but it's also about the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.390
 Children's deck ase but I you 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.580
 admit to having taken a lot more 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.349
 pleasure to go and 23 + rayman 2 or 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.630
 smart wine and I will explain 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.949
 why they have nothing this rayman will have 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.260
 much talked about him and at the same 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.640
 time he has what / stand universe and 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.170
 atmosphere we are on something 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.060
 much more different than the second 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.410
 so is quoted as actually with a 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.180
 story that is taken seriously and 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.100
 place the universe a lot more zany 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.720
 besides, an almost omnipresent point 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.070
 in this fact badly it's the humor that we 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.420
 understand quickly enough from the first 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.280
 minutes of the game happy level gameplay 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.450
 would be badly sent the sauce to get 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.400
 not deceive anyway it is almost the 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.050
 same as the previous shutter 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.120
 that he was just relaxed 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.130
 I am thinking in particular of the side pack that his 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.690
 main pivot of the non- combat system 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.640
 but the real addition in terms of gameplay 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.400
 in this case man 3 it was necessary 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.710
 say the blue suits for the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.030
 bow species electrified the red with 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.750
 the fists hyper powerful he smashes 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.850
 everything in their path 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.800
 the yellow with the propeller that made us 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.560
 steal the green that shrank the 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.280
 bordered enemies and of course my favorite 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.800
 Custom 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.960
 the yellow finally the orange rather there with 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.980
 a point 1006 remote control and then there 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.909
 by cons it was really all 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.500
 tschannen what 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.270
 in short, I do not even explain how 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.830
 I was all football go but the screen is 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.170
 since my little slap of the time 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.120
 it was revealing three also graphically 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.500
 the game sent the crab pate 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.750
 textures and writes 3d models 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.200
 superbly well animated model it was 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.050
 fluid 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.510
 Spanish was short my little gamecube 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.040
 well I was proud add to that 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.930
 a good sound system worthy of the name but 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.760
 really one of this name I mean with 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.750
 memorable themes after I could 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.790
 tell you about the life of the game 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.200
 hard after 20 hours with all the 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.670
 mini games that had inside 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.440
 I could tell you about the scenario 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.260
 really wacky characters 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.840
 endearing charismatic rayman of the 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.070
 globox really very funny and no but I 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.900
 think all this to my colleagues have it 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.880
 already done good I think you have it 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.590
 included in all cases the 23 I 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.810
 kiffe and for I replay it I always 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.220
 this nostalgia is together - who tells me 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.320
 said 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.310
 from the kernel it makes me happy that you 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.620
 get out of the closet in this third opus 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.460
 rayman always arrives voiced his style 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.590
 and his creativity 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.630
 the landscapes are beautiful and mesmerizing 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.880
 visually nothing three spirit matters 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.470
 rayman 2 may rayman 3 is not afraid of 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.720
 put a lot of colors in focus 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.860
 to be downright psychedelic the range 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.390
 of environments is different 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.920
 high quality textures make 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.870
 really a huge difference 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.790
 it's really very pleasant to the eye 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.380
 the visuals especially in the 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.110
 Skateboard phases sound beautiful and colorful 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.910
 and once again in a juror wrong the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.190
 soundtrack is just great 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.900
 very worked and perfectly glue 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.770
 in the world 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.990
 if there is a fault in the 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.730
 visual presentation of rayman 3 is 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.860
 very important to emphasize this is the 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.900
 camera like for example when we 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.110
 goes down the narrow lanes the camera 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.400
 will feel a little jerky too I have 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.930
 found the story a bit confusing at 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.070
 some moments rather slow to start 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.990
 a little vague 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.310
 I find the objective of certain levels 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.890
 a bit difficult to find 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.180
 or I'm not good at it 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.130
 then the dialogues in the game are 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.840
 really great but the voice of globox 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.840
 can be a little embarrassing sometimes 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.989
 nevertheless the six teens are very funny 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.370
 and all the characters are endearing 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.019
 rayman 3 but definitely big 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.420
 focus on the key fight raimon 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.040
 rayman chair is equipped with super 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.959
 powers and it strengthens the gameplay 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.760
 I find that there is a great variety 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.140
 actions such as levels 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.209
 what they are asking for is really a 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.820
 high color very fun and no 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.890
 without difficulty in summarizing the 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.019
 things rayman 3 morocco road is a 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.250
 excellent 3d platform game it's 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.560
 one of the platform experiences is 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.299
 more satisfying but that I am 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.100
 feature-rich quest 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.230
 main seems a little too short 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.030
 nevertheless ubisoft was able to maintain 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.680
 perfectly the image of this games icon 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.440
 video for the pleasure of his fans 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.860
 this game will definitely have marked my 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.049
 childhood 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.710
 especially thanks to its magical atmosphere 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.410
 fairy and so special 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.240
 at rayman 3 the first time I 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.370
 played this game it was at its release in 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.890
 2003 I was then 12 years old at this time 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.310
 and I spent all my time not bad and 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.900
 I am about 90% of the pub rahman iii 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.400
 relies on his jokes smashing is 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.650
 often only very ripe to get out of 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.390
 pics with every action we make of 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.890
 mocking remarks when we zoom in on 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.540
 exclamations of joy against successful 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.830
 NPCs who follow us will find 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.050
 always a way to express their 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.600
 felt about how we play and 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.180
 even on places where one beats as well 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.770
 the game takes the player as an accomplice and 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.060
 gives the impression that it is part of 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.430
 game it's not just the person 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.680
 who controls the main character and 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.210
 I'm sure that's where this game is 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.060
 has become cult and unforgettable for 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.560
 all the people who played in 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.420
 terms of graphics 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.010
 this game is just a pearl even again 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.780
 today graphics flatters the eye 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.480
 career man has a whole universe that 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.640
 it is clean and especially who is well 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.110
 detailed and inspired today we 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.990
 can play even in its round version 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.430
 hd without telling myself that I at magic precisely 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.430
 because are put in his universe 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.360
 continues to amaze us 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.740
 as I said I was twelve 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.720
 after a shock I played this game on 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.640
 ps2 at this age we do not pay attention 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.590
 to the details that the game offers us 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.870
 we can not really define why 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.150
 the game is good and why we go 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.980
 a lot of time on at 12 years old a game 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.930
 good because he's funny or because he 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.110
 we are talking about he joined lately 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.490
 to put Jean back in my head I saw this 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.740
 that they made this title a very good 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.990
 day orders respond well 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.150
 the blocks are better defined the scenario 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.710
 is simple and complete both the 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.810
 gameplay is pretty simple time together 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.250
 and even if we die many times of 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.440
 the goal always makes us want 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.660
 to continue playing to discover the 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.580
 next gags just as well as 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.660
 know what the unqualified 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.750
 besides, one of the great attractions 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.870
 of this scenario for a 12-year-old kid and 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.700
 all the costumes of rayman game with the 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.230
 kim in his level design but the score 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.100
 end of level does not make it clear 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.530
 that not to search the area 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.120
 at least not enough for 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.220
 find all the parcels table to find 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.230
 and cash 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.550
 more if the game is overall simple 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.720
 that does not mean that we are going 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.960
 finish day in 30 minutes 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.040
 oh no rayman 3 can boast 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.450
 to have a fairly long life 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.620
 consequent filled with bumps are 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.090
 always and gameplay phases 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.740
 different from level to level 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.360
 good I admit that certain phases 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.600
 come back quite often as the 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.740
 levels of some for that matter if you 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.450
 find the game too easy 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.820
 wait to surf on platforms 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.370
 narrow all in a decor to 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.870
 flashy colors casseneuil and gives us 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.230
 hard to distinguish platform us 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.610
 hear short I follow that all 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.740
 people who played this game get 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.510
 very well reminiscent of these phases of 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.550
 platform to come back on bumps 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.620
 we can see that their part of life 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.110
 is larger and give you not 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.420
 badly of time to beat them 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.190
 in conclusion I would say that this game knew 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.900
 mark his players by the simplicity of 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.690
 taken in hand especially for a game of 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.630
 platform 3d of the time 2003 I you 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.460
 recalls very correct graphics and 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.130
 especially varied and detailed which gives a 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.990
 absolute coherence to the universe all 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.790
 packed in humor that still puts 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:14.470
 today makes me laugh and 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.470
 always just according to the situation
