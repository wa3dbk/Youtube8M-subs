00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.590
 hi how are you doing 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.550
 We are here to answer a question 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.180
 What does the bartender do in this case? 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.330
 through youtube asks us what 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.689
 I do if I have a cable with three cables 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.059
 inside I have to put the one of all 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.400
 the earth he is talking about a 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.270
 150 volts connection 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.000
 look at the sea more I think that in any 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.310
 case you connect something always the 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.440
 ground connection has to be about 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.460
 all especially talking about current 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.490
 alternates then always yes or yes when 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.340
 you have some cable like this 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.730
 example where surely inside 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.340
 we have the three connectors that one goes to 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.070
 come to earth the other will be the live 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.830
 and the other one is going to be the neutral one then 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.040
 between these two we are going to have the tension 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.229
 of which he is speaking to us and this 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.590
 is the earth the earth is a cable 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.600
 that connects for security then if 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.880
 the province cable the land has 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.530
 to be placed 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.740
 there could be cases where we are not going to 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.320
 use because equipment that is 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.780
 totally isolated that does not have any 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.700
 risk is possible there are many 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.040
 current equipment that come with 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.110
 special protection which 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.050
 handle only with these two 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.120
 cables but I would say that when we do 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.740
 a connection with a cable 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.440
 always put or try to put the 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.720
 ground connection then let's go to 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.370
 the wall or the socket that we take where 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.550
 we always take tension with the 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.860
 possibility of taking us from the earth 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.990
 thanks and good any query that 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.110
 do not hesitate to contact us again 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.570
