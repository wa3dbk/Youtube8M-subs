00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.040
 Hello Polynesians! How are you? 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.800
 My name is Lesslie and today I am going to show you a delicious 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.320
 Pizza recipe, you know we're in the month of pizza, and I'm going to show you ... 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.740
 That sweet pizza delight, I know you're going to say what's up with you, Lesslie? But is that 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.120
 in truth, it tastes very rich, it seems good ... 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.310
 I will not tell you what it is and if I already 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.820
 they are already going to know what it is, but I made two pizzas, this recipe can make it 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.940
 with his family or his mother or his brothers because he is very sweet and all the time they are going to love each other 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.550
 eat all, all the ingredients, I really had to contain a lot to not finish 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.820
 the ingredients, because if not, I was not going to teach them anything. 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.949
 But you can accompany 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.129
 this pizza with milk or coffee, or coffee with milk as you like, but as a 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.640
 I really like milk, I'm a little calf, in fact my mom says I'm a little calf because 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.720
 I drink a lot of milk, everything, everything I accompany with milk, good everything sweet, not everything ... 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.820
 But I hope you like it, I did it with a lot, a lot of love and let's see it. 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.640
 It's very easy to make this pizza, in this case I'm going to make it from apple pie but you can 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.200
 make the flavor that you like. 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.000
 And we're going to need 400 g of pizza dough, nuts 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.640
 whole, a little flour, sugar, two apples cut into squares, and cinnamon. 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.080
 We are going to put a little flour, on the surface where we are going to put our dough, this serves us 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.860
 so that it does not stick to us, and we're going to flatten it. 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.970
 Now let's mold or pinch a little bit 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.820
 the edge of the dough so that the mixture does not drain, then we will make our mixture. 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.280
 In a bowl we are going to put the cut apples, 3 tablespoons of sugar approximately, 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.100
 nuts, cinnamon to taste and a little flour. 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.250
 This is so that the mixture becomes viscous 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.600
 instead of aguadita, we stir very well and then we expand it in our pizza. 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:03.120
 Preheat the oven for 5 minutes at 200 ° and put the pizza for 20 minutes equal to 200 ° 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.770
 Once the 20 minutes have passed, we take our pizza out of the oven and 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.390
 easy is to make this delicious apple pie pizza, I really love this pizza 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.700
 more when I accompany her with a glass of cold milk. 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.240
 OH! It tastes delicious. 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.480
 To make a delicious 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.680
 chocolate pizza, we are going to need 300 gr of pizza dough, hazelnut cream or any 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.900
 another creamy chocolate, some delicious miniature chocolates, and chocolate chips. 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.860
 The first thing we are going to do is expand, our mass in the mold that we are going to put in the oven. 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.200
 Then we will put a layer of hazelnut cream all over the pizza as if it were our sauce 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.090
 of tomato, now you're going to put all the chocolates and chocolate chips you want, really 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.620
 the more you put it, the more delicious it tastes. 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.549
 Now let's put our pizza in the oven 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.840
 for 15 to 20 minutes at approximately 200 °. 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.500
 When the 15 have already passed 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.400
 or 20 minutes, we take out our delicious chocolate pizza and to give it better presentation 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.880
 We put some sugar in our pizza. 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.939
 And now we can eat this 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.040
 Delicious chocolate pizza, the same with a glass of cold milk. 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.870
 Oh! these pizzas know 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.580
 very, very rich in truth I'm not lying to me I loved the 2. 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.760
 Have you seen that they are super rich and very easy to make? 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.280
 You know and I'll tell you again that the only problem 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.439
 It's like the pizza dough, but you can go to the bakery, a little girl, a 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.400
 Big, what they want and tell them to sell them a little bit of dough to roll. 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.620
 You already know that I love receiving all your photos and they motivate me to keep teaching them things 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.880
 nice delicious, easy, so you can do them. 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.820
 So, you will not see any 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.780
 except that they send me this photograph of this pizza, and tell me here below that 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.520
 Pizza type you want me to teach you how to do the next week. 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.860
 See you in the next video. 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.960
 Goodbye Polynesians! I love them!
