the ACC now I know you and I have

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.880 
the ACC now I know you and I have
disagreed<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.940> fair<00:00:06.540> amount<00:00:06.629> about<00:00:07.109> Georgia

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
disagreed a fair amount about Georgia

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.560 
disagreed a fair amount about Georgia
Tech<00:00:08.189> over<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.580> years<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.090> think<00:00:09.120> it<00:00:09.420> comes

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
Tech over the years and I think it comes

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.320 
Tech over the years and I think it comes
down<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:10.110> oftentimes<00:00:11.070> Paul<00:00:11.670> Johnson<00:00:12.179> has<00:00:12.300> been

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
down to oftentimes Paul Johnson has been

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.070 
down to oftentimes Paul Johnson has been
able<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:13.340> take<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.490> talent<00:00:14.880> he<00:00:15.000> has<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.599> do<00:00:16.049> a

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
able to take the talent he has and do a

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.660 
able to take the talent he has and do a
little<00:00:16.500> better<00:00:16.680> than<00:00:17.010> what<00:00:17.160> paper<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.640> paper

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
little better than what paper the paper

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.310 
little better than what paper the paper
looks<00:00:18.180> like<00:00:18.420> now<00:00:18.600> when<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.810> look<00:00:18.900> at<00:00:19.080> Georgia

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
looks like now when you look at Georgia

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.560 
looks like now when you look at Georgia
Tech<00:00:19.439> this<00:00:19.800> year<00:00:19.980> what<00:00:20.100> are<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.220> seeing<00:00:20.570> yeah

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
Tech this year what are you seeing yeah

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.060 
Tech this year what are you seeing yeah
and<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.990> was<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.199> case<00:00:22.230> last<00:00:22.529> year<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.980> think

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and that was the case last year I think

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.160 
and that was the case last year I think
if<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.730> take<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.939> look<00:00:24.180> at<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.390> survey<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.840> all

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
if you take a look at a survey of all

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.290 
if you take a look at a survey of all
the<00:00:25.410> magazines<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.279> all<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.849> preseason

pick<00:00:29.369> Georgia<00:00:29.760> Tech<00:00:30.000> was<00:00:30.179> fourth<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
pick Georgia Tech was fourth in the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.440 
pick Georgia Tech was fourth in the
coastal<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:32.669> one<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.880> those<00:00:33.059> people

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
coastal and I was one of those people

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.180 
coastal and I was one of those people
that<00:00:33.480> had<00:00:33.750> them<00:00:33.870> forth<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.829> know<00:00:34.950> one

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
that had them forth and you know one

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.240 
that had them forth and you know one
point<00:00:35.460> last<00:00:35.610> year<00:00:35.820> 6<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.480> 0<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.840> number<00:00:37.829> 12<00:00:38.100> in

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
point last year 6 and 0 and number 12 in

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.100 
point last year 6 and 0 and number 12 in
the<00:00:38.340> country<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.850> also<00:00:39.030> knocked<00:00:39.390> off<00:00:39.570> Clemson

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
the country and also knocked off Clemson

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.440 
the country and also knocked off Clemson
so<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.320> agree<00:00:40.890> Paul<00:00:41.160> Johnson<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> guy<00:00:41.940> that

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
so I agree Paul Johnson is a guy that

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.330 
so I agree Paul Johnson is a guy that
always<00:00:42.660> gets<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> most<00:00:43.350> out<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.890> town<00:00:44.100> on

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
always gets the most out of the town on

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.920 
always gets the most out of the town on
hand<00:00:44.610> when<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.910> look<00:00:45.059> at<00:00:45.210> Georgia<00:00:45.450> Tech<00:00:45.570> this

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
hand when you look at Georgia Tech this

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.840 
hand when you look at Georgia Tech this
year<00:00:46.170> they're<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.250> solid<00:00:47.489> once

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
year they're going to be solid once

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.430 
year they're going to be solid once
again<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.210> thought<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> second<00:00:49.050> half<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
again I thought the second half of the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.590 
again I thought the second half of the
year<00:00:49.469> last<00:00:49.800> year<00:00:50.010> 7<00:00:50.850> Washington's

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
year last year 7 Washington's

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.810 
year last year 7 Washington's
performance<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.320> quarterback<00:00:52.860> was<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> little

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
performance a quarterback was a little

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.430 
performance a quarterback was a little
on<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.300> he<00:00:54.449> sighed<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.719> think<00:00:55.170> he'll<00:00:55.320> be

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
on the if he sighed I think he'll be

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.260 
on the if he sighed I think he'll be
challenged<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.399> starting<00:00:56.850> quarterback

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
challenged for that starting quarterback

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.330 
challenged for that starting quarterback
job<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:58.140> they've<00:00:58.289> got<00:00:58.320> my<00:00:58.559> number<00:00:58.770> 12<00:00:59.039> rated

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
running backs I was very disappointed in

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.520 
running backs I was very disappointed in
the<00:01:03.390> spring<00:01:03.780> when<00:01:03.960> they<00:01:04.110> lost<00:01:04.290> their

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the spring when they lost their

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.109 
the spring when they lost their
outstanding<00:01:04.769> linebacker<00:01:05.189> brunette<00:01:05.970> who's

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
outstanding linebacker brunette who's

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.700

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
going to be out for the year I thought

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.679 
going to be out for the year I thought
he<00:01:07.860> was<00:01:07.950> perhaps<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.580> best<00:01:08.880> defensive<00:01:09.479> player

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
he was perhaps the best defensive player

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.289 
he was perhaps the best defensive player
last<00:01:10.020> year<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.860> overall<00:01:11.220> defensively<00:01:11.909> I

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
last year but overall defensively I

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.600 
last year but overall defensively I
think<00:01:12.840> they<00:01:12.960> still<00:01:13.229> look<00:01:13.470> salad<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.070> read<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
think they still look salad and read the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.520 
think they still look salad and read the
reason<00:01:14.909> i<00:01:14.970> picked<00:01:15.180> Georgia<00:01:15.570> Tech<00:01:15.869> third<00:01:16.259> in

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
good game in the same thing with Alabama

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.789 
good game in the same thing with Alabama
you<00:03:55.480> know<00:03:55.600> a<00:03:55.630> lot<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:55.840> teams<00:03:56.170> get<00:03:56.380> blown<00:03:56.590> out<00:03:56.620> by

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
you know a lot of teams get blown out by

you know a lot of teams get blown out by
Alabama<00:03:57.370> in<00:03:57.519> that<00:03:57.639> first<00:03:57.850> game<00:03:57.940> they<00:03:58.600> lost<00:03:58.840> by

Alabama in that first game they lost by
10<00:03:59.380> so<00:03:59.650> i<00:03:59.680> think<00:03:59.799> the<00:04:00.040> losses<00:04:00.459> in<00:04:00.609> the<00:04:00.639> openers

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
10 so i think the losses in the openers

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.180 
10 so i think the losses in the openers
those<00:04:01.150> in<00:04:01.630> those<00:04:01.750> two<00:04:02.019> was<00:04:02.680> due<00:04:02.950> to<00:04:03.069> the<00:04:03.100> fact

teams<00:04:55.270> coordinator<00:04:55.509> and<00:04:56.020> then<00:04:56.110> after<00:04:56.830> the

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
teams coordinator and then after the

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.800 
teams coordinator and then after the
season<00:04:57.340> was<00:04:57.490> over<00:04:57.520> finally<00:04:58.090> higher<00:04:58.419> on<00:04:58.629> one<00:04:58.780> I

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
season was over finally higher on one I

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.170 
season was over finally higher on one I
think<00:04:58.990> that's<00:04:59.319> big<00:04:59.530> I've<00:04:59.979> always<00:05:00.490> put<00:05:00.819> a<00:05:00.849> great

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
think that's big I've always put a great

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.600 
think that's big I've always put a great
emphasis<00:05:01.659> on<00:05:01.870> special<00:05:02.319> teams<00:05:02.500> and<00:05:02.830> I<00:05:03.370> think

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
emphasis on special teams and I think

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.939 
emphasis on special teams and I think
having<00:05:03.819> a<00:05:04.030> coach<00:05:04.270> that<00:05:04.300> just<00:05:04.840> specifically<00:05:05.740> is

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
having a coach that just specifically is

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.189 
having a coach that just specifically is
working<00:05:06.370> on<00:05:06.460> special<00:05:06.909> teams<00:05:07.060> makes<00:05:07.840> it<00:05:08.020> more

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
working on special teams makes it more

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.409 
working on special teams makes it more
of<00:05:08.379> a<00:05:08.500> priority<00:05:08.530> and<00:05:09.099> with<00:05:09.250> coach<00:05:09.490> grow<00:05:09.819> you

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
of a priority and with coach grow you

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:11.760 
of a priority and with coach grow you
know<00:05:10.449> he's<00:05:10.629> got<00:05:10.840> some<00:05:11.080> pretty<00:05:11.259> confusing

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
know he's got some pretty confusing

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.279 
know he's got some pretty confusing
defenses<00:05:12.520> with<00:05:12.699> the<00:05:12.819> 34<00:05:13.360> I<00:05:13.389> think<00:05:13.930> the<00:05:14.020> first

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
defenses with the 34 I think the first

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.430 
defenses with the 34 I think the first
year<00:05:14.590> with<00:05:15.340> Georgia<00:05:15.789> Tech<00:05:16.030> allowing<00:05:16.659> 372

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
year with Georgia Tech allowing 372

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.529 
year with Georgia Tech allowing 372
yards<00:05:17.590> in<00:05:18.039> this<00:05:18.159> first<00:05:18.460> year<00:05:18.729> there<00:05:18.940> that<00:05:19.419> was

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
yards in this first year there that was

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.119 
yards in this first year there that was
a<00:05:19.569> lot<00:05:19.779> with<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.139> players<00:05:20.409> trying<00:05:20.800> to<00:05:20.919> grasp

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
a lot with the players trying to grasp

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:22.950 
a lot with the players trying to grasp
those<00:05:21.400> schemes<00:05:21.789> but<00:05:22.060> I<00:05:22.120> think<00:05:22.599> it's<00:05:22.750> one<00:05:22.930> of

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
those schemes but I think it's one of

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.570 
those schemes but I think it's one of
those<00:05:23.169> who<00:05:23.349> are<00:05:23.379> if<00:05:23.500> you<00:05:23.590> have<00:05:23.620> a<00:05:23.740> veteran<00:05:24.219> unit

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
those who are if you have a veteran unit

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.730 
those who are if you have a veteran unit
and<00:05:25.509> now<00:05:25.689> the<00:05:25.750> players<00:05:25.960> are<00:05:26.289> in<00:05:26.379> their<00:05:26.500> third

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
and now the players are in their third

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.409 
and now the players are in their third
year<00:05:26.770> but<00:05:27.310> I<00:05:27.400> think<00:05:27.639> L<00:05:27.759> grows<00:05:28.029> one<00:05:28.270> of<00:05:28.360> the

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
year but I think L grows one of the

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.179 
year but I think L grows one of the
better<00:05:28.599> defensive<00:05:28.840> coaches<00:05:29.590> out<00:05:29.740> there<00:05:29.800> so<00:05:30.159> I

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:30.189 
better defensive coaches out there so I

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:33.089 
better defensive coaches out there so I
love<00:05:30.789> the<00:05:31.060> Paul<00:05:31.840> Johnson<00:05:31.870> on<00:05:32.469> offense<00:05:32.919> they'll

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
love the Paul Johnson on offense they'll

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.550 
love the Paul Johnson on offense they'll
grow<00:05:33.310> on<00:05:33.520> defense<00:05:33.940> combination<00:05:34.629> when<00:05:35.469> you

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
grow on defense combination when you

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.890 
grow on defense combination when you
look<00:05:35.740> at<00:05:35.860> that<00:05:35.979> offense<00:05:36.460> Phil<00:05:36.849> you<00:05:37.419> have<00:05:37.569> Tevin

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
look at that offense Phil you have Tevin

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.659 
look at that offense Phil you have Tevin

see Georgia Tech coming up with the big
plays<00:05:58.810> on<00:05:59.289> this<00:05:59.409> offense<00:05:59.889> and<00:06:00.069> could<00:06:00.250> that<00:06:00.279> be

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
plays on this offense and could that be

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.869 
plays on this offense and could that be
a<00:06:00.550> concern<00:06:01.050> it<00:06:02.050> could<00:06:02.440> be<00:06:02.589> a<00:06:02.620> concern<00:06:03.069> but<00:06:03.339> you

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879 
a concern it could be a concern but you

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:06.059 
a concern it could be a concern but you
know<00:06:04.000> coach<00:06:04.569> Johnson<00:06:05.110> definitely<00:06:05.139> uncover

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:06.069 
know coach Johnson definitely uncover

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:08.219 
know coach Johnson definitely uncover
some<00:06:06.370> quality<00:06:06.759> skill<00:06:07.029> players<00:06:07.330> and<00:06:07.930> there<00:06:08.080> are

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
some quality skill players and there are

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:10.320 
some quality skill players and there are
good<00:06:08.440> guys<00:06:08.469> there<00:06:08.949> and<00:06:08.979> like<00:06:09.490> i<00:06:09.610> said<00:06:09.669> i<00:06:09.879> don't

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
good guys there and like i said i don't

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.540 
good guys there and like i said i don't
think<00:06:10.539> at<00:06:10.629> the<00:06:10.719> quarterback<00:06:11.020> spot<00:06:11.349> it's<00:06:12.219> a

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
think at the quarterback spot it's a

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.339 
think at the quarterback spot it's a
it's<00:06:12.580> a<00:06:12.969> given<00:06:13.180> that<00:06:13.270> Evan<00:06:13.659> Washington<00:06:14.110> holds

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349 
it's a given that Evan Washington holds

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:16.170 
it's a given that Evan Washington holds
on<00:06:14.469> to<00:06:14.589> it<00:06:14.620> all<00:06:14.860> year<00:06:14.889> unless<00:06:15.370> he<00:06:15.580> plays<00:06:15.879> a<00:06:15.909> lot

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
on to it all year unless he plays a lot

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.790 
on to it all year unless he plays a lot
better<00:06:16.389> than<00:06:16.539> he<00:06:16.599> did<00:06:16.779> at<00:06:16.839> the<00:06:17.050> second<00:06:17.440> half<00:06:17.620> of

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
better than he did at the second half of

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.619 
better than he did at the second half of
last<00:06:18.009> year<00:06:18.400> and<00:06:18.550> I<00:06:18.699> think<00:06:18.909> the<00:06:19.000> potential<00:06:19.360> is

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:19.629 
last year and I think the potential is

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.659 
last year and I think the potential is
there<00:06:19.690> is<00:06:20.379> Georgia<00:06:20.710> Tech's<00:06:21.009> offense<00:06:21.460> looked

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
there is Georgia Tech's offense looked

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.760 
there is Georgia Tech's offense looked
unstoppable<00:06:22.029> last<00:06:22.779> year<00:06:23.050> tells<00:06:23.259> first<00:06:23.500> six

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
unstoppable last year tells first six

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.649 
unstoppable last year tells first six
games<00:06:23.860> they<00:06:24.639> were<00:06:24.789> just<00:06:25.000> piling<00:06:25.180> up<00:06:25.479> the

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:25.659 
games they were just piling up the

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:28.110 
games they were just piling up the
points<00:06:26.020> on<00:06:26.139> a<00:06:26.199> week-to-week<00:06:26.440> basis<00:06:27.219> so<00:06:28.060> I

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
points on a week-to-week basis so I

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.029 
points on a week-to-week basis so I
think<00:06:28.539> you'll<00:06:28.900> see<00:06:28.960> some<00:06:29.379> players<00:06:29.620> emerged

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 
think you'll see some players emerged

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.300 
think you'll see some players emerged
this<00:06:30.339> year<00:06:30.639> I<00:06:30.789> do<00:06:31.150> think<00:06:31.539> Sims<00:06:31.810> has<00:06:32.050> a<00:06:32.310> real

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
this year I do think Sims has a real

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.399 
this year I do think Sims has a real
good<00:06:33.490> shot<00:06:33.520> at<00:06:33.729> top<00:06:34.419> of<00:06:34.449> the<00:06:34.659> thousand<00:06:35.080> yards

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:35.409 
good shot at top of the thousand yards

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:37.260 
good shot at top of the thousand yards
and<00:06:35.589> whoever<00:06:36.250> emerges<00:06:36.430> that<00:06:36.789> quarterback

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
and whoever emerges that quarterback

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.180 
and whoever emerges that quarterback
should<00:06:37.479> be<00:06:37.599> a<00:06:37.630> little<00:06:37.810> more<00:06:37.990> dynamic<00:06:38.529> you

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
should be a little more dynamic you

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.889 
should be a little more dynamic you
mentioned<00:06:39.550> Georgia<00:06:39.789> Tech's<00:06:40.089> offensive<00:06:40.690> line

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:40.899 
mentioned Georgia Tech's offensive line

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:41.340 
mentioned Georgia Tech's offensive line
being

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350 
being

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.870 
being
real<00:06:41.710> high<00:06:41.890> this<00:06:41.950> year<00:06:42.070> I<00:06:42.220> believe<00:06:42.520> you<00:06:42.640> said

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
real high this year I believe you said

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.600 
real high this year I believe you said
number<00:06:43.180> 12<00:06:43.540> Paul<00:06:44.350> Johnson<00:06:44.800> really<00:06:45.070> hasn't<00:06:45.280> had

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
number 12 Paul Johnson really hasn't had

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.820 
number 12 Paul Johnson really hasn't had
a<00:06:45.670> big-time<00:06:46.000> highly<00:06:46.690> rated<00:06:46.900> offensive<00:06:47.560> line

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
a big-time highly rated offensive line

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.100 
a big-time highly rated offensive line
in<00:06:48.130> his<00:06:48.280> tenure<00:06:48.580> how<00:06:49.270> much<00:06:49.420> of<00:06:49.540> a<00:06:49.630> factor<00:06:49.840> you

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110 
in his tenure how much of a factor you

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.750 
in his tenure how much of a factor you
think<00:06:50.350> that<00:06:50.500> could<00:06:50.680> be<00:06:50.740> in<00:06:50.950> having<00:06:51.250> him<00:06:51.430> really

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.760 
think that could be in having him really

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.460 
think that could be in having him really
getting<00:06:52.030> this<00:06:52.120> offense<00:06:52.570> rolling<00:06:52.840> this<00:06:53.110> season

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470 
getting this offense rolling this season

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.680 
getting this offense rolling this season
oh<00:06:53.680> it<00:06:54.220> is<00:06:54.340> huge<00:06:54.640> and<00:06:54.940> you<00:06:55.330> know<00:06:55.420> a<00:06:55.450> lot<00:06:55.510> of

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690 
oh it is huge and you know a lot of

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.990 
oh it is huge and you know a lot of
things<00:06:56.020> I<00:06:56.290> do<00:06:56.350> in<00:06:56.620> my<00:06:56.650> forecast<00:06:57.250> I<00:06:57.520> put<00:06:57.970> a

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 
things I do in my forecast I put a

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.430 
things I do in my forecast I put a
little<00:06:58.120> more<00:06:58.300> emphasis<00:06:58.780> perhaps<00:06:58.960> on<00:06:59.320> the

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 
little more emphasis perhaps on the

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.380 
little more emphasis perhaps on the
offensive<00:06:59.800> line<00:07:00.010> defense<00:07:00.730> and<00:07:00.970> special<00:07:01.180> teams

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:01.390 
offensive line defense and special teams

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.480 
offensive line defense and special teams
and<00:07:01.810> a<00:07:01.840> lot<00:07:01.990> of<00:07:02.020> the<00:07:02.140> other<00:07:02.290> folks<00:07:02.560> do<00:07:02.800> I<00:07:03.010> think

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
and a lot of the other folks do I think

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.550 
and a lot of the other folks do I think
what<00:07:03.700> other<00:07:03.850> folks<00:07:04.120> line<00:07:04.330> up<00:07:04.510> their<00:07:04.660> magazines

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 
what other folks line up their magazines

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.170 
what other folks line up their magazines
or<00:07:05.830> offseason<00:07:06.520> things<00:07:06.730> they<00:07:06.880> look<00:07:07.060> at

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 
or offseason things they look at

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.790 
or offseason things they look at
quarterback<00:07:07.510> running<00:07:07.840> back<00:07:08.080> receivers<00:07:08.620> I

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
quarterback running back receivers I

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.890 
quarterback running back receivers I
think<00:07:09.400> the<00:07:09.490> offensive<00:07:09.850> line<00:07:10.000> is<00:07:10.210> is<00:07:10.630> really

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:10.900 
think the offensive line is is really

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.810 
think the offensive line is is really
the<00:07:11.320> start<00:07:11.620> the<00:07:11.860> straw<00:07:12.100> that<00:07:12.130> stirs<00:07:12.520> the<00:07:12.580> drink

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820 
the start the straw that stirs the drink

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.730 
the start the straw that stirs the drink
on<00:07:13.210> the<00:07:13.330> offense<00:07:13.690> and<00:07:13.840> that's<00:07:14.380> going<00:07:14.530> to<00:07:14.620> help

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:14.740 
on the offense and that's going to help

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.400 
on the offense and that's going to help
those<00:07:15.040> playmakers<00:07:15.610> emerge<00:07:16.200> looking<00:07:17.200> at<00:07:17.290> the

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.410 
those playmakers emerge looking at the

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.920 
those playmakers emerge looking at the
defense<00:07:17.590> Phil<00:07:18.280> teams<00:07:19.120> were<00:07:19.330> able<00:07:19.360> to<00:07:19.690> run

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:19.930 
defense Phil teams were able to run

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.870 
defense Phil teams were able to run
between<00:07:20.140> the<00:07:20.380> tackles<00:07:20.530> right<00:07:21.280> at<00:07:21.490> Georgia

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:21.880 
between the tackles right at Georgia

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.510 
between the tackles right at Georgia
Tech<00:07:22.000> last<00:07:22.510> year<00:07:22.810> and<00:07:22.990> they<00:07:23.500> had<00:07:23.710> two<00:07:24.040> seniors

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 
Tech last year and they had two seniors

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.520 
Tech last year and they had two seniors
and<00:07:24.760> a<00:07:24.850> junior<00:07:25.120> on<00:07:25.390> that<00:07:25.570> defensive<00:07:26.080> line<00:07:26.320> now

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:26.530 
and a junior on that defensive line now

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.650 
and a junior on that defensive line now
of<00:07:26.560> course<00:07:26.770> you<00:07:26.950> lose<00:07:27.130> the<00:07:27.310> two<00:07:27.460> seniors<00:07:27.970> you

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:28.660 
of course you lose the two seniors you

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.210 
of course you lose the two seniors you
don't<00:07:28.870> have<00:07:29.020> a<00:07:29.050> lot<00:07:29.320> of<00:07:29.350> depth<00:07:29.650> you<00:07:29.860> don't<00:07:30.040> have

don't have a lot of depth you don't have
