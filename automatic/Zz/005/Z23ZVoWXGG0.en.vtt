00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.720 

we<00:00:24.400> have<00:00:25.439> shoots<00:00:26.439> that<00:00:26.740> are<00:00:26.800> coming<00:00:27.189> up<00:00:27.310> here

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
we have shoots that are coming up here

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.019 
we have shoots that are coming up here
from<00:00:28.329> the<00:00:28.539> rootstock

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
from the rootstock

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.900 
from the rootstock
if<00:00:31.029> you'll<00:00:31.269> notice<00:00:31.680> here's<00:00:32.680> the<00:00:32.949> foliage<00:00:33.370> for

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
if you'll notice here's the foliage for

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.610 
if you'll notice here's the foliage for
the<00:00:34.030> variety<00:00:34.570> that<00:00:34.600> we<00:00:35.019> are<00:00:35.230> trying<00:00:36.070> to<00:00:36.250> grow

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
the variety that we are trying to grow

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.680 
the variety that we are trying to grow
this<00:00:38.620> now<00:00:39.370> if<00:00:39.640> you<00:00:39.790> look<00:00:40.030> at<00:00:40.150> the<00:00:40.269> difference

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
this now if you look at the difference

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.630 
this now if you look at the difference
in<00:00:40.900> the<00:00:40.989> foliage<00:00:41.440> you<00:00:42.150> can<00:00:43.150> see<00:00:44.159> that<00:00:45.159> this<00:00:45.370> is

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
in the foliage you can see that this is

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.799 
in the foliage you can see that this is
different<00:00:45.850> and<00:00:46.360> it's<00:00:46.570> growing<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:49.390> smaller

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
different and it's growing with smaller

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.060 
different and it's growing with smaller
leaves<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:52.059> leaves<00:00:52.239> are<00:00:52.780> a<00:00:53.140> different<00:00:54.129> shape

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
leaves the leaves are a different shape

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.320 
leaves the leaves are a different shape
and<00:00:57.070> when<00:00:57.670> you<00:00:57.790> go<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:58.600> follow<00:00:59.199> this<00:00:59.530> down<00:01:00.330> to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
and when you go and follow this down to

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.580 
and when you go and follow this down to
the<00:01:02.250> soil<00:01:03.250> line<00:01:03.580> you'll<00:01:04.269> see<00:01:04.360> it's<00:01:04.839> not<00:01:04.989> coming

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
the soil line you'll see it's not coming

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.960 
the soil line you'll see it's not coming
off<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.820> area<00:01:07.750> area<00:01:08.020> above<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.979> graft<00:01:09.250> it's

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
off the area area above the graft it's

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.810 
off the area area above the graft it's
coming<00:01:10.420> from<00:01:10.600> below<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.259> graft<00:01:11.500> what<00:01:12.490> we<00:01:12.640> do

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
coming from below the graft what we do

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.270 
coming from below the graft what we do
to<00:01:13.060> correct<00:01:13.420> this<00:01:13.570> problem<00:01:13.770> because<00:01:14.770> if<00:01:15.070> we

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
to correct this problem because if we

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.670 
to correct this problem because if we
leave<00:01:15.490> this<00:01:15.790> chute<00:01:16.750> here<00:01:17.110> this<00:01:17.350> will<00:01:17.650> take

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
leave this chute here this will take

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.260 
leave this chute here this will take
over<00:01:18.189> and<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:19.689> the<00:01:20.650> desired<00:01:21.340> plant<00:01:21.759> will

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
over and the the desired plant will

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.510 
over and the the desired plant will
disappear<00:01:22.900> we<00:01:23.680> want<00:01:23.920> to<00:01:23.979> get<00:01:24.100> rid<00:01:24.250> of<00:01:24.310> this

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
disappear we want to get rid of this

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.120 
disappear we want to get rid of this
chute<00:01:24.820> if<00:01:25.119> we<00:01:25.360> break<00:01:25.720> it<00:01:25.780> off<00:01:26.079> or<00:01:26.500> cut<00:01:26.829> it<00:01:26.950> off

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
chute if we break it off or cut it off

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.270 
chute if we break it off or cut it off
we're<00:01:28.060> still<00:01:28.390> going<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:28.929> have<00:01:29.170> more<00:01:29.799> shoots

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
we're still going to have more shoots

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.020 
we're still going to have more shoots
come<00:01:30.700> so<00:01:31.450> we<00:01:31.600> need<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:32.140> dig<00:01:32.590> down<00:01:32.859> until<00:01:33.579> we<00:01:33.729> get

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
come so we need to dig down until we get

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.700 
come so we need to dig down until we get
to<00:01:34.420> where<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.729> chute<00:01:37.060> is<00:01:37.329> coming<00:01:37.899> from<00:01:38.439> the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
to where the chute is coming from the

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.129 
to where the chute is coming from the
root<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:42.850> that<00:01:43.060> we've<00:01:43.210> gotten<00:01:43.420> down<00:01:43.569> to<00:01:43.749> the

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:44.139 
root now that we've gotten down to the

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:48.419 
root now that we've gotten down to the
where<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.340> root<00:01:46.060> is<00:01:46.319> attached<00:01:47.319> to<00:01:47.590> this<00:01:47.799> chute

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
where the root is attached to this chute

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.580 
where the root is attached to this chute
we're<00:01:48.789> just<00:01:48.969> going<00:01:49.179> to<00:01:49.210> give<00:01:49.359> it<00:01:49.479> a<00:01:49.689> great<00:01:49.960> huge

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
we're just going to give it a great huge

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.359 
we're just going to give it a great huge
yank<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.630> get<00:01:52.869> rid<00:01:53.020> of<00:01:53.049> it<00:01:53.259> just<00:01:53.289> like<00:01:53.649> that

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.919 

rid<00:01:57.369> of<00:01:57.490> that<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.950> we're<00:02:00.069> going<00:02:00.219> to<00:02:00.249> take<00:02:00.490> a

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
rid of that and we're going to take a

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.190 
rid of that and we're going to take a
little<00:02:01.929> glue<00:02:02.289> just<00:02:03.100> put<00:02:03.310> it<00:02:03.399> down<00:02:03.609> there<00:02:04.200> where

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
little glue just put it down there where

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:15.540 
little glue just put it down there where
we<00:02:05.380> broke<00:02:05.619> it<00:02:05.799> off

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550
