problem
it<00:00:05.370> seems<00:00:05.609> that<00:00:05.850> it<00:00:06.629> usually<00:00:06.899> idle<00:00:07.830> at<00:00:07.919> about

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
it seems that it usually idle at about

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.480 
it seems that it usually idle at about
700<00:00:09.000> maybe<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.450> little<00:00:09.630> bit<00:00:09.809> more<00:00:10.080> but<00:00:11.040> every<00:00:11.190> so

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
700 maybe a little bit more but every so

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.660

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
often it kind of comes in intervals that

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.660 
often it kind of comes in intervals that
it<00:00:14.820> dropped<00:00:15.719> slower<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.680> rpms<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.460> car

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
it dropped slower and rpms in the car

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.090 
it dropped slower and rpms in the car
stumbles<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.380> don't<00:00:19.560> know<00:00:19.680> if<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.920> can

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
stumbles and I don't know if you can

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.689 
stumbles and I don't know if you can
hear<00:00:20.520> it

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
hear it

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:42.480 
hear it
or<00:00:21.539> not<00:00:23.210> so<00:00:24.210> I'll<00:00:24.359> be<00:00:24.510> quiet

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.490 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.020 

I<00:00:42.930> replaced<00:00:43.930> my<00:00:44.110> TPS<00:00:44.830> I<00:00:45.130> believe<00:00:45.400> about<00:00:45.610> a<00:00:45.670> year

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
I replaced my TPS I believe about a year

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.660 
I replaced my TPS I believe about a year
ago<00:00:46.380> but<00:00:47.380> it<00:00:47.530> just<00:00:47.560> it<00:00:47.890> doesn't<00:00:48.100> seem<00:00:48.370> like<00:00:48.550> the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
ago but it just it doesn't seem like the

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:59.370 
ago but it just it doesn't seem like the
car<00:00:48.910> wants<00:00:49.210> to<00:00:49.240> idle<00:00:49.690> consistently

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.570 

there<00:01:00.010> we<00:01:00.160> go<00:01:00.310> I<00:01:01.830> don't<00:01:02.830> know<00:01:02.890> if<00:01:03.010> anybody<00:01:03.370> can

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
there we go I don't know if anybody can

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.250 
there we go I don't know if anybody can
see<00:01:03.850> that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
see that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.860 
see that
how<00:01:05.260> it<00:01:05.410> just<00:01:05.620> dropped<00:01:05.950> as<00:01:06.250> low<00:01:06.460> as<00:01:06.640> it<00:01:07.510> did<00:01:07.720> now

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
how it just dropped as low as it did now

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.540 
how it just dropped as low as it did now
maybe<00:01:08.110> it's<00:01:08.380> supposed<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:08.830> do<00:01:08.980> that<00:01:09.130> I<00:01:09.190> mean<00:01:09.430> it

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
maybe it's supposed to do that I mean it

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.480 
maybe it's supposed to do that I mean it
is<00:01:09.730> you<00:01:10.390> know<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.540> higher<00:01:10.930> mileage<00:01:11.320> car<00:01:11.860> and<00:01:12.400> you

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
is you know a higher mileage car and you

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.000 
is you know a higher mileage car and you
know<00:01:12.610> I<00:01:12.640> respect<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.360> fact<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.870> you<00:01:14.710> know<00:01:14.860> it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
know I respect the fact that you know it

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.420 
know I respect the fact that you know it
does<00:01:15.190> have<00:01:15.370> higher<00:01:15.610> mileage<00:01:16.800> but<00:01:17.800> I<00:01:17.830> just

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
does have higher mileage but I just

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.670 
does have higher mileage but I just
don't<00:01:18.610> know<00:01:18.880> if<00:01:18.910> it's<00:01:19.270> something<00:01:19.570> that<00:01:20.020> can<00:01:20.530> be

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
don't know if it's something that can be

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.150 
don't know if it's something that can be
fixed<00:01:20.980> if<00:01:21.340> it's<00:01:21.520> something<00:01:21.940> that<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:23.560> know<00:01:23.740> I

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
fixed if it's something that you know I

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.210 
fixed if it's something that you know I
cleaned<00:01:24.910> out<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.540> throttle<00:01:26.170> body<00:01:26.470> real<00:01:26.950> well

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
cleaned out the throttle body real well

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.240 
cleaned out the throttle body real well
it<00:01:27.460> took<00:01:27.640> a<00:01:27.760> lot<00:01:27.910> of<00:01:27.970> gunk<00:01:28.390> out<00:01:28.570> of<00:01:28.630> it<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:30.100> it

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
it took a lot of gunk out of it but it

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.450 
it took a lot of gunk out of it but it
doesn't<00:01:30.700> seem<00:01:30.910> to<00:01:31.090> be<00:01:32.010> fixed<00:01:33.010> and<00:01:33.130> I<00:01:33.190> even

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
doesn't seem to be fixed and I even

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.310 
doesn't seem to be fixed and I even
removed<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:34.030> throttle<00:01:34.450> position<00:01:34.540> Center

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
removed the throttle position Center

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.310 
removed the throttle position Center
sensor<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:37.240> know<00:01:37.390> made<00:01:37.780> sure<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:38.290> just

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
sensor you know made sure it just

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.480 
sensor you know made sure it just
stumbled<00:01:38.890> right<00:01:38.920> there<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.770> know<00:01:41.890> clean<00:01:42.280> that

if the fact that the mileage on the car

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.609 
if the fact that the mileage on the car
plays<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.210> difference<00:02:07.660> or<00:02:07.840> not<00:02:07.869> it's<00:02:08.410> just

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619
