00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.269
 hello friends here and come 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.150
 Monday 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.340
 somewhere already an hour and a half guys work 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.260
 in the morning but changes are fast 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.289
 happens because you see plywood 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.930
 there are literally there two guys and three 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.199
 comes out but quickly closes here 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.910
 the structure we saw 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:30.949
 therefore, it looks like a lot 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.820
 so I feel there now will tell us 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.800
 here is plywood such bitches on it on each 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.630
 by measure not to miss such 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.470
 and there but maybe you can see my being 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.390
 no less now come closer and here 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:50.809
 from here you will try to show it from afar 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:55.059
 in sight there start there which 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:59.180
 says that the plywood is an inspector 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:02.940
 checked and corresponds to level 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:08.100
 qualities here 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.259
 confirmed as it should be all means I 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.430
 just in case I was used to tires 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:17.520
 they say that there are clumsies and crooks and 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.610
 assholes and generally mean so far 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.159
 means asked to show from the fence and to 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.030
 lunch from the fence show the whole front 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.860
 the primate will be just about to work at home 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:36.000
 I'll try it 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.009
 go here these neighbour's fence 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.229
 he will have to change his neighbor 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.780
 had to change but we want to wait 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.860
 until construction ends the planet 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.610
 let pass pass pass 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:55.170
 corner here and now i'm at it 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:02:05.369
 Corners deploy so well just go 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:07.739
 you saw what it looks like this and 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.200
 these are the changes you see today 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:13.230
 due to the fact that on saturday so 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.900
 calmly it passed them looked it 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.819
 happened literally there in an hour and a half 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.610
 not under pretty quick so jump jump 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.610
 and all plywood beat off 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.799
 fits this about the events 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.010
 I don't know if you can see better 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.590

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.579

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.579
 stand here at a neighbor 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:49.579
 so that the designer when the project offered 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.739
 how do he said give guys we 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:55.579
 can do on the neighbors here there left 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:03:01.519

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:03.530
