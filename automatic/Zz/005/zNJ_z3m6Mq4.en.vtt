00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
important aspect of hybrid motor units

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.800 
important aspect of hybrid motor units
is<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:55.160> hybrid<00:02:55.610> computer<00:02:56.120> always<00:02:56.360> has

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
is that the hybrid computer always has

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.140 
is that the hybrid computer always has
to<00:02:56.989> know<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.230> position<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:57.799> the<00:02:57.920> rotor<00:02:58.150> this

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
to know the position of the rotor this

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.390 
to know the position of the rotor this
is<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.390> reason<00:02:59.810> why<00:02:59.959> all<00:03:00.260> hybrid<00:03:00.709> rotors<00:03:01.069> are

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
is the reason why all hybrid rotors are

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.190 
is the reason why all hybrid rotors are
connected<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.090> position<00:03:02.600> sensor<00:03:03.019> either
