stunned<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.080> little<00:02:34.410> bit<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.530> pool<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:34.950> be

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
stunned and a little bit of pool to be

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.559 
stunned and a little bit of pool to be
honest<00:02:35.310> but<00:02:35.370> then<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:35.580> realized<00:02:36.000> he<00:02:36.120> has<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.239> life

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
honest but then I realized he has a life

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.570 
honest but then I realized he has a life
orb<00:02:36.870> which<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.379> interesting<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.280> this<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:38.489> like

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
orb which is interesting so this is like

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.490 
orb which is interesting so this is like
a<00:02:38.640> fully<00:02:38.970> offensive<00:02:39.510> travelin<00:02:39.900> probably

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
a fully offensive travelin probably

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.589 
a fully offensive travelin probably
going<00:02:40.709> max<00:02:40.920> attack<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.430> all<00:02:41.489> that<00:02:41.640> stuff<00:02:41.760> and

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
going max attack and all that stuff and

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.059 
going max attack and all that stuff and
it<00:02:42.959> seems<00:02:43.200> like<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.379> burnt<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.799> actually

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
we go into my dark wait to get the four

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.220 
we go into my dark wait to get the four
times<00:02:53.190> resistance<00:02:53.489> going<00:02:53.970> on<00:02:54.120> horn<00:02:54.780> leech<00:02:54.989> at

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
times resistance going on horn leech at

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.870 
times resistance going on horn leech at
this<00:02:55.349> point<00:02:55.620> not<00:02:55.739> gonna<00:02:55.920> do<00:02:55.980> anything<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.760> me

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
this point not gonna do anything to me

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.759 
this point not gonna do anything to me
and<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.690> can<00:02:57.870> get<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.079> residual<00:02:58.440> life<00:02:58.560> will

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
and I can get the residual life will

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.440 
and I can get the residual life will
damage<00:02:59.129> I<00:02:59.250> think<00:02:59.519> we'll<00:02:59.700> actually<00:02:59.790> be<00:03:00.030> more

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
damage I think we'll actually be more

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.330 
damage I think we'll actually be more
than<00:03:01.049> what<00:03:01.319> he<00:03:01.410> gains<00:03:01.650> back<00:03:01.860> from<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.099> horn

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
than what he gains back from the horn

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.250 
than what he gains back from the horn

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.379 
earthquake is actually going to be a to
hit<00:04:10.560> KO<00:04:10.769> on<00:04:11.130> travelin<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:11.970> reason<00:04:12.239> is

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
hit KO on travelin and the reason is

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.240 
hit KO on travelin and the reason is
because<00:04:12.900> he's<00:04:13.139> an<00:04:13.260> offensive<00:04:13.560> one<00:04:13.950> with<00:04:14.099> life

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
because he's an offensive one with life

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.580 
because he's an offensive one with life
all<00:04:14.459> but<00:04:14.579> not<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.790> defensively<00:04:15.389> built<00:04:16.019> variant

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
all but not a defensively built variant

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.199 
all but not a defensively built variant
I<00:04:16.739> guess<00:04:17.130> he<00:04:17.220> doesn't<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.609> I<00:04:17.700> made<00:04:17.880> maybe<00:04:18.090> he

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
I guess he doesn't it I made maybe he

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.089 
I guess he doesn't it I made maybe he
does<00:04:18.359> have<00:04:18.389> max<00:04:18.690> HP<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.530> maybe<00:04:19.709> it's<00:04:19.889> not<00:04:19.950> all

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
does have max HP so maybe it's not all

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.279 
does have max HP so maybe it's not all
that<00:04:20.220> weird<00:04:20.459> but<00:04:20.750> whatever<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:21.840> still<00:04:22.109> managed

can take any hit when it goes mega

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.469 
can take any hit when it goes mega
because<00:04:41.190> of<00:04:41.430> course<00:04:41.699> he<00:04:41.910> has<00:04:42.000> those<00:04:42.180> booster

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.840 
because of course he has those booster
defense<00:04:42.810> is<00:04:43.020> very<00:04:43.350> nice<00:04:43.590> very<00:04:43.919> solid<00:04:44.460> of<00:04:44.550> body

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
defense is very nice very solid of body

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.820 
defense is very nice very solid of body
and<00:04:45.090> close<00:04:45.990> combat<00:04:46.229> and<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.530> reason<00:04:46.770> I'm

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
and close combat and the reason I'm

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.040

Karen<00:04:47.190> close<00:04:47.340> combat<00:04:47.699> and<00:04:48.000> I<00:04:48.180> guess<00:04:48.810> close

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
Karen close combat and I guess close

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.629 
Karen close combat and I guess close
combat<00:04:49.229> is<00:04:49.410> more<00:04:49.590> powerful<00:04:49.740> than<00:04:50.160> arm<00:04:50.370> thrust

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
combat is more powerful than arm thrust
