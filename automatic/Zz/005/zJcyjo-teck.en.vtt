00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
attack and see what he did I mean he did

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.839 
attack and see what he did I mean he did
the<00:02:53.420> exact<00:02:53.720> same<00:02:53.750> thing<00:02:54.140> but<00:02:54.170> I<00:02:54.760> don't<00:02:55.760> know

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
the exact same thing but I don't know

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.809 
the exact same thing but I don't know
how<00:02:56.000> he<00:02:56.060> got<00:02:56.239> three<00:02:56.510> stars<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:57.280> my<00:02:58.280> question

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
how he got three stars and my question

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.800 
how he got three stars and my question
for<00:02:58.849> him<00:02:59.209> is<00:02:59.650> if<00:03:00.650> my<00:03:01.459> attack<00:03:01.790> failed<00:03:02.090> why<00:03:02.750> the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
for him is if my attack failed why the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.880 
for him is if my attack failed why the
fuck<00:03:03.290> would<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:03.650> do<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:04.040> same<00:03:04.069> exact<00:03:04.790> attack

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
fuck would you do the same exact attack

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.009 
fuck would you do the same exact attack
but<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:07.190> mean<00:03:07.489> it<00:03:07.730> works<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.180> guess<00:03:08.870> it

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
but I mean it works so I guess it

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.050 
but I mean it works so I guess it
doesn't<00:03:09.290> matter<00:03:09.410> so<00:03:10.069> everything<00:03:10.730> looks<00:03:10.880> the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
doesn't matter so everything looks the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.120 
doesn't matter so everything looks the
exact<00:03:11.480> same<00:03:11.510> so<00:03:11.930> far<00:03:12.200> one<00:03:12.440> of<00:03:12.470> his<00:03:12.620> dragons<00:03:12.980> got

like<00:03:44.209> three<00:03:44.660> dragons<00:03:45.170> on<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.410> townhall<00:03:45.950> I

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
like three dragons on the townhall I

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.840 
like three dragons on the townhall I
only<00:03:46.280> had<00:03:46.430> two

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
only had two

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.729 
only had two
he<00:03:47.209> dropped<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.569> rage<00:03:47.720> spell<00:03:47.840> on<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:48.139> left<00:03:48.440> side

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
he dropped a rage spell on the left side

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.430 
he dropped a rage spell on the left side
and<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:50.060> balloon<00:03:50.420> is<00:03:50.690> going<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:51.049> take<00:03:51.230> out

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
and that balloon is going to take out

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.949 
and that balloon is going to take out
that<00:03:51.739> air<00:03:51.950> defense<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.340> believe<00:03:52.579> yeah<00:03:52.760> so<00:03:53.389> he

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
that air defense I believe yeah so he

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.330 
that air defense I believe yeah so he
took<00:03:54.109> out<00:03:54.260> all<00:03:54.319> three<00:03:54.620> of<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.739> air<00:03:54.859> defenses

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
took out all three of the air defenses

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.420 
took out all three of the air defenses
and<00:03:55.989> he's<00:03:56.989> gonna<00:03:57.200> three-star<00:03:57.709> this<00:03:57.889> space<00:03:58.100> and

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
and he's gonna three-star this space and

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.780 
and he's gonna three-star this space and
what<00:03:59.239> I<00:03:59.269> just<00:03:59.420> don't<00:03:59.810> understand<00:04:00.380> is<00:04:00.620> how<00:04:01.340> the

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
what I just don't understand is how the

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.120 
what I just don't understand is how the
fuck<00:04:02.120> did<00:04:02.389> he<00:04:02.540> do<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:02.810> same<00:04:03.049> exact<00:04:03.470> attack<00:04:03.829> I

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
fuck did he do the same exact attack I

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.309 
fuck did he do the same exact attack I
only<00:04:04.609> got<00:04:04.760> two<00:04:04.970> stars<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:05.540> he<00:04:05.750> got<00:04:05.900> three<00:04:06.139> it

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
only got two stars and he got three it

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.559 
only got two stars and he got three it
just<00:04:06.500> doesn't<00:04:06.920> make<00:04:07.160> sense<00:04:07.220> to<00:04:07.639> me<00:04:07.730> at<00:04:07.910> all<00:04:07.940> he

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
just doesn't make sense to me at all he

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.180 
just doesn't make sense to me at all he
even<00:04:08.750> drops<00:04:08.959> his<00:04:09.109> King<00:04:09.350> in<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.650> same<00:04:09.859> exact

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
even drops his King in the same exact

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.849 
even drops his King in the same exact
spot<00:04:10.430> like<00:04:10.750> what<00:04:11.750> did<00:04:11.900> what<00:04:12.109> does<00:04:12.230> he<00:04:12.380> do<00:04:12.620> why

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
spot like what did what does he do why

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.879 
spot like what did what does he do why
is<00:04:12.920> he<00:04:13.130> copying<00:04:13.549> me<00:04:13.989> so<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.019> mean<00:04:15.380> I<00:04:15.530> guess<00:04:15.560> this

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
is he copying me so I mean I guess this

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.830 
is he copying me so I mean I guess this
attack<00:04:16.250> shows<00:04:16.519> you<00:04:16.700> that<00:04:16.880> dragon<00:04:17.329> attacks<00:04:17.630> are

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
attack shows you that dragon attacks are

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.240 
attack shows you that dragon attacks are
just<00:04:18.260> pure<00:04:18.620> luck<00:04:18.889> and<00:04:19.190> I<00:04:20.150> mean<00:04:20.840> you<00:04:21.560> just<00:04:22.039> gotta

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
just pure luck and I mean you just gotta

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.360 
just pure luck and I mean you just gotta
hope<00:04:22.789> that<00:04:23.060> they<00:04:23.180> go<00:04:23.360> in<00:04:23.599> the<00:04:23.720> right<00:04:23.840> direction

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
hope that they go in the right direction

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.000 
hope that they go in the right direction
so<00:04:25.750> this<00:04:26.750> was<00:04:26.930> pretty<00:04:27.110> much<00:04:27.289> an<00:04:27.440> overkill<00:04:27.800> I

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
so this was pretty much an overkill I

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.560 
so this was pretty much an overkill I
mean<00:04:28.190> it<00:04:28.280> was<00:04:28.400> way<00:04:28.700> different<00:04:29.060> than<00:04:29.090> my<00:04:29.300> attack

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
mean it was way different than my attack

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.350 
mean it was way different than my attack
he<00:04:29.780> has<00:04:29.930> tons<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.530> dragons<00:04:30.919> left<00:04:31.099> a<00:04:31.400> lot<00:04:32.120> of<00:04:32.240> his

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
he has tons of dragons left a lot of his

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.150 
he has tons of dragons left a lot of his
