00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.830
 barbecue in general so a shark homm 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.600
 heart beats you so to start 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.200
 today we are going to cook chicken 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.780
 barbecue so we will offer them some 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.309
 chicken legs with a brothel so 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.820
 that's what we'll learn to do 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.320
 today 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:56.190
 so I have to start I cut butter 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.820
 in quarters and so there is about 80 g 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.430
 jimmy 15 grams of platinum curly and his 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.350
 I muse in Lyon and coarsely chopped 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.910
 we 're going to mix all that 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.220
 to get a brothel we have these areas there 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.180
 after that I mix but three elements 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.759
 and I 'm right after I mixed my 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.630
 prepared with garlic butter and 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.880
 parsley during the lemming wise gmi so 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.380
 salt and pepper to season the 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.520
 bird eye 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.119
 now we will get to the heart of 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:33.210
 subject we will garnish our chicken legs 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.210
 so let's leave the sonabhy pepper salt 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.220
 now we will stuff them below 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.869
 skin so it's easy enough 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.000
 so to draw a little bit of skin 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.439
 chicken 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.909
 we know that easily easy your 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:56.909
 finger and we will garnish under the skin 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:11.310
 so the goal is to feed life on 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.310
 will have a meat that will wait better 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.570
 finally the first one is done i'm going to do 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.570
 the second 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.940
 and here we are as we are at the barbecue 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.090
 we acquire this little world to barbecue 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.300
 so for starters I'm going to grab the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.670
 chicken on the face of the skin which for 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.990
 that the skin is crisp shame 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.210
 to gilbert brutus and that it's very very 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.430
 hot so it tells that 30 seconds 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:47.380
 so I grabbed my chicken and found 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:50.350
 just after that so I have to color our 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.410
 two chicken legs now we're going 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.220
 put them in foil so on a 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.220
 parchment paper 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.600
 here we are going to do roughly 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.760
 and we end up with hand union 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.019
 more of this cooking is that the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.480
 flavors are between years so you 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.900
 are going to have a good time chicken with a 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.900
 good taste of garlic and parsley 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.910
 So here we put this little package 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.610
 for 45 minutes in the embers and 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.200
 I find right after our chicken 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.299
 so cook the meat but tender 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.530

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.010

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.400
