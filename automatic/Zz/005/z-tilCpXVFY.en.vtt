and the truck survived or I would have
been<00:02:19.480> dead<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:20.019> mean<00:02:20.440> with<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.590> radiator<00:02:21.129> failure

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
been dead I mean with a radiator failure

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.190 
been dead I mean with a radiator failure
and<00:02:21.910> everything<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:22.569> know<00:02:22.599> I<00:02:22.720> had<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.019> buy<00:02:23.170> all

were<00:04:46.910> affected<00:04:47.570> so<00:04:47.960> it's<00:04:48.350> about<00:04:48.560> time<00:04:49.010> that<00:04:49.880> we

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
were affected so it's about time that we

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.140 
were affected so it's about time that we
take<00:04:51.830> care<00:04:52.039> of<00:04:52.160> business<00:04:52.310> in<00:04:52.789> a<00:04:52.880> peaceful

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
manner and I think they're just driving

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.290 
manner and I think they're just driving
their<00:04:56.660> asses<00:04:57.080> slow<00:04:57.380> around<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:58.340> DC<00:04:58.550> loop<00:04:59.060> and
