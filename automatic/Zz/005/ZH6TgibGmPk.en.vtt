is to keep going to the hole to keep

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.050 
is to keep going to the hole to keep

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
and to be getting older I think it's a

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.630 
and to be getting older I think it's a
testament<00:02:24.990> to<00:02:25.170> how<00:02:25.230> hard<00:02:25.530> he<00:02:25.620> works<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:26.190> have

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
testament to how hard he works you have

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.070 
testament to how hard he works you have
to<00:02:26.700> be<00:02:26.820> careful<00:02:27.210> when<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.420> give<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.720> compliment

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
to be careful when you give a compliment

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.620 
to be careful when you give a compliment
and<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.410> take<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.890> long<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.370> get<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.580> the

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.880 

all<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.780> sudden<00:02:37.020> now<00:02:37.140> Phil<00:02:37.380> Jackson's<00:02:37.830> how

all of a sudden now Phil Jackson's how
can<00:02:38.070> I<00:02:38.100> bring<00:02:38.280> in<00:02:38.400> tomorrow<00:02:38.730> with<00:02:38.850> him<00:02:39.000> off<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
can I bring in tomorrow with him off the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.560 
can I bring in tomorrow with him off the
bench

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
bench

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.510 
bench
can<00:02:39.900> he<00:02:40.020> handle<00:02:40.230> those<00:02:40.530> things<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.950> 6-minute<00:02:41.460> a

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
can he handle those things a 6-minute a

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.190 
can he handle those things a 6-minute a
year<00:02:44.420> he<00:02:45.420> should<00:02:45.480> bring<00:02:45.810> him<00:02:45.930> off<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.080> bench

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
year he should bring him off the bench

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.740 
year he should bring him off the bench
man<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.650> mean<00:02:47.070> this<00:02:47.520> would<00:02:47.760> help<00:02:47.970> him<00:02:48.270> because

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
man I mean this would help him because

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.770 
man I mean this would help him because
he<00:02:49.290> didn't<00:02:49.680> show<00:02:49.860> up<00:02:49.890> neither<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.520> then<00:02:50.640> a

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
he didn't show up neither and then a

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.210 
he didn't show up neither and then a
championship<00:02:51.780> game<00:02:51.990> and<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.620> think<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.070> if

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
championship game and I think that if

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.710 
championship game and I think that if
they<00:02:53.370> bring<00:02:53.580> him<00:02:53.730> off<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:53.910> bench<00:02:54.060> gonna<00:02:54.510> give

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
they bring him off the bench gonna give

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.570 
they bring him off the bench gonna give
them<00:02:54.810> more<00:02:54.990> firepower<00:02:55.200> off<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:55.890> bench<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:56.490> you

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
them more firepower off the bench so you

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.650 
them more firepower off the bench so you
don't<00:02:56.760> want<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.000> put<00:02:57.150> him<00:02:57.300> at<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.510> point

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
don't want to put him at the point

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.420 
don't want to put him at the point
forward<00:02:58.020> sometimes<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.620> bring<00:02:58.770> Kobe<00:02:59.160> off<00:02:59.280> the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
forward sometimes I bring Kobe off the

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:11.720 
forward sometimes I bring Kobe off the
ball<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.820> Kobe<00:03:09.890> try<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:10.950> give<00:03:11.160> me<00:03:11.280> two<00:03:11.460> three

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
ball that Kobe try to give me two three

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.580 
ball that Kobe try to give me two three
point<00:03:12.000> guards<00:03:12.180> for<00:03:12.540> him<00:03:12.720> or<00:03:12.840> something<00:03:12.870> you

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
know but no point guard ain't gonna work

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.450 
know but no point guard ain't gonna work
you<00:03:15.690> know<00:03:15.810> stay<00:03:16.590> on<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.890> bench<00:03:17.040> he<00:03:17.250> be<00:03:17.370> all

right all right so now let's talk about

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.450 
right all right so now let's talk about
motivation<00:03:18.990> I've<00:03:19.320> always<00:03:19.740> thought<00:03:19.950> now<00:03:20.190> if

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
motivation I've always thought now if

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.390 
motivation I've always thought now if
you're<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.180> team<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:21.870> takes<00:03:22.110> that<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.130> lose

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
you're the team that takes that you lose

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.030 
you're the team that takes that you lose
in<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.730> NBA<00:03:24.000> Finals<00:03:24.240> who's<00:03:25.110> more<00:03:25.470> motivated

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
in the NBA Finals who's more motivated

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.040 
in the NBA Finals who's more motivated
than<00:03:26.190> next<00:03:26.430> year<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.700> team<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.030> won<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.810> NBA

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
than next year the team that won the NBA

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.340 
than next year the team that won the NBA
Finals<00:03:28.380> are<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.590> team<00:03:28.770> that<00:03:28.920> lost<00:03:29.130> it

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
Finals are the team that lost it

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.590 
Finals are the team that lost it
I<00:03:31.380> think<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.920> tnen<00:03:32.190> lost<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.520> I<00:03:32.610> think<00:03:32.880> Kobe

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
I think the tnen lost it I think Kobe

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.120 
I think the tnen lost it I think Kobe

with a little bit more fire because they

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.840 
with a little bit more fire because they

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
think Boston really put it to them and I

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.470 
think Boston really put it to them and I
think<00:03:41.250> they're<00:03:41.370> gonna<00:03:41.490> try<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.970> show<00:03:42.270> that

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.210 
think they're gonna try to show that
they<00:03:42.660> can<00:03:42.720> get<00:03:42.960> back<00:03:43.170> there<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.530> hope<00:03:43.740> Boston

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
they can get back there and hope Boston

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.500
