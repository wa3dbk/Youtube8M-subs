00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello everyone welcome on the channel 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.520
 kharafi is delighted to meet you for 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.099
 this tutorial number 15 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.500
 and yes already the 15 devoted to dark table ' 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.519
 in sound systems there is a 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.500
 tool that we call the co leaders 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.560
 graphique is co-leader of the English verb 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.760
 to nicolaÃ¯ which means to equalize it 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.199
 is in the form of a rule 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.850
 compound of the small cursor 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.140
 independently of each other are going 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.580
 allow you to preserve areas 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.099
 precise sound spectrum 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.640
 so you will find on the left the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.289
 infrabasses and to the right of the acute supras 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.239
 in modern systems software 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.130
 the hi fi strings mp3 players you 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.739
 have the opportunity to select rock 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.480
 pop jazz techno rap rock and so 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.610
 adapt the modulation of the sound to the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.629
 music that you listen to 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.070
 I already see some wondering 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.660
 on my sanity that everyone 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.399
 reassure it is a tutorial on 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.700
 dark dble and it's good image of which 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.140
 we'll talk if I'm talking to you about a 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.610
 graphics decoder it's for the purpose of 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.590
 introduce you to a new module 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.239
 this module you will find it in the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.010
 drawer improvement modules in 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.420
 third position you'll recognize it 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.609
 easily since you can imagine 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.769
 this is the equalizer module that we 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.320
 let's talk when you unrolled it 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.490
 you come across a small menu consisting of 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.020
 diagrams 10 grams that we 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.750
 know well now on which 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.880
 we do not need to spread ourselves anymore 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.729
 his little diagram recomposing three 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.380
 tabs the tab the human khroma and 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.460
 was before entering the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.770
 details and see a little bit how 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.240
 all this little world is working I you 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.939
 invite me to join in the menu of 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.380
 presets when I click on I 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.700
 find me with different options of 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.670
 sinn that darth and bum and to my 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.430
 layout in strength and sharpness 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.100
 Noise reduction contract global str and 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.030
 well these options it's a bit your rock 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.790
 pop techno classic jazz to you that's it 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.799
 is you begin to understand 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.329
 the equalizer module will allow 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.070
 do on the image what the co 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.360
 graphical leaders will do on sound if 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.090
 I place my pointer in the middle of a 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.079
 world g I see words appear 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.399
 I have the opportunity here to congratulate 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.560
 the remarkable work of the team of 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.570
 French translation of the software with 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.990
 in passing a special dedication one of 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.820
 its members 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.869
 mister pascal aubry little comrades 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.480
 from google + above contrasted bottom 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.860
 left blur global right details 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.110
 it's the same in the khroma tab 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.849
 with a little subtlety in the tab 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.409
 sharpness that uses the same words except 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.360
 that in position road I find myself with 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.190
 the net word 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.530
 let's go back to the English the human the line 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.790
 central is a little the line of your 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.920
 eco graphic arts 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.019
 remember on the left we had them 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.120
 infrabasses and to the right the supras acute 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.349
 well it works pretty small module 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.810
 near the same in the same way that a 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.700
 echo the graphic arts left you 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.319
 to go earlier to influence the whole 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.220
 while on the right you go 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.200
 bring closer to the fine details of the image 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.739
 these little lines actually has a small 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.569
 hidden sister 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.980
 if I go down the mouse pointer 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.340
 down I see a appear 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.780
 new word this word it's the word gross is 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.700
 behind this word is hiding another line 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.709
 identical to this one who will you 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.140
 allow to manage the noise parameter 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.670
 you will understand it in your English 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.840
 you will be able to manage not only 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.019
 the contract this your image 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.790
 but the noise in ceases when we 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.340
 will study noise in round darth 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.720
 hebel very soon you will see us 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.370
 will see that there is no noise but 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.840
 several noises several kinds of 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.239
 noise from the luminance noises the 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.370
 chrominance noises and so on and 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.950
 well this little equalizer module will you 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.200
 allow to mitigate the noise even the 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.090
 noises in a significant way in 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.599
 your images through these systems of 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.130
 lever if we go upwards we 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.650
 will be our image if we go 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.139
 down we're going to blur it I 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.030
 am going to grow the undd of my setting and 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.169
 do a little test right away I 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.329
 draws with the left mouse button 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:46.290
 up I loose and instantly 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.069
 the contrast of my image is doped I do not 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.780
 do not know if it reminds you 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.099
 thing but me that reminds me to 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.260
 settings of clarity in the august of 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.180
 lightroom hadopi software 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.470
 if like me you searched for 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.329
 hours in dartigolles where 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.190
 found the cursor of clarity and well 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.870
 know that it does not exist in any case 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.120
 exist at the sauce to stop want 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.950
 by the way if you go back to the 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.019
 small menu of presets you will see 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.569
 at the bottom a setting called 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.250
 clarity is good in this module 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.260
 qualiseur that you will be able to manage 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.970
 the city tall dark clarity pardon in 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.949
 dark people 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.329
 if I pull my adjustment down I 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.350
 I'm going to do the opposite I'm going soccer and 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.459
 my image and high school 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.050
 I do so well the lily is from elsewhere 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.810
 that we are going to get closer to an effect 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.350
 rather horton you see this is 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.900
 amazing 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.300
 remember you little booster booster a 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.210
 double click in your diagrams and 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.200
 your parameters goes back to zero since 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.240
 we will see a little bit of the future 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.220
 from the bottom I go with your permission 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.260
 zoom in on this image and show you 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.760
 that it contains noise we do not 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.500
 let's see on the cap on the expensive site 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.740
 on the face of this young man as well 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.810
 that on heaven forgive brutality 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.010
 but I'm going to boost my setting to 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.430
 well show you how that 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.490
 works 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.410
 I paint this game draws lane from the bottom and you 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.200
 see that momentarily I read my picture 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.880
 until make the noise disappear 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.470
 heard this tutorial and educational purpose 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.090
 I invite you to have a lot more 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.860
 measure and reserve in the king 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.300
 settings in order to get a good result 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.420
 cleaner than the one I just made 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.390
 before your eyes a double click and I 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.610
 get my details in the khroma tab 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.110
 chromino under saturation you go 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.280
 do pretty much the same thing but in 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.800
 playing on the color ranges 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.460
 so if I think you'll see that I 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.120
 can boost the saturation of my image and 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.400
 the contrast it generates up 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.800
 return to our our picture a few 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.150
 some rock'n'roll colors 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.360
 you'll understand if I pull towards the 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:40.930
 down I will desaturate my image and 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.150
 break the chrominance contrast a 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.770
 double click and I come back to 0 well 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.890
 heard for the noise lines he in 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.930
 same goes for the tab the human the 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.240
 last tab the nail and sharpness is going 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.850
 allow you to refine the sharpness of 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.500
 your image on details for its purposes 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:00.850
 it's one of the longest tabs 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.290
 of the three least spectacular English 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.910
 shall we say but that allows in 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.310
 some types of photos to improve 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.830
 substantially the details all the way down 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.150
 we have a slider this slider is a 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.410
 sort of distribution slider well 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.880
 heard more where are we going towards the 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.150
 right and the more we will boost our 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.220
 settings we have the the densify 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.680
 and then we go left several 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.330
 reduce its effect it's pretty classic 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.789
 in dark table 'I do not teach you 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.810
 nothing 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:28.789
 when you go to handle these little ones 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.830
 this little module you go quickly you 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:32.779
 account for the immense interest that 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.370
 this one word of land art and want 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:36.710
 personally so far I would have 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.960
 enormously enormously enormously badly 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.550
 to do without 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.779
 a good tip once you have 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.919
 found relevant relevant settings 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:47.360
 save them create a new meadow 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.659
 settings to reuse it later 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.060
 you will see that it will prove very 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:55.310
 useful since we are in the menu 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.479
 presets let's focus on the 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.219
 second on the third option 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:00.740
 we see sharpening and 

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:01.699
 reduce the noise if I click by 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.979
 example on the third option 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:04.960
 I see appear but online here is 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:07.999
 how software developers 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.729
