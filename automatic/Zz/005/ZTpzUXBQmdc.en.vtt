X<00:00:48.629> Y<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.960> digital<00:00:49.469> gauges<00:00:49.620> here<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
X Y a digital gauges here and in the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.930 
X Y a digital gauges here and in the
center<00:00:51.500> but<00:00:52.500> let's<00:00:52.800> uh<00:00:52.890> let's<00:00:53.309> fire<00:00:53.610> them<00:00:53.760> up

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
center but let's uh let's fire them up

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.459 
center but let's uh let's fire them up
and<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.539> guys<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.899> see<00:00:55.079> what<00:00:55.170> they<00:00:55.289> look

and so you guys can see what they look

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.020 
and so you guys can see what they look
like<00:00:55.520> take<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.550> out<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.760> here

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.910 

when<00:01:03.030> they<00:01:03.120> come<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.510> there<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.559> show<00:01:04.769> all

when they come on there that show all

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.540 
when they come on there that show all
zeroes

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
zeroes

the<00:01:05.760> speedometer<00:01:06.060> off<00:01:06.510> I'll<00:01:06.810> show<00:01:07.050> a<00:01:07.080> quick

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the speedometer off I'll show a quick

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.810 
the speedometer off I'll show a quick
video<00:01:07.470> later<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.070> what<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.340> looks<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.640> when

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
video later of what it looks like when

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.320 
video later of what it looks like when
it's<00:01:08.940> actually<00:01:09.119> going<00:01:10.310> see<00:01:11.310> your<00:01:11.580> start<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.240> up

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it's actually going see your start it up

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.230 
it's actually going see your start it up
so<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.600> guys<00:01:12.720> can<00:01:12.840> see<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> tach

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.330 

and<00:01:20.780> in<00:01:21.020> a<00:01:21.110> second<00:01:21.530> it<00:01:21.620> will<00:01:21.680> settle<00:01:21.950> down<00:01:22.130> to

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
and in a second it will settle down to

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.460 
and in a second it will settle down to
about<00:01:22.460> 700<00:01:22.940> rpms

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:37.859 

maybe

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
for calibrating for zero to sixty it's

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.899 
for calibrating for zero to sixty it's
all<00:01:57.500> in<00:01:57.679> the<00:01:57.799> instructions<00:01:58.429> they're<00:01:58.579> very

easy to install the tack does come set
up<00:02:02.179> for<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.450> v8<00:02:02.899> so<00:02:03.619> there's<00:02:04.009> a<00:02:04.100> couple<00:02:04.310> of<00:02:04.460> wires

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
up for a v8 so there's a couple of wires

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.330 
up for a v8 so there's a couple of wires
on<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:04.939> back<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.299> clip<00:02:05.539> one<00:02:05.780> four<00:02:06.590> v6<00:02:07.130> or

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
on the back you clip one four v6 or

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.880 
on the back you clip one four v6 or
inline<00:02:07.729> six<00:02:08.030> or<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.390> clip<00:02:09.200> one<00:02:09.349> for<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.590> four

inline six or a clip one for a four
cylinder<00:02:10.250> which<00:02:10.610> if<00:02:11.030> you're<00:02:11.239> putting<00:02:11.420> in<00:02:11.630> a<00:02:11.720> Z

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
cylinder which if you're putting in a Z

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.319 
cylinder which if you're putting in a Z
you<00:02:12.829> shouldn't<00:02:13.130> have<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.250> four<00:02:13.549> cylinder<00:02:13.940> but

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
you shouldn't have a four cylinder but

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.210 
you shouldn't have a four cylinder but
I've<00:02:14.810> got<00:02:14.989> a<00:02:15.019> v8<00:02:15.319> in<00:02:15.470> mine<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:15.950> was<00:02:16.069> already

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
I've got a v8 in mine so it was already
