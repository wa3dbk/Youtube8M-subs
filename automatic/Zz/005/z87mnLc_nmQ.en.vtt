generation of one that will probably be

what<00:01:17.460> did<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.670> card<00:01:18.000> you're<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:19.970> then

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
what did you card you're going with then

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.149 
what did you card you're going with then
i'd<00:01:21.270> say<00:01:22.640> go<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> multiple<00:01:25.170> setup<00:01:25.830> because

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
i'd say go with a multiple setup because

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.219 
i'd say go with a multiple setup because
it<00:01:26.490> will<00:01:26.580> probably<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.939> cheaper<00:01:27.360> now<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.780> buy

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
it will probably be cheaper now to buy

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.620 
it will probably be cheaper now to buy
that<00:01:28.500> second<00:01:28.920> card<00:01:29.189> prices<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.150> dropped<00:01:30.299> on

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that second card prices have dropped on

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.350 
that second card prices have dropped on
that<00:01:30.750> card<00:01:30.990> since<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.350> bought<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.770> first<00:01:32.009> one

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
that card since you bought the first one

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.620 
that card since you bought the first one
so<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.720> option<00:01:34.079> but<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.770> only<00:01:34.979> if

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
so go that option but that is only if

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.319 
so go that option but that is only if
your<00:01:36.630> motherboard<00:01:37.200> supports<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:39.150> it

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
your motherboard supports it if it

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.170 
your motherboard supports it if it
doesn't<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.140> no<00:01:40.530> choice<00:01:40.970> they<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
doesn't you have no choice they have to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.560 
doesn't you have no choice they have to
go<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.500> know<00:01:43.619> another<00:01:44.040> video<00:01:44.880> card<00:01:45.270> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
go with you know another video card a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.319 
go with you know another video card a
single<00:01:46.079> video<00:01:46.259> card<00:01:46.710> or<00:01:47.549> maybe<00:01:47.909> your

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
single video card or maybe your

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.780 
single video card or maybe your
motherboard<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.619> know<00:01:49.740> maybe<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.759> a

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
motherboard you know maybe you have a

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.249 
motherboard you know maybe you have a
motherboard<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.600> will<00:01:51.840> only<00:01:52.020> support

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
motherboard that will only support

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.670 
motherboard that will only support
crossfire<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.820> went<00:01:54.060> with<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.680> video

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
crossfire and you went with a video

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.069 
crossfire and you went with a video
product<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.729> can't<00:01:56.969> do<00:01:57.149> SLI<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:57.990> that

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
product that you can't do SLI so in that

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.569 
product that you can't do SLI so in that
case<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.680> know<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.969> go<00:02:00.719> ahead<00:02:00.840> and
