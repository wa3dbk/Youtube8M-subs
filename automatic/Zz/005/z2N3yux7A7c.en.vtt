00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
dry while in the brush guard so you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.780 
dry while in the brush guard so you
don't<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.690> to<00:01:33.840> worry<00:01:33.960> about<00:01:34.050> that<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
don't have to worry about that and

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.030 
don't have to worry about that and
another<00:01:35.790> plus<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.930> sort<00:01:37.920> of

another plus is that you can sort of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.680 
another plus is that you can sort of
leave<00:01:38.220> little<00:01:38.400> extra<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.150> then<00:01:39.360> dry<00:01:39.570> them

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
leave little extra and then dry them

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.930 
leave little extra and then dry them
upside<00:01:40.050> down<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.560> if<00:01:40.740> any<00:01:40.950> iso<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.520> still<00:01:41.760> left

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
upside down so if any iso is still left

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.670 
upside down so if any iso is still left
in<00:01:42.119> there<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.840> not<00:01:43.050> going<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.320> wreck<00:01:43.470> the

bacteria and then when you sharpen you

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.460 
bacteria and then when you sharpen you
just<00:02:19.190> go<00:02:19.340> from<00:02:19.610> pencil<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.600> pencil<00:02:20.960> spreading

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
just go from pencil the pencil spreading

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.870 
just go from pencil the pencil spreading
the<00:02:21.560> bacteria<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:26.410> clean<00:02:27.410> my<00:02:27.560> spatula<00:02:27.890> all<00:02:28.370> the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
the bacteria I clean my spatula all the

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.670 
the bacteria I clean my spatula all the
time<00:02:29.150> because<00:02:29.510> i<00:02:29.720> use<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.050> pretty<00:02:30.170> much<00:02:30.380> every

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
time because i use it pretty much every

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.890 
time because i use it pretty much every
day<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.130> I<00:02:31.940> think<00:02:32.000> it's<00:02:32.240> really<00:02:32.450> important<00:02:32.810> to

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
day and I think it's really important to

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.080 
day and I think it's really important to
make<00:02:33.170> sure<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.680> clean<00:02:33.920> same<00:02:34.760> with<00:02:34.940> my

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:45.830 
make sure that is clean same with my
palate

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.930
