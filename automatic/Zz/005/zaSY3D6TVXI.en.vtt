00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.470
 Hallescher FC against Eintracht Frankfurt and the biggest question 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.530
 before this game 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.960
 where do they play at all 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.270
 because the domestic pol-ver the stadium is currently under construction and will 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.090

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.420
 September hand re-opened and therefore in front of the hall first the 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.180
 Game in the stadium at Bildungszentrum austragen 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.970
 but he said the whiskey 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.089
 that's too small for us and then you're off at HFC and have 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.609
 a total of eleven stadiums asked look the power makes them crackle 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.960
 Game Journey to Jerusalem only without Navi also has about as long 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.160
 lasted 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.940
 everywhere one got himself a basket partly the stadiums were otherwise 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.660
 awarded partly for security reasons 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.940
 And where do you play now three times may they guess in the stadium at the education center 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.090
 So why just if it is complicated but Torsten Püschel 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.090
 not all were to go with this choice 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.420
 the Frankfurt club blood at the start of the game go whole this year 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.630
 34 concord sent to the party lost until the kickoff on the ball of 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.259
 Stadions of Bordeaux and Marseilles 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.960
 had the game in the minute deferment complete Bull comes surprisingly in goal 

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:14.600
 the Eintracht not in the gate but also Conny Kurth on the 37-year oldie 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.880
 so you are in the first point game more only on the bench have a lot to the goalkeeper 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.549
 castling 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.219
 With this decision, I first set the clock to the cup 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.850
 Photo Janina dark jerseys Halle against the red last year in the first 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.100
 Round the second division Union Berlin from the Cup bowed by Michael is great 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.100
 that wins the running duel against Schalke was 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.950
 had great trouble in these first minutes with the newcomer 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.110
 Preuss from the fifth league vs Halberstadt 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.110
 after Halle the subsequent corner 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.710
 we have 20 meters 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.520
 close to the post 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.320

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.790
 the rest of the Frankfurters 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.080
 many still there as a small protest against the small stadium the few 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.950
 Nevertheless, the 300-meter cards were thought to be armored 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.079
 End Gerke had to come down with ankle problems for him comes Korkmaz 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.150
 on the left defensive position Ruth Köhler and that will be a big problem 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.919
 for the Frankfurt in this first half 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.649

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:32.479
 the Geneva SVP 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:34.139
 No 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.139
 by no means 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.529
 continue along the way 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:46.099
 with a broad chest 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.099
 4 final stage ago 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:52.299
 Part 1 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.239
 Fischer would be tried and tested 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.709
 He also played Bundesliga on the finances in the 90s 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:59.609
 not served 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.439
 at 1 2 this year in central defense with a bar and 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:03.279
 Schildenfeld 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:06.279
 the no concrete trace 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:09.749
 from self-appointed 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:11.809
 again and again on the Straubinger 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:14.809
 as the case 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.309

 all at least track bed 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.729
 always increase at Real 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:47.149
 currently much too late completely overwhelmed with the rain 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:52.619
 another corner 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.479
 the last seconds before the break 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:00.429
 Ceramic APA 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.739
 Siebert 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:20.809
 to flow in tears 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.460
 Ultimately, the court ruled 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.820
 Photo Re, on the other hand, was Ina Menzer of HCD the better team 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.449
 there can be happy 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.240
 The second half of Frankfurt now are the cheap minions over serve 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.289
 therefore came 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.080
 in the back 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.080
 but initially fail in the hall Wagenfeld 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.270
 good and happy 25 meters Maik Wagefeld 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.120
 so far for the squadron Spellerberg second race 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.680
 the first chance in the game 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.960
 neither her the award 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.009
 Frankfurt now in the middle of the second half, there is the endgame more 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:13.560
 Ball possession offer everyone standing deeper 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.539
 one for him as he forgot 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.659
 Costs etc 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:24.779
 Martin Fenin double top today how does the more agile 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.770
 No 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:40.209
 but now with big problems lack of concentration no offside CD 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:44.870
 and nothing works 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.009
 that fails in a duel 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:49.150
 before that was 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.509
 2 38 the oldie in the gate also at Halle 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.309
 Peters who was able to play again as Petric from the beginning 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:58.490
 to the shoulders 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.409
 from today 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:02.029
 for five minutes 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:05.080
 like the OFC against GKS 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.080
 the concert hall is already demanding something of it 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:15.939
 the usual discussions 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:19.259
 we will see in slow motion now there is a contact 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.789
 and way that makes it quite clever 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:24.979
 and now it wants to be really hot 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:27.400
 grabs the ball Chechnya way 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.159
 and I want to transform it myself 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:33.159
 Here they learn it against Orbans 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:39.669
 that's back 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.129
 after five races 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:46.129
 80 minutes 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.020
 the last seconds are running 

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:56.879
 the KSG in the fight against Oranje today it is nothing 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:01.619
 Iceland with its keeper bitter wait is worth two new tougher ahead 

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:04.619
 Lakers cashed is such a game 

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:07.360
 their commitment is continued 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.930
 and I'm glad she did not meet the same fate yesterday 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.930
 Wolfsburg 

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:24.499
 So the Belgian team pay so much respect because that's just it 

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:27.889
 Of course the good players have seen the best 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:32.210
 will probably have to go the percent of those songs they do for less well 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.300
 he has warned, "he warned 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.930
 Problem 2 You can not stand 400 meter hurdles for a moment 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:40.639
 meaningful 

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:43.729
 usually decisions are pants with life 

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:47.219
 »Continue Frankfurt with 4 

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:50.649
 in round two a game with two winners 

00:07:50.649 --> 00:07:55.319
 the reform of the opponent and today peacefully celebrate for Frankfurt the 

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:57.020
 first 

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.550
 So Halle no stumbling block for Eintracht and the Sparkasse as the 

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:02.889
 most 1 2
