cap on B but this time the Guardian

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.760 
cap on B but this time the Guardian
doesn't<00:03:30.150> do<00:03:30.300> much<00:03:30.510> as<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.930> enemy<00:03:31.110> comes<00:03:31.590> up

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
doesn't do much as the enemy comes up

doesn't do much as the enemy comes up
from<00:03:31.950> behind<00:03:32.010> but<00:03:33.000> at<00:03:33.120> this<00:03:33.240> point<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:34.170> game

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
from behind but at this point the game

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.530 
from behind but at this point the game
is<00:03:34.650> mathematically<00:03:35.459> impossible<00:03:35.490> to<00:03:36.150> win<00:03:36.270> for

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.080 

let's<00:03:44.410> take<00:03:44.590> a<00:03:44.620> look<00:03:44.830> at<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.040> map<00:03:45.310> for<00:03:45.610> century

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
let's take a look at the map for century

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.810 
let's take a look at the map for century
placement<00:03:46.630> while<00:03:47.350> planting<00:03:47.650> centuries<00:03:48.370> you

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
placement while planting centuries you

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.940 
placement while planting centuries you
want<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.120> maximize<00:03:49.750> range<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:50.500> visibility

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
want to maximize range and visibility

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.670 
want to maximize range and visibility
which<00:03:51.490> is<00:03:51.670> why<00:03:51.820> I<00:03:51.850> tend<00:03:52.360> to<00:03:52.480> keep<00:03:52.660> mine<00:03:52.960> outside

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
which is why I tend to keep mine outside

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.370 
which is why I tend to keep mine outside
in<00:03:54.010> this<00:03:54.640> particular<00:03:54.880> game<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.870> enemy<00:03:56.230> was

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
in this particular game the enemy was

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.800 
in this particular game the enemy was
very<00:03:56.710> aggressive<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.610> my<00:03:57.820> team<00:03:58.150> wasn't<00:03:58.510> very

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
very aggressive and my team wasn't very

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.230 
very aggressive and my team wasn't very
good<00:03:58.930> overall<00:03:59.440> so<00:04:00.220> we<00:04:00.370> couldn't<00:04:00.700> really<00:04:00.970> keep

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
good overall so we couldn't really keep

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.050 
good overall so we couldn't really keep
them<00:04:01.450> off<00:04:01.690> of<00:04:01.870> our<00:04:02.080> side<00:04:02.500> thus<00:04:03.400> couldn't

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
them off of our side thus couldn't

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.480 
them off of our side thus couldn't
prevent<00:04:04.330> them<00:04:04.570> from<00:04:04.600> killing<00:04:04.990> my<00:04:05.260> stuff<00:04:05.560> plus

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
prevent them from killing my stuff plus

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.120 
prevent them from killing my stuff plus
I<00:04:06.730> opted<00:04:07.330> to<00:04:07.450> plant<00:04:07.720> outside<00:04:07.990> due<00:04:08.800> to<00:04:08.950> their

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
I opted to plant outside due to their
