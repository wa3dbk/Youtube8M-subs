the tone tada while some of it was I
guess<00:02:56.930> relevant<00:02:57.930> as<00:02:58.079> far<00:02:58.290> as<00:02:58.379> because<00:02:58.590> you

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
guess relevant as far as because you

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.080 
guess relevant as far as because you
know<00:02:58.769> they<00:02:58.890> are<00:02:59.040> relevant<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.730> art<00:02:59.879> and

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
know they are relevant to the art and

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.610 
know they are relevant to the art and
it's<00:03:00.150> kind<00:03:00.359> of<00:03:00.390> giving<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.959> little<00:03:01.170> bit<00:03:01.290> more<00:03:01.500> of

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
it's kind of giving a little bit more of

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.990 
it's kind of giving a little bit more of
an<00:03:01.709> understanding<00:03:01.799> of<00:03:02.310> how<00:03:02.459> fucked<00:03:02.730> up<00:03:02.879> the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
an understanding of how fucked up the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.610 
an understanding of how fucked up the
donkey<00:03:03.359> hope<00:03:03.540> they<00:03:03.690> have<00:03:03.900> been<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.470> they

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
donkey hope they have been that they

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.990 
donkey hope they have been that they
were<00:03:04.680> torturing<00:03:05.010> them<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.579> they<00:03:05.670> had<00:03:05.849> them

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
were torturing them that they had them

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.150 
were torturing them that they had them
like<00:03:06.150> slaves<00:03:06.599> they<00:03:07.290> couldn't<00:03:07.590> do<00:03:07.739> shit<00:03:07.799> they

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
like slaves they couldn't do shit they

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.979 
like slaves they couldn't do shit they
were<00:03:08.280> really<00:03:08.489> fucked<00:03:09.090> up<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.540> tauntaun<00:03:09.930> oh

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
were really fucked up to the tauntaun oh

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.210 
were really fucked up to the tauntaun oh
so<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.260> could<00:03:10.379> definitely<00:03:10.500> say<00:03:10.709> they<00:03:10.920> have<00:03:11.040> a

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
so you could definitely say they have a

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.789 
so you could definitely say they have a
vengeance<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.209> they<00:03:12.359> have<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.870> grudge<00:03:13.290> against

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
vengeance and they have a grudge against

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.830 
vengeance and they have a grudge against
them<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.069> I<00:03:14.220> guess<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:15.180> send<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.510> green<00:03:15.690> if

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
them and I guess to send the green if

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.550 
them and I guess to send the green if
you<00:03:15.900> definitely<00:03:16.200> say<00:03:16.319> that<00:03:16.349> they're

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
you definitely say that they're

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.530 
you definitely say that they're
justified<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.400> wanting<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.880> fuck<00:03:18.120> over<00:03:18.269> the

and their relation to everything in this

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.229 
and their relation to everything in this
plot<00:03:43.319> so<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.590> kind<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.799> adds<00:03:44.209> validity<00:03:45.209> to

the biggest thing is kind of for the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.569 
the biggest thing is kind of for the
most<00:03:49.049> part<00:03:49.200> where<00:03:49.380> everyone<00:03:49.739> guests<00:03:50.099> a<00:03:50.340> lot<00:03:50.489> of

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
most part where everyone guests a lot of

most part where everyone guests a lot of
people<00:03:50.790> were<00:03:50.880> really<00:03:51.000> guessing<00:03:51.389> this<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.720> I

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
people were really guessing this and I

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.479 
people were really guessing this and I
don't<00:03:52.079> think<00:03:52.169> it<00:03:52.349> was<00:03:52.440> like<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:52.859> big<00:03:52.919> secret
