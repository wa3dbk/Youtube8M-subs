00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
light but actually this is a very dark

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.250 
light but actually this is a very dark
navy<00:00:44.610> nickel<00:00:45.539> fari<00:00:45.809> coat<00:00:46.760> which<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.260> quite

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
navy nickel fari coat which is quite

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.090 
navy nickel fari coat which is quite
nice<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:49.980> recently<00:00:50.160> bought<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:50.850> bag<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
nice just recently bought this bag and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.549 
nice just recently bought this bag and
which<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.250> quite<00:00:53.489> fun<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.210> little<00:00:54.750> tassels

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
which is quite fun if you little tassels

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.830 
which is quite fun if you little tassels
on<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.710> front<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:57.270> think<00:00:57.449> that's<00:00:57.660> why<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
on the front and I think that's why I

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.529 
on the front and I think that's why I
called<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.469> bro<00:00:59.010> or<00:00:59.280> something<00:00:59.850> never<00:01:00.059> really

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
called a bro or something never really

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.690 
called a bro or something never really
heard<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.820> it's<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.239> quite<00:01:03.570> nice<00:01:04.700> ok

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
heard of it but it's it's quite nice ok

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.000 
heard of it but it's it's quite nice ok
and<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.270> thought<00:01:06.540> for<00:01:07.020> ease<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.320> shopping

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
and I thought for ease of shopping

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.770 
and I thought for ease of shopping
because<00:01:08.610> actually<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.150> go<00:01:09.180> shopping<00:01:09.479> in

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
because actually if you go shopping in

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.660 
because actually if you go shopping in
jeans<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.229> quite<00:01:10.500> hard<00:01:10.710> work<00:01:10.979> taking<00:01:11.580> them

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
jeans it's quite hard work taking them

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.810 
jeans it's quite hard work taking them
off<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.299> everything<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.770> am<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.250> wearing
