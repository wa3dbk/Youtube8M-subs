00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
actually we place a boat this is the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.660 
actually we place a boat this is the
rand<00:00:55.530> thing<00:00:55.860> unlike<00:00:56.340> those<00:00:56.610> HD<00:00:57.360> 1<00:00:57.600> XE<00:00:58.559> 2<00:00:58.829> they

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
rand thing unlike those HD 1 XE 2 they

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.330 
rand thing unlike those HD 1 XE 2 they
have<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> square<00:01:00.270> one<00:01:00.570> nice<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:01.829> are<00:01:02.129> not

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
have a square one nice but they are not

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.200 
have a square one nice but they are not
interchangeable<00:01:03.619> so<00:01:04.820> beside<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> diopter

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
interchangeable so beside the diopter

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.140 
interchangeable so beside the diopter
and<00:01:06.630> now<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.920> what<00:01:08.159> if<00:01:08.369> your<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
and now this is what if your the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.620 
and now this is what if your the
eyepiece<00:01:09.659> prep<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.140> gone<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.799> my<00:01:11.130> one<00:01:11.630> my

I<00:01:50.610> think<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.149> 19<00:01:51.780> millimeter<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.040> don't

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
I think this is 19 millimeter I don't

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.730 
I think this is 19 millimeter I don't
have<00:01:53.939> an<00:01:54.090> exact<00:01:54.630> measurements<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.350> think

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
rubber ring that would be looks really

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.600

on that eye sensor I don't know if with
the<00:02:51.630> rubber<00:02:51.930> ring<00:02:52.260> will<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.370> block<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.850> eye

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
the rubber ring will that block the eye

drop<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.130> sensor<00:03:53.609> that<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.000> eye<00:03:54.150> sensor

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
drop the sensor that the eye sensor

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.190 
drop the sensor that the eye sensor
right<00:03:56.430> here<00:03:56.760> because<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.569> Fuji<00:03:57.959> got<00:03:58.109> the

right here because that the Fuji got the

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.610 
right here because that the Fuji got the
sensor<00:03:58.709> so<00:03:59.130> you<00:03:59.160> can<00:03:59.430> of<00:04:00.299> a<00:04:00.390> sense<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:01.140> put<00:04:01.530> the

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
sensor so you can of a sense you put the

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.250 
sensor so you can of a sense you put the
eye<00:04:01.829> on<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.310> do<00:04:02.549> turn<00:04:02.819> on<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.090> finder<00:04:03.600> but

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
eye on and do turn on the finder but

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.160 
eye on and do turn on the finder but
with<00:04:04.709> this<00:04:04.950> one<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:05.760> features<00:04:06.030> not<00:04:06.540> going<00:04:07.049> to

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
with this one that features not going to

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.759 
with this one that features not going to
work<00:04:07.410> so<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:07.980> got<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.280> choose<00:04:08.609> your<00:04:09.560> LCD<00:04:10.560> or

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
work so you got to choose your LCD or

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.569 
work so you got to choose your LCD or
either<00:04:11.549> finder<00:04:12.510> so<00:04:12.989> you<00:04:13.709> have<00:04:13.889> to<00:04:14.069> do<00:04:14.459> it

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
either finder so you have to do it

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.819 
either finder so you have to do it
manually<00:04:15.120> because<00:04:15.329> it<00:04:15.540> is<00:04:15.630> it<00:04:16.260> would<00:04:16.560> block

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
manually because it is it would block

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.009 
manually because it is it would block
the<00:04:17.010> sensei<00:04:17.400> then<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.450> camera<00:04:18.810> always

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
the sensei then and the camera always

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.219 
the sensei then and the camera always
think<00:04:19.380> you<00:04:19.470> put<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:19.919> eye<00:04:20.130> right<00:04:20.370> here<00:04:20.430> so<00:04:21.389> so

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
think you put the eye right here so so

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.920 
think you put the eye right here so so
there's<00:04:22.500> one<00:04:22.800> drawback<00:04:23.130> on<00:04:23.580> here<00:04:23.820> but<00:04:24.000> yeah

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
there's one drawback on here but yeah

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.249 
there's one drawback on here but yeah
the<00:04:25.190> rubber<00:04:26.190> ring<00:04:26.460> like<00:04:26.669> this<00:04:26.850> was<00:04:27.449> very

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259 
the rubber ring like this was very

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.890 
the rubber ring like this was very
comfortable<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:29.430> and<00:04:29.729> no<00:04:30.060> fair<00:04:30.449> at<00:04:30.690> all

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900
