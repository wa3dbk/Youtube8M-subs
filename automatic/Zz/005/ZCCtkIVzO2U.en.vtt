so<00:00:24.930> as<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.470> probably<00:00:25.680> guess<00:00:26.160> peppermint

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
so as you can probably guess peppermint

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.640 
so as you can probably guess peppermint
oil<00:00:26.820> comes<00:00:27.150> from<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> peppermint<00:00:27.840> plant<00:00:28.230> but

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
oil comes from the peppermint plant but

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.689 
oil comes from the peppermint plant but
maybe<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:28.980> didn't<00:00:29.310> know<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
maybe you didn't know that the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.070 
maybe you didn't know that the
peppermint<00:00:30.119> plan<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.480> actually<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.869> cross

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
peppermint plan is actually a cross

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.139 
peppermint plan is actually a cross
between<00:00:31.320> water<00:00:31.800> mint<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.219> spearmint<00:00:32.910> it's

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
between water mint and spearmint it's

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.060 
between water mint and spearmint it's
like<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> hybrid<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:34.110> was<00:00:34.290> first<00:00:34.530> recognized<00:00:34.920> by

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
like a hybrid it was first recognized by
