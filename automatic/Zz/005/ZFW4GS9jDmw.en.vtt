00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
large so what you have to do is kind of

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.859 
large so what you have to do is kind of
measure<00:01:55.200> your<00:01:55.560> phone<00:01:55.829> case<00:01:56.070> or<00:01:56.850> your<00:01:57.630> phone

actually<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.500> then<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:59.549> have<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.090> like

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
actually and then you have to like

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.740 
actually and then you have to like
shrink<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.820> crop<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> size<00:02:03.600> you

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
shrink it and crop it to the size you

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.660 
shrink it and crop it to the size you
think<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.380> might<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.040> use<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> ruler

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
think so you might have to use a ruler

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.980 
think so you might have to use a ruler
to<00:02:05.850> measure<00:02:05.969> or<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.360> could<00:02:06.509> just<00:02:06.540> kind<00:02:06.869> of

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
to measure or you could just kind of

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.440 
to measure or you could just kind of
like<00:02:08.899> eyeball<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.920> see

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
like eyeball it just to see

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.089

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
the lens if you know what I mean so

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.510 
the lens if you know what I mean so

you're just going to do that and when
you<00:05:05.610> take<00:05:05.850> it<00:05:06.030> out<00:05:06.150> you<00:05:06.360> should<00:05:06.570> have

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
you take it out you should have

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.410 
you take it out you should have
something<00:05:07.110> like<00:05:07.410> that<00:05:07.650> you<00:05:08.130> see<00:05:08.550> that<00:05:08.700> it's

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
something like that you see that it's

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.400 
something like that you see that it's
like<00:05:09.540> a<00:05:09.840> lens<00:05:10.640> shape<00:05:11.640> so<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:13.050> next<00:05:13.290> thing

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
like a lens shape so the next thing

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.680 
like a lens shape so the next thing
that's<00:05:13.560> it<00:05:13.800> going<00:05:14.370> to<00:05:14.490> do<00:05:14.580> is<00:05:14.850> take<00:05:15.180> your

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
that's it going to do is take your

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.530 
that's it going to do is take your
scissors<00:05:16.350> or<00:05:16.650> your<00:05:17.370> exacto<00:05:17.790> knife<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.180> just

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
scissors or your exacto knife and just

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:27.830 
scissors or your exacto knife and just
cut<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:20.090> shape<00:05:21.090> that<00:05:21.120> you<00:05:21.390> just<00:05:21.570> made<00:05:26.750> okay<00:05:27.750> so

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
cut the shape that you just made okay so

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.710 
cut the shape that you just made okay so
I<00:05:28.080> just<00:05:28.590> cut<00:05:28.980> mine<00:05:29.220> and<00:05:29.580> it<00:05:30.150> should<00:05:30.419> hopefully

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
I just cut mine and it should hopefully

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.140 
I just cut mine and it should hopefully
look<00:05:31.380> something<00:05:31.680> like<00:05:31.710> this<00:05:32.010> or<00:05:32.430> you<00:05:33.030> know

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
look something like this or you know

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.020 
look something like this or you know
better<00:05:33.510> if<00:05:33.780> you<00:05:33.900> can<00:05:34.080> and<00:05:37.460> should<00:05:38.460> fit<00:05:38.760> in<00:05:38.880> your

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
better if you can and should fit in your

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.280 
better if you can and should fit in your
case<00:05:39.270> and<00:05:39.600> if<00:05:40.370> the<00:05:41.370> lens<00:05:42.180> like<00:05:42.750> it<00:05:42.960> might<00:05:43.140> be

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
case and if the lens like it might be

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.260 
case and if the lens like it might be
popping<00:05:43.830> out<00:05:43.950> like<00:05:44.370> you<00:05:44.669> didn't<00:05:44.910> cut<00:05:45.120> it

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
popping out like you didn't cut it

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.400 
popping out like you didn't cut it
enough<00:05:45.540> then<00:05:46.260> just<00:05:46.620> go<00:05:46.770> ahead<00:05:47.010> and<00:05:47.220> fix<00:05:47.520> it<00:05:48.410> but

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
enough then just go ahead and fix it but

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.800 
enough then just go ahead and fix it but
yeah<00:05:49.880> you<00:05:50.880> should<00:05:51.030> look<00:05:51.150> something<00:05:51.390> like<00:05:51.540> this

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
yeah you should look something like this

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.610 
yeah you should look something like this
