00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.830 

when<00:00:12.630> there<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.049> this<00:00:14.299> constipation<00:00:15.299> or

backed up intestinal tract and many of

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.690 
backed up intestinal tract and many of
the<00:00:18.840> things<00:00:19.050> we've<00:00:19.410> been<00:00:19.650> talking<00:00:19.710> about<00:00:20.220> like

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:20.700 
the things we've been talking about like

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.990 
the things we've been talking about like
food<00:00:21.000> sensitivities<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:23.000> low

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
food sensitivities and and low

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.480 
food sensitivities and and low
hydrochloric<00:00:24.689> acid<00:00:25.169> we<00:00:25.770> create<00:00:26.220> an

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
hydrochloric acid we create an

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.560 
hydrochloric acid we create an
inflammation<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.199> digestive<00:00:28.830> tract<00:00:29.189> that

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
inflammation in the digestive tract that

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.269 
inflammation in the digestive tract that
results<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:30.840> condition<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.500> call<00:00:31.800> leaky

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
results in this condition we call leaky

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.540 
results in this condition we call leaky
gut<00:00:32.519> if<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.510> look<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.379> would<00:00:34.710> be<00:00:34.860> considered

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
gut if you look that would be considered

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.910 
gut if you look that would be considered
the<00:00:36.000> healthy<00:00:36.570> digestive<00:00:37.199> tract<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.710> what

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the healthy digestive tract and what

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.030 
the healthy digestive tract and what
you're<00:00:38.070> seeing<00:00:38.460> there<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:39.059> you're<00:00:39.930> seeing<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
you're seeing there is you're seeing the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.310 
you're seeing there is you're seeing the
mucosal<00:00:41.699> lining<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.330> small<00:00:42.570> intestine

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
mucosal lining of the small intestine

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.969 
mucosal lining of the small intestine
now<00:00:43.830> what<00:00:44.159> that<00:00:44.190> means<00:00:44.549> is<00:00:44.879> these<00:00:45.150> guts<00:00:45.510> are

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:45.979 
now what that means is these guts are

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.289 
now what that means is these guts are
digested<00:00:46.979> that's<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.430> key<00:00:47.640> word<00:00:47.670> here

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:48.299 
digested that's the key word here

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:52.219 
digested that's the key word here
protein<00:00:49.199> starches<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.769> fats<00:00:50.540> so<00:00:51.540> these<00:00:51.839> dots

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:52.229 
protein starches and fats so these dots

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.579 
protein starches and fats so these dots
your<00:00:53.190> gatekeeper<00:00:53.489> says<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.140> enter<00:00:55.470> the

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
your gatekeeper says you can enter the

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.890 
your gatekeeper says you can enter the
bloodstream<00:00:55.860> as<00:00:56.400> nutrients<00:00:57.150> for<00:00:57.420> your<00:00:57.629> body

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
bloodstream as nutrients for your body

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.670 
bloodstream as nutrients for your body
and<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.979> is<00:00:59.280> healthy<00:00:59.750> because<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.080> mucosal

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
and that is healthy because the mucosal

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.840 
and that is healthy because the mucosal
lining<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.250> intact<00:01:03.199> but<00:01:04.199> due<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:05.189> lot<00:01:05.700> of

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
lining is intact but due to a lot of

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.730 
lining is intact but due to a lot of
what<00:01:06.000> I've<00:01:06.119> been<00:01:06.270> speaking<00:01:06.570> about<00:01:06.840> today<00:01:07.350> poor

what I've been speaking about today poor

erodes<00:01:15.299> away<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.670> what<00:01:17.939> you've<00:01:18.750> got

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
erodes away and you know what you've got

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.410 
erodes away and you know what you've got
everything<00:01:19.829> passing<00:01:20.579> through<00:01:21.270> your

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
result of that well if you're

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.529 
result of that well if you're
predisposed<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.960> autoimmune<00:01:34.920> problems

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
predisposed to autoimmune problems

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.149 
predisposed to autoimmune problems
you're<00:01:36.539> going<00:01:36.899> to<00:01:37.079> develop<00:01:37.320> an<00:01:37.679> autoimmune

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
you're going to develop an autoimmune

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.419 
you're going to develop an autoimmune
response<00:01:38.399> and<00:01:39.409> eventually<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.950> could

response and eventually you could

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.410 
response and eventually you could
develop<00:01:42.049> something<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.439> lupus<00:01:44.069> or<00:01:44.420> asthma

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
develop something like lupus or asthma

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.459 
develop something like lupus or asthma
or<00:01:47.090> Crohn's<00:01:48.090> disease<00:01:50.090> but<00:01:51.090> what<00:01:51.390> happens<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.439> a
