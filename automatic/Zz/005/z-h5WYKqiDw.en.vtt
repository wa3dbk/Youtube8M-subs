on<00:00:14.759> one<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.570> then<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.900> could<00:00:15.960> complete<00:00:16.650> it

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:44.630 
don't know if you guys show you guys to
just<00:00:34.140> make<00:00:34.380> sure<00:00:34.880> third<00:00:35.880> one<00:00:39.260> but<00:00:41.540> no<00:00:43.640> Jordan

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
just make sure third one but no Jordan

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.520 
just make sure third one but no Jordan
or<00:00:44.789> LeBron<00:00:44.820> yet<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.320> no<00:00:46.500> jazz<00:00:48.079> gonna<00:00:49.079> William

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
or LeBron yet and no jazz gonna William

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.869 
or LeBron yet and no jazz gonna William
action<00:00:50.070> so

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.340 

and<00:00:55.879> again<00:00:56.300> hopefully<00:00:56.660> we're<00:00:56.960> still<00:00:57.200> missing

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
and again hopefully we're still missing

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.680 
and again hopefully we're still missing
the<00:00:57.559> case<00:00:57.920> hit<00:01:00.190> if<00:01:01.190> we<00:01:01.640> pull<00:01:01.879> I<00:01:02.239> think<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.570> look

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
the case hit if we pull I think a look

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.530 
the case hit if we pull I think a look
at<00:01:02.840> Jordan<00:01:03.320> or<00:01:03.500> LeBron<00:01:03.530> auto<00:01:04.159> I<00:01:04.430> think<00:01:04.760> this

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
at Jordan or LeBron auto I think this

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:21.910 
at Jordan or LeBron auto I think this
would<00:01:05.840> be<00:01:05.869> a<00:01:06.020> very<00:01:06.260> solid<00:01:06.710> case<00:01:12.970> alright<00:01:20.920> and

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
would be a very solid case alright and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.200 
would be a very solid case alright and
that<00:01:22.670> took<00:01:22.909> 1<00:01:23.180> minute<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:24.220> 24<00:01:25.220> seconds<00:01:25.759> I

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
that took 1 minute and 24 seconds I

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.330 
that took 1 minute and 24 seconds I
guess<00:01:26.630> faster<00:01:27.080> every<00:01:27.350> time<00:01:27.560> oh<00:01:30.130> alright<00:01:31.130> here

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
guess faster every time oh alright here

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.850 
guess faster every time oh alright here
we<00:01:31.369> go<00:01:31.430> Dirk<00:01:32.119> Nowitzki<00:01:32.660> based<00:01:33.410> number<00:01:33.740> ooh

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
the guys I'm stitching on there and it's

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.710 
the guys I'm stitching on there and it's
from<00:04:22.170> the<00:04:22.290> Minnesota<00:04:22.890> one<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.370> think<00:04:23.660> yeah<00:04:24.660> I

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
from the Minnesota one I think yeah I

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.780 
from the Minnesota one I think yeah I
don't<00:04:24.900> think<00:04:25.290> a<00:04:26.450> celtics<00:04:27.450> has<00:04:27.630> blue<00:04:28.440> ones<00:04:28.740> but

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.290 

I<00:04:31.850> think<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.720> shack<00:04:33.110> is<00:04:33.350> from<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.710> sun's<00:04:34.300> but

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
I think the shack is from the sun's but

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.000 
I think the shack is from the sun's but
on<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:36.110> card<00:04:36.610> it<00:04:37.610> does<00:04:37.910> say<00:04:38.210> a<00:04:38.420> shack<00:04:38.930> for<00:04:39.260> the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
on the card it does say a shack for the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.150 
on the card it does say a shack for the
Cavs<00:04:40.310> so<00:04:40.790> that's<00:04:41.120> going<00:04:41.270> to<00:04:41.330> be<00:04:41.390> Cavs<00:04:41.920> so<00:04:42.920> no

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
Cavs so that's going to be Cavs so no

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.280 
Cavs so that's going to be Cavs so no
songs<00:04:43.930> so<00:04:44.930> it's<00:04:45.410> going<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:45.590> be<00:04:45.650> lakers<00:04:46.190> celtics
