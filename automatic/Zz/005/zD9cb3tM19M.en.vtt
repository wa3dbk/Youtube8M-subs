the reason it was made hard in the

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.460 
the reason it was made hard in the
beginning<00:03:26.090> is<00:03:26.300> because<00:03:26.330> it<00:03:26.870> was<00:03:27.050> made<00:03:27.230> for<00:03:27.410> the

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
beginning is because it was made for the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.100 
beginning is because it was made for the
arcades<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.370> in<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.240> arcade<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.810> more<00:03:29.990> you

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.540 
arcades and in the arcade the more you
die<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.380> more<00:03:30.650> quarters<00:03:31.040> you<00:03:31.130> put<00:03:31.340> in<00:03:31.459> the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
die the more quarters you put in the

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.690 
die the more quarters you put in the
more<00:03:31.700> money<00:03:31.910> capcom<00:03:32.900> will<00:03:33.170> make<00:03:33.410> I<00:03:33.740> believe

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
more money capcom will make I believe

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.040 
more money capcom will make I believe
this<00:03:34.850> game<00:03:35.060> should<00:03:35.240> have<00:03:35.330> been<00:03:35.450> made<00:03:35.600> easier

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
this game should have been made easier

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.960 
this game should have been made easier
when<00:03:36.380> it<00:03:36.530> was<00:03:36.709> reintroduced<00:03:37.160> into<00:03:37.760> the

I<00:03:40.370> also<00:03:40.730> believe<00:03:41.209> graveyards<00:03:41.900> aren't<00:03:42.320> very

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
I also believe graveyards aren't very

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.290 
I also believe graveyards aren't very
romantic<00:03:43.370> I<00:03:45.310> have<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.459> give<00:03:46.610> credit<00:03:47.090> where

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
and where credit is due in this case is

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.710 
and where credit is due in this case is
the<00:03:50.900> satisfaction<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.130> kill<00:03:52.400> very<00:03:53.239> rarely

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
the satisfaction of the kill very rarely

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.930 
the satisfaction of the kill very rarely
