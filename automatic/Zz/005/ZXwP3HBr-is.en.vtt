kick it let's let the bike run to the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.479 
kick it let's let the bike run to the
side<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.649> you're<00:01:01.800> getting<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.039> feel<00:01:02.250> of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
side just so you're getting a feel of

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.810 
side just so you're getting a feel of
the<00:01:02.730> way<00:01:03.239> transferring<00:01:03.870> around<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.170> bike<00:01:04.820> so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the way transferring around the bike so

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.910 
the way transferring around the bike so
step<00:01:06.090> two<00:01:06.299> you're<00:01:06.720> gonna<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:07.380> doing<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.680> step

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
step two you're gonna be doing the step

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.140 
step two you're gonna be doing the step
one<00:01:08.130> where<00:01:08.369> you're<00:01:08.460> kicking<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> bike<00:01:08.970> but

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
one where you're kicking the bike but

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.700 
one where you're kicking the bike but
you're<00:01:09.270> gonna<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.540> trying<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.869> move<00:01:10.080> your<00:01:10.320> arms

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
you're gonna be trying to move your arms

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.100 
you're gonna be trying to move your arms
in<00:01:11.010> assert<00:01:11.430> like<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> circular<00:01:12.210> motion<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.990> so

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
in assert like a circular motion just so

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.330 
in assert like a circular motion just so
you'll<00:01:13.380> see<00:01:13.530> if<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.680> want<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.920> buy<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.100> whip

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
you'll see if you want the buy to whip

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.880 
you'll see if you want the buy to whip
around<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.580> bars<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.770> quick

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
around the bars so just a quick

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.560 
around the bars so just a quick
demonstration<00:01:17.100> when<00:01:17.580> I'm<00:01:17.670> studies<00:01:18.000> you've

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
demonstration when I'm studies you've

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.749 
demonstration when I'm studies you've
kicked<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> bike<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.560> obviously<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.610> move

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
kicked the bike and obviously you move

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.230 
kicked the bike and obviously you move
the<00:01:20.880> bars<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.229> circle<00:01:22.680> motion<00:01:23.090> just<00:01:24.090> so

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the bars in a circle motion just so

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.670 
the bars in a circle motion just so
you're<00:01:24.390> getting<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.630> bike<00:01:24.840> near<00:01:25.350> where<00:01:25.530> it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you're getting the bike near where it

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.080 
you're getting the bike near where it
started<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.810> again<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:29.070> clean<00:01:29.490> up<00:01:29.610> step<00:01:29.939> one

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
started so again you clean up step one

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.880 
started so again you clean up step one
kicking<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.600> bike<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.200> you're<00:01:31.590> moving<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
kicking the bike and you're moving the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.880 
kicking the bike and you're moving the
bars<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.880> direction<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.770> just

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
bars in that direction so you can just

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.140 
bars in that direction so you can just
keep<00:01:35.009> doing<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.400> by<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:35.670> moving<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> bars

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
keep doing it by just moving the bars

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.260 
keep doing it by just moving the bars
look<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.500> all<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:38.009> your<00:01:38.280> arms<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.820> spin

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
look so it's all in your arms and spin

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.039 
look so it's all in your arms and spin
the<00:01:40.079> movement<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> bars<00:01:43.670> okay<00:01:44.670> step<00:01:44.970> 3<00:01:45.240> now

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
the movement of the bars okay step 3 now

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.139 
the movement of the bars okay step 3 now
you've<00:01:46.619> got<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.829> momentum<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.729> tail<00:01:47.939> whip

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
you've got the momentum the tail whip

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.639 
you've got the momentum the tail whip
you've<00:01:48.270> kicked<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.780> you're<00:01:48.960> moving<00:01:49.200> your<00:01:49.290> arms

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
you've kicked it you're moving your arms

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.139 
you've kicked it you're moving your arms
it's<00:01:50.130> feeling<00:01:50.430> more<00:01:50.520> natural

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
it's feeling more natural

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.060 
it's feeling more natural
the<00:01:51.630> bikes<00:01:51.840> landing<00:01:52.259> at<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> side<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.799> you're

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
the bikes landing at the side of you're

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.160 
the bikes landing at the side of you're
not<00:01:53.159> quite<00:01:53.399> getting<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.850> yet<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.659> step

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
not quite getting on it yet so step

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.289 
not quite getting on it yet so step
three<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.979> need<00:01:56.100> as<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.579> coming<00:01:56.880> around<00:01:57.030> from

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
three you need as you coming around from

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.450 
three you need as you coming around from
the<00:01:57.509> circular<00:01:58.200> motion<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.530> bars<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.340> can

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
the circular motion of the bars you can

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.859 
the circular motion of the bars you can
be<00:01:59.579> pushing<00:01:59.880> it<00:01:59.969> back<00:02:00.119> straight<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.479> front<00:02:00.750> of

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
be pushing it back straight in front of

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.620 
be pushing it back straight in front of
you<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.579> way<00:02:02.700> your<00:02:02.850> gonna<00:02:02.909> land<00:02:03.180> Eva<00:02:03.420> sat

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
you so that way your gonna land Eva sat

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.050 
you so that way your gonna land Eva sat
down<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.020> down<00:02:04.079> now<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.829> bike<00:02:05.060> and

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
down and down now on the bike and

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.819 
down and down now on the bike and
rolling<00:02:06.630> away

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
rolling away

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.350 
rolling away
but<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.459> most<00:02:08.610> important<00:02:08.970> thing<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.149> getting

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
but the most important thing is getting

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.420 
but the most important thing is getting
the<00:02:09.450> bike<00:02:09.629> back<00:02:09.869> underneath<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.379> if<00:02:11.310> you

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
the bike back underneath you if you

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.400 
the bike back underneath you if you
fight<00:02:11.640> over<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.910> big<00:02:12.120> box<00:02:12.360> you're<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.290> gonna

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
fight over a big box you're just gonna

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.900 
fight over a big box you're just gonna
learn<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:14.099> know<00:02:14.220> belly<00:02:14.400> flop<00:02:14.670> it's<00:02:14.819> gonna

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
learn you know belly flop it's gonna

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.449 
learn you know belly flop it's gonna
hurt

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
hurt

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.949 
hurt
and<00:02:17.459> that's<00:02:17.640> step<00:02:17.819> three<00:02:20.239> okay<00:02:21.239> step<00:02:21.480> four<00:02:21.510> now

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
and that's step three okay step four now

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.690 
and that's step three okay step four now
this<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.379> that<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.890> hard<00:02:23.069> a<00:02:23.190> bit<00:02:23.340> it's

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
this is that the hard a bit it's

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.789 
this is that the hard a bit it's
stopping<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.390> rotation<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.140> getting<00:02:25.680> back

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
stopping the rotation and getting back

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.390 
stopping the rotation and getting back
on<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.849> step<00:02:27.510> four<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:28.590> off<00:02:28.709> you<00:02:28.860> got<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.010> stop

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
on so step four you off you got to stop

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.650 
on so step four you off you got to stop
the<00:02:29.489> bike<00:02:29.640> from<00:02:29.730> spinning<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.450> by<00:02:30.569> its

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
the bike from spinning so the by its

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.660 
the bike from spinning so the by its
going<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.810> be<00:02:30.900> coming<00:02:31.110> around<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:32.129> a<00:02:32.310> lot<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.459> a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
going to be coming around and a lot of a

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.039 
going to be coming around and a lot of a
lot<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.849> people<00:02:33.060> just<00:02:33.150> kick<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.569> stop<00:02:33.810> so

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
lot of people just kick it to stop so

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.050 
lot of people just kick it to stop so
you<00:02:34.080> kick<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.709> then<00:02:34.920> land<00:02:35.040> on<00:02:35.190> your<00:02:35.310> first

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
you kick it and then land on your first

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.449 
you kick it and then land on your first
pedal<00:02:36.299> so<00:02:36.599> your<00:02:36.720> front<00:02:36.840> pedal<00:02:37.220> some<00:02:38.220> people

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
pedal so your front pedal some people

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.479 
pedal so your front pedal some people
just<00:02:38.580> get<00:02:38.700> straight<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.090> pedal<00:02:40.489> obviously

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
just get straight to pedal obviously

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.860 
just get straight to pedal obviously
you're<00:02:41.790> learning<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.209> so<00:02:42.390> you're<00:02:42.720> going<00:02:42.840> to

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
you're learning it so you're going to

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.259 
you're learning it so you're going to
stop<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.290> by<00:02:43.380> just<00:02:43.849> obviously<00:02:44.849> hitting<00:02:45.060> you

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
stop it by just obviously hitting you

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.940 
stop it by just obviously hitting you
it's<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:45.690> your<00:02:45.840> leg<00:02:45.989> hence<00:02:46.500> why<00:02:46.680> you'll<00:02:46.860> have

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
it's in your leg hence why you'll have

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.729 
it's in your leg hence why you'll have
the<00:02:47.040> pads<00:02:47.250> on<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.459> or<00:02:47.640> not<00:02:47.760> her<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.739> what

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
the pads on it or not her and what

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.710 
the pads on it or not her and what
you're<00:02:49.860> aiming<00:02:49.980> for<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:50.849> step<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.299> you're

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
you're aiming for in this step is you're

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.660 
you're aiming for in this step is you're
looking<00:02:51.989> for<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.170> first<00:02:52.380> pedal<00:02:52.739> so<00:02:53.459> it's

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
looking for that first pedal so it's

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.890 
looking for that first pedal so it's
clean<00:02:53.880> round<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.209> see<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.480> first<00:02:54.630> pedal

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
clean round you see the first pedal

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.569 
clean round you see the first pedal
that's<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.470> one<00:02:55.620> you're<00:02:55.739> aiming<00:02:56.010> for<00:02:56.190> it

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
that's the one you're aiming for it

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.680 
that's the one you're aiming for it
doesn't<00:02:56.880> matter<00:02:57.000> about<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.329> left<00:02:57.480> leg<00:02:57.660> just

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
doesn't matter about the left leg just

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.630 
doesn't matter about the left leg just
yet<00:02:58.079> so<00:02:58.530> as<00:02:58.920> you're<00:02:59.099> coming<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.519> can

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
yet so as you're coming on you can

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.870 
yet so as you're coming on you can
practice<00:02:59.910> it<00:03:00.030> on<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.239> floor<00:03:00.450> by<00:03:00.630> just<00:03:00.840> going

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
practice it on the floor by just going

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.789 
practice it on the floor by just going
so<00:03:02.880> if<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.840> will<00:03:03.989> if<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.200> stand<00:03:04.410> this<00:03:04.560> side<00:03:04.680> of

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
so if you will if you stand this side of

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.589 
so if you will if you stand this side of
your<00:03:04.860> bike<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.610> can<00:03:05.760> practice<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.209> by<00:03:06.299> just<00:03:06.480> go

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
your bike you can practice it by just go

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.770 
your bike you can practice it by just go
in<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.849> pretty<00:03:09.090> much<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.390> motion<00:03:09.720> of

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
in that is pretty much the motion of

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.229 
in that is pretty much the motion of
getting<00:03:09.989> on<00:03:10.079> a<00:03:10.110> tailwhip<00:03:13.400> final<00:03:14.400> step<00:03:14.639> now

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
getting on a tailwhip final step now

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.420 
getting on a tailwhip final step now
you've<00:03:15.750> got<00:03:15.930> one<00:03:15.959> side<00:03:16.350> on<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.709> bike<00:03:16.859> you<00:03:17.370> need

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
you've got one side on the bike you need

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.250 
you've got one side on the bike you need
to<00:03:17.549> get<00:03:17.639> this<00:03:17.730> leg<00:03:17.940> on<00:03:18.090> now<00:03:18.720> you're<00:03:19.079> going<00:03:19.200> to

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
to get this leg on now you're going to

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.150 
to get this leg on now you're going to
learn<00:03:19.380> so<00:03:19.650> you're<00:03:19.739> probably<00:03:19.889> going<00:03:20.069> to

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
learn so you're probably going to

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.430 
learn so you're probably going to
scramble<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.790> top<00:03:21.030> shoe<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.600> can<00:03:21.720> just<00:03:22.350> to

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
scramble to the top shoe you can just to

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.280 
scramble to the top shoe you can just to
start<00:03:22.680> with<00:03:22.739> just<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:23.069> you<00:03:23.160> can<00:03:23.250> roll<00:03:23.430> away<00:03:24.290> but

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
start with just so you can roll away but
