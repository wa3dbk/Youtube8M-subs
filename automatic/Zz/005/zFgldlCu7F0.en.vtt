00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
his Wayne order to clear up I got some

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.640 
his Wayne order to clear up I got some
some<00:03:07.200> bubbles<00:03:07.590> on<00:03:07.740> my<00:03:07.890> glass<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:10.230> from<00:03:10.500> my

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
some bubbles on my glass and from my

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.950 
some bubbles on my glass and from my
research<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.400> found<00:03:11.580> out<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:11.910> those<00:03:12.300> are<00:03:12.540> gas

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
research I found out that those are gas

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.240 
research I found out that those are gas
bubbles<00:03:13.530> which<00:03:13.830> can<00:03:14.070> be<00:03:14.190> harmful<00:03:14.490> to<00:03:14.790> my<00:03:15.180> fish

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
bubbles which can be harmful to my fish

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.820 
bubbles which can be harmful to my fish
so<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.280> don't<00:03:17.640> know<00:03:17.790> if<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.120> said<00:03:18.590> take<00:03:19.590> my

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
so I don't know if I said take my

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.090 
so I don't know if I said take my
squeezy<00:03:20.340> thing<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:21.320> think<00:03:22.320> of<00:03:22.440> will<00:03:22.650> think<00:03:23.010> I'm

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
squeezy thing I think of will think I'm

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.380 
squeezy thing I think of will think I'm
gonna<00:03:23.190> just<00:03:23.310> take<00:03:23.430> my<00:03:23.610> squeezy<00:03:23.880> thing<00:03:24.210> and

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
gonna just take my squeezy thing and

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.470 
gonna just take my squeezy thing and
squeegee<00:03:24.870> all<00:03:25.050> these<00:03:25.320> off<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.940> glass<00:03:26.940> cuz<00:03:27.390> I

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
squeegee all these off the glass cuz I

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.630 
squeegee all these off the glass cuz I
got<00:03:27.630> my<00:03:27.780> fish<00:03:28.020> down<00:03:28.290> here<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.310> don't<00:03:29.340> want

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
I'm back in there and their fish tank

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.180 
I'm back in there and their fish tank
but<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:38.040> need<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.730> do<00:03:38.940> some<00:03:39.300> water<00:03:39.990> tests<00:03:40.440> if<00:03:41.070> I

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
but I need to do some water tests if I

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.340 
but I need to do some water tests if I
know<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.550> pH<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:42.120> all<00:03:42.330> messed<00:03:42.600> up<00:03:42.840> now<00:03:43.080> because

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
know the pH is all messed up now because

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.190 
know the pH is all messed up now because
I<00:03:43.740> was<00:03:43.890> only<00:03:44.040> able<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.430> get<00:03:44.670> four<00:03:45.510> buckets<00:03:45.990> of

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
I was only able to get four buckets of

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
I was only able to get four buckets of
the<00:03:47.300> fish<00:03:48.300> tank<00:03:48.510> water<00:03:48.740> and<00:03:49.740> then<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:49.950> had<00:03:50.130> to

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
the fish tank water and then I had to

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.700 
the fish tank water and then I had to
put<00:03:50.340> like<00:03:50.490> six<00:03:50.760> or<00:03:50.910> seven<00:03:50.940> buckets<00:03:51.480> of<00:03:51.900> fresh

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
put like six or seven buckets of fresh

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.310 
put like six or seven buckets of fresh
water<00:03:52.950> in<00:03:53.250> there<00:03:53.489> so<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:54.300> know<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.840> pH<00:03:55.140> is

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
water in there so I know the pH is

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.100 
water in there so I know the pH is
messed<00:03:55.560> up<00:03:56.000> but<00:03:57.000> yeah<00:03:57.239> I've<00:03:57.420> just<00:03:57.480> put<00:03:57.870> some

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
messed up but yeah I've just put some

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.530 
messed up but yeah I've just put some
bacteria<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:58.980> it's<00:03:59.130> what<00:03:59.910> I<00:03:59.940> put<00:04:00.180> up<00:04:00.270> with<00:04:00.450> the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
bacteria and it's what I put up with the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.410 
bacteria and it's what I put up with the
nutrient<00:04:01.080> cycle<00:04:01.320> in<00:04:01.650> there<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:03.000> put<00:04:03.239> the

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
nutrient cycle in there and I put the

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.680 
nutrient cycle in there and I put the
stress<00:04:04.200> code<00:04:04.530> in<00:04:04.709> there<00:04:05.239> after<00:04:06.239> that<00:04:06.510> this

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
stress code in there after that this

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.680 
stress code in there after that this
said<00:04:07.160> about<00:04:08.160> an<00:04:08.340> hour<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.970> while<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.209> eat<00:04:09.480> dinner

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
said about an hour to while I eat dinner

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.030 
said about an hour to while I eat dinner
probably<00:04:10.680> about<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.690> test<00:04:12.690> of<00:04:12.870> water<00:04:13.050> and

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
probably about the test of water and

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.370 
probably about the test of water and
next<00:04:14.370> time<00:04:14.520> you<00:04:15.000> see<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.270> hopefully<00:04:15.720> my<00:04:16.109> fish

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
next time you see it hopefully my fish

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.610 
next time you see it hopefully my fish
should<00:04:16.560> be<00:04:16.709> in<00:04:16.830> there<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.520> thriving<00:04:18.000> way<00:04:18.450> all

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
should be in there and thriving way all

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.310 
should be in there and thriving way all
right<00:04:19.940> got<00:04:20.940> two<00:04:21.120> fish<00:04:21.299> in<00:04:21.330> there<00:04:21.750> put<00:04:22.080> them<00:04:22.169> in

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
right got two fish in there put them in

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.980 
right got two fish in there put them in
there<00:04:22.530> last<00:04:22.800> night<00:04:23.270> they<00:04:24.270> seemed<00:04:24.540> to<00:04:24.660> be<00:04:24.810> doing

okay and yeah they're looking all ready
to<00:04:27.780> come<00:04:27.960> into<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.290> top<00:04:29.870> so<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:30.900> guess<00:04:31.230> all<00:04:31.530> in

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
to come into the top so I guess all in

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.480 
to come into the top so I guess all in
all<00:04:32.600> everything<00:04:33.600> worked<00:04:34.080> out<00:04:34.320> just<00:04:34.380> fine

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
all everything worked out just fine

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.950 
all everything worked out just fine
let's<00:04:35.669> see<00:04:35.820> if<00:04:35.910> they<00:04:36.060> come<00:04:36.300> up<00:04:36.480> to<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.630> top

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
let's see if they come up to the top

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.620 
let's see if they come up to the top
when<00:04:37.169> I<00:04:37.260> open<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:37.620> for<00:04:38.070> you<00:04:41.060> yeah<00:04:42.060> let<00:04:42.360> me<00:04:42.390> see

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
if they come to the top when I feed them

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.899 
if they come to the top when I feed them
for<00:04:44.580> you
