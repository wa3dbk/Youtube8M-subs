00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
what this is the tripod mount I used to

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.990 
what this is the tripod mount I used to
film<00:00:06.359> everything<00:00:06.540> here<00:00:07.049> today<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:08.429> put<00:00:08.970> a

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
film everything here today and I put a

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.129 
film everything here today and I put a
little<00:00:09.179> tray<00:00:09.599> on<00:00:09.840> top<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:11.010> so<00:00:11.780> the<00:00:12.780> camera

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
little tray on top of it so the camera

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.519 
little tray on top of it so the camera
would<00:00:13.290> sit<00:00:13.559> right<00:00:13.769> there<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.870> I<00:00:15.870> didn't<00:00:16.410> have

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.920 
would sit right there and I didn't have
it<00:00:16.650> in<00:00:16.770> my<00:00:16.890> housing<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:18.210> therefore<00:00:18.570> you

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
it in my housing and that therefore you

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.420 
it in my housing and that therefore you
could<00:00:19.080> hear<00:00:19.380> me<00:00:19.560> speak<00:00:20.130> better<00:00:22.100> maybe<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.250> can

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
could hear me speak better maybe you can

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.920 
could hear me speak better maybe you can
tell<00:00:23.730> what<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> did<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.470> they<00:00:25.980> use<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.490> piece<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.449> a

didn't go to the store to buy apart for
this<00:00:36.620> okay<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:38.570> went<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> internet

searching for different ideas and stuff
and<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.660> saw<00:00:42.899> someone<00:00:43.620> selling<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.250> device<00:00:44.610> that

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
allowed the GoPro camera to float in

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.330 
allowed the GoPro camera to float in
water<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.899> case<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.289> was<00:00:49.410> dropped<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.070> well

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
could use something like that it went to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.459 
could use something like that it went to
my<00:00:55.070> my<00:00:56.070> normal<00:00:56.550> handheld<00:00:57.090> mount<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.199> put<00:00:58.440> my

my my normal handheld mount and I put my
camera<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.340> top<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:01.190> basically<00:01:02.190> this

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
camera on the top like so basically this

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.090 
camera on the top like so basically this
is<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.699> always<00:01:03.180> already<00:01:03.390> had<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.439> didn't

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
is what I always already had I didn't

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.070 
is what I always already had I didn't
have<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.369> make<00:01:05.400> anything<00:01:05.880> new<00:01:06.240> then<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.630> go<00:01:06.810> and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
have to make anything new then I go and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.679 
have to make anything new then I go and
I<00:01:07.380> by<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> noodle<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.340> 99<00:01:08.850> cents<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.450> cut<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
I by a noodle for 99 cents that I cut a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.660 
I by a noodle for 99 cents that I cut a
small<00:01:09.960> part<00:01:10.290> if<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.590> put<00:01:10.860> too<00:01:10.890> much<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
small part if you put too much in the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.420 
small part if you put too much in the
noodle<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.180> there<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.689> won't<00:01:13.200> float<00:01:13.950> right<00:01:14.220> you

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
noodle on there it won't float right you

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.420 
noodle on there it won't float right you
want<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.939> float<00:01:15.979> completely<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.280> down

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
want it to float completely up and down

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.230 
want it to float completely up and down
so<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.939> stick<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.689> noodle<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.240> then

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
so I stick the noodle on there and then

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.940 
so I stick the noodle on there and then
I<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> an<00:01:23.150> elbow<00:01:24.259> threaded<00:01:25.259> end<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.890> a

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
I get a an elbow threaded end and a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.350 
I get a an elbow threaded end and a
threaded<00:01:26.369> end<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.939> thread<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.479> elbow<00:01:28.100> onto

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
threaded end and I thread the elbow onto

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.499 
threaded end and I thread the elbow onto
here<00:01:30.360> like<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.920> put<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> cap<00:01:34.939> put<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> cap<00:01:36.299> on

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
here like so I put a cap put a cap on

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.200 
here like so I put a cap put a cap on
there<00:01:36.860> pull<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> needle<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> end<00:01:39.000> like

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
there pull the needle up to the end like

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.780 
there pull the needle up to the end like
that<00:01:39.240> if<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.590> drop<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.100> camera<00:01:41.610> while

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
that if you drop this camera while

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.149 
that if you drop this camera while
you're<00:01:41.970> underwater<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:43.380> will<00:01:43.649> float<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
you're underwater it will float to the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.450 
you're underwater it will float to the
surface<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:45.530> this<00:01:46.530> will<00:01:46.799> stick<00:01:47.009> out<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
surface and this will stick out of the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.990 
surface and this will stick out of the
water<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:48.810> also<00:01:48.960> works<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:50.159> put<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
water it also works if you put in the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.700 
water it also works if you put in the
upside<00:01:51.420> down<00:01:51.659> mode<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.170> floated<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
upside down mode and floated in the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.550 
upside down mode and floated in the
water<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.340> film<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.880> fishing<00:01:54.750> around<00:01:55.049> um

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
water you can film it fishing around um

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.399 
water you can film it fishing around um
I<00:01:55.829> filmed<00:01:56.579> ducks<00:01:57.000> swimming<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.600> threw<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.170> out

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
I filmed ducks swimming I threw this out

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.219 
I filmed ducks swimming I threw this out
in<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.649> water<00:01:58.890> through<00:01:59.729> some<00:02:00.000> food<00:02:00.329> out<00:02:00.570> to

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
in the water through some food out to

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.420 
in the water through some food out to
the<00:02:01.380> docks<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.799> they<00:02:01.860> came<00:02:02.009> around<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
the docks and they came around the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:14.960 
the docks and they came around the
camera<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.860> fit

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.930 

there<00:02:15.970> there's<00:02:16.690> enough<00:02:17.080> buoyancy<00:02:17.560> in<00:02:18.220> this

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
there there's enough buoyancy in this

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.920 
there there's enough buoyancy in this
plan<00:02:19.690> as<00:02:20.110> simple<00:02:21.040> as<00:02:21.129> it<00:02:21.340> is<00:02:21.519> to<00:02:22.209> bring<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.810> up

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
plan as simple as it is to bring it up

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.920 
plan as simple as it is to bring it up
to<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.230> surface<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:24.730> not<00:02:25.269> enough<00:02:25.690> buoyancy

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
to the surface but not enough buoyancy

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.190
