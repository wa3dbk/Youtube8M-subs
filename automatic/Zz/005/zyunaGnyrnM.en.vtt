usually<00:03:13.840> pick<00:03:14.050> up<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.350> neutralizer<00:03:14.890> shade

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
usually pick up the neutralizer shade

with<00:03:19.540> you<00:03:19.600> guys<00:03:19.660> I<00:03:20.020> do<00:03:20.080> like<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.560> neutralizer

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
with you guys I do like the neutralizer

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.100 
with you guys I do like the neutralizer
shade<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.400> lot<00:03:21.670> better<00:03:21.910> than<00:03:22.000> this<00:03:22.300> one<00:03:22.540> so<00:03:22.780> if

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
shade a lot better than this one so if

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.810 
shade a lot better than this one so if
you<00:03:23.170> have<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.380> skin<00:03:23.800> tone<00:03:24.010> similar<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.610> mine

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
you have a skin tone similar to mine

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.440 
you have a skin tone similar to mine
which<00:03:25.090> is<00:03:25.239> about<00:03:25.450> NC<00:03:26.110> 25<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.980> NC<00:03:27.280> 30<00:03:27.580> in<00:03:27.820> Mac<00:03:28.150> I

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
which is about NC 25 to NC 30 in Mac I

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.420 
which is about NC 25 to NC 30 in Mac I
would<00:03:28.870> recommend<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:29.440> neutralizer<00:03:29.980> shade

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
would recommend the neutralizer shade

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.449 
would recommend the neutralizer shade
because<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.910> has<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.330> nice<00:03:32.140> shade<00:03:32.500> of<00:03:32.530> yellow<00:03:33.040> to

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
because it has a nice shade of yellow to

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.550 
because it has a nice shade of yellow to
it<00:03:33.580> which<00:03:33.790> really<00:03:34.000> counteracts<00:03:34.720> any<00:03:34.900> darkness

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
it which really counteracts any darkness

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.040 
it which really counteracts any darkness
but<00:03:35.739> this<00:03:36.010> does<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.459> trick<00:03:36.489> as<00:03:36.940> well<00:03:37.209> so<00:03:37.780> it's

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
but this does the trick as well so it's

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.810 
but this does the trick as well so it's
just<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.320> little<00:03:38.500> twisty<00:03:39.100> tube<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.610> I<00:03:39.700> am

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
just a little twisty tube and I am

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.820 
just a little twisty tube and I am
messing<00:03:40.180> up<00:03:40.450> my<00:03:40.480> eyeliner<00:03:41.080> a<00:03:41.200> little<00:03:41.530> bit<00:03:41.650> I

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
messing up my eyeliner a little bit I

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.680 
messing up my eyeliner a little bit I
have<00:03:42.220> my<00:03:42.430> blush<00:03:42.670> on<00:03:42.910> and<00:03:43.090> everything<00:03:43.390> usually

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
have my blush on and everything usually

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.150 
have my blush on and everything usually
this<00:03:43.840> would<00:03:44.050> be<00:03:44.200> done<00:03:44.440> before<00:03:44.860> all<00:03:45.010> these

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
this would be done before all these

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.860 
this would be done before all these
other<00:03:45.370> steps<00:03:45.730> but<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.150> just<00:03:46.300> wanted<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.660> save

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
other steps but I just wanted to save

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.410 
other steps but I just wanted to save
time<00:03:47.200> so<00:03:47.830> as<00:03:48.100> you<00:03:48.250> guys<00:03:48.400> can<00:03:48.640> see<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.209> really

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
time so as you guys can see it really

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.540 
time so as you guys can see it really
does<00:03:49.570> cover<00:03:50.110> a<00:03:50.230> lot<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.650> like<00:03:50.830> to<00:03:50.980> bring<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.370> into

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
does cover a lot I like to bring it into

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.640 
does cover a lot I like to bring it into
this<00:03:52.180> inner<00:03:52.450> part<00:03:52.720> of<00:03:52.840> my<00:03:52.900> eye<00:03:53.019> as<00:03:53.410> well

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
this inner part of my eye as well

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.250 
this inner part of my eye as well
because<00:03:53.980> that<00:03:54.130> tends<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.640> get<00:03:54.820> pretty<00:03:55.150> dark<00:03:55.480> so

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260

and it has a coverage in it so it's not

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.150
