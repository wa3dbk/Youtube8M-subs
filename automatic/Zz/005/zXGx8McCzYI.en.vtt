00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.480
 so for some time and already one 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.670
 possibility times mobile things reasonably 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.540
 Although there are the rails 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.480
 but I really do not like that 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.670
 just thought once we build yet 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.570
 Just put an old shirt on your 600th 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.890
 the rail 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.269
 so you can play in the gt2 it goes 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.119
 of course all the others integrated 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:32.009
 the whole thing to a sensible mobile 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.250
 saw another device with which one 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.430
 relatively accurate for this then clearly 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.309
 more accurate than the true angle, too 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.770
 can cut and in fast 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.539
 execution yes, here is a small table 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:53.600
 I 'm about to build the whole thing 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:01:01.230
 I've already prepared something 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:07.640
 without taken lying vise table 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:13.020
 there is the height is set 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:16.640
 mark once briefly 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.640
 she is adorned that he can not slip 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.920
 and you have everything you need 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.920
 of course , this table can also be 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.220
 for the victims use for example 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.410
 drilling relatively fast relatively accurate 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.980
 can be used for the 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.180
 little gags and and and I hope so 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.340
 that someday it will be one more 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.560
 version 2 of exactly this table gives 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.950
 and then again the extensions 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.950
 to
