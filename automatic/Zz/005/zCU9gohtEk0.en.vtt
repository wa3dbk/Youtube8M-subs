00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 now this news for those who do not like 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:07.410
 make a lot of effort on this I'm a 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.620
 of them did you know that it's possible to burn 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.530
 more calories until we are 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.680
 sleeping on the sea the news of this 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.500
 Food exercises certain exercises 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.990
 in and a peaceful sleep can help in 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.119
 slimming and it affects good for that you 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:31.050
 you need to know how your 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:33.030
 metabolism no food is left 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.739
 out of the fact of Claudia 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.620
 I was going to sit down and eat a cake. 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.930
 hot is crazy half a goal easy for years 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.820
 she weighs 56 pounds 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.149
 this exam shows that Claudia has a 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.280
 metabolism 20% above the ideal for 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.300
 age and height of it I want to win 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.340
 muscles 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.360
 so I increased my protein intake 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.770
 by appointment of my nutritionist 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.890
 darcila feeds every three hours 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.859
 to speed up the metabolism were 15 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.619
 years of fighting with the balance of my pain 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.600
 This is because I ate the same or less with 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.640
 most and could not lose weight 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.130
 by calculation based on tables used 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.040
 by most nutritionists the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.250
 tarsila metabolism would be 20% below 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.670
 of the ideal but new tests showed that 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.920
 the index is higher 32% 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.580
 the metabolism is the amount of energy 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.880
 that we spend on all activities 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.060
 during the day 10 percent are used 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.610
 to digest food 20 percent 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.290
 daily movement and also in the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.590
 physical exercises 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.439
 the other 70% correspond to the rate 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.200
 basal metabolic energy expended for 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.200
 maintain vital functions such as breathing 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.009
 heartbeat sleep or 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.710
 rests who wants to increase the metabolism 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.790
 is to spend more energy on 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.280
 rest 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.590
 we indicate some foods the coffee 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.600
 because of caffeine is that it is a 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.020
 stimulant of metabolism 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.009
 green tea fruits like orange what 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.340
 i 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.590
 red pepper guarana powder 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.010
 fibrous vegetables such as mustard 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.590
 Chard broccoli ginger is also 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.579
 thermogenic can be mixed in juices 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.530
 and salads 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.090
 but to get these results 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.610
 foods must be used with 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.030
 often change and food 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.340
 Tarsila exercises already lost 30 pounds 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.040
 I'm still 15, I know you have one 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.409
 goal to achieve I know where to go 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.640
 so everything is going to accelerate me today 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:44.040
 the metabolism to know precisely the 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.470
 ability of our body to spend 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.790
 calories can help in the diet when we 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.040
 we saw in the report 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.280
 now we are going to meet an equipment 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.650
 which according to endocrinologists is capable 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.560
 to measure the metabolic rate of geraldo 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.450
 how this examination not need 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.819
 the person needs to be at rest and in 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.430
 fasting for ten minutes 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.139
 breathing through this tube will be 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.450
 taken to the equipment and the 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:12.180
 difference between oxygen consumed and 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.739
 the device can calculate the 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.599
 amount of calories the body of the 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.099
 What are you doing right now at home? 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.620
 what can be done for those who have a 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.079
 slower metabolism well in the 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.480
 food we know that food 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.099
 rich in protein requires that of our 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.629
 a much greater effort to 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.609
 be metabolized than the rich foods 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.900
 then in carbohydrate change in 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.010
 food and nutritional content 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.010
 can help in this regard
