what's<00:00:00.240> up<00:00:00.359> guys<00:00:00.539> this<00:00:00.570> is<00:00:00.989> Nick<00:00:01.170> we're<00:00:01.890> going

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
what's up guys this is Nick we're going

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.390 
what's up guys this is Nick we're going
to<00:00:02.070> talk<00:00:02.220> about<00:00:02.370> effects<00:00:02.970> loops<00:00:03.240> today<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:04.400> get

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
to talk about effects loops today I get

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.499 
to talk about effects loops today I get
a<00:00:05.430> lot<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:05.640> questions<00:00:06.060> from<00:00:06.150> you<00:00:06.240> guys<00:00:06.359> about

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
a lot of questions from you guys about

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.450 
a lot of questions from you guys about
why<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:06.990> don't<00:00:07.290> have<00:00:07.440> any<00:00:07.470> overdrive<00:00:08.040> pedals<00:00:08.370> on

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
why I don't have any overdrive pedals on

why I don't have any overdrive pedals on
my<00:00:08.580> board<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.630> reason<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.380> prefer<00:00:10.800> to

18-foot Megami cables for routing here
my<00:00:48.899> solution<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.500> lay<00:00:49.710> them<00:00:49.860> out<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
my solution is to lay them out on the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.069 
my solution is to lay them out on the
floor<00:00:50.399> with<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> natural<00:00:51.120> curve<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.629> cables

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
floor with the natural curve the cables

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.500 
floor with the natural curve the cables
in<00:00:52.320> order<00:00:52.710> then<00:00:53.460> zip<00:00:53.699> tie<00:00:53.850> them<00:00:54.030> together<00:00:54.149> as

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
in order then zip tie them together as

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.569 
in order then zip tie them together as
closely<00:00:54.750> as<00:00:54.960> possible<00:00:55.219> if<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.430> done

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
closely as possible if it's done

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.040 
closely as possible if it's done
correctly<00:00:56.610> they'll<00:00:57.270> wrap<00:00:57.449> together<00:00:57.780> easily

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
correctly they'll wrap together easily

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.229 
correctly they'll wrap together easily
and<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.559> make<00:00:58.710> setup<00:00:59.010> much<00:00:59.280> simpler<00:00:59.969> for<00:01:00.149> you

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
and will make setup much simpler for you

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.570 
and will make setup much simpler for you
in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.420> long<00:01:00.570> run

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
in the long run

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.520 
in the long run
the<00:01:02.000> cable<00:01:02.330> goes<00:01:02.360> bad<00:01:02.690> you<00:01:02.870> can<00:01:03.020> cut<00:01:03.200> all<00:01:03.410> the

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
the cable goes bad you can cut all the

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.110 
the cable goes bad you can cut all the
zip<00:01:03.710> ties<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.129> exchange<00:01:04.520> the<00:01:04.699> single<00:01:05.000> cable

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
zip ties and exchange the single cable

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.780 
zip ties and exchange the single cable
for<00:01:05.420> a<00:01:05.449> different<00:01:05.780> one<00:01:06.220> most<00:01:07.220> manufacturers

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
for a different one most manufacturers

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.490 
for a different one most manufacturers
will<00:01:08.000> put<00:01:08.180> lifetime<00:01:08.570> warranties<00:01:08.990> on<00:01:09.140> cables

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
will put lifetime warranties on cables

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.789 
will put lifetime warranties on cables
so<00:01:09.650> take<00:01:09.830> advantage<00:01:09.950> of<00:01:10.280> that

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.830 

use<00:01:13.430> different<00:01:13.789> colors<00:01:14.119> of<00:01:14.149> zip<00:01:14.450> ties<00:01:14.630> to

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
use different colors of zip ties to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.260 
use different colors of zip ties to
color-code<00:01:15.289> the<00:01:15.380> ends<00:01:15.710> I<00:01:15.890> keep<00:01:16.789> an<00:01:16.909> order<00:01:17.179> of
