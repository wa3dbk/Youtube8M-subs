bjbjLULU This video will teach you how to
draw a realistic looking face with a happy

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.980
(smile) expression.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:52.220
The "calm" eye is almond shaped but when a
person is smiling, squeeze the two eyelids

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.220
together.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:08.409
The "calm" eye is almond shaped but when a
person is smiling, squeeze the two eyelids

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:22.700
together.Notice that you can see the fold
of the upper eyelid a little bit more.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:31.270
The eyebrows and forehead are in a relaxed
position.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:48.409
To draw a smiling face successfully, you need
to be able to make the cheeks seem more rounded....especially

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.119
with the shadow below the cheek!

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:10.310
Right now, I am adding a construction line
for where the shading will go.( I am working

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.070
from a reference picture, BTW.)

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:32.220
To draw a smiling face successfully, you need
to be able to make the cheeks seem more rounded....especially

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.930
with the shadow below the cheek!

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:54.120
Right now, I am adding a construction line
for where the shading will go.( I am working

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:07.450
from a reference picture, BTW.) SLOWLY build
up the shading and be very patient!

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:16.020
CONFESSION: I used non drawing paper for this
drawing!

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:24.590
Watch and see what it does when I erase!

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.590
ARGH!!!!

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.210
Yes there is a difference!OK couldn't wait!

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:42.690
"Drawing paper" is more textured....or as
artists say...."has more tooth"....watch the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:55.070
shading VANISH when I erase because the surface
is as slippery as ICE!

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.070
ARGH!!!!

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.690
The eyebrows are NOT one solid tone.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:15.070
Try to observe the eyebrows of whoever you
are drawing before shading them.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:26.500
The only exception is when heavy make up is
applied.....Maybe its Maybelline!

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.210
Shading is ALWAYS dependant upon LIGHT!

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:43.640
There are no universal rules to applying tones
to drawing.....because lighting conditions

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.490
vary so much!

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.400
REMEMBER THAT!

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:56.020
In this case, the light came from above.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.730
This is most often the case.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:13.160
Notice the shadow that I am adding between
the brow and eye.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:25.540
When drawing a smiling face, the area UNDER
the eye is very important!

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:36.970
The orbicularis oculi muscle (muscle around
eye) contracts...The eye is ball shaped.....thus

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:50.300
"eyeball"....our shading has to show that
it is ROUNDED!The brush is a BIG help.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:58.810
It allows me to shade something delicately....which
is needed, when drawing skin.....I use bristle

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.390
AND soft tipped brushes.... both give slightly
different effects.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.900
REMEMBER, when a person is smiling, you will
(usually) only see their top row of teeth.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.880
ALSO, notice the corners of the mouth.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.430
Notice that the two sides of the mouth are
shaded dark (because the teeth wrap around

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:21.760
in a horseshoe shape).REMEMBER, when a person
is smiling, you will (usually) only see their

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.760
top row of teeth.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.120
Everyones smile (the shape of their mouth
during a smile) is unique!

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.120
OBSERVE OBSERVE OBSERVE!

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.050
Draw in the lashes as triangular masses.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.919
Notice that the top eyelashes are a LOT longer
and fuller than the bottom lashes.

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:32.919
This is the case for everybody.

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:34.060
Males, in general have shorter lashes than
females...Maybe he's born with it...Maybe

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.060
its TESTOSTERONE!

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.330
If you are GOOD at line drawings and want
to work on shading, make photocopies of your

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.880
work so that you can make multiple attempts
at shading....you will learn FAST!

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.880
TRUST ME!

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.139
CLICK HERE to go to my shading tutorial.....It
gives you a link to a print out worksheet

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:41.139
(so that you could shade along with me.)

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:42.139
Remember SHADING is all about RELATIVITY!

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:43.360
So compare the tones of different areas of
your reference image or sitter.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.380
Be sure NOT to make the "smile line" look
too much like a "line".....just like the eyebrows,

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.380
it is NOT a solid shape!

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.380
Right now I am using a tortillion (blending
stump).

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.960
It moves the graphite from the pencil more
quickly and efficiently than the paint brush.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.960
Tortillions are also very good at making lines.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.980
They are simply stumps of paper shapes like
pencils.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:51.980
The edges of the face are TRICKY.......YES,
they need to be darker in tone to seem rounded

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:52.980
but they cannot appear as a solid line, or
else your drawing will not seem believable.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:53.980
NOTICE that I am using the technique of cross
hatching (line next to line) to apply the

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.980
tones....then I am smudging it....followed
by another layer of hatching...or I could

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.680
then create a highlight with the eraser.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:19.610
Be careful with the hairline.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:59.889
It is always a gradual transition of tone....Believe
it or not, even if a person is BALD, the top

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:01.199
of the head is rounded and requires a gradual
gradation of tone!

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:02.199
The areas around the eyes seemed dark before.....right?....See
what happens when you add darker tones?

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:03.199
Shading is ALL ABOUT RELATIVITY!

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:04.199
I did the hair with a 9B graphite stick BTW!

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:05.199
Try to notice the subtle shading that I am
doing to round the forehead.....Remember that

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:06.199
I want to make it seem serene, since the facial
expression is a smile.

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:07.199
I am going to darken the corners to make it
seem rounded.

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:08.199
QUICK!

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:09.199
DONT LOOK AT THE SCREEN!

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:10.199
Merrill is using his fingers!

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:11.199
Tsk Tsk!

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.199
I am only using them because of the "skating
rink" that I am drawing on (I am using non
