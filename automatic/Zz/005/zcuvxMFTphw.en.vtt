00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.810
 hello everyone turned 83 years old this time is not for 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.929
 a gameplay video his contribution 3 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.619
 but today I propose a video so of gameplay so on the 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.079
 i5 beaver coach will not have three it has to take place during the second 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.809
 world war so the debate and I decided today to propose to you 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.859
 a gameplay view on this opus why not to change the meaning where 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.490
 it does not hurt end of this month what do you think 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.590
 so before you tell me the reasons why so I propose you 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.290
 today 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.470
 the man a gameplay video so it equals simpler city first 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.430
 that one of the reasons for these herbs simply 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.740
 nothing you can 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.150
 I have a little bit of time 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.650
 but before that so 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.850
 from home so I'll tell you what is my class 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.290
 so because I am first match to death by team it took me shorter because 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.309
 who is passing by a very very good brand 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.570
 but I really like fatah this opus la luma fin 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.690
 almost all the single ones than the others 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.000
 So what was one that others forgiveness 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.380
 so that forward I find that that 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.350
 then come the absurd 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.009
 maybe this and are all affiliates treatment while on the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.610
 last shots offers and we have not bad who are really 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.270
 we see that sampras 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.180
 are not what I do not know what you think 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.170
 you but for my part I find that the mode in seven colors are a lot 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.990
 better than 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.540
 quarrel that the new maps 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.940
 to avoid new businesses 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.259
 a loan will not be able to have his cup lingering on it 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.349
 so what if not our that I play with as a main weapon allied with any 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:44.229
 the pump required to see it% which I attached the accessory 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.580
 handle 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.690
 possible she 1897 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.590
 it is the secondary order banks 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.530
 as far as this conference is concerned, there is only one of the weapons of France in the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.320
 secondary 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.850
 so this is the welter p38 I'm going to use greetings asset pronounced 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.450
 manna 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.630
 if I start off badly from his name because you believe that what I'm doing has 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.089
 urgently to the world in way to helpers pronounce themselves badly 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:10.529
 and by the way you could see that I had bruises that were not missing 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.680
 the one who got stuck in Iran in power at kimi in a row 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.980
 he lives they did not ask anything implemented and just before I do not know if 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.980
 you have been careful 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.090
 he made a lot of enemies gissing escaped for now richard j 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.940
 free-kick to be a little quieter 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.529
 but unfortunately I have not had time there is still limited 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.309
 all in another employee kill me it's really a pity 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:30.949
 the edges of the gameplay rather not bad I find 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:32.539
 in front of you to tell me what is 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.559
 you think but I find that for me it's not bad so otherwise I 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.710
 will play with the fear of fragmentation and then as 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.079
 equipment in tactics with the cast has not 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.830
 coma all in coma any case i did not see anything i'm proud of this handle 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.429
 q as if this handle 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:48.699
 and for the grenade launcher and ben you have no assets 1 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:52.279
 otherwise as to all position geforce so I think you 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.239
 know one is like a child I do not know if prices are at cost 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.250
 of 4 music think so finally 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.250
 it's up to you to tell me if you are a conference day 4% 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.059
 really 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:05.599
 not much played on the cod multi 4 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.070
 but I do not see I'm so bad anymore 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.330
 in strength for those who do not know so that increase the damage of 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.280
 balls that was brewing I really would like them to emit that in the next 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.839
 seminar 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:17.879
 especially for sanitary because vaille flowers because it's really 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:18.579
 pressure 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.120
 otherwise as an asset 3g extreme conditions that allows for 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.890
 like marathon - two runners are growing in what is really 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:25.889
 good to all 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:30.129
 for what is rather effective if I like that there is for once 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.920
 here for small maps earlier 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.620
 at the same time and that we will appreciate to go as quickly as expected its 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.379
 broadcasts I know what's good it means breaks 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.759
 especially when we are all in shape 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:42.019
 very very good at all 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.309
 the bar or honor but the things that I do not advise use of this 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:46.549
 concept 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:47.830
 the miti this name 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.479
 the brand 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.879
 he does what he wants noria death silence why not 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:53.760
 the forum 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.110
 I will show why not in a video of all the trumps ya really 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.019
 many assets 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.659
 for well that assets that are a bit like bayern to all and have a 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.459
 tower to which low-ground 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.720
 which is rather in 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.149
 number of children who 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:09.389
 considered a secondary weapon so that's messner we have a lot 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.129
 assets 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.919
 nice to stop there for now 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.400
 so why I propose today that via a video of the collective 5 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.370
 so just complicated the beginning of the video 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.370
 well it changes a little bit of time and especially rage I tell you very 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.910
 frankly I'm really tired of 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.809
 suddenly they were good reports 3 

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:27.849
 and followed 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:30.919
 I can not play on his strengths anyway online 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.180
 frankly and that makes 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.430
 it's been almost a week that I'm not going to play multi two children 3 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.870
 because just ben I do not know it says nothing 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.949
 so much nature 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.419
 after that maybe it was clues and other 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.419
 hide it not I'm not more fun on this subject 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.509
 here it is I prefer to play from time to time talk about the colors 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.400
 on the various dailies unfortunately I do not have a policy 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.870
 to what is a very good game 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.410
 for my part personally the best clubs that runs four 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.620
 events five times for me a loan what's going on 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.990
 some take the prefect euros more others per month for my parish 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.580
 cockpit 4 and 5 ticks 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.550
 are much better 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.550
 maybe also because the new york committee 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.129
 if not all of the back part the part will soon end up injecting 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:19.539
 could see that I did 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.990
 a series of cases would be that in a row 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.580
 so i hope this video will please you sika mister not click on 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.610
 chamakh it's really very important to me because it will take time 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.909
 in order to avoid at all 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:31.810
 hc 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.520
 Luck the only thing that can reward me here never seen 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.780
 young people but do not hesitate to put a little flexible 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.400
 and especially commented 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.400
 so that the ox I did not have time to say much 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:46.949
 on this video so I think I'll offer you a second video of 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:48.460
 gameplay on cole duty 5 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.600
 so we probably finish that sounds 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.450
 portillo coup I made the 36 8 years that I find that it is rather a good 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.180
 part 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.650
 so you see in the comments if you want for other types of 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.439
 gameplay on this opus 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:59.650
 and as his beautiful 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.150
 your note that it will allow me to follow you 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.300
 a few things 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.330
 Well, I'd like to report 3 rd to play in a match that's what I do 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.449
 part 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.460
 you told him I wanted to do a private match with you but 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.759
 for now we do not have many who contacted me 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.749
 so that I really do not I'll tell you that I'll give you more 

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:19.469
 details in another study 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:22.679
 I hope it took you if ever this cabin is not questioned 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.740
 and then judged very soon
