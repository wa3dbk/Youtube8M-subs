00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
never always really a very um how could

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.380 
never always really a very um how could
I<00:01:21.170> say<00:01:21.350> I<00:01:21.530> had<00:01:21.710> always<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:22.100> moral<00:01:22.460> sense<00:01:22.760> but<00:01:23.330> I

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
I say I had always a moral sense but I

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.899 
I say I had always a moral sense but I
was<00:01:23.570> never<00:01:23.780> such<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.049> religious<00:01:24.799> or<00:01:25.040> people

involved<00:01:26.360> in<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.510> religion<00:01:26.900> so<00:01:27.500> it<00:01:27.650> sort<00:01:27.890> of

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
involved in a religion so it sort of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.940 
involved in a religion so it sort of
became<00:01:28.220> something<00:01:28.580> where<00:01:28.940> it<00:01:29.210> was<00:01:29.680> like<00:01:30.680> why

however I thought I thought that that
was<00:02:36.390> just<00:02:36.569> a<00:02:36.840> lack<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.349> being<00:02:37.530> able<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.920> find

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
was just a lack of being able to find

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.339 
was just a lack of being able to find
evidence<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:38.970> assessing<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.900> because<00:02:40.110> I'm<00:02:40.319> a

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
evidence and assessing it because I'm a

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.289 
evidence and assessing it because I'm a
very<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:40.860> I'm<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> person<00:02:41.459> that's<00:02:41.610> sort<00:02:41.909> of<00:02:42.000> I

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
very so I'm a person that's sort of I

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.720 
very so I'm a person that's sort of I
assess<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.290> lot<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.560> things<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:44.310> find<00:02:44.489> to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
assess a lot of things to find to

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.339

is<00:02:46.500> which<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.400> wrong<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.970> don't<00:02:48.299> see<00:02:48.720> why<00:02:49.040> why<00:02:50.040> we

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
is which is wrong I don't see why why we

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.819 
is which is wrong I don't see why why we
shouldn't<00:02:50.579> do<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:50.910> because<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.870> 1<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.560> 1

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829

began studying all of that in order to
in<00:03:15.120> order<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.480> figure<00:03:15.659> out<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.109> determine

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
in order to figure out and determine

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.069

don't know how long it will last I'm
guessing<00:04:31.290> another<00:04:31.530> few<00:04:31.770> years<00:04:32.330> and

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
guessing another few years and

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.290 
guessing another few years and
technically<00:04:34.410> what<00:04:35.160> it<00:04:35.280> does<00:04:35.490> is<00:04:35.670> it<00:04:35.790> able<00:04:36.060> for

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
technically what it does is it able for

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.120 
technically what it does is it able for
me<00:04:36.420> to<00:04:36.510> evaluate<00:04:36.750> how<00:04:37.290> do<00:04:37.350> tell<00:04:37.740> God<00:04:37.980> has

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
me to evaluate how do tell God has

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.320 
me to evaluate how do tell God has
affected<00:04:38.610> my<00:04:38.760> life<00:04:40.460> after<00:04:41.460> what<00:04:41.820> happened<00:04:42.120> was

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
on Easter 2007 in April during April I

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.790 
on Easter 2007 in April during April I

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
joyfully came because I didn't have a

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.010 
joyfully came because I didn't have a
church<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:58.950> my<00:04:59.040> dad<00:04:59.250> wasn't<00:04:59.460> here<00:04:59.820> so<00:05:00.210> it<00:05:00.840> was

church and my dad wasn't here so it was

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.930 
church and my dad wasn't here so it was
it<00:05:01.500> was<00:05:01.620> something<00:05:01.860> that<00:05:02.160> of<00:05:02.280> an<00:05:02.400> opportunity

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
it was something that of an opportunity

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.400 
it was something that of an opportunity
and<00:05:03.540> I<00:05:03.840> came<00:05:04.110> I<00:05:04.140> really<00:05:04.650> enjoyed<00:05:05.040> it<00:05:05.160> and<00:05:05.280> I
