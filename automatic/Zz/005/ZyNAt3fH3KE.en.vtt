have no idea they ask us actually I

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.039 
have no idea they ask us actually I
think<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.680> reason<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:29.520> decided<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.869> this

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
think the reason we decided to do this

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.749 
think the reason we decided to do this
is<00:01:31.259> because<00:01:31.409> we<00:01:31.710> had<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> lot<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.159> fun<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:32.670> had

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
is because we had a lot of fun we had

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.410 
is because we had a lot of fun we had
not<00:01:32.880> actually<00:01:33.060> planned<00:01:33.479> an<00:01:33.659> event<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.860> this

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
not actually planned an event like this

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.300 
not actually planned an event like this
but<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.540> got<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> very<00:01:36.930> positive<00:01:37.170> reaction<00:01:38.040> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
but we got a very positive reaction to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.399 
but we got a very positive reaction to
the<00:01:38.490> first<00:01:38.790> launch<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.900> did<00:01:40.079> where<00:01:40.259> all

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the first launch that we did where all

a great time and this song was just one
of<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.979> songs<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.549> they<00:01:47.579> played<00:01:47.939> live<00:01:48.210> for

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
