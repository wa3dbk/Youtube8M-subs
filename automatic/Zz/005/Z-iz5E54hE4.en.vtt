00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.890
 problems faced by the country 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.009
 challenges that the state faces 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.800
 and economies and contains systemic measures 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.869

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.120
 government activities 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:42.269
 would ask everyone who participates in this 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.820
 work to do it quickly home 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.239

 necessary credit resources 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.799

 will continue to take effect the law which 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.060
 gave the deposit insurance agency 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.290

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.219
 our countries have made a decisive contribution to 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.819
 defeat of fascism and Japanese militarism 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:46.979
