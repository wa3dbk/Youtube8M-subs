00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
lived in a rabbit hutch the whole life

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.820 

and<00:01:09.940> just<00:01:10.180> breeding<00:01:10.630> operators<00:01:11.409> inside<00:01:11.799> a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
and just breeding operators inside a

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.980 
and just breeding operators inside a
rabbit<00:01:12.159> hutch<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.490> same<00:01:12.670> hash<00:01:12.930> probably<00:01:13.930> a

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
rabbit hutch the same hash probably a

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.960 
rabbit hutch the same hash probably a
cage<00:01:14.200> no<00:01:14.380> bigger<00:01:14.590> than<00:01:14.770> that<00:01:14.970> probably

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
cage no bigger than that probably

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.080 
cage no bigger than that probably
smaller<00:01:16.350> yep<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.500> other<00:01:17.649> one<00:01:17.890> has<00:01:18.190> a<00:01:18.670> really

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
smaller yep the other one has a really

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.029 
smaller yep the other one has a really
large<00:01:19.360> granuloma<00:01:20.080> from<00:01:20.380> a<00:01:20.470> rubbing<00:01:20.830> from

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
large granuloma from a rubbing from

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:28.070 
large granuloma from a rubbing from
wearing<00:01:21.430> those<00:01:21.930> twine<00:01:22.930> covered<00:01:24.210> numbers

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.380 

amazing<00:01:29.080> to<00:01:29.200> me<00:01:29.289> that<00:01:29.319> their<00:01:29.560> appetites

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
amazing to me that their appetites

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.790 
amazing to me that their appetites
they're<00:01:31.390> still<00:01:31.659> able<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.960> eat<00:01:32.110> after<00:01:32.289> all<00:01:32.590> this

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
they're still able to eat after all this

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.999 
they're still able to eat after all this
I<00:01:33.039> guess<00:01:33.729> it's<00:01:33.909> just<00:01:33.940> basic<00:01:34.360> survival<00:01:35.009> no

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
I guess it's just basic survival no

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.649 
I guess it's just basic survival no
matter<00:01:36.190> how<00:01:36.310> bad<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.640> feel<00:01:36.789> eat<00:01:37.179> when<00:01:37.569> you

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
matter how bad you feel eat when you

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.520 
matter how bad you feel eat when you
have<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.899> chance<00:01:37.929> I<00:01:40.229> said<00:01:41.229> you<00:01:41.350> know<00:01:41.409> it's
