now when we have the paradiddle

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.399 
now when we have the paradiddle
under<00:01:38.670> our<00:01:38.700> hands<00:01:39.090> we're<00:01:40.020> going<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.259> move

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
under our hands we're going to move

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.710

and not just to the snare drum we can

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.500 
and not just to the snare drum we can
start<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.190> move<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.730> different<00:02:17.090> beats<00:02:17.300> around

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
start to move the different beats around

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.870 
start to move the different beats around
the<00:02:17.810> drums<00:02:18.050> we'll<00:02:18.920> start<00:02:19.310> by<00:02:19.489> putting<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
the drums we'll start by putting the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.630 
the drums we'll start by putting the
first<00:02:20.239> beat<00:02:20.569> of<00:02:20.810> each<00:02:21.170> paradiddle<00:02:21.860> on<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.069> Tom

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
first beat of each paradiddle on a Tom

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:41.700 
first beat of each paradiddle on a Tom
this<00:02:23.239> is<00:02:23.390> what<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.630> sounds<00:02:23.959> like

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.170 

then<00:02:42.710> if<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.100> start<00:02:43.370> picking<00:02:43.550> out<00:02:43.880> random

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
then if you start picking out random

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.300 
then if you start picking out random
beats<00:02:44.630> from<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.050> paradiddle<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:45.710> playing

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
beats from the paradiddle and playing
