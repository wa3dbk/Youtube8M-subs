give you guys any hints all of a sudden
it's<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:09.600> been<00:01:09.869> calling<00:01:10.229> me<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.409> try<00:01:10.619> this

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
it's just been calling me to try this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.940 
it's just been calling me to try this
out<00:01:11.009> so<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.329> just<00:01:12.390> figured<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.990> would<00:01:13.229> check<00:01:13.649> it

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
out so I just figured I would check it

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.620 
out so I just figured I would check it
out<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.249> see<00:01:14.310> how<00:01:14.429> I<00:01:14.579> like<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.240> somehow

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
out and see how I like it I just somehow

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.469 
out and see how I like it I just somehow
think<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.229> way<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.999> gives<00:01:17.999> it<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.179> cooler

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
think this way is gives it a cooler

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.440 
think this way is gives it a cooler
appearance<00:01:19.170> then<00:01:20.810> gaming<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:23.149> the<00:01:24.149> dealer

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
appearance then gaming with the dealer

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.139 
appearance then gaming with the dealer
looks<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.780> cool<00:01:25.280> it<00:01:26.280> looks<00:01:26.460> cooler<00:01:26.700> than<00:01:26.999> the

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
looks so cool it looks cooler than the

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.700

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
width wise what you do you know this is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.069

because i think it looks so cool i might
do<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.750> down<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.170> road<00:02:59.200> doing<00:02:59.470> more

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
do that down the road doing more

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.369 
do that down the road doing more
monitors<00:03:00.250> but<00:03:00.659> will<00:03:01.659> say<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:02.079> can't<00:03:02.290> imagine

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379

my whole thing I had to rip it all out

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.780 
my whole thing I had to rip it all out
to<00:03:35.319> do<00:03:35.500> this<00:03:35.650> because<00:03:35.829> I<00:03:36.040> had<00:03:36.160> no<00:03:36.310> room<00:03:36.519> because

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
to do this because I had no room because

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.460 
to do this because I had no room because
you<00:03:37.060> know<00:03:37.150> you<00:03:37.449> stop<00:03:37.660> putting<00:03:37.780> 24<00:03:38.349> inch

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
monitors up on its way like this it just

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.759 
monitors up on its way like this it just
makes<00:03:41.769> it<00:03:41.919> a<00:03:42.209> more<00:03:43.209> difficult<00:03:43.449> to<00:03:44.019> do<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.620> but

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
makes it a more difficult to do it but

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.439 
makes it a more difficult to do it but
you<00:03:44.859> know<00:03:44.919> what<00:03:45.069> guys<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.370> might<00:03:45.579> end<00:03:45.609> up<00:03:45.849> bum<00:03:46.090> I

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
really like this I might end up going

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.759 
really like this I might end up going
for<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:49.150> no<00:03:49.269> more<00:03:49.629> than<00:03:49.780> three<00:03:50.079> monitors<00:03:50.440> and
