00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello on this video we will show 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.930
 270 boat 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.790
 solid layer with a transom mounted on it 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:14.889
 we installed the engine 2 and 6 horse 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.710
 forces and Dima besik engine weight 11 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.030
 kilogram for hinged trance 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.710
 must be right now we will test 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.710
 this boat with a motor 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.489
 the engine started 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.700
 engine she immediately create a full 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.700
 gas principle 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.610
 the shelf is light enough 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.079
 weighs about 20 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.730
 kilogram 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.730
 cocktail title bosses give 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.809
 Reviews 1 skill 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.890
 Now we will try to give full gas 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.500
 let's see how this engine behaves 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.210
 on the boat skunk king and now the engine 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.090
 almost idle 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.350
 you can take a closer look 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.350
 add kaz 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.299
 need to bend 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.780
 dance to the engine goes a little 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.340
 the submarine is still on the hinged transom 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.430
 it is desirable to put the engine month 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.409
 less power bi horsepower either 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.270
 you can put countries half he 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.630
 quite light motor 9 kilograms 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.579
 for mounted trance mobile 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.619
 2 and 6 horsepower and powerful enough 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.540
 motor chick we are already in the past video 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.819
 were testing him with a hard boat 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.040
 transom 290 but if by force 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.040
 characteristics it is almost like conco 4 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.840
 but none the less on this motors foot 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.130
 you can push if the gas is full not to give 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.130
 that is normal enough 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.530
 more power but these are pads 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.940
 and blizzards about 1 liter 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.940
 evildog 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.569
 here are the remnants we poured 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.140
 40 milliliters of oil 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.110
 contact moving 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.830
 the tests were quite successful we 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.830
 back to shore 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.640
 now we will put this engine on 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.250
 the boat 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.510
 four and a half meters for which on 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.510
 designed for trolling 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.310
 Thank you all for your attention and good-bye 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.310
 to new meetings
