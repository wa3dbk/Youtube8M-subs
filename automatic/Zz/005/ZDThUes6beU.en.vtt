can't<00:05:47.620> really<00:05:47.919> remember<00:05:48.190> what<00:05:48.699> some<00:05:49.690> of<00:05:49.719> my

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
can't really remember what some of my

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.129 
can't really remember what some of my
memory<00:05:50.259> banks<00:05:50.590> have<00:05:50.740> failed<00:05:50.979> over<00:05:51.190> the<00:05:51.430> years

fighting<00:05:54.729> I<00:05:55.650> think<00:05:56.650> it<00:05:56.740> was<00:05:56.860> pirates<00:06:05.879> pirates

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:06.879 
fighting I think it was pirates pirates

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:09.390 
fighting I think it was pirates pirates
and<00:06:07.599> I<00:06:08.110> think<00:06:08.379> there<00:06:08.500> were<00:06:08.590> some<00:06:08.800> ninjas<00:06:09.219> that

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
and I think there were some ninjas that

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.969 
and I think there were some ninjas that
were<00:06:09.460> working<00:06:09.669> with<00:06:09.879> them<00:06:10.029> I<00:06:10.810> don't<00:06:11.379> think<00:06:11.620> so

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
were working with them I don't think so

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:13.890 
were working with them I don't think so
and<00:06:12.279> I<00:06:12.610> think<00:06:12.669> they<00:06:12.969> had<00:06:13.120> traveled<00:06:13.719> from

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
and I think they had traveled from

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:26.010 
and I think they had traveled from
another<00:06:14.199> planet<00:06:23.520> my<00:06:24.520> logical<00:06:25.029> data<00:06:25.240> analysis

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
another planet my logical data analysis

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.809 
another planet my logical data analysis
sector<00:06:26.379> indicates<00:06:26.949> that<00:06:27.159> would<00:06:27.370> be<00:06:27.520> highly

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:27.819 
sector indicates that would be highly

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.930 
sector indicates that would be highly
unlikely<00:06:28.389> and<00:06:29.110> my<00:06:29.319> bullshit<00:06:29.620> meter<00:06:29.770> agrees<00:06:30.219> my

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
unlikely and my bullshit meter agrees my

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.469 
unlikely and my bullshit meter agrees my
postion<00:06:31.479> meter<00:06:31.750> agrees

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479
