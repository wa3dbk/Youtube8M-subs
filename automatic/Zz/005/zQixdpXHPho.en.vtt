is<00:00:19.800> fantastic<00:00:20.150> a<00:00:21.150> great<00:00:21.240> app<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.960> I'll

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
is fantastic a great app that I'll

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.540 
is fantastic a great app that I'll
actually<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.470> quickly<00:00:22.740> show<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.039> here<00:00:23.340> is

do you have yet that hairspray again oh
one<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.599> my<00:00:27.750> favorite<00:00:28.260> set<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:29.010> applications

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
one of my favorite set of applications

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.170 
one of my favorite set of applications
is<00:00:30.830> our<00:00:31.830> apps<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.250> bridge<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.550> physical

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
is our apps that bridge the physical

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.639 
is our apps that bridge the physical
world<00:00:33.300> with<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.750> virtual<00:00:34.079> world<00:00:34.140> that's<00:00:34.500> sort

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
world with the virtual world that's sort

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.930 
world with the virtual world that's sort
of<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> promise<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.460> mobile<00:00:35.700> can

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
of the promise of what mobile can

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.030 
of the promise of what mobile can
deliver<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.200> what<00:00:37.440> we've<00:00:37.559> done<00:00:37.590> here<00:00:37.800> is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
deliver and so what we've done here is

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.760 
deliver and so what we've done here is
we've<00:00:38.280> created<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.640> barcode<00:00:39.030> scanner<00:00:39.770> that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
we've created a barcode scanner that

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.880 
we've created a barcode scanner that
basically<00:00:41.370> allows<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.239> scan

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
basically allows you to scan

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.330 
basically allows you to scan
one-dimensional<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:43.980> two-dimensional

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
one-dimensional and two-dimensional

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.209 
one-dimensional and two-dimensional
barcodes<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.750> for<00:00:46.020> instance<00:00:46.050> if<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.039> look

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
barcodes so for instance if you look

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.840 
barcodes so for instance if you look
here<00:00:48.230> no<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.500> my<00:00:49.590> business<00:00:49.739> card<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.399> on

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
here no this is my business card and on

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.250 
here no this is my business card and on
the<00:00:50.969> back<00:00:51.180> what<00:00:51.360> we've<00:00:51.449> done<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.750> created<00:00:52.050> at<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
the back what we've done is created at a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.590 
the back what we've done is created at a
two-dimensional<00:00:53.010> barcode<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:54.210> probably

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
two-dimensional barcode you probably

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.150 
two-dimensional barcode you probably
have<00:00:54.719> seen<00:00:54.870> stuff<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.649> FedEx

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
have seen stuff like this on FedEx

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.180 
have seen stuff like this on FedEx
packages<00:00:56.610> right<00:00:57.000> or<00:00:57.449> UPS<00:00:57.870> boxes<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.920> call

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
packages right or UPS boxes on the call

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.520 
packages right or UPS boxes on the call
Mexico's<00:00:59.760> or<00:00:59.969> whatnot<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.840> essentially<00:01:01.230> this

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
Mexico's or whatnot but essentially this

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.139 
Mexico's or whatnot but essentially this
is<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.890> standard<00:01:02.129> two-dimensional<00:01:02.910> code

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
is just a standard two-dimensional code

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.580 
is just a standard two-dimensional code
that<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.110> take<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> picture<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.680> it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
that if I take a picture of it

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.880 
that if I take a picture of it
the<00:01:06.429> camera<00:01:06.789> instantly<00:01:07.240> recognizes<00:01:07.899> the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
the camera instantly recognizes the

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.529 
the camera instantly recognizes the
information<00:01:09.369> stored<00:01:09.609> in<00:01:09.700> that<00:01:09.789> code<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.329> I

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
information stored in that code and I

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:12.330 
information stored in that code and I
just<00:01:10.780> click<00:01:10.990> add<00:01:11.170> contact<00:01:11.619> and<00:01:11.950> that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
just click add contact and that

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.740 
just click add contact and that
information<00:01:12.549> is<00:01:12.850> then<00:01:13.000> stored<00:01:13.149> to<00:01:13.450> my<00:01:13.570> address

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
information is then stored to my address

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.639 
information is then stored to my address
book<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:14.229> I<00:01:14.560> can<00:01:14.740> save<00:01:14.920> it<00:01:14.950> so<00:01:16.350> also<00:01:17.350> all<00:01:17.500> of<00:01:17.530> a

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
book and I can save it so also all of a

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:18.990 
book and I can save it so also all of a
sudden<00:01:17.920> we've<00:01:18.069> eliminated<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.490> need<00:01:18.700> for

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
sudden we've eliminated the need for

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.690 
sudden we've eliminated the need for
paper<00:01:19.329> business<00:01:19.539> cards<00:01:20.310> there's<00:01:21.310> also<00:01:21.520> a

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
paper business cards there's also a

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.669 
paper business cards there's also a
great<00:01:22.149> application<00:01:22.509> which<00:01:22.929> I'll<00:01:23.380> show<00:01:23.530> you<00:01:23.560> in

great application which I'll show you in

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.649 
great application which I'll show you in
a<00:01:23.740> moment<00:01:23.829> where<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.310> same<00:01:24.490> application<00:01:25.060> can

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
a moment where the same application can

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.809 
a moment where the same application can
also<00:01:25.780> take<00:01:25.990> pictures<00:01:26.319> of<00:01:26.350> a<00:01:27.009> barcode<00:01:27.670> on<00:01:27.759> a

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
also take pictures of a barcode on a

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.240 
also take pictures of a barcode on a
product<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:29.350> that<00:01:29.380> will<00:01:29.709> allow<00:01:29.859> you<00:01:29.920> to<00:01:30.069> do

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
that stuff let me show you one other app

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.449 
that stuff let me show you one other app
while<00:01:35.259> I'm<00:01:35.380> waiting<00:01:35.469> for<00:01:35.679> that<00:01:35.799> barcode<00:01:36.100> you
