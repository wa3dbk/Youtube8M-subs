minimize the number of external holes so
you<00:02:21.670> can<00:02:21.940> use<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.300> same<00:02:22.570> hole<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.850> inject

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
you can use the same hole and inject

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.030 
you can use the same hole and inject
marinade<00:02:25.330> in<00:02:25.540> several<00:02:25.960> locations<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.860> the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
marinade in several locations of the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:53.000 
marinade in several locations of the
turkey

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.250 

when<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.129> takes<00:02:54.400> maybe<00:02:55.080> three<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.230> five
