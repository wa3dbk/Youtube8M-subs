though either of those things so all I

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.320 
though either of those things so all I
could<00:01:07.530> spell<00:01:07.890> really<00:01:08.250> was<00:01:08.430> ham<00:01:08.760> but<00:01:09.180> that's

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.560

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
I would try this out with him over where

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.639
