00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.130 

okay<00:00:01.050> once<00:00:01.319> you<00:00:01.680> have<00:00:01.979> completed<00:00:02.870> the<00:00:03.870> wings

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
okay once you have completed the wings

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.650 
okay once you have completed the wings
on<00:00:04.560> both<00:00:05.160> sides<00:00:05.549> you<00:00:05.819> will<00:00:05.970> have<00:00:06.180> this<00:00:06.390> which

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
on both sides you will have this which

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.220 
on both sides you will have this which
is<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.930> beginning<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.500> step<00:00:07.890> 9<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.900> that<00:00:09.900> step

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
is the beginning of step 9 and that step

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.580 
is the beginning of step 9 and that step
is<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.800> do<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.040> reverse<00:00:11.639> fold<00:00:12.230> along<00:00:13.230> these

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
is to do a reverse fold along these

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.019 
is to do a reverse fold along these
edges<00:00:14.040> right<00:00:16.039> here<00:00:17.270> and<00:00:18.680> right<00:00:19.680> here<00:00:20.029> meeting

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
edges right here and right here meeting

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.679 
edges right here and right here meeting
here<00:00:21.480> original<00:00:22.289> reverse<00:00:22.740> folding<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.250> down

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
here original reverse folding that down

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.519 
here original reverse folding that down
so<00:00:25.250> full<00:00:26.250> model<00:00:26.609> like<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.320> where

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
so full model like this this is where

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.299 
so full model like this this is where
the<00:00:28.800> point<00:00:29.220> gets<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.449> lot<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:31.080> layers<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.800> you're

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the point gets a lot of layers so you're

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.240 
the point gets a lot of layers so you're
gonna<00:00:33.230> want<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.320> really<00:00:34.500> get<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.190> you

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
gonna want to really get that and you

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.000 
gonna want to really get that and you
can<00:00:35.399> use<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:35.730> my<00:00:35.850> favorite<00:00:36.329> origami<00:00:37.140> tools<00:00:37.680> in

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
can use one my favorite origami tools in

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.700 
can use one my favorite origami tools in
the<00:00:38.399> series<00:00:38.820> origami<00:00:39.300> section<00:00:39.809> bent<00:00:40.559> nose

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the series origami section bent nose

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.160 
the series origami section bent nose
pliers<00:00:41.030> very<00:00:42.030> nice<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:42.600> doing<00:00:42.719> things<00:00:43.020> like

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
pliers very nice for doing things like

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.650 
pliers very nice for doing things like
this<00:00:43.700> making<00:00:44.700> sure<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.149> get<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.450> ones

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
this making sure that you get the ones

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.750 
this making sure that you get the ones
that<00:00:46.200> are<00:00:46.320> smooth<00:00:46.680> without<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> serrated<00:00:47.489> edge

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that are smooth without a serrated edge

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.180 
that are smooth without a serrated edge
otherwise<00:00:48.350> you<00:00:49.350> will<00:00:49.469> leave<00:00:49.620> interesting

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
otherwise you will leave interesting

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.990 
otherwise you will leave interesting
patterns<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.789> your<00:00:51.379> origami<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:53.520> these<00:00:53.820> are

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
patterns on your origami so these are

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.139 
patterns on your origami so these are
very<00:00:54.210> handy<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.809> getting<00:00:55.910> multiple<00:00:56.910> layers

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
very handy for getting multiple layers

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.849 
very handy for getting multiple layers
down<00:00:58.820> okay<00:00:59.820> then<00:01:00.260> you're<00:01:01.260> going<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.559> want<00:01:01.770> to

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
down okay then you're going to want to

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.649 
down okay then you're going to want to
fold

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.790 

following<00:01:08.659> along<00:01:09.110> this<00:01:09.560> edge<00:01:09.860> right<00:01:10.159> here

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:23.109 

doing<00:01:15.800> the<00:01:16.100> same<00:01:16.340> thing<00:01:16.729> on<00:01:17.600> this<00:01:18.470> side<00:01:22.119> my

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
doing the same thing on this side my

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.060 
doing the same thing on this side my
chances<00:01:23.630> are<00:01:23.810> things<00:01:24.229> aren't<00:01:24.440> going<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:24.860> line

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
chances are things aren't going to line

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.420 
chances are things aren't going to line
up<00:01:25.100> exactly<00:01:26.380> through<00:01:27.380> all<00:01:27.560> these<00:01:27.830> layers<00:01:28.100> so

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
up exactly through all these layers so

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.480 
up exactly through all these layers so
you're<00:01:28.580> just<00:01:28.640> going<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:28.880> have<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:29.149> kind<00:01:29.330> of

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
you're just going to have to kind of

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.200 
you're just going to have to kind of
find<00:01:31.490> it<00:01:31.759> as<00:01:31.970> it<00:01:32.390> comes

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
find it as it comes

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.560 
find it as it comes
fold<00:01:35.210> down<00:01:36.280> um<00:01:37.930> George<00:01:39.429> like<00:01:40.429> that<00:01:40.759> once<00:01:41.270> again

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
fold down um George like that once again

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.730 
fold down um George like that once again
using<00:01:41.780> Magnificent<00:01:42.649> sears<00:01:42.950> origami<00:01:43.460> tools<00:01:44.740> to

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
using Magnificent sears origami tools to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.859 
using Magnificent sears origami tools to
make<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.160> nice<00:01:47.649> tight<00:01:49.270> full<00:01:50.619> get<00:01:51.619> in<00:01:51.860> there

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
make it a nice tight full get in there

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.100 
make it a nice tight full get in there
there<00:01:55.420> okay<00:01:56.530> so<00:01:57.530> now<00:01:57.679> that<00:01:57.950> gives<00:01:58.160> us<00:01:58.340> that

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
there okay so now that gives us that

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.010 
there okay so now that gives us that
reverse<00:02:00.110> fold<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:02.210> we<00:02:02.330> have<00:02:02.479> it<00:02:02.600> like<00:02:02.720> this

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
reverse fold and we have it like this

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.620 
reverse fold and we have it like this
which<00:02:03.710> is<00:02:03.860> what<00:02:04.039> we're<00:02:04.190> looking<00:02:04.220> at<00:02:04.700> for<00:02:05.509> the

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
which is what we're looking at for the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.090 
which is what we're looking at for the
beginning<00:02:06.560> of<00:02:06.649> step<00:02:06.860> 10<00:02:07.509> now<00:02:08.509> step<00:02:08.989> 10<00:02:09.319> is

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
beginning of step 10 now step 10 is

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.150 
beginning of step 10 now step 10 is
another<00:02:11.030> judgment<00:02:11.989> fold<00:02:12.260> we're<00:02:12.950> going<00:02:13.100> to

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
pick a point something like this if you

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.750 
pick a point something like this if you
want<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.810> can<00:02:32.989> you<00:02:33.440> can<00:02:33.650> make<00:02:33.680> sure<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.340> folds

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
want you can you can make sure it folds

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.710 
want you can you can make sure it folds
flat<00:02:34.940> up<00:02:35.660> against<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.440> at<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:37.690> 90<00:02:38.690> degree

make the next Valley fold across that
direction<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.519> this<00:02:59.390> one<00:02:59.660> is<00:02:59.900> another<00:03:00.350> multi

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
direction and this one is another multi

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.349 
direction and this one is another multi
layer<00:03:01.310> you're<00:03:01.640> going<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:01.850> take<00:03:01.970> all<00:03:02.209> the

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
layer you're going to take all the

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.340 
layer you're going to take all the
layers<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.870> wing<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:03.859> back<00:03:04.040> wing<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:05.480> you're

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
layers the wing the back wing and you're

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.009 
layers the wing the back wing and you're
going<00:03:06.470> to<00:03:06.560> start<00:03:06.890> there<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:08.570> you're<00:03:08.840> going<00:03:08.989> to

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
going to start there and you're going to

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.710 
going to start there and you're going to
fold<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:12.560> where<00:03:12.739> that<00:03:12.920> back<00:03:13.760> crease<00:03:14.329> on<00:03:14.630> the

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
fold to where that back crease on the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.759 
fold to where that back crease on the
tail<00:03:15.410> fin<00:03:15.709> met<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.459> body<00:03:18.010> fold<00:03:19.010> that<00:03:19.250> up<00:03:20.769> like

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
tail fin met the body fold that up like

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:28.360 
tail fin met the body fold that up like
that<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:25.730> course<00:03:26.980> you're<00:03:27.980> going<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.190> do

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
that and of course you're going to do

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:36.610 
that and of course you're going to do
the<00:03:28.519> same<00:03:28.699> thing<00:03:29.090> on<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:32.299> other<00:03:32.329> side<00:03:35.620> holding

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
the same thing on the other side holding

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.819 
the same thing on the other side holding
this<00:03:37.040> down<00:03:38.829> matching<00:03:39.829> that<00:03:39.979> angle<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:42.560> then

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
this down matching that angle and then

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:49.900 
this down matching that angle and then
taking<00:03:43.370> everything

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:57.720 

I'm<00:03:50.450> folding<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:51.140> up

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.979 

now<00:03:58.510> if<00:03:58.599> you<00:03:58.660> did<00:03:58.840> it<00:03:58.930> right<00:03:59.140> or<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:01.540> will<00:04:01.750> have

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
now if you did it right or you will have

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.000 
now if you did it right or you will have
wings<00:04:02.560> that<00:04:02.920> match<00:04:03.390> all<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:04.690> way<00:04:04.780> across<00:04:05.110> with

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
wings that match all the way across with

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.280 
wings that match all the way across with
everything<00:04:06.489> lining<00:04:06.670> up<00:04:06.910> nicely<00:04:07.260> like<00:04:08.260> this

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
everything lining up nicely like this

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.650 
everything lining up nicely like this
and<00:04:09.269> then<00:04:10.269> when<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:12.000> fold<00:04:13.000> these<00:04:13.209> back<00:04:13.390> down

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
and then when you fold these back down

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.479 
and then when you fold these back down
you<00:04:14.200> have<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.970> beginning<00:04:16.680> of<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:18.100> model

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
you have the beginning of the model

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.860 
you have the beginning of the model
really<00:04:18.820> starting<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.209> take<00:04:19.479> shape

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.180 

okay<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.080> then<00:04:23.290> on<00:04:23.560> 11<00:04:24.400> is<00:04:24.940> just<00:04:25.240> taking<00:04:25.630> this

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
okay and then on 11 is just taking this

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.780 
okay and then on 11 is just taking this
piece<00:04:27.190> of<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.760> reverse<00:04:28.210> fold<00:04:28.540> that<00:04:28.720> you<00:04:28.870> did

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
piece of the reverse fold that you did

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.600 
piece of the reverse fold that you did
and<00:04:30.790> you're<00:04:31.060> just<00:04:31.210> going<00:04:31.419> to<00:04:31.450> fold<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:32.370> this<00:04:33.370> is

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
and you're just going to fold it this is

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.450 
and you're just going to fold it this is
just<00:04:33.850> to<00:04:34.000> lock<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.720> model<00:04:35.110> together<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:35.860> this

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
just to lock the model together and this

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.140 
just to lock the model together and this
is<00:04:36.610> where<00:04:36.760> this<00:04:36.970> tool<00:04:37.479> really<00:04:37.780> comes<00:04:38.380> in<00:04:38.530> handy

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
is where this tool really comes in handy

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.240 
is where this tool really comes in handy
getting<00:04:40.150> in<00:04:40.270> there<00:04:40.510> and<00:04:40.690> making<00:04:42.000> sure<00:04:43.000> that

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
getting in there and making sure that

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.740 
getting in there and making sure that
fold<00:04:45.250> is<00:04:45.520> nice<00:04:45.760> and<00:04:46.120> tight<00:04:48.240> folding<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.360> model

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
fold is nice and tight folding the model

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:56.400 
fold is nice and tight folding the model
together

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.310 

getting<00:04:57.410> everything<00:04:57.680> nice<00:04:58.100> and<00:04:59.320> tight

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320

getting everything nice and tight
throughout<00:05:00.710> body<00:05:04.030> nice<00:05:05.710> model<00:05:06.710> then<00:05:07.610> at<00:05:07.970> the

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
throughout body nice model then at the

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.750 
throughout body nice model then at the
end<00:05:08.240> of<00:05:08.570> 12<00:05:10.900> at<00:05:11.900> the<00:05:12.050> beginning<00:05:12.410> of<00:05:12.530> 12<00:05:12.800> we<00:05:13.550> have

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
end of 12 at the beginning of 12 we have

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.450 
end of 12 at the beginning of 12 we have
our<00:05:13.940> fins<00:05:14.300> down<00:05:14.510> like<00:05:14.690> this<00:05:14.900> and<00:05:15.280> you're<00:05:16.280> just

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
our fins down like this and you're just

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.660 
our fins down like this and you're just
going<00:05:16.670> to<00:05:16.730> fold<00:05:17.330> those<00:05:17.570> up<00:05:17.770> this<00:05:18.770> is<00:05:19.010> a<00:05:19.040> pretty

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
going to fold those up this is a pretty

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:30.360 
going to fold those up this is a pretty
much<00:05:19.910> just<00:05:20.150> to<00:05:20.330> taste<00:05:20.600> fold<00:05:24.910> those<00:05:28.780> fold<00:05:29.780> up

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
much just to taste fold those fold up

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.720 
much just to taste fold those fold up
and<00:05:31.840> then<00:05:32.840> this<00:05:33.680> next<00:05:34.010> part<00:05:34.190> we're<00:05:34.340> crimp

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
and then this next part we're crimp

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.540 
and then this next part we're crimp
folding<00:05:35.090> the<00:05:35.210> wings<00:05:35.240> here<00:05:36.070> that's<00:05:37.070> just

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
folding the wings here that's just

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.140 
folding the wings here that's just
developing<00:05:38.090> this<00:05:38.360> air<00:05:38.630> intake<00:05:39.170> and<00:05:40.000> to<00:05:41.000> get

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
developing this air intake and to get

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.140 
developing this air intake and to get
the<00:05:41.330> shape<00:05:41.750> of<00:05:41.870> the<00:05:41.960> wing<00:05:42.110> nicely<00:05:42.530> and<00:05:43.000> try<00:05:44.000> and

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
the shape of the wing nicely and try and

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.390 
the shape of the wing nicely and try and
getting<00:05:44.450> the<00:05:44.870> wing<00:05:45.260> kind<00:05:45.890> of<00:05:46.040> looking

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
getting the wing kind of looking

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.570 
getting the wing kind of looking
straight<00:05:47.390> parallel<00:05:48.080> to<00:05:48.290> the<00:05:48.410> body<00:05:48.560> here<00:05:48.920> but

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
straight parallel to the body here but

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.230 
straight parallel to the body here but
that's<00:05:50.360> again<00:05:50.930> more<00:05:51.230> of<00:05:51.320> a<00:05:51.640> shaping<00:05:52.640> fold<00:05:53.060> that

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
that's again more of a shaping fold that

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.680 
that's again more of a shaping fold that
we're<00:05:53.390> doing<00:05:53.660> now<00:05:53.860> so<00:05:54.860> usually<00:05:55.340> I<00:05:55.370> take<00:05:55.820> that

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
we're doing now so usually I take that

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.330 
we're doing now so usually I take that
where<00:05:57.170> this<00:05:57.820> part<00:05:58.820> of<00:05:59.000> the<00:05:59.090> fold<00:05:59.360> comes<00:05:59.690> in<00:06:00.340> to

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
where this part of the fold comes in to

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.670 
where this part of the fold comes in to
the<00:06:01.430> edge<00:06:01.520> of<00:06:01.640> the<00:06:01.730> wing<00:06:01.910> here<00:06:02.240> and<00:06:02.500> coming<00:06:03.500> out

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
the edge of the wing here and coming out

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:10.390 
the edge of the wing here and coming out
to<00:06:05.169> around<00:06:06.730> the<00:06:07.730> beginning<00:06:08.150> of<00:06:08.270> the<00:06:08.360> oh<00:06:09.400> you

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
to around the beginning of the oh you

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:18.060 
to around the beginning of the oh you
can<00:06:10.669> just<00:06:10.850> fold<00:06:11.210> that<00:06:11.980> down<00:06:12.980> like<00:06:13.310> this<00:06:16.390> and

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
can just fold that down like this and

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:27.000 
can just fold that down like this and
then<00:06:20.830> starting<00:06:22.180> at<00:06:23.180> the<00:06:23.630> base<00:06:23.810> of<00:06:23.840> the<00:06:24.140> wing

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.470 

folding<00:06:28.010> it<00:06:28.130> out<00:06:29.620> where<00:06:30.620> the<00:06:30.860> wing<00:06:31.100> looks

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
folding it out where the wing looks

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:38.570 
folding it out where the wing looks
fairly<00:06:32.480> perpendicular<00:06:33.440> to<00:06:33.470> the<00:06:36.550> body

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
fairly perpendicular to the body

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.980 
fairly perpendicular to the body

only thing left to do is to inside
reverse<00:07:12.139> fold<00:07:13.139> the<00:07:14.129> tail<00:07:14.960> just<00:07:15.960> to<00:07:16.110> give<00:07:16.349> it

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:16.469 
reverse fold the tail just to give it

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:41.400 
reverse fold the tail just to give it
that<00:07:17.389> flat<00:07:18.389> edge<00:07:18.719> look

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:41.410
