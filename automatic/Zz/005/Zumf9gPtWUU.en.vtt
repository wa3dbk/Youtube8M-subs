00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.890 
not actually connecting with anything so
that<00:01:18.830> makes<00:01:19.100> it<00:01:19.190> difficult

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.960 

we<00:01:24.900> do<00:01:25.050> have<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.380> rehearse<00:01:25.500> things<00:01:26.010> and<00:01:26.580> set

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.800 
gonna go back violently which happens
with<00:01:38.490> most<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.760> the<00:01:38.880> spells<00:01:39.180> there<00:01:39.690> are

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
with most of the spells there are

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.080 
with most of the spells there are
occasions<00:01:40.320> where<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.920> spell<00:01:41.700> might<00:01:41.880> hit

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
somebody in the shoulder so it's very

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.860 
somebody in the shoulder so it's very
similar<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.430> when<00:01:45.150> we<00:01:45.180> do<00:01:45.360> bullet<00:01:45.600> hits<00:01:45.750> on

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
similar to when we do bullet hits on

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.840 
similar to when we do bullet hits on
films<00:01:46.229> we'll<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.920> react<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.640> with

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
films we'll just react with it with

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.120 
films we'll just react with it with
their<00:01:48.000> shoulder<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.740> then<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:49.890> carry<00:01:50.070> on

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
their shoulder and then just carry on

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.540 
their shoulder and then just carry on
fighting

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.969 

we<00:01:59.550> always<00:01:59.729> go<00:02:00.150> all<00:02:00.420> out<00:02:00.450> put<00:02:00.960> everything<00:02:01.710> into

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
we always go all out put everything into

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.640 
we always go all out put everything into
it<00:02:02.160> and<00:02:02.580> then<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:03.960> always<00:02:04.110> bring<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.470> back

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
it and then we can always bring it back

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.310 
it and then we can always bring it back
slightly<00:02:07.700> because<00:02:08.700> if<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.450> do

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
slightly because if you have do

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.140 
slightly because if you have do
something<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:11.100> just<00:02:11.130> doesn't<00:02:11.520> look<00:02:11.550> real<00:02:11.850> you

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
something it just doesn't look real you

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.240 
something it just doesn't look real you
know<00:02:12.630> so<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:12.959> have<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.410> kind<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.680> throw

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
know so you have to kind of throw

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:32.979 
know so you have to kind of throw
yourself<00:02:14.640> in

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.390 

but<00:02:33.989> more<00:02:34.170> critical<00:02:34.650> or<00:02:34.799> nothing<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:35.220> better

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
but more critical or nothing the better

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.089 
but more critical or nothing the better
you<00:02:35.579> can<00:02:35.610> give<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.540> public<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:37.049> real<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.799> real

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
you can give the public a real a real

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.890 
you can give the public a real a real
performance<00:02:38.549> I<00:02:38.700> think<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:39.000> more<00:02:39.209> more<00:02:39.780> you'll

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
performance I think the more more you'll

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.200 
performance I think the more more you'll
get<00:02:39.989> back
