 automatically turns off in the case of 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.460
 trekking the version the differential it

 in relation to strada adventure ahead of

 visual a little more sporty 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.049
 but it's already a style that is already in 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.820
 been leaving for a long time. 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.030
 to adventure a style or more 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.400
 current 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.479
 although the rear does not have large 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.790
 changes 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.740
 the interior the panel basically the same 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.369
 adventure 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.540
 only it has 11 items less 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.130
 adventure has three instruments 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.240
 above the center console that are 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.180
 absent in tracking but this is 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.520
 model there are some options like air 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.610
 conditional steering system 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.039
 sound that has bluetooth connectivity

 multifunctional controls 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.750

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.400
 sound as it allowed the attendance of 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.530
 phone calls in a possible 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.630

 stagnant road tracking cabin 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.840
 double three doors 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.700
 in the interior we have as differential 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.670
 the fact of the road trek in three harbors 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.170
 have space for three passengers 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:47.480

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:51.610
 has a cargo proposal with capacity 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:55.120
 to transport three people inside 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:59.210
 without giving up its load capacity 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.980
 that is traditional in the light commercial 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.810
 Troicki road also comes with the bucket 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:10.120

 little saint antonio with black drawing 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.580
 and then we will see the rear 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.670
 really good looking with a good look 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.950
 interesting a visual light the flashlights 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:27.370
 Specifically, they look pretty good. 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:30.800
 even from the highway delivered in 2015 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.370
 the road track in all its versions 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:39.460
