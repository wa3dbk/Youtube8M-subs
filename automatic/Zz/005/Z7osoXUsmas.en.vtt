for the nav system or some other feature

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.980 
for the nav system or some other feature
made<00:00:10.019> Elizabeth<00:00:11.330> realize<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.629> battery

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
made Elizabeth realize that the battery

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.560 
made Elizabeth realize that the battery
is<00:00:13.200> low

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.790

let's find cigarette lighter it's right
there

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.650 

number<00:01:20.640> 33<00:01:21.800> so<00:01:22.800> now<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:22.980> need<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.340> find<00:01:23.640> where<00:01:24.330> is

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
number 33 so now I need to find where is

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.250 
number 33 so now I need to find where is
number<00:01:25.260> 33<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.550> they<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:27.050> this<00:01:28.050> little

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
number 33 and they have this little

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.540 
number 33 and they have this little
diagram<00:01:28.620> right<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:29.400> next<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:31.370> 33<00:01:32.370> is

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
diagram right here next to it and 33 is

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:40.590 
diagram right here next to it and 33 is
right<00:01:32.820> here<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.710> if<00:01:34.980> I<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.640> panel

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:02:03.660 

looks<00:01:40.780> like<00:01:41.200> this

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.390 

oh<00:02:04.590> look

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
oh look

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.430 
oh look
I<00:02:07.430> don't<00:02:08.090> know<00:02:08.240> if<00:02:08.390> this<00:02:08.630> is<00:02:08.869> going<00:02:09.020> to<00:02:09.110> show<00:02:09.320> up

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
I don't know if this is going to show up

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.790 
I don't know if this is going to show up
on<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.710> video<00:02:10.030> but<00:02:11.030> inside<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.960> plastic<00:02:12.530> you

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
on the video but inside the plastic you

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.330 
on the video but inside the plastic you
can<00:02:12.860> see<00:02:13.280> some<00:02:13.700> metal<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.660> that<00:02:15.410> metal<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:16.070> not

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
can see some metal and that metal is not

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.330 
can see some metal and that metal is not
connected<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.210> much<00:02:17.960> like<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.170> light<00:02:18.470> bulb<00:02:18.740> when

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
connected so much like a light bulb when

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.040 
connected so much like a light bulb when
it's<00:02:19.640> like<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.820> closed<00:02:20.150> circuit<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.020> that

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
it's like a closed circuit and that

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.990 
it's like a closed circuit and that
closed<00:02:22.010> circuit<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.550> broke<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:24.550> therefore<00:02:25.550> I

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
closed circuit is broke and therefore I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.770 
closed circuit is broke and therefore I
think<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.600> is<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.960> fuse<00:02:27.490> so<00:02:28.510> I've<00:02:29.510> already

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
think it is the fuse so I've already

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.400 
think it is the fuse so I've already
gone<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.290> got<00:02:30.470> my<00:02:31.240> pack<00:02:32.240> of<00:02:32.270> fuses<00:02:32.900> from

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.400 

so<00:02:36.590> from<00:02:37.520> pet<00:02:37.730> boys<00:02:37.970> I<00:02:38.150> spent<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.810> whole<00:02:41.080> 3.2<00:02:42.080> 50

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
so from pet boys I spent a whole 3.2 50

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.600 
so from pet boys I spent a whole 3.2 50
cent<00:02:42.620> three<00:02:42.830> dollars<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.280> seventy<00:02:43.400> eight

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
cent three dollars and seventy eight

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.080 
cent three dollars and seventy eight
cents<00:02:43.910> of<00:02:44.030> attacks

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
cents of attacks

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.589 
cents of attacks
and<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:46.870> got<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.080> pack<00:02:47.349> of<00:02:47.380> five<00:02:49.260> skip<00:02:50.260> these<00:02:50.440> open

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
and I got a pack of five skip these open

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.500 
and I got a pack of five skip these open
and<00:02:52.599> I'm<00:02:52.930> really<00:02:53.319> hopeless

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.690 

these<00:02:58.510> are<00:02:58.720> really<00:02:58.930> nifty<00:02:59.860> little<00:03:00.190> things<00:03:00.520> -

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
these are really nifty little things -

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.580 
these are really nifty little things -
they're<00:03:00.910> like<00:03:01.030> little<00:03:01.080> tweezers<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.380> use

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
they're like little tweezers to use

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.080 
they're like little tweezers to use
because<00:03:02.890> if<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.190> stuff<00:03:03.519> hard<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.849> get<00:03:04.000> out

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.070 

put<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:07.959> back<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:10.060> is<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.360> old<00:03:10.569> one

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
put that back this is the old one

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.520 
put that back this is the old one
and<00:03:11.380> this<00:03:11.530> is<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.860> new<00:03:12.010> one

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
and this is the new one

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.490 
and this is the new one
so<00:03:14.040> let's<00:03:14.340> get<00:03:14.520> this<00:03:14.640> new<00:03:14.850> one<00:03:15.030> in<00:03:18.290> right<00:03:19.290> in

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
so let's get this new one in right in

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.760 
so let's get this new one in right in
here<00:03:22.610> we're<00:03:23.610> in<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.090> panel<00:03:24.480> number<00:03:24.720> 33<00:03:25.320> is<00:03:25.470> in

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
here we're in the panel number 33 is in

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.060 
here we're in the panel number 33 is in
this<00:03:25.950> case<00:03:26.190> number<00:03:26.460> 33<00:03:27.500> so<00:03:28.500> we<00:03:28.620> just<00:03:28.770> put<00:03:28.950> the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
this case number 33 so we just put the

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:43.130 
this case number 33 so we just put the
fuse<00:03:29.340> in

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.730 

still<00:03:44.140> 11%<00:03:44.920> on<00:03:45.070> my<00:03:45.220> phone<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:47.320> now<00:03:47.440> I'm<00:03:47.530> going

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
still 11% on my phone and now I'm going

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.890 
still 11% on my phone and now I'm going
to<00:03:47.830> plug<00:03:48.010> it<00:03:48.160> in

it's a slow charging and you can see the

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.089 
it's a slow charging and you can see the
little<00:03:58.640> flash<00:03:59.590> right<00:04:00.590> there<00:04:00.769> that<00:04:00.950> it's
