00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
let's slow down of course which is super

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.679 
let's slow down of course which is super
opie<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.830> super<00:01:16.830> monkeys<00:01:17.310> because<00:01:17.850> temples

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
opie and super monkeys because temples

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.249 
opie and super monkeys because temples
are<00:01:19.470> sooo<00:01:19.650> boot<00:01:19.830> really<00:01:20.369> good<00:01:20.580> um<00:01:21.259> mortars

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
are sooo boot really good um mortars

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.539 
are sooo boot really good um mortars
because<00:01:22.890> once<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.740> zomg<00:01:25.740> gets<00:01:25.979> cracked<00:01:26.250> you

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
because once the zomg gets cracked you

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.929 
because once the zomg gets cracked you
can<00:01:26.729> more<00:01:26.880> stall<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.570> that's<00:01:27.750> good<00:01:28.939> villages

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
can more stall and that's good villages

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.319 
can more stall and that's good villages
because<00:01:30.530> most<00:01:31.530> seem<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.979> think<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.520> we

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
because most seem to think that we

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.969 
because most seem to think that we
wouldn't<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.750> enough<00:01:33.780> money<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.530> didn't

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
wouldn't have enough money we didn't

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.399 
wouldn't have enough money we didn't
have<00:01:35.100> villages<00:01:35.610> or<00:01:35.850> farms<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.570> villages<00:01:36.990> are

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
have villages or farms and villages are

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.660 
have villages or farms and villages are
obviously<00:01:37.770> better<00:01:37.979> than<00:01:38.340> having<00:01:38.579> farms<00:01:39.560> um<00:01:40.670> no

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
obviously better than having farms um no

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.670 
obviously better than having farms um no
I<00:01:41.700> wasn't<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.360> sure<00:01:42.390> about<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.350> thought

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
I wasn't so sure about this I I thought

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.969 
I wasn't so sure about this I I thought
which<00:01:43.829> may<00:01:44.040> use<00:01:44.250> snipers<00:01:44.759> instead<00:01:45.860> you<00:01:46.860> can

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
which may use snipers instead you can

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.350 
which may use snipers instead you can
get<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> little<00:01:47.310> money<00:01:47.520> from<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> ability<00:01:48.329> and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
get a little money from the ability and

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.340 
get a little money from the ability and
then<00:01:49.549> you<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.000> awesome<00:01:51.329> poor<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.049> sniper

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
then you have the awesome poor to sniper

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.609 
then you have the awesome poor to sniper
but<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.689> really<00:01:54.689> haven't<00:01:54.869> played<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.290> update

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
but I really haven't played this update

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.469 
but I really haven't played this update
enough<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.520> trusted<00:01:56.729> him<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.060> did

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
enough so I just trusted him and did

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.889 
enough so I just trusted him and did
this<00:01:57.979> without<00:01:58.979> with<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.149> villages<00:02:00.570> instead

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
this without with the villages instead

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.660 
this without with the villages instead
of<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.049> snipers

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
of the snipers

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.219 
of the snipers
and<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.780> bomb<00:02:03.960> towers<00:02:04.380> as<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.860> see<00:02:05.210> were

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
and the bomb towers as you can see were

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.999 
and the bomb towers as you can see were
spamming<00:02:07.229> them<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.710> break<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.130> zom<00:02:08.550> jeez<00:02:10.009> yeah

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
spamming them to break the zom jeez yeah

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.670 
spamming them to break the zom jeez yeah
they're<00:02:11.250> really<00:02:11.459> good<00:02:11.610> for<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:13.200> what

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
they're really good for that and what

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.160 
they're really good for that and what
once<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> get<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.610> zomg<00:02:15.090> dead<00:02:15.330> after<00:02:15.810> that

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
once you get the zomg dead after that

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.650 
once you get the zomg dead after that
it's<00:02:16.349> very<00:02:16.890> easy<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:19.020> anyway<00:02:19.470> on<00:02:20.400> round<00:02:20.850> 58<00:02:21.360> we

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
it's very easy so anyway on round 58 we

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.190 
it's very easy so anyway on round 58 we
decide<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.380> just<00:02:22.560> give<00:02:22.770> up<00:02:22.910> because<00:02:23.959> this<00:02:24.959> was

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
decide to just give up because this was

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.559 
decide to just give up because this was
super<00:02:25.410> annoying<00:02:25.830> just<00:02:26.550> spamming<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.180> ability

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
super annoying just spamming the ability

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.650 
super annoying just spamming the ability
it<00:02:28.470> took<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.830> long<00:02:28.950> time<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.940> video<00:02:30.269> is<00:02:30.450> sped

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
it took a long time this video is sped

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.330 
it took a long time this video is sped
up<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:31.140> it's<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:31.560> normal<00:02:31.920> speed<00:02:33.470> but<00:02:34.470> in<00:02:34.890> real

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
up so it's a normal speed but in real

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.130 
up so it's a normal speed but in real
time<00:02:35.610> was<00:02:35.850> taking<00:02:36.120> about<00:02:36.180> 10<00:02:36.540> times<00:02:36.750> as<00:02:36.959> long

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
time was taking about 10 times as long

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.789 
time was taking about 10 times as long
so<00:02:37.910> even<00:02:38.910> though<00:02:38.940> these<00:02:39.750> two<00:02:40.140> rounds<00:02:40.530> rounds

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
so even though these two rounds rounds

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.870 
so even though these two rounds rounds
15<00:02:41.100> set<00:02:41.340> 56<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.269> 57<00:02:42.569> that<00:02:43.049> I've<00:02:43.140> recorded<00:02:43.880> to

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
15 set 56 and 57 that I've recorded to

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.050 
15 set 56 and 57 that I've recorded to
play<00:02:45.120> two<00:02:45.840> two<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.590> half<00:02:46.709> three<00:02:46.950> minutes<00:02:47.340> in

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
play two two and a half three minutes in

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.259 
play two two and a half three minutes in
real<00:02:48.299> time<00:02:48.569> at<00:02:48.989> about<00:02:49.470> half<00:02:49.739> an<00:02:49.860> hour<00:02:50.269> so

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
real time at about half an hour so

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.330 
real time at about half an hour so
didn't<00:02:52.230> want<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.440> go<00:02:52.530> on<00:02:52.680> anymore<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.250> we

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
didn't want to go on anymore and we

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.990 
didn't want to go on anymore and we
decide<00:02:53.720> okay<00:02:54.720> let's<00:02:55.410> just<00:02:55.590> stop<00:02:56.310> here<00:02:56.340> because

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000
