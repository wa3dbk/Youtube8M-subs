yellow and orange yellow and green now
we<00:00:17.730> look<00:00:18.060> at<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.359> corner<00:00:18.750> pieces<00:00:19.130> whether

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
we look at the corner pieces whether

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.590 
we look at the corner pieces whether
they<00:00:20.430> need<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.699> be<00:00:20.850> fixed<00:00:21.359> now<00:00:22.070> this<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.600> yellow

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
they need to be fixed now this is yellow

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.839 
they need to be fixed now this is yellow
red<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.080> blue<00:00:25.970> so<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.210> needs<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.750> go<00:00:28.189> here<00:00:29.189> to

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
red and blue so this needs to go here to

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.290 
red and blue so this needs to go here to
make<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.210> yellow<00:00:30.480> red<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.170> blue<00:00:31.730> so<00:00:32.730> these<00:00:33.000> two

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
make it yellow red and blue so these two

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.500 
make it yellow red and blue so these two
pieces<00:00:33.540> need<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:33.989> be<00:00:34.170> interchanged<00:00:35.180> and<00:00:36.180> this

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
pieces need to be interchanged and this

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.700 
pieces need to be interchanged and this
one<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.870> yellow<00:00:37.290> orange<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.190> blue<00:00:39.230> we<00:00:40.230> need<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
one is yellow orange and blue we need to

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.040 
one is yellow orange and blue we need to
come<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:41.340> at<00:00:41.550> yellow<00:00:42.210> orange<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.930> blue<00:00:45.050> that

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
come here at yellow orange and blue that

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.549 
come here at yellow orange and blue that
is<00:00:46.850> and<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.420> find<00:00:48.719> these<00:00:49.020> two<00:00:49.079> pieces

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
is and then we find these two pieces

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.369 
is and then we find these two pieces
need<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.190> interchanged<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.079> these<00:00:52.079> two

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
need to be interchanged and these two

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.000 
need to be interchanged and these two
pieces<00:00:52.649> need<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.309> interchanged<00:00:54.469> as<00:00:55.469> we<00:00:55.770> saw

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
pieces need to be interchanged as we saw

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.930 
pieces need to be interchanged as we saw
in<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> basics<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.059> three<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:58.289> out<00:00:58.559> out

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
in the basics that three in in out out

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.070 
in the basics that three in in out out
would<00:00:59.940> entertain<00:01:00.870> these<00:01:01.350> two<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.920> these<00:01:02.820> two

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
would entertain these two and these two

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.050 
would entertain these two and these two
now<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.500> time<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.189> put<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.700> into

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
now is the time to put that into

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.609 
now is the time to put that into
practice<00:01:06.740> let<00:01:07.740> us<00:01:07.890> go<00:01:08.070> over<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.869> in<00:01:10.280> in<00:01:11.420> out<00:01:12.420> out

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
practice let us go over it in in out out

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:26.960 
practice let us go over it in in out out
in<00:01:14.420> in<00:01:16.280> out<00:01:17.280> out<00:01:17.450> in<00:01:19.130> in<00:01:21.020> out<00:01:22.020> out<00:01:25.580> now<00:01:26.580> this

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
in in out out in in out out now this

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.210 
in in out out in in out out now this
piece<00:01:27.420> will<00:01:27.840> interchange<00:01:28.229> with<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.920> with<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
piece will interchange with this with a

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.249 
piece will interchange with this with a
turn<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:31.220> if<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.430> remember<00:01:32.900> this<00:01:33.900> it

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
turn like this if you remember this it

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.700 
turn like this if you remember this it
does<00:01:34.770> not<00:01:35.009> take<00:01:35.700> part<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.659> moves<00:01:37.200> at<00:01:37.500> all

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
does not take part in the moves at all

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.649 
does not take part in the moves at all
it<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.070> not<00:01:38.189> part<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> move<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.210> drawing

as we said is untouched these two pieces

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.690 
as we said is untouched these two pieces
get<00:01:43.020> entertained<00:01:43.590> these<00:01:43.860> two<00:01:44.100> pieces<00:01:44.310> get
