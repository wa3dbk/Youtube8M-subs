00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
we have two programs of study foundation

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.430 
we have two programs of study foundation
we<00:00:02.700> have<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.820> media<00:00:03.240> program<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.840> main<00:00:04.080> art

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
we have a media program and a main art

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.140 
we have a media program and a main art
design<00:00:04.830> program<00:00:05.750> and<00:00:06.750> it's<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:08.099> September<00:00:08.730> to

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
design program and it's a September to

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.690 
design program and it's a September to
end<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.599> 2<00:00:09.870> June<00:00:10.170> program<00:00:10.920> one<00:00:11.280> year<00:00:11.460> program

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
end of 2 June program one year program

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.250 
end of 2 June program one year program
and<00:00:12.120> it's<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.559> course<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.549> bridges<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.360> level

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
and it's a course that bridges a level

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.279 
and it's a course that bridges a level
study<00:00:16.529> with<00:00:17.160> degree<00:00:17.520> level<00:00:17.670> study<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
study with degree level study and the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.519 
study with degree level study and the
main<00:00:19.590> reason<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.430> be<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> course<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:22.140> to

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
main reason to be on the course is to

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.550 
main reason to be on the course is to
diagnose<00:00:23.519> your<00:00:23.640> specialism<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:25.050> if<00:00:25.380> you're

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
diagnose your specialism so if you're

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.960 
diagnose your specialism so if you're
unsure<00:00:25.710> about<00:00:26.010> whether<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.490> want<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.789> study

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
unsure about whether you want to study

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.089 
unsure about whether you want to study
graphics<00:00:27.510> or<00:00:27.720> photography<00:00:28.289> then<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.980> have

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
graphics or photography then you have

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.460 
graphics or photography then you have
another<00:00:29.310> year<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.570> establish<00:00:31.320> your

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
another year to establish your

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.990 
another year to establish your
specialism<00:00:32.099> before<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.520> move<00:00:32.669> on<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.940> a

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
specialism before you move on to a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.290 
specialism before you move on to a
degree<00:00:33.149> yes<00:00:34.079> they<00:00:34.440> can<00:00:35.090> however<00:00:36.090> fire

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
degree yes they can however fire

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.030 
degree yes they can however fire
imagination<00:00:37.020> gaze<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.649> want<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.860> do

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
imagination gaze and what you want to do

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.500 
imagination gaze and what you want to do
just<00:00:38.399> go<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.360> it

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
just go for it

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.660 
just go for it
yeah<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:40.140> think<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.680> rotation<00:00:41.190> weeks<00:00:41.370> are<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
yeah I think the rotation weeks are the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.670 
yeah I think the rotation weeks are the
best<00:00:41.910> fit<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.210> me<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.079> loved<00:00:43.469> like

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
best fit for me I just loved like

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.160 
best fit for me I just loved like
experimenting<00:00:44.070> with<00:00:44.579> different<00:00:44.840> doing<00:00:45.840> that

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
experimenting with different doing that

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.810 
experimenting with different doing that
materials<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.489> was<00:00:47.579> just<00:00:47.760> a

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
materials and all that it was just a

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.459 
materials and all that it was just a
really<00:00:48.000> good<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.360> six<00:00:48.629> weeks<00:00:48.719> just<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.260> see

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
really good like six weeks just to see

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.810 
really good like six weeks just to see
what<00:00:49.620> was<00:00:49.739> out<00:00:49.890> there<00:00:49.920> there's<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.730> many

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
what was out there there's so many

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.670 
what was out there there's so many
things<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.420> didn't<00:00:52.020> realize<00:00:52.260> her<00:00:52.559> out

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
things that I didn't realize her out

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.529 
things that I didn't realize her out
there<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.039> we<00:00:53.160> could<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.300> just

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
there that we could do and I just

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.000 
there that we could do and I just
thought<00:00:54.629> they<00:00:54.780> were<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> best<00:00:55.140> best<00:00:55.500> weeks<00:00:55.770> I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
thought they were the best best weeks I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.950 
thought they were the best best weeks I
think<00:00:56.070> mainly<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.940> thought<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.570> wanted<00:00:57.899> to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
think mainly I thought that I wanted to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.930 
think mainly I thought that I wanted to
do<00:00:58.109> photography<00:00:58.620> at<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.800> beginning<00:00:59.190> but<00:00:59.730> my

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
do photography at the beginning but my

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.819 
do photography at the beginning but my
whole<00:01:00.300> thought<00:01:00.719> pattern<00:01:01.109> was<00:01:01.199> completely

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
whole thought pattern was completely

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.590 
whole thought pattern was completely
changed<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.550> I'm<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.000> glad<00:01:03.090> I've<00:01:03.329> done<00:01:03.480> it

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
changed and I'm just glad I've done it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.080 
changed and I'm just glad I've done it
really<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.519> well<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.580> think<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.820> amount<00:01:05.970> of

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
really so well I think the amount of

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.140 
really so well I think the amount of
pathways<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:08.549> good<00:01:08.760> smaller

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
pathways is is really good smaller

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.060 
pathways is is really good smaller
foundation<00:01:09.689> courses<00:01:10.049> don't<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.650> quite<00:01:10.890> so

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
foundation courses don't have quite so

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.160 
foundation courses don't have quite so
many<00:01:11.159> pathways<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:12.479> there's<00:01:12.720> not<00:01:12.869> such<00:01:13.049> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
many pathways so there's not such a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.859 
many pathways so there's not such a
range<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.619> choices<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.159> students<00:01:14.869> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
range of choices for the students the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.179 
range of choices for the students the
other<00:01:15.990> thing<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.290> makes<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.770> unique<00:01:17.009> is

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
other thing that makes it unique is

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.160 
other thing that makes it unique is
being<00:01:17.490> part<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.119> specialist<00:01:18.600> art<00:01:18.840> design

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
being part of a specialist art design

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.320 
being part of a specialist art design
media<00:01:19.439> University<00:01:20.130> College<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
media University College so the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.390 
media University College so the
foundation<00:01:21.780> students<00:01:22.229> can<00:01:22.409> share<00:01:22.920> some<00:01:23.310> of

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
foundation students can share some of

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.859 
foundation students can share some of
the<00:01:23.460> major<00:01:23.670> facilities<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.509> are<00:01:24.630> put<00:01:24.750> in

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the major facilities that are put in

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.300 
the major facilities that are put in
place<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.350> higher<00:01:25.470> education<00:01:25.560> students

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
place for the higher education students

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.359 
place for the higher education students
being<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.930> campus<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.439> university<00:01:29.159> I

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
being on the campus in the university I

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.120 
being on the campus in the university I
find<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.850> think<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.090> really<00:01:30.360> nice<00:01:30.570> AEC<00:01:31.200> B<00:01:31.500> got

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
find I think it's really nice AEC B got

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.950 
find I think it's really nice AEC B got
a<00:01:32.159> nice<00:01:32.340> atmosphere<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.939> think<00:01:33.030> yeah<00:01:33.509> even

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
a nice atmosphere I think yeah even

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.380 
a nice atmosphere I think yeah even
though<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.259> foundations<00:01:35.070> there's<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.119> degree

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
though on foundations there's the degree

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.539 
though on foundations there's the degree
students<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.259> then<00:01:37.530> all<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.220> other<00:01:38.340> stuff

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
students and then all the other stuff

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.310 
students and then all the other stuff
which<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.759> happening<00:01:39.090> their<00:01:39.270> degree<00:01:39.570> shows<00:01:39.840> I

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
which is happening their degree shows I

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.530 
which is happening their degree shows I
really<00:01:41.280> enjoyed<00:01:41.579> like<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> film<00:01:42.090> nights<00:01:42.299> they

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
really enjoyed like the film nights they

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.060 
really enjoyed like the film nights they
have<00:01:42.689> sometimes<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.590> there's<00:01:43.770> actually

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
have sometimes just there's actually

it's<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.400> way<00:03:07.580> to<00:03:07.610> really<00:03:08.030> work<00:03:08.330> out<00:03:08.600> what<00:03:08.780> you
