00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.750
 hello how about how good you are 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.519
 all boys and girls and welcome 6 to 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.930
 youtube channel and healthy captive I am 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.879
 be that you can find me on twitter 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.500
 for roba is nothing 10 and in this video 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.869
 I think for the first time in my history 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.220
 I'm going to do a review of a tweet that 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.750
 maybe I do not recommend to everyone 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.270
 normally I always try to do 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.590
 videos to recommend the best or so 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.880
 less what I like the most and the 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.590
 People who have the same tastes as me 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.240
 Well, you can come to like what I 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.649
 I recommend no but this time I'm going to 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.600
 recommend a tweet that has two 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.309
 versions a version that is free and 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.649
 another version that is paid this tweet 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.570
 I recommend it 100% agree I want 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.730
 qualify this but the paid version 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.649
 perhaps I not recommend everyone 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.930
 First try it for free and if it goes well 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.370
 well perfect if you need a plus os 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.530
 I will explain what the version has 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.239
 of payment for all interested me 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.160
 I bought in your ex choice pro is a 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.690
 paid version is a simple tweet that 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.239
 is available in big box and has a 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.469
 price of $ 1.99 and what 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.149
 true is that at first I thought 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.070
 well then and which one throws the money because 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.140
 it's not worth it either, I'm not 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.570
 original selection the free one that 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.130
 we have always done the same thing but 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.070
 yes it is true that the pro brings us 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.140
 certain options that maybe you 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.700
 you also need and you can 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.680
 be useful that's why I want to introduce you 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.810
 this tweet pro to see you guys 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.100
 Interested in buying it or not buying it now 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.080
 let's see a little bit what he does 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.640
 selection is a tweet that integrates with 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.409
 the keyboard in such a way that when 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.510
 we write anything 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.160
 we can move in this way 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.530
 as you are watching by playing the keyboard 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.840
 we can move the cursor and then here 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.670
 we could adjust what we 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.979
 we wanted or we could erase something that 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.690
 it really seems essential to me 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.880
 at the time of writing because I write 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.080
 very fast at least I try and the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.940
 I'm wrong many times 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.950
 then he hears then to go back with 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.630
 ios normal process is the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.039
 magnifying glass by tapping on the text and such is a 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.289
 roll the truth that I do not like anything and 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.729
 it's quite anti-productive and this tweet 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.200
 it is not done at least the keyboard 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.850
 be more productive at least for me 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.190
 I like what happens that this tweet the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.500
 Pro version gives us certain options 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.030
 check that we in free selection 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.220
 we could in this way move the cursor 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.570
 but in the pro we can do it too 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.489
 but I have it configured so that 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.410
 work from the status bar as 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.090
 I'm seeing in agreement for me it's a 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.290
 little more comfortable especially on the ipad in 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.239
 what's in the status bar is great 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.010
 because it's bigger not here maybe already 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.170
 it's going to like me I like it on the keyboard 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.910
 so that none is written 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.319
 a digital letter but let's see a 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.200
 what are the adjustments of this 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.000
 tweet selection we go to the settings of the 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.440
 system to note that here we have all 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.180
 these new options that the version 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.800
 free we do not have and that can be 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.900
 pretty cool if I really am 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.580
 selection you are a little short and 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.140
 maybe I give some kind of problem to the 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.880
 write as for example to me it happened to me 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.069
 that when I write very fast I get 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.020
 moved the cursor because it was 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.520
 writing super fast that does not usually 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.380
 pass normally but good when it's 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.850
 that is very fast happens and good the truth 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.260
 is that it's a bit uncomfortable, that's why I 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.970
 adjusted to my taste so that I do not go 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.620
 better I'm happy to have it 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.110
 bought this tweet but good maybe 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.760
 some of you may not be necessary not 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.230
 it's a tweet that we can activate it 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.670
 deactivate it with the version but with 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.769
 this option here simply with a 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.049
 triple tap on the button yes on the 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.880
 capital letters no we can also tell you what 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.890
 area is going to be the selectable of the 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.970
 keyboard to move the cursor we can 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.500
 say what the keyboard is going to be 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.819
 full we can simply tell you that 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.230
 is going to be the space bar these 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.000
 options that you are seeing here not 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.620
 besides shots we can adjust the 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.060
 sensitivity and this is something to me that I 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.950
 they liked the pro version very much 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.630
 because the normal version is super fast 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.790
 and maybe sometimes it 's a bit difficult 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.710
 you have to go with very carefully to 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.570
 go when you put the cursor on the point 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.890
 where you want and with this version what 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.930
 we can put instead of normal what 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.240
 we put in reduced and goes more slowly 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.950
 in such a way that it's simpler to 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.800
 adjust the same we could say of 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.300
 sweep speed the speed of the swing of 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.680
 how the course moves could we 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.810
 adjust also in this way what 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.550
 we can put very fast and very slow I 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.110
 as maybe I'm a bit clumsy for 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.060
 adjust and have more precision I like 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.530
 have it at the minimum speed to 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.840
 have more precision adjust it more 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.460
 easily and good to see that later with 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.770
 three fingers then we could select 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.020
 text but this only on the ipad in 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.670
 your selection to select press 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.220
 shift and move the cursor as 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.690
 normally and we select text these 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.820
 they are roughly the only options 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.470
 that has the pro version regarding the 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.450
 Free if you are doing well for free 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.980
 use it for free complicate us if 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.600
 you need a plus because it happens to you like 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.430
 me that when you write very fast the 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.470
 cursor moves you and so it's good 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.970
 maybe from tweet the pro version can 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.489
 be pretty useful for you guys 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.650
 in any case I do not want to cheat you 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.870
 in the free version goes great so 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.550
 I advise 100% that you try it not me 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.900
 you misunderstand but the pro version 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.000
 have these options and I wanted 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.440
 present them in case someone has 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.950
 come a little cut as I tell you the 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.600
 version 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.430
 good guys this has been all I hope 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.630
 that you have liked the review very many 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.520
