00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
trick bike I broke the 60 mile-per-hour

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.860 
trick bike I broke the 60 mile-per-hour
barrier<00:00:12.230> with<00:00:13.230> my<00:00:13.500> star<00:00:14.009> delta<00:00:14.309> motor<00:00:14.570> so<00:00:15.570> I'm

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
barrier with my star delta motor so I'm

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.790 
barrier with my star delta motor so I'm
going<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.080> show<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.470> guys<00:00:16.590> I'm<00:00:16.770> not

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
going to show it to you guys I'm not

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.590 
going to show it to you guys I'm not
going<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.190> obviously<00:00:17.460> it's<00:00:17.880> not<00:00:18.119> going<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.539> do

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
going to obviously it's not going to do

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.640 
going to obviously it's not going to do
a<00:00:18.630> bike<00:00:18.869> run<00:00:19.109> but<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.369> very<00:00:20.430> faster<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.650> have

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
a bike run but it is very faster I have

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.900 
a bike run but it is very faster I have
to<00:00:22.740> figure<00:00:22.920> out<00:00:23.010> how<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.220> properly<00:00:23.580> mount<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
to figure out how to properly mount the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.450 
to figure out how to properly mount the
camera<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.240> there<00:00:24.449> but<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:25.320> extremely<00:00:26.250> fast

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
camera on there but is extremely fast

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:36.670 
camera on there but is extremely fast
i'll<00:00:26.609> show<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.710> my<00:00:28.710> psychoanalyst<00:00:29.039> reading

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.430 

know<00:00:37.680> if<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.040> guys<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.280> see<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:42.260> ok<00:00:43.260> i<00:00:43.290> will

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
know if you guys can see that ok i will

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.779 
know if you guys can see that ok i will
read<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.070> guys<00:00:44.219> cannot<00:00:44.489> see<00:00:44.700> it

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
read to you if you guys cannot see it

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.310 
read to you if you guys cannot see it
but<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:47.610> i<00:00:47.640> would<00:00:47.850> say<00:00:48.000> i<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.180> about<00:00:48.390> ninety

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
but so i would say i was about ninety

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.590 
but so i would say i was about ninety
eighty<00:00:49.559> percent<00:00:50.030> battery<00:00:51.030> when<00:00:51.300> i<00:00:51.329> did<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
eighty percent battery when i did the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
eighty percent battery when i did the
run<00:00:55.039> 160<00:00:56.039> apps<00:00:56.219> pretty<00:00:56.699> much<00:00:56.910> for<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> peak<00:00:57.620> 80

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
run 160 apps pretty much for a peak 80

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:11.359 
run 160 apps pretty much for a peak 80
volts<00:00:58.949> minimum<00:01:03.619> 102<00:01:05.060> km/h<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:09.650> i<00:01:10.650> ended<00:01:11.280> up

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
volts minimum 102 km/h and i ended up

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.039 
volts minimum 102 km/h and i ended up
using<00:01:11.549> where<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.119> did<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.510> with<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.869> road

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
using where I did it on with the road

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.840 
using where I did it on with the road
was<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.619> freshly<00:01:14.100> paved<00:01:14.310> road<00:01:14.580> very<00:01:14.880> flat<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
was a freshly paved road very flat and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.270 
was a freshly paved road very flat and
to<00:01:17.850> me<00:01:17.970> like<00:01:18.180> Ivan<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:19.170> GPS<00:01:19.560> certified<00:01:20.009> but

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
to me like Ivan is not GPS certified but

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.460 
to me like Ivan is not GPS certified but
the<00:01:20.970> cycle<00:01:21.299> analysis<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.720> set<00:01:21.930> properly<00:01:22.140> to

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the cycle analysis is set properly to

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.280 
the cycle analysis is set properly to
the<00:01:22.500> wheel<00:01:22.740> size<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.780> this<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> fastest

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
the wheel size so this is the fastest

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.700 
the wheel size so this is the fastest
I've<00:01:25.409> ever<00:01:25.500> gone<00:01:25.770> awhile<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.850> speed<00:01:27.150> record<00:01:27.299> was

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
I've ever gone awhile a speed record was

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.120 
I've ever gone awhile a speed record was
96<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.070> ending<00:01:29.310> before<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.610> was<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:29.909> 94<00:01:31.100> but<00:01:32.100> I

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
96 and ending before I was like 94 but I

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.819 
96 and ending before I was like 94 but I
felt<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.490> was<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.880> best<00:01:33.030> run<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.829> I

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
felt like this was the best run and I

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:35.810 
felt like this was the best run and I
don't<00:01:35.070> know<00:01:35.130> if<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.280> could<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.520> gone<00:01:35.640> any

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
don't know if I could have gone any

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.370 
don't know if I could have gone any
faster<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.750> stayed<00:01:36.960> let<00:01:37.170> off<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
faster but I just stayed let off the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.130 
faster but I just stayed let off the
throttle<00:01:37.409> eventually<00:01:38.540> i'm<00:01:39.540> scared<00:01:39.869> i'm<00:01:39.990> going

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
throttle eventually i'm scared i'm going

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.639 
throttle eventually i'm scared i'm going
to<00:01:40.229> burn<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.500> my<00:01:40.530> motor<00:01:42.320> 500<00:01:43.320> watt<00:01:43.470> motor

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
to burn on my motor 500 watt motor

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.910 
to burn on my motor 500 watt motor
probably<00:01:44.159> pushing<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.610> lot<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.060> power<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.920> yeah

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
probably pushing a lot of power so yeah

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.550 
probably pushing a lot of power so yeah
there<00:01:47.189> are<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> results

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.510 

and<00:01:54.560> there's<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:54.770> resting<00:01:55.130> voltage<00:01:55.159> the

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
and there's a resting voltage the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.940 
and there's a resting voltage the
battery<00:01:55.850> sits<00:01:56.030> around<00:01:56.150> 90<00:01:56.600> Oh<00:01:56.960> Taylor's

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
battery sits around 90 Oh Taylor's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.490 
battery sits around 90 Oh Taylor's
around<00:01:58.189> 94<00:01:58.640> 95<00:01:59.090> when<00:01:59.360> I<00:01:59.390> did<00:01:59.600> it<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:02.500> I'm

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
around 94 95 when I did it and I'm

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.630 
around 94 95 when I did it and I'm
running<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.860> older<00:02:04.070> version<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.369> second

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
running the older version of second

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.149 
running the older version of second
lines<00:02:04.790> but<00:02:04.939> the<00:02:05.060> battery<00:02:05.210> probably<00:02:05.540> has<00:02:05.810> about

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
lines but the battery probably has about

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.859 
lines but the battery probably has about
2<00:02:07.159> ampere<00:02:07.490> are<00:02:07.640> put<00:02:07.909> through<00:02:07.939> it<00:02:08.239> not<00:02:08.450> actually

2 ampere are put through it not actually

2 ampere are put through it not actually
one<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:11.420> yeah<00:02:13.060> pretty<00:02:14.060> much<00:02:14.150> it
