00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.240 
in this episode we're going to be
looking<00:00:09.599> for<00:00:09.900> at<00:00:09.960> these<00:00:10.139> cards<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.679> graphics

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
looking for at these cards and graphics

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.280 
looking for at these cards and graphics
interface<00:00:11.580> technologies<00:00:12.450> first<00:00:13.049> thing<00:00:13.200> I'm

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
interface technologies first thing I'm

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.350 
interface technologies first thing I'm
going<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.740> do<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.040> remove<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.549> old<00:00:14.759> AGP

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
going to do is remove the old AGP

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.810 
going to do is remove the old AGP
graphics<00:00:15.599> card<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.890> actually<00:00:17.460> an<00:00:17.580> eight

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
graphics card this is actually an eight

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.750 
graphics card this is actually an eight
times<00:00:18.240> AGP<00:00:19.020> graphics<00:00:19.050> card<00:00:19.680> now<00:00:20.189> some

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
times AGP graphics card now some

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.400 
times AGP graphics card now some
graphics<00:00:21.180> cards<00:00:21.539> will<00:00:21.750> have<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> little

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
graphics cards will have a little

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.980 
graphics cards will have a little
security<00:00:23.189> clip<00:00:23.550> at<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> back<00:00:23.939> here<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.960> a

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
security clip at the back here this is a

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.380 
security clip at the back here this is a
fairly<00:00:25.529> old<00:00:25.830> card<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.699> does<00:00:26.820> not<00:00:26.970> have<00:00:27.210> it

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
fairly old card so it does not have it

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.759 
fairly old card so it does not have it
now<00:00:27.660> when<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.050> take<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.349> off<00:00:28.410> you'll<00:00:28.650> also

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
now when you take it off you'll also

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.560 
now when you take it off you'll also
notice<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.519> power<00:00:29.849> connector<00:00:30.210> sitting<00:00:30.449> off

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
notice is a power connector sitting off

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.609 
notice is a power connector sitting off
the<00:00:30.599> back<00:00:30.840> here<00:00:31.019> I've<00:00:31.080> already<00:00:31.230> unplugged

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the back here I've already unplugged

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.560 
the back here I've already unplugged
that<00:00:31.980> but<00:00:32.430> some<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.759> these<00:00:32.850> power<00:00:33.149> connectors

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
that but some of these power connectors

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.270 
that but some of these power connectors
especially<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.079> your<00:00:34.110> graphics<00:00:34.649> card<00:00:34.680> pci

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
especially on your graphics card pci

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.010 
especially on your graphics card pci
express<00:00:35.520> graphics<00:00:35.610> cards<00:00:36.329> actually

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
express graphics cards actually

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.330 
express graphics cards actually
connected<00:00:37.350> directly<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> power<00:00:38.100> supply

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
connected directly to the power supply

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.670 
connected directly to the power supply
so<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.570> hug<00:00:39.750> be<00:00:39.930> back<00:00:40.379> power

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
so you just have to hug be back power

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.709 
so you just have to hug be back power
like<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.730> let's<00:00:42.180> chat<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> little<00:00:42.600> bit

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
like that so let's chat a little bit

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.369 
like that so let's chat a little bit
about<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.290> GP<00:00:43.980> versus<00:00:44.460> pci<00:00:44.850> express<00:00:45.239> he<00:00:46.140> said

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
about a GP versus pci express he said

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.410 
about a GP versus pci express he said
stress<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.100> current<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.700> therefore<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
stress is the current and therefore the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.660 
stress is the current and therefore the
next<00:00:48.719> generation<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.680> graphics<00:00:50.460> technology

like<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:47.970> here<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> total<00:01:49.080> of<00:01:49.140> eight

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
like we have here a total of eight

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.469 
like we have here a total of eight
gigabits<00:01:49.920> per<00:01:50.010> second<00:01:50.550> yeah<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.090> lot<00:01:51.300> of

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
gigabits per second yeah it's a lot of

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.950 
gigabits per second yeah it's a lot of
data<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.500> think<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.920> an<00:01:53.190> AGP<00:01:53.729> eight<00:01:54.600> times

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
data if you think of an AGP eight times

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.020 
data if you think of an AGP eight times
at<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.590> bits<00:01:55.800> per<00:01:55.950> second<00:01:56.369> as<00:01:56.550> you<00:01:56.880> know<00:01:57.000> a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
at to you bits per second as you know a

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.850 
at to you bits per second as you know a
hose<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.690> that's<00:01:57.840> what<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.170> go<00:01:58.290> down<00:01:58.500> too

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
hose and that's what can go down too

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.219 
hose and that's what can go down too
you've<00:01:59.640> got<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.880> think<00:02:00.030> how<00:02:00.210> far<00:02:00.479> pci<00:02:00.960> express

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
you've got to think how far pci express

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.030 
you've got to think how far pci express
in<00:02:01.440> terms<00:02:01.470> of<00:02:01.800> lanes<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.820> thanks<00:02:03.390> yeah<00:02:04.040> 16

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
in terms of lanes so thanks yeah 16

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.649 
in terms of lanes so thanks yeah 16
lanes<00:02:05.280> going<00:02:05.640> down<00:02:05.820> there<00:02:06.060> at<00:02:06.180> each<00:02:06.330> of<00:02:06.540> them

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
lanes going down there at each of them

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.740 
lanes going down there at each of them
carrots<00:02:07.020> point<00:02:07.259> five<00:02:07.470> so<00:02:08.399> yeah<00:02:08.970> total<00:02:09.600> load

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
carrots point five so yeah total load

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.570 
carrots point five so yeah total load
item<00:02:10.110> there's<00:02:10.440> also<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.739> physical<00:02:11.250> difference

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
item there's also a physical difference

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.520 
item there's also a physical difference
between<00:02:11.880> AGP<00:02:12.360> card<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> pci<00:02:13.140> express<00:02:13.440> card

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
the other thing that PCI Express has

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.449 
the other thing that PCI Express has

there<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.340> two<00:03:38.550> card<00:03:38.820> they<00:03:39.000> should

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
there the two card they should

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.180 
there the two card they should
communicate<00:03:39.450> with<00:03:39.990> one<00:03:40.020> another<00:03:40.230> as<00:03:40.680> well<00:03:40.709> as

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
communicate with one another as well as

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.820

the<00:03:46.050> two<00:03:46.200> graphics<00:03:46.560> cards<00:03:46.860> like<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.280> when

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
the two graphics cards like that when

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.460 
the two graphics cards like that when
they<00:03:47.880> actually<00:03:48.030> here<00:03:48.750> in<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:48.990> motherboard<00:03:49.350> so

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
they actually here in the motherboard so

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.630 
they actually here in the motherboard so
they've<00:03:49.590> now<00:03:49.740> that<00:03:49.920> can<00:03:50.040> communicate<00:03:50.610> with

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
they've now that can communicate with

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.520 
they've now that can communicate with
each<00:03:50.850> other<00:03:51.000> using<00:03:51.510> cross<00:03:51.840> files<00:03:52.050> technology

each other using cross files technology

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.250 
each other using cross files technology
now<00:03:53.160> Dib<00:03:53.730> screech<00:03:54.030> you've<00:03:54.150> got<00:03:54.300> two<00:03:54.630> graphics

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
now Dib screech you've got two graphics

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.860 
now Dib screech you've got two graphics
cards<00:03:55.650> as<00:03:55.860> in<00:03:56.160> sli<00:03:56.610> doesn't<00:03:56.970> necessarily<00:03:57.690> mean

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
cards as in sli doesn't necessarily mean

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.690 
cards as in sli doesn't necessarily mean
you<00:03:58.140> get<00:03:58.350> double<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.740> performance<00:03:59.040> you've

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
you get double the performance you've

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.699 
you get double the performance you've
got<00:03:59.880> other<00:04:00.060> limitations<00:04:00.690> like<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.959> CPU<00:04:01.500> the

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
got other limitations like the CPU the

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.920 
got other limitations like the CPU the

playing part of the overall gaming or
system<00:04:07.320> graphics<00:04:08.040> performance<00:04:08.480> so<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:10.110> can

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
system graphics performance so you can

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.860 
system graphics performance so you can
go<00:04:10.769> get<00:04:11.040> SLI<00:04:11.430> but<00:04:11.820> expect<00:04:12.150> about<00:04:12.330> twenty-five

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
go get SLI but expect about twenty-five

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.360 
go get SLI but expect about twenty-five
to<00:04:13.019> thirty<00:04:13.230> percent<00:04:13.500> performance<00:04:13.980> increase

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
for sli or crossfire and the other thing

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.320 
for sli or crossfire and the other thing
to<00:04:19.979> notice<00:04:20.160> that<00:04:20.430> if<00:04:20.580> the<00:04:20.729> life<00:04:20.850> does<00:04:21.090> have<00:04:21.299> a

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
to notice that if the life does have a

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.180 
to notice that if the life does have a
limitation<00:04:22.019> that<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.229> can't<00:04:22.440> have<00:04:22.680> two

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
limitation that you can't have two

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.159 
limitation that you can't have two
margins<00:04:23.850> but<00:04:24.479> I<00:04:24.540> guess<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.810> good<00:04:24.930> thing<00:04:24.990> about

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
margins but I guess the good thing about

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.800 
margins but I guess the good thing about
it's<00:04:25.470> aligned<00:04:25.770> but<00:04:26.130> if<00:04:26.520> you<00:04:26.669> buy<00:04:26.850> an<00:04:27.000> SLI<00:04:27.270> board

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
it's aligned but if you buy an SLI board

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.690 
it's aligned but if you buy an SLI board
you<00:04:28.080> get<00:04:28.229> one<00:04:28.470> card<00:04:28.800> when<00:04:29.040> you<00:04:29.070> can<00:04:29.250> afford<00:04:29.520> it

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
you get one card when you can afford it

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.410 
you get one card when you can afford it
six<00:04:30.000> months<00:04:30.180> later<00:04:30.360> great

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
six months later great

you<00:04:48.700> might<00:04:48.790> want<00:04:48.850> to<00:04:49.150> look<00:04:49.210> for<00:04:49.420> when

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
you might want to look for when

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.820 
you might want to look for when
purchasing<00:04:49.930> a<00:04:50.020> graphics<00:04:50.350> card<00:04:50.380> so<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:50.680> might

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
purchasing a graphics card so you might

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.500 
purchasing a graphics card so you might
get<00:04:50.950> two<00:04:51.160> identical<00:04:51.610> cards<00:04:51.820> as<00:04:52.060> far<00:04:52.270> as<00:04:52.390> the

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
get two identical cards as far as the

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.160 
get two identical cards as far as the
same<00:04:52.750> chipset<00:04:53.500> same<00:04:53.920> GPU<00:04:54.370> yeah<00:04:55.000> but<00:04:55.540> one<00:04:55.990> may

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
same chipset same GPU yeah but one may

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.050 
same chipset same GPU yeah but one may
be<00:04:56.230> overclocked<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:56.890> other<00:04:57.010> one<00:04:57.160> isn't<00:04:57.400> what

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
be overclocked the other one isn't what

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.850 
be overclocked the other one isn't what
an<00:04:58.240> overclocked<00:04:58.690> card<00:04:58.930> is<00:04:59.110> is<00:04:59.290> basically<00:04:59.530> a

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
an overclocked card is is basically a

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.300 
an overclocked card is is basically a
cherry<00:05:00.310> pick<00:05:00.670> GPU<00:05:01.270> and<00:05:01.420> ram<00:05:01.450> yes<00:05:02.260> and<00:05:02.530> they

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
cherry pick GPU and ram yes and they

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.820 
cherry pick GPU and ram yes and they
overclocker<00:05:03.850> beyond<00:05:04.480> the<00:05:04.780> specifications<00:05:05.680> of

typically<00:06:14.830> is<00:06:14.950> built<00:06:15.550> for<00:06:15.760> SLR<00:06:16.210> this<00:06:16.510> is<00:06:16.660> a

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
typically is built for SLR this is a

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.450 
typically is built for SLR this is a
deeper<00:06:17.440> gtx<00:06:17.950> 280<00:06:18.880> from<00:06:19.870> msi<00:06:20.440> so<00:06:20.950> if<00:06:21.130> it's<00:06:21.370> a

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
deeper gtx 280 from msi so if it's a

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.340 
deeper gtx 280 from msi so if it's a
faster<00:06:21.940> car<00:06:22.120> the<00:06:22.300> dps<00:06:22.690> running<00:06:22.930> at<00:06:23.020> faster

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
faster car the dps running at faster

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.530 
faster car the dps running at faster
speeds<00:06:23.380> it<00:06:23.830> has<00:06:24.040> more<00:06:24.280> ram<00:06:24.550> however

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540 
speeds it has more ram however

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.620 
speeds it has more ram however
physically<00:06:26.530> they<00:06:27.190> are<00:06:27.340> identical<00:06:27.550> size<00:06:28.180> the

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
physically they are identical size the

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.750 
physically they are identical size the
same<00:06:28.840> cooling<00:06:29.290> solution<00:06:29.740> on<00:06:29.830> both<00:06:30.010> cards<00:06:30.430> yes

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
same cooling solution on both cards yes

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.910

requirement<00:06:32.460> this<00:06:32.970> particular<00:06:33.210> car<00:06:33.600> probably

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
requirement this particular car probably

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.450 
requirement this particular car probably
would<00:06:34.080> use<00:06:34.620> a<00:06:34.650> little<00:06:34.860> bit<00:06:34.920> more<00:06:35.040> power<00:06:35.310> than

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
would use a little bit more power than

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.890 
would use a little bit more power than
that<00:06:35.610> card<00:06:35.850> as<00:06:36.000> well<00:06:36.030> yeah<00:06:36.540> but<00:06:36.780> I<00:06:36.870> mean

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
that card as well yeah but I mean

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.210 
that card as well yeah but I mean
essentially<00:06:37.320> the<00:06:37.560> design<00:06:37.830> of<00:06:37.860> the<00:06:38.010> card

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
essentially the design of the card

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.430 
essentially the design of the card
itself<00:06:38.340> is<00:06:38.730> the<00:06:38.880> same<00:06:39.120> the<00:06:39.150> GPU<00:06:39.810> on<00:06:39.960> board<00:06:40.230> is

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
itself is the same the GPU on board is

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.470 
itself is the same the GPU on board is

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
graphics card is concerned in the mark

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.120 
graphics card is concerned in the mark
at<00:06:45.660> the<00:06:45.720> moment<00:06:46.020> this<00:06:46.080> is<00:06:46.260> one<00:06:46.590> of<00:06:46.620> the<00:06:46.920> top

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
at the moment this is one of the top

performing card in a single dpu solution

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.700 
performing card in a single dpu solution
so<00:06:51.120> I<00:06:51.150> mean<00:06:51.360> basically<00:06:51.540> best<00:06:52.080> bet<00:06:52.440> for<00:06:52.470> an

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
so I mean basically best bet for an

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.100 
so I mean basically best bet for an
upgrade<00:06:52.830> is<00:06:53.310> the<00:06:53.670> mid-range<00:06:54.000> card<00:06:54.450> where<00:06:55.020> you

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
upgrade is the mid-range card where you

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.110 
upgrade is the mid-range card where you
drive<00:06:55.350> value<00:06:55.800> for<00:06:56.010> money<00:06:56.130> and<00:06:56.340> go<00:06:56.730> for<00:06:57.030> an

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
drive value for money and go for an

drive value for money and go for an
overclocked<00:06:57.660> OC<00:06:58.320> version<00:06:58.830> you<00:06:59.130> can<00:06:59.250> try<00:06:59.460> and

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
overclocked OC version you can try and

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.390 
overclocked OC version you can try and
find<00:06:59.730> one<00:07:00.360> that's<00:07:00.600> you<00:07:00.780> know<00:07:00.870> on<00:07:01.050> sale<00:07:01.320> and<00:07:01.620> you

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
find one that's you know on sale and you

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.220 
find one that's you know on sale and you

know as similar prices the non OC

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.420 
know as similar prices the non OC
version<00:07:04.590> then<00:07:04.710> you<00:07:04.800> know<00:07:04.950> you've<00:07:05.130> got<00:07:05.310> the
