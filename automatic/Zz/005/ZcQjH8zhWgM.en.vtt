00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 very good to leave all your profits 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.640
 recent we are in this new video of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.770
 white 2 we are in a superior that already 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.410
 appreciate it made me want to do or already 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.150
 had to be trusted but and is 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.460
 about the coke mix that a lot of people have 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.529
 asked that like wilco et cetera is 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.420
 because they are but far from me I never 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.640
 I feel a little that I prefer nothing but 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.449
 so there are no misunderstandings 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.090
 simply because I'm going to do what 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.769
 you entity and ex authorial then 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.140
 let's start with the classes we're going to be a 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.699
 little quick all the classes because no 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.779
 I think I'm too long I do not think 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.480
 be very long then let's start 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.610
 fast in the first class we have the dcr 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.950
 which is the class that I most use jointly 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.500
 seen videos then we have the bcr with 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.629
 the computer that gives you more precision 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.550
 this computer more precision and the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.039
 fast charger that is for Basque box 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.510
 order roll with modes you're running already 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.129
 You can recharge faster as 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.750
 rendering a little bit clearer than 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.219
 precision but the truth is that it serves 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.430
 quite in high school we carry the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.649
 gun the tactics of 45 45 with whom 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.750
 they are violent as I have a hard line 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.390
 because I have a hard line because I 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.760
 I use very simple gusts then it 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.140
 makes it very feasible to use if you go to 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.270
 use the very high 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.890
 we use hard line because it is hand 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.350
 put very high if you're starting 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.900
 to show by current I mean 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.460
 them if you train profits 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.830
 very high gusts because you will not get 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.470
 none brings us to hard line and uses 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.210
 that in very simple gusts from a 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.369
 advantage we carry stress hardness forgiveness 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.050
 that stress you unless you are shot 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.530
 of third advantage let's say dexterity that 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.690
 helps the most agile movement is more 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.940
 much more agile with the doll and also 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.490
 then it is to paint this point much more 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.810
 fast and this is extremely important 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.440
 for those who want to be quick shop 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.690
 stressed 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.630
 remember what skill is the most important 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.759
 is the wii sports class the second of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.369
 lethal we carry on the tactical idea 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.259
 we carry the two shock charges leave 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.780
 the second class that he usually uses is 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.429
 the ballista they have used goes ready in 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.950
 improve what you can wish them worth 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:02.580
 be to cook what they want and I carry 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.259
 the cpu 8 and I have the laminated laser sight 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.360
 what he does is give you more possibility 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.800
 that the hip 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.600
 remember that morgan back and modern 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.910
 warfare 2 there was an advantage that 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.830
 called this stable goalkeeper and that a lot 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.860
 trend that was very dirty to use 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.900
 advantage then in this of the contour 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.700
 is that people are not that advantage but 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.180
 We gave the service looks not 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.770
 it's as useful as a stable interest but yes 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.330
 that helps a lot so it's not done 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.250
 with Chinese we do not do extrusion 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.930
 use them to be smarter to know 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.090
 use the complements that the 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.220
 first game in suit we go weight 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.590
 light and the rest that's exactly 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.390
 just like the class now this light 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.250
 so we can move a little faster 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.150
 those who do not like or who 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.320
 feel weird when using the doll very 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.730
 slowly since the sniper usually 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.220
 start a lot then that's why I weigh 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.260
 lightweight eliminates that feeling of going very 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.090
 slowly so for now I see them and 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.530
 let's go to the tutorial of what is the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.820
 twist like you will not notice and 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.400
 I see them in a short time 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.160
 we are back with what is the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.360
 tutorial of the code we are playing in 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.709
 against bots 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.959
 I think there's no problem because they 're 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.020
 pretty pretty bullfighters the bots 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.870
 the recruit is very stupid but they are 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.400
 very rear so I'm daniel and I'm good 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.530
 troll so let's start this fast 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.940
 before they come and they laugh at me all for 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.290
 do a quiz like first is to know 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.599
 what is a cuesco vÃ©lez 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.329
 is to aim and just see the lines 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.329
 crossed of the sight shoots of the tec 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.730
 be quick to join to aim and to 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:34.109
 point shots that's what it would be 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.269
 the quiz for now the correct way to 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.099
 do the quiz with the movement let's say 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:42.450
 in public or when you're never you're 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:45.060
 still is to do this forgiveness is to run 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.840
 stop you very important is to listen 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.980
 run, stop, aim and shoot 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.109
 when you make an opponent is to run to 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.060
 stop you start to shoot do not follow 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.859
 running do not do this that a lot of people 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.230
 he is wrong he runs he runs he runs 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.060
 aims shoots and while continuing to cut that 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.790
 It's wrong because because if you do not stop 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.790
 run and do this did you see set the 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.579
 shot and it comes out very is very deviated the 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.530
 shot then this one does not lose a lot 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.900
 precision doing this the shot though 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.790
 you see even if you make sure you gave him 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.980
 you will not give him this simple one 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:22.550
 then why it is not quite 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.870
 with this since you should not run 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.180
 keep running aim is to be able to 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.590
 that it does not have to be his fucking 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.590
 vengeful mother bastard 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.870
 then the correct way to do it is 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.180
 run, stop, aim and shoot 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.960
 we are a variation that excuse and 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.460
 this bastard is telling against me 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.530
 then excuse me if I'm 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.480
 mistaking in there is a version that 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.980
 called hardtkopp I think this is it 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.660
 called heart scott which is to point to a 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.700
 side pull the sights and shoot 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.620
 that's much more feasible because if you see 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.160
 someone will continue to eat nothing 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.810
 wisco not but by inertia by inertia goes 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.550
 to do this to the whiskey goes already to the 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.230
 sheet where the doll is 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.130
 then the quick for duty is like this 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.570
 front you're running to the ix with age 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.270
 that is what was surveyed now we are going 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:20.770
 with the demonstrations come like that bastard 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.770
 you want to come to us today 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:33.039
 but many times you have to fix the 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:35.429
 that originated to point is a side and you 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.429
 you shoot 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:44.090
 for call attractions 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.090
 and yesterday to 1 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.979
 I do not know I do not know if the rate notice but I 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.810
 pointed to the side and find when they put it 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:57.150
 in slow motion if you are going to see 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.819
 perfectly what he does is that 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.860
 circuit because it covers it front and 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:05.460
 practically that people practically 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.790
 is this is believing to grab the 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.250
 sniper not this one 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.440
 not have love to his kingdom as well 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.120
 say it do not have more revenue because 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.760
 They must take into account that using 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.190
 the sniper will go to work 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.080
 very much your revenue so you 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.280
 you know you can start with bots that the 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.040
 true that they are pretty enough 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.960
 quite worthy I say that about 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.280
 boosted the realities and about 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.900
 a several theory are about 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:36.060
 powered is obviously the machine 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.190
 then this one I'm going to start with bots and 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.720
 after multiplayer although I 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.090
 I would recommend coming is achieved multi game 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.000
 because I do not know I do not like to play against 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.680
 many and good will train against bots 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.610
 I do not know more of the same does not serve me 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.610
 I probably look at nothing 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:07:00.879
 but then I have no doubts and 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.669
 then nothing else is that you 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:05.169
 propose to use be controller and 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:06.759
 already by inertia only going to be 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:08.469
 you quick shop or they can be 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:11.830
 talking for example screams everything with the 

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:14.439
 I work talking and doing this I no longer have 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.729
 bullets and then this one nothing else is going to be 

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:17.499
 it will be custom you are going to go 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:20.080
 accustom and propose to take out the 

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:23.229
 sniper and there's no more no more 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.719
 science of that I came to menen I was wearing this 

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:27.370
 kind of water thank you thank you thank you 

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:28.749
 Well, the people are clear 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.330
 I hope that if they have some liens 

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:33.189
 leave in the comments and this would be 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.050
 everything and the ones in the next video up 

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:36.399
 then I hope you helped them with what 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.860
 is the quick score and then I will do what 

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:41.289
 be what the bank is that is a bit 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.210
 stronger than anything but good they are 

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:45.669
 write in the next topic so the 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.590
 people just grow up self and I do not see it until 

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:50.250
 then 

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.250
 I'm your friend 

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.410
 I am your faithful friend 

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:03.750
 and if one day you find yourself far away 

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.750
 away from you
