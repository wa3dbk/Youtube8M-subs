00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
our genetic information now what did he

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.200 
our genetic information now what did he
use<00:00:14.940> flies<00:00:15.240> did<00:00:16.230> Mendel<00:00:16.560> use<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.890> piece<00:00:17.210> well

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210

wheel we're gonna assume that this is so

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.330 
wheel we're gonna assume that this is so
this<00:02:47.600> isn't<00:02:47.810> exactly<00:02:48.019> this<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.800> not<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.100> cross

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
this isn't exactly this is not the cross

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.650 
this isn't exactly this is not the cross
with<00:02:49.580> these<00:02:49.730> two<00:02:49.910> guys<00:02:50.030> if<00:02:50.300> this<00:02:50.480> is<00:02:50.630> a

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
with these two guys if this is a

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.569 
with these two guys if this is a
recessive<00:02:51.110> allele<00:02:51.290> this<00:02:51.680> would<00:02:51.830> be<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.010> little

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
recessive allele this would be a little

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.810 
recessive allele this would be a little
late<00:02:52.959> so<00:02:53.959> all<00:02:54.530> of<00:02:54.950> these<00:02:55.070> would<00:02:55.280> be<00:02:55.310> little<00:02:55.700> a

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
late so all of these would be little a

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.819 
late so all of these would be little a
big<00:02:56.150> all<00:02:57.079> the<00:02:57.140> way<00:02:57.500> around<00:02:57.799> it<00:02:58.489> bread<00:02:59.120> with

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
big all the way around it bread with

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.979 
big all the way around it bread with
homozygous<00:03:01.329> Wow

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
homozygous Wow

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.640 
homozygous Wow
so<00:03:03.590> what<00:03:03.769> did<00:03:03.890> he<00:03:03.980> get<00:03:04.959> well<00:03:05.959> he<00:03:06.110> got<00:03:06.260> what<00:03:06.470> you

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
so what did he get well he got what you

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.350 
so what did he get well he got what you
would<00:03:06.769> expect

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
would expect

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.090 
would expect
he<00:03:08.360> got<00:03:08.920> all<00:03:09.920> regular<00:03:10.540> flies<00:03:11.540> no<00:03:12.530> me<00:03:12.709> no

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
he got all regular flies no me no

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.840 
he got all regular flies no me no
needles<00:03:13.519> no<00:03:13.790> white<00:03:14.180> eyes<00:03:14.530> so<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:15.799> far<00:03:16.070> looks

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
needles no white eyes so so far looks

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:17.979 
needles no white eyes so so far looks
like<00:03:16.940> this<00:03:17.180> might<00:03:17.360> be<00:03:17.390> right

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
like this might be right

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.840 
like this might be right
the<00:03:18.320> old<00:03:18.440> mand<00:03:19.010> open<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:21.459> what<00:03:22.459> he<00:03:22.519> did<00:03:22.700> is<00:03:22.820> he

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
the old mand open and what he did is he

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.810 
the old mand open and what he did is he
took<00:03:22.970> these<00:03:23.380> new<00:03:24.380> first-generation<00:03:25.100> from<00:03:25.670> the

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
took these new first-generation from the

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.690 
took these new first-generation from the
mutant<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.630> wild<00:03:26.660> type<00:03:27.320> mother<00:03:27.680> read<00:03:28.549> them

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
mutant and wild type mother read them

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.289 
mutant and wild type mother read them
with<00:03:28.880> yet<00:03:29.090> another<00:03:29.799> mutant<00:03:30.799> wild-type<00:03:31.299> that

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
with yet another mutant wild-type that

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.449 
with yet another mutant wild-type that
was<00:03:32.420> important<00:03:32.959> he<00:03:33.079> did<00:03:33.260> this<00:03:33.410> with<00:03:33.470> he<00:03:34.220> didn't

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
was important he did this with he didn't

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.460 
was important he did this with he didn't
just<00:03:34.579> use<00:03:34.730> wonderful<00:03:35.180> Adi<00:03:35.320> obviously<00:03:36.320> he

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
just use wonderful Adi obviously he

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.940 
just use wonderful Adi obviously he
knows<00:03:36.590> them<00:03:36.739> all<00:03:36.890> well<00:03:37.760> not<00:03:38.030> all<00:03:38.209> but<00:03:38.799> do<00:03:39.799> this

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
knows them all well not all but do this

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.830 
knows them all well not all but do this
up<00:03:40.160> obviously<00:03:40.700> more<00:03:40.850> than<00:03:41.030> once

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
up obviously more than once

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.860 
up obviously more than once
so<00:03:42.560> what<00:03:42.800> he<00:03:42.890> did<00:03:43.209> that's<00:03:44.209> a<00:03:44.360> particular

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
so what he did that's a particular

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.760 
so what he did that's a particular
interest<00:03:45.140> to<00:03:45.290> us

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
interest to us

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.670 
interest to us
she<00:03:46.310> took<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.640> females<00:03:47.170> now<00:03:48.170> we're<00:03:48.590> assuming

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
she took the females now we're assuming

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.790 
she took the females now we're assuming
that<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.970> females<00:03:52.300> heterozygous

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
that the females heterozygous

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.880 
that the females heterozygous
that's<00:03:54.800> because<00:03:55.160> homozygous<00:03:59.530> now<00:04:00.530> combined

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
that's because homozygous now combined

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.059 
that's because homozygous now combined
with<00:04:01.040> this<00:04:01.959> according<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.080> this<00:04:03.709> punnett

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
with this according to this punnett

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.910 
with this according to this punnett
square<00:04:04.450> which<00:04:05.450> is<00:04:05.480> what<00:04:05.959> we<00:04:06.110> would<00:04:06.230> expect<00:04:06.380> if

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
square which is what we would expect if

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.059 
square which is what we would expect if
Mendel<00:04:07.610> was<00:04:07.660> completely<00:04:08.660> right<00:04:09.069> this

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
Mendel was completely right this

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.190 
Mendel was completely right this
literally<00:04:10.400> would<00:04:11.150> go<00:04:11.300> across<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:11.870> we<00:04:12.020> would

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
literally would go across and we would

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.940 
literally would go across and we would
get<00:04:12.319> know<00:04:15.669> so<00:04:16.669> know<00:04:16.880> why<00:04:17.060> that<00:04:17.209> flies<00:04:17.950> but

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
get know so know why that flies but

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.510 
get know so know why that flies but
instead<00:04:19.280> what<00:04:19.519> he<00:04:19.640> actually<00:04:20.000> found<00:04:21.490> was<00:04:22.490> that

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
instead what he actually found was that

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.740 
instead what he actually found was that
50%<00:04:23.060> of<00:04:23.480> the<00:04:23.600> males<00:04:23.870> had<00:04:24.440> white<00:04:24.770> eyes

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
50% of the males had white eyes

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:33.100 
50% of the males had white eyes
the<00:04:26.750> other<00:04:26.870> 50%<00:04:27.200> were<00:04:27.650> normal<00:04:28.010> but<00:04:31.750> other<00:04:32.750> 50%

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
the other 50% were normal but other 50%

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.100 
the other 50% were normal but other 50%
is<00:04:33.560> normal<00:04:36.100> this<00:04:37.100> is<00:04:37.220> kind<00:04:37.400> of<00:04:37.430> interesting

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
is normal this is kind of interesting

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.610 
is normal this is kind of interesting
right<00:04:39.110> so<00:04:39.979> if<00:04:40.160> you<00:04:40.280> ignore<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.850> females

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
right so if you ignore the females

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.430 
right so if you ignore the females
it<00:04:42.620> looks<00:04:42.919> like<00:04:46.840> you<00:04:47.840> know<00:04:47.990> it<00:04:48.140> just<00:04:48.169> doesn't

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
it looks like you know it just doesn't

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.610 
it looks like you know it just doesn't
really<00:04:48.680> make<00:04:48.800> sense<00:04:49.450> but<00:04:50.450> know<00:04:51.020> what<00:04:51.500> they

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
really make sense but know what they

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.090 
really make sense but know what they
didn't<00:04:51.950> know<00:04:52.010> at<00:04:52.910> this<00:04:53.120> time

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
didn't know at this time

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.760 
didn't know at this time
was<00:04:56.100> the<00:04:56.220> difference<00:04:56.520> in<00:04:56.640> chromosomes<00:04:57.770> they

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
was the difference in chromosomes they

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.430 
was the difference in chromosomes they
couldn't<00:04:59.400> prove<00:04:59.580> that<00:05:00.170> having<00:05:01.170> a<00:05:01.260> Y

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
couldn't prove that having a Y

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.610 
couldn't prove that having a Y
chromosome<00:05:01.860> who<00:05:02.370> made<00:05:02.610> it<00:05:02.820> was<00:05:03.360> a<00:05:03.390> myth<00:05:03.750> they

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
chromosome who made it was a myth they

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.140 
chromosome who made it was a myth they
were<00:05:04.680> obviously<00:05:04.950> gonna<00:05:05.340> be<00:05:05.430> skeptics<00:05:06.060> you

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
were obviously gonna be skeptics you

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.410 
were obviously gonna be skeptics you
said<00:05:06.560> being<00:05:07.560> male<00:05:07.800> makes<00:05:08.700> this<00:05:08.910> chromosome

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
said being male makes this chromosome

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.930 
said being male makes this chromosome
shorter<00:05:09.870> makes<00:05:10.290> it<00:05:10.470> a<00:05:10.530> Y<00:05:10.620> chromosome<00:05:10.980> so

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
shorter makes it a Y chromosome so

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.780 
shorter makes it a Y chromosome so

in<00:05:19.470> these<00:05:19.710> females<00:05:20.810> there<00:05:21.810> was<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.620> mutant

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
in these females there was the mutant

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.800 
in these females there was the mutant
