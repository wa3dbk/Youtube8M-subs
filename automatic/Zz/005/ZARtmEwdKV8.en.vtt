you change your mind once it's actually
on<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.490> write<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.909> always<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
on you write that always the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.359 
on you write that always the
deal-breaker<00:01:27.960> for<00:01:28.080> me<00:01:28.259> okay<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> next

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
deal-breaker for me okay so for the next

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.670 
deal-breaker for me okay so for the next
one<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.970> chose<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:31.439> one<00:01:31.650> is

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
one I chose this one this one is

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.800 
one I chose this one this one is
definitely<00:01:32.490> more<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> flapper

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
definitely more of like a flapper

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.210 
definitely more of like a flapper
inspired<00:01:34.320> dress<00:01:34.590> which<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.950> thought<00:01:35.100> was

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
inspired dress which I thought was

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.249 
inspired dress which I thought was
perfect<00:01:35.490> since<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:36.000> theme<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.390> Gatsby<00:01:37.020> of

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
perfect since your theme is Gatsby of

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.080 
perfect since your theme is Gatsby of
course<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.189> see<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.400> has<00:01:38.549> all<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> beads

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
course you can see it has all the beads

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.550 
course you can see it has all the beads
but<00:01:39.299> what<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> loved<00:01:39.780> about<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.320> color

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
but what I loved about it is the color

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.080 
but what I loved about it is the color
it's<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.250> little<00:01:41.280> bit<00:01:41.549> more<00:01:41.700> unique<00:01:42.030> than

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
it's a little bit more unique than

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.899 
it's a little bit more unique than
traditional<00:01:42.840> Gatsby<00:01:43.290> colors<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.399> it's<00:01:44.700> still

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
traditional Gatsby colors so it's still

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.460 
traditional Gatsby colors so it's still
your<00:01:45.060> prom<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.509> want<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:45.930> fun<00:01:46.200> with<00:01:46.259> it

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
your prom you want to have fun with it

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.719 
your prom you want to have fun with it
and<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> thought<00:01:47.009> blue<00:01:47.250> would<00:01:47.399> look<00:01:47.520> great<00:01:47.700> on

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
and I thought blue would look great on

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.789 
and I thought blue would look great on
you<00:01:48.000> what<00:01:48.210> do<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.299> think<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.750> love<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.770> love

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
you what do you think I love it you love

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.200 
you what do you think I love it you love
it<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.310> think<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:50.640> gonna<00:01:50.759> fit<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.060> really

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
it I think it's gonna fit you really

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.060 
it I think it's gonna fit you really
nice<00:01:51.420> too<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.200> definitely<00:01:52.829> think<00:01:52.950> you

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
nice too so I definitely think you

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.889 
nice too so I definitely think you
should<00:01:53.100> try<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.790> then<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> last

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
should try that on and then for the last

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.139 
should try that on and then for the last
one<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.470> chose<00:01:55.740> more<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.159> traditional<00:01:56.700> Gatsby

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
one I chose more of a traditional Gatsby

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.690 
one I chose more of a traditional Gatsby
one<00:01:57.329> it's<00:01:57.899> not<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.320> much<00:01:58.469> flapper<00:01:59.189> as<00:01:59.369> much<00:01:59.549> as

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
one it's not so much flapper as much as

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.639 
one it's not so much flapper as much as
that<00:01:59.880> one<00:02:00.090> but<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.420> colors<00:02:00.810> are<00:02:00.840> very<00:02:01.320> very

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
that one but the colors are very very

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.679 
that one but the colors are very very
Gatsby<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.250> me<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.579> think<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.180> gold<00:02:03.390> will<00:02:03.570> look

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
Gatsby to me I think the gold will look

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.270 
Gatsby to me I think the gold will look
great<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.469> know<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:04.829> not<00:02:04.950> more<00:02:05.189> of

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
great on you I know it's not more of

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.160 
great on you I know it's not more of
like<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> traditional<00:02:06.000> prom<00:02:06.329> color<00:02:06.689> but

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
like a traditional prom color but

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.300 
like a traditional prom color but
I<00:02:07.200> think<00:02:07.380> it's<00:02:07.500> still<00:02:07.619> really<00:02:07.860> cute<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.250> of

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
I think it's still really cute and of

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.070 
I think it's still really cute and of
course<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.700> has<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.849> beads<00:02:09.240> just<00:02:09.929> very

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.210 
course it has the beads just very
form-fitting<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.800> think<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.039> gonna<00:02:11.130> look

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
form-fitting and I think it's gonna look

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.860 
form-fitting and I think it's gonna look
great<00:02:11.520> what<00:02:11.730> do<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.880> think<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.300> think<00:02:12.750> it's
