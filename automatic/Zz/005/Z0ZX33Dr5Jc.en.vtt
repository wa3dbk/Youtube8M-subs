regarding coro coro and of course the

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.890 
regarding coro coro and of course the
same<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.069> game<00:00:08.460> freak<00:00:08.760> made<00:00:09.030> about<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.360> couple<00:00:09.840> of

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
same a game freak made about a couple of

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.390 
same a game freak made about a couple of
weeks<00:00:10.139> ago<00:00:10.320> saying<00:00:10.769> that<00:00:10.920> there<00:00:11.099> was<00:00:11.190> going<00:00:11.309> to

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
weeks ago saying that there was going to

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.209 
weeks ago saying that there was going to
be<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.550> new<00:00:12.019> pokemon<00:00:13.019> game<00:00:13.259> coming<00:00:13.710> out<00:00:13.860> now

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
be a new pokemon game coming out now

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.029 
be a new pokemon game coming out now
again<00:00:15.030> we<00:00:15.389> currently<00:00:15.839> do<00:00:16.139> not<00:00:16.170> know<00:00:16.410> whether

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
again we currently do not know whether

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.510 
again we currently do not know whether
it's<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.460> spin<00:00:17.760> off<00:00:17.820> or<00:00:18.150> not<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.779> am<00:00:19.529> guessing

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
it's a spin off or not I am guessing

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.660 
it's a spin off or not I am guessing
that<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.330> most<00:00:21.779> likely<00:00:21.900> not<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.369> be<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
that it is most likely not going to be a

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.630 
that it is most likely not going to be a
mainstream<00:00:24.539> game<00:00:24.990> again<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.039> was<00:00:26.519> talking

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
about this earlier and I know I already

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.960 
about this earlier and I know I already

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
then i'll talk about coro coro here in a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.080 
then i'll talk about coro coro here in a
second<00:00:32.130> because<00:00:32.189> i<00:00:32.430> think<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.669> relates<00:00:32.790> to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
second because i think it relates to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.170 
second because i think it relates to
that<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.710> i<00:00:34.710> don't<00:00:35.219> believe<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:36.000> will

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that but i don't believe that this will

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.270 
that but i don't believe that this will
be<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.329> matron<00:00:36.870> game<00:00:37.079> because<00:00:37.500> Omega<00:00:38.190> Ruby

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
be a matron game because Omega Ruby

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.619 
be a matron game because Omega Ruby
office<00:00:38.610> at<00:00:38.760> far<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.059> hasn't<00:00:39.210> even<00:00:39.360> been<00:00:39.480> out

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
office at far it hasn't even been out

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.900 
office at far it hasn't even been out
for<00:00:39.780> two<00:00:39.870> months<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.489> you<00:00:41.489> got<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.730> keep<00:00:41.760> that

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
for two months so you got to keep that

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.040 
for two months so you got to keep that
in<00:00:42.059> mind<00:00:42.860> it<00:00:43.860> took<00:00:44.160> them<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.640> know<00:00:44.840> it<00:00:45.840> took

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
in mind it took them you know it took

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.319 
in mind it took them you know it took
them<00:00:46.230> about<00:00:46.350> good<00:00:46.860> seven<00:00:47.399> months<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.030> would

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
them about good seven months I would

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.869 
them about good seven months I would
have<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.629> say<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:49.530> them<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.890> release<00:00:50.039> or<00:00:50.579> at

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
have to say for them to release or at

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.569 
have to say for them to release or at
least<00:00:51.120> an<00:00:51.809> ounce<00:00:52.289> Pokemon<00:00:52.860> Omega<00:00:52.890> Ruby<00:00:53.219> adopts

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
least an ounce Pokemon Omega Ruby adopts

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.600 
least an ounce Pokemon Omega Ruby adopts
a<00:00:53.760> far<00:00:53.969> after<00:00:54.480> x<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.930> y<00:00:55.100> again<00:00:56.100> took<00:00:56.430> about

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
a far after x and y again took about

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.319 
a far after x and y again took about
seven<00:00:56.850> months<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.379> would<00:00:58.680> expect<00:00:58.910> for<00:00:59.910> us<00:01:00.120> to

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
seven months so I would expect for us to

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.270 
seven months so I would expect for us to
get<00:01:00.510> actual<00:01:01.440> information<00:01:01.800> about<00:01:02.219> a

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
get actual information about a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.520 
get actual information about a
mainstream<00:01:02.820> game<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.300> would<00:01:03.539> expect<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.199> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
mainstream game I would expect that to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.750 
mainstream game I would expect that to
be<00:01:04.760> around<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.840> time<00:01:07.110> one<00:01:07.380> III<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.040> out<00:01:08.220> I

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
be around the time one III is out I

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.030 
be around the time one III is out I
would<00:01:09.210> expect<00:01:09.570> maybe<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.500> would<00:01:10.619> actually<00:01:10.770> be

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
would expect maybe it would actually be

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.310 
would expect maybe it would actually be
in<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> Nintendo<00:01:12.030> Direct<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.570> could<00:01:13.170> be

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
in the Nintendo Direct it could be

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.530 
in the Nintendo Direct it could be
before<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.400> could<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.850> before<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.420> they

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
before that it could be before that they

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.330 
before that it could be before that they
could<00:01:15.869> announce<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.470> game<00:01:16.650> before<00:01:16.860> e3

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
could announce the game before e3

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.929 
could announce the game before e3
because<00:01:17.939> more<00:01:18.360> than<00:01:18.390> likely<00:01:19.040> coro<00:01:20.040> coro<00:01:20.460> would

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
because more than likely coro coro would

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.749 
because more than likely coro coro would
leak<00:01:21.240> before<00:01:21.570> e3<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.770> did<00:01:22.920> last<00:01:22.950> year<00:01:23.460> so

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
leak before e3 like it did last year so

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.609 
leak before e3 like it did last year so
they<00:01:23.850> could<00:01:24.150> announce<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.720> game<00:01:24.990> before<00:01:25.290> e3

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
they could announce the game before e3

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.219 
they could announce the game before e3
and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.640> say<00:01:26.850> new<00:01:27.330> footage<00:01:27.750> coming<00:01:27.960> soon

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
and then say new footage coming soon

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.960 
and then say new footage coming soon
like<00:01:28.409> ly<00:01:28.590> sure<00:01:28.829> but<00:01:29.009> instead<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.670> show<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
like ly sure but instead just show the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.179 
like ly sure but instead just show the
new<00:01:30.090> footage<00:01:30.420> at<00:01:30.540> e3<00:01:30.689> or<00:01:31.170> they<00:01:31.590> push<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:31.979> back

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
new footage at e3 or they push it back

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.350 
new footage at e3 or they push it back
to<00:01:32.310> next<00:01:32.460> month<00:01:32.759> or<00:01:32.820> something<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.150> but

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
to next month or something like that but

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.760 
to next month or something like that but
I'm<00:01:33.479> pretty<00:01:33.720> sure<00:01:33.990> they<00:01:34.170> would<00:01:34.320> show<00:01:34.530> new

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
I'm pretty sure they would show new

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.620 
I'm pretty sure they would show new
footage<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.909> games<00:01:36.150> at<00:01:36.509> e3<00:01:37.189> so<00:01:38.189> by<00:01:38.850> III<00:01:39.420> we

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.830 
should know when the next mainstream
games<00:01:41.130> are<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:41.460> for<00:01:41.640> coro<00:01:41.909> coro<00:01:42.210> coming<00:01:42.720> out

game<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.110> going<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.380> be<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.740> I'm<00:01:46.829> expecting<00:01:47.369> it

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
game is going to be and I'm expecting it

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.249 
game is going to be and I'm expecting it
to<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.700> spin-off<00:01:48.030> I'm<00:01:48.329> not<00:01:48.540> exactly<00:01:48.780> sure<00:01:48.960> as

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
to be a spin-off I'm not exactly sure as

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.039 
to be a spin-off I'm not exactly sure as
to<00:01:49.290> what<00:01:49.649> kind<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.130> game<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.340> going<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.759> be<00:01:51.049> but

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
to what kind of game is going to be but

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.690 
to what kind of game is going to be but
I<00:01:52.079> am<00:01:52.229> expecting<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.189> spin-off<00:01:53.549> and

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
I am expecting it to be a spin-off and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.810 
I am expecting it to be a spin-off and
we<00:01:53.880> should<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.329> able<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.750> see<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.110> soon<00:01:55.680> uh<00:01:56.340> it

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
we should be able to see it soon uh it

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.389 
we should be able to see it soon uh it
should<00:01:57.479> come<00:01:58.320> out<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:58.799> within<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.219> next

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
should come out you know within the next

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.370 
should come out you know within the next
couple<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.820> days<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.030> would<00:02:00.689> assume<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.229> they

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
couple of days I would assume that they

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.859 
couple of days I would assume that they
would<00:02:01.560> announce<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:02.060> sometime<00:02:03.060> next<00:02:03.390> week

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
would announce it sometime next week

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.830 
would announce it sometime next week
when<00:02:04.290> coro<00:02:04.860> coro<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.520> officially<00:02:06.329> supposed<00:02:06.719> to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
when coro coro is officially supposed to

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.680 
when coro coro is officially supposed to
go<00:02:07.020> out<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.469> believe<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.550> next<00:02:08.910> thursday

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
go out I believe that the next thursday

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.199 
go out I believe that the next thursday
so<00:02:09.890> that's<00:02:10.890> when<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.190> would<00:02:11.400> expect<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.090> be

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
so that's when I would expect it to be

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.620 
so that's when I would expect it to be
out

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
out

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.560 
out
it<00:02:13.590> might<00:02:13.860> not<00:02:14.040> be<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.610> could<00:02:14.760> be<00:02:14.940> after<00:02:15.360> or

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
it might not be it could be after or

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.970 
it might not be it could be after or
later<00:02:15.840> but<00:02:16.170> they<00:02:16.320> announced<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.800> they're

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
later but they announced that they're

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.500 
later but they announced that they're
going<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.220> put<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.400> new<00:02:17.610> game<00:02:17.850> out<00:02:18.120> or<00:02:18.360> their

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
going to put a new game out or their

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.780 
going to put a new game out or their
they<00:02:18.870> announced<00:02:19.200> they<00:02:19.530> were<00:02:19.830> announcing<00:02:20.550> a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
they announced they were announcing a

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.780 
they announced they were announcing a
new<00:02:21.030> game<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:22.020> know<00:02:22.200> two<00:02:22.920> weeks<00:02:23.130> ago<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.730> I

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
new game you know two weeks ago so I

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.640 
new game you know two weeks ago so I
would<00:02:23.970> assume<00:02:24.060> it'd<00:02:24.510> be<00:02:24.660> sometime<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.380> week

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
would assume it'd be sometime this week

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.320 
would assume it'd be sometime this week
when<00:02:25.890> coro<00:02:26.220> coro<00:02:26.520> supposed<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.000> feel<00:02:27.150> now

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
when coro coro supposed to feel now

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.390 
when coro coro supposed to feel now
again<00:02:28.140> we<00:02:28.260> don't<00:02:28.500> know<00:02:28.650> if<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.040> game<00:02:29.250> is

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
again we don't know if that game is

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.460 
again we don't know if that game is
actually<00:02:29.520> going<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.000> be<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.630> coro<00:02:30.900> coro<00:02:31.170> but

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
actually going to be and coro coro but

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.050 
actually going to be and coro coro but
at<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.860> same<00:02:32.070> time<00:02:32.250> for<00:02:32.490> me<00:02:32.610> what<00:02:32.790> not<00:02:32.910> it

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
at the same time for me what not it

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.540 
at the same time for me what not it
would<00:02:33.150> make<00:02:33.360> sense<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:34.830> kind<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.160> like<00:02:35.340> what

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
would make sense it kind of like what

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.220 
would make sense it kind of like what
they<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.820> know<00:02:35.850> did<00:02:36.150> with<00:02:36.270> pokémon<00:02:36.510> about

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
they you know did with pokémon about

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.440 
they you know did with pokémon about
Rosie<00:02:37.560> now<00:02:37.740> at<00:02:37.860> rosie<00:02:38.340> rosie<00:02:38.520> was<00:02:39.150> actually

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
Rosie now at rosie rosie was actually

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.810 
Rosie now at rosie rosie was actually
never<00:02:39.720> in<00:02:39.990> Coral<00:02:40.380> coral<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.890> was<00:02:41.340> never<00:02:41.580> in

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
never in Coral coral it was never in

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.730 
never in Coral coral it was never in
there<00:02:42.000> instead<00:02:42.450> for<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.930> month<00:02:43.200> they<00:02:43.500> had

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
there instead for that month they had

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.040 
there instead for that month they had
diancie<00:02:44.220> instead<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.150> they<00:02:45.630> officially

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
diancie instead and they officially

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.140 
diancie instead and they officially
announced<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:46.860> antsy<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.250> who<00:02:47.610> knows<00:02:47.790> we<00:02:48.000> could

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
announced I antsy so who knows we could

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.090 
announced I antsy so who knows we could
actually<00:02:48.330> see<00:02:48.810> Hoopa<00:02:49.200> sooner<00:02:49.530> or<00:02:49.680> later<00:02:49.800> and

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
actually see Hoopa sooner or later and

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.830 
actually see Hoopa sooner or later and
that<00:02:50.580> would<00:02:50.670> be<00:02:50.790> pretty<00:02:50.970> nice<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.450> be<00:02:51.570> able<00:02:51.660> to

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
that would be pretty nice to be able to

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.870 
that would be pretty nice to be able to
use<00:02:52.050> hoopla<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.650> it's<00:02:52.830> unbound<00:02:53.250> form<00:02:53.610> and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
use hoopla and it's unbound form and

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.570 
use hoopla and it's unbound form and
Wi-Fi<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.480> whatnot<00:02:54.810> who<00:02:55.620> knows<00:02:55.830> has<00:02:56.070> how<00:02:56.370> long

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
Wi-Fi and whatnot who knows has how long

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.220 
Wi-Fi and whatnot who knows has how long
you<00:02:56.760> know<00:02:56.880> that<00:02:57.030> event<00:02:57.330> would<00:02:57.480> take<00:02:57.750> but<00:02:58.020> I

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
you know that event would take but I

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.700 
you know that event would take but I
would<00:02:58.380> assume<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.550> Hoopa<00:03:00.000> event<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.720> going

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
would assume that a Hoopa event is going

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.260 
would assume that a Hoopa event is going
to<00:03:01.770> be<00:03:01.890> happening<00:03:02.130> here<00:03:02.580> sooner<00:03:03.000> or<00:03:03.150> later

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
to be happening here sooner or later

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.570 
to be happening here sooner or later
within<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.780> next<00:03:03.960> month<00:03:04.080> or<00:03:04.470> two<00:03:04.710> so<00:03:05.070> also

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
within the next month or two so also

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.430 
within the next month or two so also
keep<00:03:05.760> out<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.090> line<00:03:06.240> for<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.630> I'm<00:03:07.260> not

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
keep out in line for that I'm not

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.290 
keep out in line for that I'm not
exactly<00:03:07.740> sure<00:03:07.950> as<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.220> what<00:03:08.490> to<00:03:08.640> expect<00:03:09.090> from

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
exactly sure as to what to expect from

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.390 
exactly sure as to what to expect from
coro<00:03:09.810> coro<00:03:10.080> over<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.650> next<00:03:10.890> couple<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.220> days

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
coro coro over the next couple of days

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.480 
coro coro over the next couple of days
but<00:03:11.730> i<00:03:11.790> would<00:03:11.970> expect<00:03:12.210> maybe<00:03:13.160> just<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.340> new

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
but i would expect maybe just the new

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.460 
but i would expect maybe just the new
spin-off<00:03:14.910> game<00:03:15.180> if<00:03:15.390> not<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.990> then<00:03:16.020> maybe

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
spin-off game if not that then maybe

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.500 
spin-off game if not that then maybe
having<00:03:16.980> something<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.400> do<00:03:17.550> with<00:03:17.670> who<00:03:17.820> but<00:03:18.060> it's

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
having something to do with who but it's

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.060 
having something to do with who but it's
always<00:03:18.780> usually<00:03:19.050> something<00:03:19.470> interesting

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
always usually something interesting
