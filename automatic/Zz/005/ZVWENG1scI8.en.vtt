00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.460
 homemade electric bicycle 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.690
 it's a normal simple bicycle with a 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.920
 simple frame 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.920
 like any bicycle 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.539
 it works 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.619
 base 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.680
 of a motor of an electric drill the 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.150
 which one is going 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:34.480
 in the frame introduced in the part 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.860
 internal a box that is extended a 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.510
 little to be able to fit the 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.220
 transmission 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.370
 the batteries come 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.520
 the 12 volt batteries can be 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.310
 place lithium so that they last longer and 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.280
 comes with a switch that can be 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.710
 place at some time in the part where 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.430
 the person thinks more convenient to 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.430
 press the button 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.909
 the engine of the polis of the salted 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.270
 is driven in a transmission that already 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.539
 I will teach how 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.080
 they have an approximate duration of 30 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.940
 kilometer 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.770
 if people want to give more 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.570
 speed or less speed will be 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.190
 Applies to bicycle changes 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.070
 and brings speeds are from d 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.070
 of the changes that the person wants 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.070
 apply it 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.030
 simple normal 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.240
 we are going to teach here 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.460
 of what is composed is a drill 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.909
 electrical which was dismantled to 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:02.850
 to be able to remove the pieces inside the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:05.750
 motor the shaft this is where goes the the 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.750
 box where it goes 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.700
 where the pacha the pacha goes down and this 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.110
 It is the internal box that helps us 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.440
 that the engine does not work at all times 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.860
 this part of here 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.030
 that the one on the polisher gets the 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.080
 crown and the breakwater 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:33.130
 the crown and the style which the crown 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.640
 is introduced in the axis that goes in the 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.690
 bicycle case 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.290
 all this is what composes from 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.270
 a polisher and an electric drill 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.730
 make up the scaffolding of the bicycle is 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.709
 very easy to make is homemade very cheap 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.620
 the switch is a rotating tente 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.159
 anyone 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.150
 you can get it somewhere in 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:03.160
 a hardware store very simple to make the 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.670
 bicycle is totally autonomous 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.650
 you can 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.290
 and mud for any side can 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.220
 apply it to an SUV or one of 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.220
 route as you
