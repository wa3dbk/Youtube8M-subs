00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
in from one end I'm going to close it

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.780 
in from one end I'm going to close it
and<00:01:51.330> bring<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> wire<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.380> little<00:01:52.860> past<00:01:53.250> 90

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
and bring the wire a little past 90

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.460 
and bring the wire a little past 90
degrees<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:55.250> can<00:01:56.250> then<00:01:56.400> make<00:01:56.580> four<00:01:57.000> turns

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470

gently<00:02:07.970> pushing<00:02:08.300> on<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.509> tag<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:08.960> I'm<00:02:09.590> going

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
gently pushing on the tag and I'm going

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.280 
gently pushing on the tag and I'm going
to<00:02:09.860> bend<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.280> back<00:02:10.550> so<00:02:11.030> it's<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.270> 90<00:02:11.750> degrees<00:02:12.080> to

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
to bend it back so it's a 90 degrees to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.830 
to bend it back so it's a 90 degrees to
the<00:02:12.320> twists<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.040> also<00:02:13.760> straighten<00:02:14.540> up<00:02:14.720> the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
the twists and also straighten up the

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.310 
the twists and also straighten up the
length<00:02:15.050> I<00:02:15.520> can<00:02:16.520> now<00:02:16.640> bend<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.120> tag<00:02:17.420> around<00:02:18.110> the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
length I can now bend the tag around the

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:35.000 
length I can now bend the tag around the
shaft<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:19.280> make<00:02:19.310> four<00:02:19.820> bar<00:02:20.210> wraps

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.070 

by<00:02:36.010> making<00:02:36.190> another<00:02:36.610> Bend<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:37.180> can<00:02:37.570> form<00:02:37.930> a

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
by making another Bend I can form a

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.560 
by making another Bend I can form a
handle<00:02:38.500> which<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.340> can<00:02:39.460> use<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.880> rock<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.360> wire
