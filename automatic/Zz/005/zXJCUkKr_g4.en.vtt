00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 Halli hello to him a little later than imagined 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.120
 I want to give you an overview today 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.400
 give about the news of p2 because 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.559
 I see you have a lot of them 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.130
 get sent and we do 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.779
 now virtually our own p2 walls 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.980
 and I'll show you switches and mine 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.980
 opinion on the new products 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.410
 we catch with the perfect face cried 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.930
 in the prime loose powder 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.879
 this is actually a relatively normal one 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.920
 powder transparent hold relatively so 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.010
 that you can spread that very well 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.410
 So there's nothing special to say 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.870
 Next we have the all in one 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.730
 from fashion compact foundation and me 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.620
 I must say that's not so good 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.600
 fallen that was really very hard 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.449
 I am well the compact foundation 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.039
 but has very dry on the skin 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.320
 seen so if you have oily skin 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.960
 maybe it's something for you otherwise 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.350
 even that neele new compact power 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.450
 that was relatively relinquish what I liked 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.439
 was that it had a seal that can 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.270
 Do not see her here now 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.010
 So there you have to look 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.439
 I'm not that the foundation 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.450
 Aunt of all the core products has me 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.840
 actually this make up the best 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.460
 liked it had one of the power 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.740
 was not particularly high now but has 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.150
 covered quite well and that was now 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.310
 a color for me a little bit too 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.729
 was dark but just look at 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.890
 Definitely a highlight for me 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.530
 the total madlib greens this is one 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.329
 very great texture looks at first moment 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.310
 not so dull as it is then 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.799
 but afterwards is when you order 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.170
 you notice almost nothing of it is it 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.140
 a very light trainer and it holds 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.009
 really very very long so very whole 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.009
 great product 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.619
 where I was very much looking forward to it 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.950
 to try the primer base of p2 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.390
 she looks like we are her 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.140
 immediately applied on the hand like the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.690
 tk primer push there I have to 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.480
 certainly test something further 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.400
 because a first test was right 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.709
 sobering you see the same if I 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.049
 The eyeshadow swatch is on it 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.160
 and in the eye shadow it is 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.110
 of course, also different 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.569
 Eyeshadow can not show one 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.500
 version of the hype eyeshadow with a 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:32.500
 I say wonderful 3d printing 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.450
 then there is the ultra mattheis shadows 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.739
 all shadows now have primer in vienna 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.200
 in there I ask myself what is there for 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.480
 then another base , too 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.069
 really very very tired so not so 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.769
 as with patrice that they are a bit like that 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.739
 are more sides are also for math 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.150
 eyeshadows are relatively unhappy 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.739
 the new color from 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.690
 I have to say that was what I thought 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.650
 actually on and most exciting of 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:01.150
 all eyeshadow yes normal 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.340
 Eyeshadows are very clear to me 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.139
 the highlight is the intense atis 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.600
 price segments this in i believe 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.859
 will be a total of six colors, the 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.170
 really have a weird one 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:14.079
 consistency as if pigments had themselves 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.819
 I was very tired and very wet 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.280
 have you now of all four 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.040
 eyeshadow malt watches made below 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.079
 you see the base and top without base and 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.549
 You can see that you are not so good 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.750
 like no difference as I said that 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.989
 I have to test 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.850
 I found the pigment right here 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.269
 right at the front is best 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:37.870
 Krombach okay was relatively flashing light yes 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.660
 the mat is also okay but yes all 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.049
 only the pigment really has me there 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.030
 truly another convinced 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.170
 lipgloss series are the ultimate vinyl 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.139
 lip gloss 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.880
 they are slightly shiny but now too 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.380
 not so totally wrong 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.609
 I thought only in this color 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.319
 oh my god who wants to be such a 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.910
 liver sausage on the lip but make as 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.900
 I then applied it was even 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.319
 very nice 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.390
 it tends to be a bit 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.819
 unevenly distributed 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.530
 but measured by the price of the 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.480
 this lip gloss has that is absolutely in 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.520
 order 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.670
 That's what it looked like, so it is 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.739
 a very solid product really 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.720
 I was surprised by the perfect duo 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.169
 highlighter this is a pen where you 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.510
 have a matte rosalie side and one 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.730
 the slightly more shines the shiny one 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.080
 I did not like her page 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.550
 See that later I have that too 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.250
 but applied to the eyelid 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.290
 really nice is the matte side unfortunately 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.630
 the camera hit this effect but me 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.580
 had the following one 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.530
 order the eyelashes mascara in the 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.980
 applied angle and in real that is 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.990
 so great out so great that you can from 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.180
 the extreme volume lashes mascara 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.220
 really do not say cause I have them 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.810
 along with the sparkle star the now 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.700
 the same descendants apply the 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.860
 sparkling star actually has better 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.350
 volume eyelashes made as these 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.690
 this is a total fail sparkling star 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.700
 should be small flitzer pigments in the 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.620
 mascara have the packaging looks 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.110
 beautiful from a bit is relative 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.220
 normal but also there I can you already 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.040
 say did not work at all 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.200
 and here you see that with the 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.500
 long eyelashes sparkle left there on the 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.700
 eyelid I now have the highlighter 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.950
 applied and just in the pen 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.330
 Augenwinkel and I'll tell you this 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.030
 you really have to see it coming 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:28.360
 unfortunately not over here as well 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:31.120
 just like with essence there is one and 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.030
 Patrice can therefore be transparent 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.590
 lipliner is really very practical 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.169
 and I found the consistency here 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.940
 i was really good as well 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.530
 still testing the hai intense maxi 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.600
 Lipstick I had first suspected that 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.770
 that will be a kind felt pens 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.410
 but they are just in one 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.930
 Felt-tip shaped mold is poured 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.120
 quite solid lipstick not quite 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.220
 so covering but that is for many of 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.470
 you also okay and I found this 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.070
 Metallic finish what you have then 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.320
 also really nice because we have 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.970
 even the blood touch bursts also found that 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.490
 I was quite solid it was a beautiful one 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.020
 color also this office promise something 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.780
 you have that kind of look 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.700
 at the same swatch that came is already out 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.400
 was also very nice to apply 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.190
 not too little pigmented not too doll 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.990
 So that's one absolutely every product 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.690
 which I personally liked very much 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.150
 but not quite as good as the 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.699
 patrice illuminaten blanches me there 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.380
 still liked much better and 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:32.680
 then I had a nail polish off 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:36.340
 the limmat series there you see the finish 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.020
 I also found it very exciting yes 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.789
 and here we have mine again 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.130
 highlights that I think so too 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:43.780
 I've heard something a little bit 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.130
 Recommend you there and if you now 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.080
 will not be up to date 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.940
 I have you all down here again 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:53.880
 news linked in this sense say 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.880
 I'll just co euro until next time
