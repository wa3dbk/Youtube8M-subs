Recently in our “Exploring the 18th Century”
series, we’ve been discussing chemical leavening

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.759
and then going in depth into that topic. Today
we’ll be starting a companion series of

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.050
cooking episodes that goes with that. Thanks
for joining us today on 18th Century Cooking

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:25.960
with James Townsend and Son.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.120
The recipe today is called a Christmas cookie.
It’s from Amelia Simmons’ 1796 cookbook,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.550
American Cookery. It’s very interesting
here, a couple of different things. The first

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.559
thing is that it’s called a Christmas cookie.
It’s not something you normally see in an

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.280
English cookbook. This is an American cookbook.
She’s definitely got some Dutch influence

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.461
here. You can also tell not only by Christmas
being included in it, which isn’t a normal

00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:59.600
kind of big celebration in the 18th century
for English, but also the word cookie, which

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.220
is a reference to the Dutch word koekje, or
their version of a cookie, and the third interesting

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.750
thing about this recipe is that it uses pearl
ash as the leavening agent and we have a pearl

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.720
ash here. It’s an item that we’ve started
carrying at the store. We have this available

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.560
in little 2 ounce packages, so you can experiment
with pearl ash too. Pearl ash is a refinement,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.170
or a component of the alkaline potash, which
is extracted from burning trees or other vegetable

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.540
matter. It’s typically used in soap making
and in dyeing and other industrial processes,

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.130
but when this alkaline component is mixed
with an acid in baking, you get a leavening

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.670
effect.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.579
Now this recipe is a very simple one. We start
off with 3 ½ cups of flour. To our flour,

00:01:52.579 --> 00:02:04.829
we will add 1 cup of sugar and 3 tablespoons
of powdered coriander. For a lighter texture,

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:16.260
I will rub in about 10 ounces of butter into
our floured mixture. Our wet ingredients are

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.900
very simple. I have 1 ¼ cup of sour milk.
If you don’t have sour milk, you can take

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.010
regular milk and add, say, a tablespoon of
lemon juice or vinegar to that. To our sour

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.680
milk, let’s add ½ a teaspoon of our pearl
ash. It needs to completely dissolve before

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:48.160
we add it into our dry ingredients.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:57.160
Once this is mixed well, it should be kneaded
5-10 minutes. If it’s too moist, add a little

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:08.620
extra flour.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:16.930
Once we’re done kneading this, we can roll
it out to ½ inch or ¾ of an inch thick.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:26.659
Once you’ve got it rolled out, you can cut
this into any shape you like. I’m just going

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.080
to cut simple rectangles.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:36.599
Today, let’s bake these in a new product
that we haven’t used before in the kitchen.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:43.320
Here is our little reflector oven. This is
very similar to reflector ovens you see in

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.480
the 19th century and we think they go back
to the 18th century, but we’re not really

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.569
quite sure exactly how far back they go. This
is a perfect little tool for baking little

00:03:52.569 --> 00:04:16.320
items like this. In a home oven, you can bake
these at about 325 for, say, 25 minutes.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.759
Notice the wonderful crumb. This pearl ash
makes a wonderful light and fluffy cookie.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:28.060
These look great. I’m sure they taste great.
Let’s try them out.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.740
Mmm, wow, that coriander flavor, completely
different than what you’re probably used

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:44.280
to. Very light and fluffy. These aren’t
too chewy. They smell really nice. You should

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.150
try these cookies out.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.050
