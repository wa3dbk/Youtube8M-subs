00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.380
 good day academy welcome you 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.449
 in this short we present aspects 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.789
 relevant to our new course of 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.510
 basic inventor in videos available to 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:35.090
 from the first of July 2012 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.090
 first familiarization with the interface 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.770
 obvious can I 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.770
 grating with the right mouse button 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.500
 automatically the 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.329
 tool for creation of new 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.110
 sketch let's do it again 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.800
 key expressions 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.790
 Thunderbolt 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.699
 and look at the icon that I saw 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.369
 it says what plane I should select for 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.060
 create the new sketch I'm going to create it in 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.060
 this face 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.640
 second extrusion functionalities 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.510
 die 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.120
 third functionalities of revolution 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.200
 let's place is between two faces 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.440
 between two faces will allow a face 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.810
 of start and a final face in the in the 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.959
 which in the same revolution we are 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.160
 making them soften with the 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.160
 desired surfaces 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.160
 fourth its elevation 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.230
 then choose the ok tool 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.310
 for this sweep I'm going to do is catch 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.310
 the first section 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.850
 fifth parameterized 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.300
 so what are we achieving in this 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.350
 moment we are achieving that the 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:07.660
 keyboard regeneration be in accordance with 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.660
 the width of the keyboard 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.030
 then now let's do a test 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.030
 let's change the width of the phone 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.580
 to see if our formula goes 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.330
 working 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.360
 the next 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.400
 see that at this moment the width of 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.280
 the keys is in accordance with the width of the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.620
 telephone but the total width of the 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.080
 social keys of the distribution in the 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.900
 phone still has not moved because 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.420
 because we have not edited the definition 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.110
 of width in the rectangular hotel 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.630
 then we also have to review 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.380
 this operation to finish 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.380
 parameterize 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.280
 Y 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.250
 How did you like them and we hope that there 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.910
 been to your liking 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.520
 remember that these are just some of 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:52.150
 the topics of the course content 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.780
 we invite you to academic www dotcom 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.270
 wd to know how to access a 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.410
 Trial a week 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.410
 we wait until soon
