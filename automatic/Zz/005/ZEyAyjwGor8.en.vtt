that helpful ground war like people are

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:34.149 
that helpful ground war like people are
always<00:01:32.990> moving<00:01:33.409> it's<00:01:33.740> not<00:01:33.829> like<00:01:33.950> they're

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
always moving it's not like they're

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.769 
always moving it's not like they're
gonna<00:01:34.219> pinpoint<00:01:34.759> you<00:01:34.819> on<00:01:34.909> a<00:01:34.939> map<00:01:35.179> you<00:01:35.689> know

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
exactly so I like using toughness

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.669

because<00:01:37.579> it<00:01:37.849> key<00:01:38.450> gunfights<00:01:38.899> always<00:01:39.319> happen

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
because it key gunfights always happen

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:40.749 
because it key gunfights always happen
when<00:01:39.829> you're<00:01:39.950> on<00:01:40.039> high<00:01:40.159> streaks<00:01:40.520> and
