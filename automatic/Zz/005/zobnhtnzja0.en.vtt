00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.870 

it's<00:00:10.290> fair<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.590> say<00:00:10.769> that<00:00:10.800> sometimes<00:00:11.490> things

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
it's fair to say that sometimes things

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.430 
it's fair to say that sometimes things
don't<00:00:12.240> go<00:00:12.360> exactly<00:00:12.630> as<00:00:12.960> planned

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
don't go exactly as planned

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.499 
don't go exactly as planned
and<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.950> think<00:00:14.250> today<00:00:14.460> was<00:00:14.639> one<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.820> those<00:00:15.000> days

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
and I think today was one of those days

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.580 
and I think today was one of those days
so<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.710> maiden<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.430> epic<00:00:17.730> 79<00:00:18.119> buffalo<00:00:18.590> did

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
so the maiden to the epic 79 buffalo did

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.980 
so the maiden to the epic 79 buffalo did
definitely<00:00:19.920> not<00:00:20.250> go<00:00:20.340> as<00:00:20.400> planned<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.910> I'm<00:00:21.420> not

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
definitely not go as planned and I'm not

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.890 
definitely not go as planned and I'm not
entirely<00:00:22.439> sure<00:00:22.560> why<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.689> Penta<00:00:24.689> part<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
entirely sure why so Penta part the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.120 
entirely sure why so Penta part the
reason<00:00:25.019> putting<00:00:25.380> out<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.619> video

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
reason putting out this video

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.310 
reason putting out this video
but<00:00:26.550> pretty<00:00:27.510> much<00:00:27.599> show<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.869> crash<00:00:28.050> anyway

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
but pretty much show the crash anyway

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.650 
but pretty much show the crash anyway
it's<00:00:28.470> just<00:00:28.529> one<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.830> those<00:00:28.920> things<00:00:29.510> but<00:00:30.510> let's

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
it's just one of those things but let's

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.950 
it's just one of those things but let's
let's<00:00:31.170> take<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.439> through<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.859> see<00:00:32.070> if

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
let's take you through it and see if

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.389 
let's take you through it and see if
everybody<00:00:33.960> else<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.350> come<00:00:34.739> work<00:00:34.890> out<00:00:35.100> what

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
everybody else can come work out what

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.500 
everybody else can come work out what
I'm<00:00:35.489> doing<00:00:35.520> wrong<00:00:35.790> because<00:00:35.910> I'm<00:00:36.120> not<00:00:36.270> actually

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
I'm doing wrong because I'm not actually

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.580 
I'm doing wrong because I'm not actually
sure<00:00:36.690> about<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:38.270> so<00:00:39.270> at<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.750> start<00:00:39.960> here<00:00:40.200> we've

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
sure about it so at the start here we've

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.299 
sure about it so at the start here we've
got<00:00:41.210> my<00:00:42.210> Fred<00:00:42.450> Neil<00:00:42.690> or<00:00:42.989> crikey<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.649> YouTube<00:00:43.950> as

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
got my Fred Neil or crikey on YouTube as

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.010 
got my Fred Neil or crikey on YouTube as
you<00:00:44.489> see<00:00:44.670> he's<00:00:44.850> got<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.719> goal<00:00:45.870> of

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
you see he's got the the goal of

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.840 
you see he's got the the goal of
protection<00:00:46.559> which<00:00:47.010> shouldn't<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.610> confused

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
protection which shouldn't be confused

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.000 
protection which shouldn't be confused
by<00:00:48.210> regarding<00:00:49.140> life<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.710> found<00:00:49.860> on

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
by regarding life that I just found on

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.779 
by regarding life that I just found on
my<00:00:50.100> shed<00:00:50.309> at<00:00:50.430> all<00:00:51.530> we<00:00:52.530> went<00:00:53.070> through<00:00:53.250> we

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
my shed at all we went through we

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.389 
my shed at all we went through we
checked<00:00:54.210> our<00:00:54.329> services<00:00:54.949> surfaces<00:00:55.949> we<00:00:56.129> checked

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
checked our services surfaces we checked

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.299 
checked our services surfaces we checked
the<00:00:56.699> motor<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.780> looked<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> center<00:00:59.250> of

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the motor we looked at the center of

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.060 
the motor we looked at the center of
gravity<00:00:59.399> according<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> instructions<00:01:01.070> we

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
gravity according to the instructions we

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.570 
gravity according to the instructions we
had<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.370> slightly<00:01:02.609> nose-heavy<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.920> we<00:01:04.920> journey

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
had it slightly nose-heavy as we journey

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.750 
had it slightly nose-heavy as we journey
would<00:01:05.880> do<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:08.780> then<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:10.200> gave<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.619> throw<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
would do and then we gave a throw and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.039 
would do and then we gave a throw and
that's<00:01:12.450> where<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.750> goes<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.930> bit<00:01:13.110> pear-shaped

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:37.410 

ready<00:01:18.229> I'm<00:01:18.590> ready<00:01:18.979> you<00:01:19.969> happy

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.170 

when<00:01:39.100> when<00:01:40.100> we<00:01:40.220> first<00:01:40.460> saw<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:40.670> back<00:01:40.909> we<00:01:41.119> were

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
when when we first saw it back we were

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.450 
when when we first saw it back we were
thinking<00:01:41.600> oh<00:01:41.750> maybe<00:01:42.380> we<00:01:42.530> stalled<00:01:42.830> it<00:01:42.979> what<00:01:43.430> I

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
thinking oh maybe we stalled it what I

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.190 
thinking oh maybe we stalled it what I
didn't<00:01:43.759> tell<00:01:43.909> Neal<00:01:44.149> is<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.600> give<00:01:44.750> him<00:01:44.869> quite<00:01:45.170> a

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
didn't tell Neal is to give him quite a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.300 
didn't tell Neal is to give him quite a
flat<00:01:45.560> throat<00:01:46.299> I<00:01:47.299> was<00:01:48.049> quite<00:01:48.470> a<00:01:48.500> big<00:01:48.710> burden<00:01:48.920> it

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
flat throat I was quite a big burden it

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.810 
flat throat I was quite a big burden it
really<00:01:49.580> needs<00:01:49.789> to<00:01:49.850> get<00:01:50.030> some<00:01:50.320> speed<00:01:51.320> up<00:01:51.820> so

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
really needs to get some speed up so

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.779 
really needs to get some speed up so
knee<00:01:52.880> front<00:01:53.240> at<00:01:53.830> sort<00:01:54.830> of<00:01:54.860> 30<00:01:55.069> maybe<00:01:55.640> 40

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
knee front at sort of 30 maybe 40

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.950 
knee front at sort of 30 maybe 40
degrees<00:01:56.409> but<00:01:57.409> if<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:57.770> look<00:01:57.950> at<00:01:58.069> the<00:01:58.159> video

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
degrees but if you look at the video

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.499 
degrees but if you look at the video
which<00:01:59.960> I'll<00:02:00.259> now<00:02:00.440> attempt<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:00.800> slow<00:02:00.950> down<00:02:01.509> he

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509

to level just to straighten the wings
and<00:02:44.180> yeah<00:02:44.660> it'll<00:02:45.079> when<00:02:45.350> it<00:02:45.739> all<00:02:45.859> went<00:02:45.950> crazy

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
and yeah it'll when it all went crazy

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.120 
and yeah it'll when it all went crazy
from<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.630> point<00:02:47.900> if<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.560> look<00:02:48.680> at<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.799> mobis

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
from that point if you look at the mobis

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.830 
from that point if you look at the mobis
here<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.459> really<00:02:49.670> don't<00:02:49.820> get<00:02:49.940> much<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.329> an

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
here you really don't get much of an

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.650 
here you really don't get much of an
impression<00:02:51.140> other<00:02:51.980> than<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.489> went<00:02:52.640> back<00:02:53.000> into

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
impression other than it went back into

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:05.520 
impression other than it went back into
the<00:02:53.750> ground<00:02:54.280> which<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.430> great

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.240 

what<00:03:06.460> I<00:03:06.670> did<00:03:06.850> notice<00:03:07.560> looking<00:03:08.560> back<00:03:08.770> on<00:03:09.090> the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
what I did notice looking back on the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.930 
what I did notice looking back on the
DVR<00:03:12.250> which<00:03:13.320> locked<00:03:14.320> up<00:03:14.590> after<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:15.700> crash<00:03:15.910> but

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
DVR which locked up after the crash but

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.470 
DVR which locked up after the crash but
I<00:03:16.240> was<00:03:16.360> lucky<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.780> retrieve<00:03:17.110> it<00:03:18.480> several

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
I was lucky to retrieve it several

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.210 
I was lucky to retrieve it several
things<00:03:19.690> firstly<00:03:20.320> you'll<00:03:20.560> notice<00:03:20.860> that<00:03:21.040> the

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
things firstly you'll notice that the

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.730 
things firstly you'll notice that the
quality<00:03:21.550> of<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.730> recording<00:03:21.850> is<00:03:22.240> very<00:03:22.450> bad<00:03:22.740> I

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
quality of the recording is very bad I

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.670 
quality of the recording is very bad I
notice<00:03:24.490> aside<00:03:24.760> test<00:03:25.420> this<00:03:25.570> before<00:03:25.960> but<00:03:26.470> can<00:03:26.650> I

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
notice aside test this before but can I

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.500 
notice aside test this before but can I
receive<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.460> my<00:03:27.550> TV<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.000> everything<00:03:28.390> was

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
receive it to my TV and everything was

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.790 
receive it to my TV and everything was
fine<00:03:30.120> but<00:03:31.120> unless<00:03:31.420> it<00:03:31.690> looked<00:03:31.900> fuzzy<00:03:32.560> and

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
fine but unless it looked fuzzy and

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.520 
fine but unless it looked fuzzy and
looking<00:03:33.760> again<00:03:33.880> I<00:03:34.360> noticed<00:03:34.960> that<00:03:35.140> some<00:03:35.320> of<00:03:35.350> the

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
looking again I noticed that some of the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.200 
looking again I noticed that some of the
OSD<00:03:36.040> information<00:03:36.490> has<00:03:36.610> dropped<00:03:36.880> off<00:03:37.090> the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
OSD information has dropped off the

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.210 
OSD information has dropped off the
bottom<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.660> screen<00:03:37.810> they're<00:03:38.140> making<00:03:39.100> me

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
bottom of the screen they're making me

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.650 
bottom of the screen they're making me
think<00:03:39.370> there's<00:03:39.610> some<00:03:39.850> sort<00:03:39.970> of<00:03:40.090> mismatch

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
think there's some sort of mismatch

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.550 
think there's some sort of mismatch
between<00:03:40.900> ntsc<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:41.860> pal<00:03:43.320> broadcast<00:03:44.320> and

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
between ntsc and pal broadcast and

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.130 
between ntsc and pal broadcast and
receiving<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.670> i<00:03:45.700> will<00:03:46.030> check<00:03:46.210> that<00:03:46.240> out<00:03:46.450> you

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
receiving so i will check that out you

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.920 
receiving so i will check that out you
also<00:03:47.380> noticed<00:03:47.920> that<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.340> air<00:03:48.580> speed<00:03:49.030> sensor

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
also noticed that the air speed sensor

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.680 
also noticed that the air speed sensor
seems<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.530> be<00:03:50.680> not<00:03:51.490> calibrated<00:03:51.910> is<00:03:52.270> coming<00:03:52.600> up

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
seems to be not calibrated is coming up

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.960 
seems to be not calibrated is coming up
with<00:03:52.840> over<00:03:53.260> 200<00:03:53.740> kilometres<00:03:54.070> now<00:03:54.190> wind<00:03:54.490> that

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
with over 200 kilometres now wind that

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.700 
with over 200 kilometres now wind that
was<00:03:55.150> windy<00:03:55.540> wasn't<00:03:56.410> that<00:03:56.530> windy<00:03:58.530> but<00:03:59.530> that

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
was windy wasn't that windy but that

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.080 
was windy wasn't that windy but that
should<00:03:59.920> have<00:04:00.040> had<00:04:00.250> an<00:04:00.370> impact<00:04:00.460> because<00:04:00.880> I<00:04:00.970> was

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
should have had an impact because I was

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.120 
should have had an impact because I was
in<00:04:01.210> manual<00:04:01.630> all<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.780> way<00:04:01.870> around<00:04:02.110> we<00:04:02.320> tested

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
in manual all the way around we tested

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.950 
in manual all the way around we tested
stabilized<00:04:03.820> on<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.060> ground<00:04:04.360> to<00:04:04.570> make<00:04:04.600> sure<00:04:04.870> it

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
stabilized on the ground to make sure it

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.580 
stabilized on the ground to make sure it
was<00:04:05.080> okay<00:04:05.440> but<00:04:06.220> only<00:04:06.460> with<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.850> idea<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.590> doing

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
was okay but only with the idea of doing

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.100 
was okay but only with the idea of doing
that<00:04:08.890> in<00:04:09.580> the<00:04:09.790> air<00:04:09.910> after<00:04:10.240> we<00:04:10.510> had<00:04:10.930> like

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
that in the air after we had like

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.979 
that in the air after we had like
several<00:04:11.380> hundred<00:04:11.500> meters<00:04:11.980> of<00:04:12.220> safety<00:04:13.380> so<00:04:15.989> I'm

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
several hundred meters of safety so I'm

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.720 
several hundred meters of safety so I'm
not<00:04:17.230> actually<00:04:17.859> sure<00:04:18.070> what<00:04:18.280> it<00:04:18.370> was<00:04:18.430> I<00:04:18.580> thought

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
not actually sure what it was I thought

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.160 
not actually sure what it was I thought
it<00:04:18.880> might<00:04:19.000> have<00:04:19.060> been<00:04:19.150> a<00:04:19.239> store<00:04:19.540> but<00:04:19.690> it<00:04:19.780> looks

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
it might have been a store but it looks

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.200 
it might have been a store but it looks
less<00:04:20.560> likely<00:04:20.980> so<00:04:21.250> asked<00:04:21.700> on<00:04:21.790> a<00:04:21.850> postcard

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
less likely so asked on a postcard

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.990 
less likely so asked on a postcard
please<00:04:22.950> or<00:04:23.950> you<00:04:24.280> could<00:04:24.400> just<00:04:24.430> think<00:04:24.730> the<00:04:24.790> money

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
please or you could just think the money

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.840 
please or you could just think the money
to<00:04:25.240> come<00:04:25.450> in<00:04:25.540> as<00:04:25.660> well<00:04:26.430> okay<00:04:27.430> so<00:04:27.460> here's<00:04:27.790> the

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
to come in as well okay so here's the

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.060 
to come in as well okay so here's the
damage<00:04:28.000> report<00:04:28.480> this<00:04:28.780> is<00:04:28.990> some<00:04:29.290> pretty<00:04:29.860> much

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
damage report this is some pretty much

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.910 
damage report this is some pretty much
how<00:04:30.190> I<00:04:30.250> found<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.640> plane<00:04:30.850> I<00:04:31.200> can<00:04:32.200> field<00:04:32.560> he

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
how I found the plane I can field he

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.980 
how I found the plane I can field he
knows<00:04:33.070> every<00:04:33.640> single<00:04:33.670> thing<00:04:34.210> that<00:04:34.420> was<00:04:34.630> stuck

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
knows every single thing that was stuck

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.740 
knows every single thing that was stuck
down<00:04:35.430> seems<00:04:36.430> to<00:04:36.610> have<00:04:36.730> burst<00:04:37.030> forward<00:04:37.450> and

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
down seems to have burst forward and

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.770 
down seems to have burst forward and
come<00:04:37.960> off<00:04:38.110> I<00:04:38.350> think<00:04:38.800> what<00:04:38.920> happened<00:04:39.250> is<00:04:39.340> deep

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
come off I think what happened is deep

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.170 
come off I think what happened is deep
pretty<00:04:40.780> heavy<00:04:40.990> air<00:04:41.200> see<00:04:41.500> which<00:04:42.040> was<00:04:42.250> managed

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
pretty heavy air see which was managed

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.030 
pretty heavy air see which was managed
over<00:04:43.300> here<00:04:43.480> on<00:04:43.630> his<00:04:43.950> Beltre<00:04:45.240> thumped<00:04:46.240> off<00:04:47.040> hit

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
over here on his Beltre thumped off hit

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.640 
over here on his Beltre thumped off hit
into<00:04:48.340> this<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.940> was<00:04:49.060> a<00:04:49.090> test<00:04:49.360> there<00:04:49.630> that<00:04:50.410> came

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
into this it was a test there that came

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.900 
into this it was a test there that came
out<00:04:50.860> called<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.760> back<00:04:52.030> with<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:53.910> remarkably

out called the back with it remarkably
the<00:04:55.090> battery<00:04:55.510> stayed<00:04:56.380> intact<00:04:56.590> there<00:04:56.950> which

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
the battery stayed intact there which

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.980 
the battery stayed intact there which
meant<00:04:57.610> there<00:04:57.730> wasn't<00:04:57.970> much<00:04:58.480> damage<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:58.900> the

meant there wasn't much damage to the

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.020 
meant there wasn't much damage to the
front<00:04:59.230> here<00:04:59.410> although<00:05:00.160> what<00:05:00.700> we<00:05:00.820> did<00:05:00.970> have<00:05:01.180> is

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
front here although what we did have is

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.400 
front here although what we did have is
see<00:05:04.030> there's<00:05:04.330> a<00:05:04.390> little<00:05:04.540> bit<00:05:04.660> of<00:05:04.840> a<00:05:04.930> shearing

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
see there's a little bit of a shearing

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.990 
see there's a little bit of a shearing
the<00:05:05.560> plastic<00:05:05.950> bit<00:05:06.130> that<00:05:06.310> was<00:05:06.460> attached<00:05:06.850> to

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
the plastic bit that was attached to

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.540 
the plastic bit that was attached to
this<00:05:07.210> part<00:05:07.450> of<00:05:07.510> the<00:05:07.600> pitot<00:05:07.780> tube<00:05:08.110> has<00:05:09.100> come<00:05:09.400> off

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
this part of the pitot tube has come off

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.330 
this part of the pitot tube has come off
so<00:05:09.729> I<00:05:09.760> have<00:05:10.000> to<00:05:10.150> see<00:05:10.300> if<00:05:10.419> that's<00:05:10.810> fixable

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
so I have to see if that's fixable

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.290 
so I have to see if that's fixable
the<00:05:13.330> nose<00:05:14.520> basically<00:05:15.520> ripped<00:05:15.789> out<00:05:16.000> of<00:05:16.030> his

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
thing the Mobius man here that was stuck

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.930 
thing the Mobius man here that was stuck
on<00:05:23.650> that<00:05:24.300> came<00:05:25.300> off<00:05:25.449> of<00:05:25.479> his<00:05:25.720> Mountain<00:05:26.940> no

on that came off of his Mountain no
particular<00:05:28.360> damage<00:05:28.659> there<00:05:29.819> the<00:05:31.830> wings<00:05:33.270> and

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
particular damage there the wings and

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:42.830 
particular damage there the wings and
the<00:05:36.389> skew<00:05:37.650> was<00:05:38.650> nice<00:05:38.889> and<00:05:39.099> bent<00:05:39.250> over<00:05:40.229> too<00:05:41.229> bad

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
the skew was nice and bent over too bad

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.860 
the skew was nice and bent over too bad
on<00:05:43.840> the<00:05:43.900> sides<00:05:44.289> here<00:05:44.440> we<00:05:45.509> got<00:05:46.509> a<00:05:46.539> bit<00:05:46.840> of

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
on the sides here we got a bit of

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.100 
on the sides here we got a bit of
splitting<00:05:47.409> for<00:05:48.400> the<00:05:48.460> tube<00:05:48.759> and<00:05:49.599> you'll<00:05:49.750> notice

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
splitting for the tube and you'll notice

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.230 
splitting for the tube and you'll notice
there's<00:05:50.560> a<00:05:50.770> rip<00:05:51.129> out<00:05:51.490> of<00:05:51.729> this<00:05:51.879> part<00:05:52.120> of<00:05:52.180> the

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
there's a rip out of this part of the

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.189 
there's a rip out of this part of the
wing<00:05:52.389> worthy<00:05:52.780> of<00:05:53.560> a<00:05:53.620> part<00:05:53.889> of<00:05:53.919> wing<00:05:54.129> attaches

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
wing worthy of a part of wing attaches

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.499 
wing worthy of a part of wing attaches
similar<00:05:56.199> story<00:05:56.500> on<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:56.860> other<00:05:56.949> side<00:05:57.509> there's

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
similar story on the other side there's

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:02.520 
similar story on the other side there's
a<00:05:58.870> split<00:05:59.830> on<00:06:00.190> that<00:06:00.909> carbon<00:06:01.150> fiber<00:06:01.479> tube<00:06:01.780> this

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
a split on that carbon fiber tube this

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.140 
a split on that carbon fiber tube this
seems<00:06:03.099> a<00:06:03.190> little<00:06:03.280> bit<00:06:03.460> more<00:06:03.520> intact

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
seems a little bit more intact

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.309 
seems a little bit more intact
and<00:06:05.110> that's<00:06:05.259> because<00:06:05.710> if<00:06:06.129> we<00:06:06.400> look<00:06:06.550> at<00:06:07.319> the

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 
and that's because if we look at the

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:11.010 
and that's because if we look at the
wings<00:06:08.530> I<00:06:09.060> see<00:06:10.060> that<00:06:10.270> the<00:06:10.449> main<00:06:10.599> part<00:06:10.750> the<00:06:10.870> wings

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
wings I see that the main part the wings

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.920 
wings I see that the main part the wings
fine<00:06:11.669> where<00:06:12.669> the<00:06:13.379> bolts<00:06:14.379> just<00:06:15.360> here<00:06:16.360> and<00:06:16.630> went

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
fine where the bolts just here and went

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.120 
fine where the bolts just here and went
through<00:06:17.169> into<00:06:17.529> the<00:06:17.620> main<00:06:17.770> wing<00:06:18.000> that's<00:06:20.130> that's

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
through into the main wing that's that's

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.469 
through into the main wing that's that's
the<00:06:21.279> bit<00:06:21.400> the<00:06:21.520> basically<00:06:21.729> ripped<00:06:21.969> out<00:06:22.180> with<00:06:22.330> it

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
the bit the basically ripped out with it

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.450 
the bit the basically ripped out with it
but<00:06:22.810> that<00:06:22.930> should<00:06:23.169> just<00:06:23.349> have<00:06:23.830> to<00:06:23.949> be<00:06:24.009> back<00:06:24.310> I

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
but that should just have to be back I

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.249 
but that should just have to be back I
think<00:06:24.520> this<00:06:24.789> is<00:06:24.909> the<00:06:25.000> one<00:06:25.120> I<00:06:25.150> replaced<00:06:25.569> which

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 
think this is the one I replaced which

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:29.070 
think this is the one I replaced which
was<00:06:26.469> guerrilla<00:06:26.710> glued<00:06:26.949> so<00:06:27.819> that<00:06:28.029> held<00:06:28.930> the

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
was guerrilla glued so that held the

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.339 
was guerrilla glued so that held the
phone<00:06:29.229> have<00:06:29.500> a<00:06:29.529> nasty<00:06:29.919> whereas<00:06:30.669> the<00:06:30.759> other<00:06:30.880> one

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:31.349 
phone have a nasty whereas the other one

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.550 
phone have a nasty whereas the other one
which<00:06:33.539> had<00:06:34.539> the<00:06:34.630> glue<00:06:34.750> from<00:06:34.870> the<00:06:34.960> manufacturer

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
which had the glue from the manufacturer

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.800 
which had the glue from the manufacturer
it's<00:06:35.830> pretty<00:06:36.279> much<00:06:36.370> taken<00:06:36.849> the<00:06:37.029> wood<00:06:37.389> out<00:06:37.509> very

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
it's pretty much taken the wood out very

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.249 
it's pretty much taken the wood out very
cleanly<00:06:38.340> so<00:06:39.360> it's<00:06:40.360> not<00:06:40.509> taking<00:06:40.810> any<00:06:40.930> wing<00:06:41.080> with

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:41.259 
cleanly so it's not taking any wing with

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:45.749 
cleanly so it's not taking any wing with
it<00:06:41.379> so<00:06:41.560> that<00:06:41.680> can<00:06:41.860> just<00:06:41.919> be<00:06:42.069> glued<00:06:43.060> back<00:06:43.240> in<00:06:44.759> the

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 
it so that can just be glued back in the

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.930 
it so that can just be glued back in the
any<00:06:46.180> other<00:06:46.360> part<00:06:46.840> of<00:06:46.900> damage<00:06:47.289> was<00:06:47.849> one<00:06:48.849> of

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:48.940 
any other part of damage was one of

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.029 
any other part of damage was one of
these<00:06:49.029> clips<00:06:49.270> that<00:06:49.479> one's<00:06:49.690> intact<00:06:50.080> that<00:06:50.860> one

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 
these clips that one's intact that one

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:52.999 
these clips that one's intact that one
lost<00:06:51.460> the<00:06:51.610> front<00:06:51.819> this<00:06:51.940> is<00:06:52.090> where<00:06:52.330> it<00:06:52.419> clips

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:53.009 
lost the front this is where it clips

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:55.529 
lost the front this is where it clips
onto<00:06:54.009> this<00:06:54.219> part<00:06:54.490> that<00:06:54.669> the<00:06:55.029> carbon<00:06:55.330> fiber

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:55.539 
onto this part that the carbon fiber

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:59.070 
onto this part that the carbon fiber
spar<00:06:55.930> it<00:06:56.080> goes<00:06:56.229> through<00:06:56.440> all<00:06:57.750> in<00:06:58.750> all<00:06:58.870> though

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 
spar it goes through all in all though

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.390 
spar it goes through all in all though
I've<00:06:59.560> got<00:06:59.770> to<00:06:59.800> say<00:06:59.889> I<00:07:00.219> was<00:07:00.520> surprised<00:07:00.969> by<00:07:01.690> the

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
I've got to say I was surprised by the

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.740 
I've got to say I was surprised by the
lack<00:07:03.400> of<00:07:03.460> damage<00:07:03.729> on<00:07:03.969> the<00:07:04.060> nose<00:07:04.180> if<00:07:04.389> we<00:07:04.479> look<00:07:04.629> at

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750 
lack of damage on the nose if we look at

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.499 
lack of damage on the nose if we look at
it<00:07:05.279> it's<00:07:06.840> all<00:07:07.840> intact<00:07:08.529> I<00:07:08.740> can't<00:07:08.979> see<00:07:09.129> any<00:07:09.509> real

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:10.509 
it it's all intact I can't see any real

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:11.879 
it it's all intact I can't see any real
damage<00:07:10.719> to<00:07:10.870> the<00:07:10.960> front<00:07:11.229> here<00:07:11.440> I<00:07:11.560> don't<00:07:11.620> know<00:07:11.800> if

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:11.889 
damage to the front here I don't know if

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:14.339 
damage to the front here I don't know if
it's<00:07:12.039> because<00:07:12.270> it<00:07:13.270> basically<00:07:13.419> turned<00:07:13.990> itself

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:14.349 
it's because it basically turned itself

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:18.059 
it's because it basically turned itself
over<00:07:14.740> as<00:07:15.120> it<00:07:16.120> went<00:07:16.300> so<00:07:16.659> it's<00:07:17.020> all<00:07:17.139> that<00:07:17.409> at<00:07:17.949> the

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:18.069 
over as it went so it's all that at the

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:20.279 
over as it went so it's all that at the
top<00:07:18.340> really<00:07:18.669> to<00:07:18.789> the<00:07:18.909> impact<00:07:19.240> it<00:07:20.050> has<00:07:20.169> pretty

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:20.289 
top really to the impact it has pretty

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:23.820 
top really to the impact it has pretty
well<00:07:20.409> the<00:07:20.560> wind<00:07:20.800> shook<00:07:21.130> off<00:07:22.589> really<00:07:23.589> quite<00:07:23.800> a

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:23.830 
well the wind shook off really quite a

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.840 
well the wind shook off really quite a
different<00:07:24.190> question<00:07:24.310> I'm<00:07:24.610> normal<00:07:24.880> too

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:25.850 
different question I'm normal too

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.850 
different question I'm normal too
I'd<00:07:26.850> expect<00:07:27.360> normally<00:07:28.260> the<00:07:28.500> battery<00:07:28.830> just

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 
I'd expect normally the battery just

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.710 
I'd expect normally the battery just
smashes<00:07:29.550> through<00:07:29.700> the<00:07:29.790> front<00:07:30.030> on<00:07:30.180> this<00:07:30.300> case

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 
smashes through the front on this case

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.170 
smashes through the front on this case
all<00:07:30.930> the<00:07:31.139> bits<00:07:32.130> and<00:07:32.280> pieces<00:07:32.370> came<00:07:32.850> flying

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 
all the bits and pieces came flying

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.590 
all the bits and pieces came flying
through<00:07:33.330> but<00:07:34.940> fortunately<00:07:35.940> mainly<00:07:36.300> intact

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:36.600 
through but fortunately mainly intact

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.450 
through but fortunately mainly intact
I'll<00:07:36.750> go<00:07:37.260> ahead<00:07:37.470> and<00:07:37.650> start<00:07:37.860> gluing<00:07:37.980> this<00:07:38.220> back

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 
I'll go ahead and start gluing this back

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.970 
I'll go ahead and start gluing this back
together<00:07:38.610> now<00:07:38.910> and<00:07:39.060> then<00:07:39.180> try<00:07:39.360> and<00:07:39.389> figure<00:07:39.660> out

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:39.980 
together now and then try and figure out

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.280 
together now and then try and figure out
what<00:07:40.980> went<00:07:41.160> wrong
