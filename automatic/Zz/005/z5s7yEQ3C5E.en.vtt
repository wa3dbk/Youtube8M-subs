so<00:00:01.829> here<00:00:02.250> I<00:00:02.280> am<00:00:02.370> again<00:00:02.639> talking<00:00:03.149> about<00:00:03.389> more<00:00:03.810> of

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
so here I am again talking about more of

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.460 
so here I am again talking about more of
this<00:00:04.110> moon<00:00:04.410> hoax<00:00:04.680> insanity<00:00:05.520> why<00:00:06.440> because<00:00:07.440> I

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
this moon hoax insanity why because I

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.160 
this moon hoax insanity why because I
love<00:00:07.980> talking<00:00:08.519> about<00:00:08.760> stupid<00:00:09.300> conspiracy

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
love talking about stupid conspiracy

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.839 
love talking about stupid conspiracy
theories<00:00:10.559> even<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.950> third<00:00:11.219> grader<00:00:11.550> could

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
theories even a third grader could

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.020 
theories even a third grader could
debunk<00:00:12.150> no<00:00:12.900> but<00:00:13.290> once<00:00:13.860> again<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.519> lets<00:00:14.849> me

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
debunk no but once again this lets me

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.180 
debunk no but once again this lets me
talk<00:00:15.210> about<00:00:15.509> subjects<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.139> am<00:00:16.379> interested<00:00:17.039> in

in this case physics and photogrammetry
photogrammetry<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.449> technique<00:00:21.840> of

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.869 
favorite the jump salute as if I haven't
debunked<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.260> crap<00:00:40.590> enough<00:00:40.980> by<00:00:41.489> doing<00:00:41.790> a

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
debunked this crap enough by doing a

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.240 
debunked this crap enough by doing a
test<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.420> comparison<00:00:43.020> not<00:00:43.410> once<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:43.920> twice

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
test for comparison not once but twice

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.880 
test for comparison not once but twice
as<00:00:44.760> well<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.510> by<00:00:45.629> proving<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.230> dust<00:00:46.469> fell<00:00:46.710> at

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
as well as by proving the dust fell at

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.770 
as well as by proving the dust fell at
the<00:00:46.920> same<00:00:47.010> rate<00:00:47.570> but<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:48.629> X<00:00:49.230> Y<00:00:49.620> Z<00:00:49.860> ll<00:00:50.340> l<00:00:50.610> zy<00:00:50.969> x<00:00:51.390> is

the same rate but now X Y Z ll l zy x is

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.080 
the same rate but now X Y Z ll l zy x is
saying<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.649> if<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.309> rate<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.640> fall<00:00:53.820> is

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
saying that if the rate of fall is

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.119 
saying that if the rate of fall is
consistent<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:54.870> lunar<00:00:55.170> gravity<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
consistent with lunar gravity then the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.400 
consistent with lunar gravity then the
astronaut<00:00:56.640> must<00:00:56.940> be<00:00:57.149> less<00:00:57.390> than<00:00:57.629> 4<00:00:57.870> feet<00:00:58.140> tall

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
astronaut must be less than 4 feet tall

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.250 
astronaut must be less than 4 feet tall
I've<00:00:59.340> showed<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.820> my<00:00:59.969> math<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.449> he<00:01:00.930> comes<00:01:01.199> back

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
I've showed in my math and he comes back

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.759 
I've showed in my math and he comes back
with<00:01:01.440> nothing<00:01:02.280> his<00:01:02.760> best<00:01:03.300> effort<00:01:03.930> didn't<00:01:04.559> even

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
with nothing his best effort didn't even

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.969 
with nothing his best effort didn't even
use<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.159> proper<00:01:05.790> basis<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.450> comparison<00:01:06.979> so

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
use the proper basis for comparison so

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.980 
use the proper basis for comparison so
let's<00:01:08.189> look<00:01:08.369> at<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.580> fall<00:01:08.760> I'll<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.750> two

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
let's look at the fall I'll do two

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.300 
let's look at the fall I'll do two
things<00:01:10.170> different<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.740> time

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
things different this time

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.190 
things different this time
I'll<00:01:11.580> look<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.240> entire<00:01:12.689> height<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
I'll look at the entire height of the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.190 
I'll look at the entire height of the
astronauts<00:01:13.680> jump<00:01:14.040> not<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> dust<00:01:14.880> height

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
astronauts jump not just the dust height

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.450 
astronauts jump not just the dust height
remember<00:01:16.200> I've<00:01:16.350> already<00:01:16.740> established<00:01:16.920> that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
remember I've already established that

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.609 
remember I've already established that
they<00:01:17.670> both<00:01:17.820> fall<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> same<00:01:18.390> rate<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.049> I'll

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
they both fall at the same rate and I'll

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.859 
they both fall at the same rate and I'll
use<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.070> same<00:01:20.310> impact<00:01:20.820> file<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.720> can

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
use the same impact file that you can

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.450 
use the same impact file that you can

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
s equals zero point 4 3 7 meters so we
