00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.200
 toxic refined sugar as the 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:09.969
 smoking and alcohol 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.590
 to reveal the harmfulness of this 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.050
 ingredient is a group of experts 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.580
 of the university of san francisco than in 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.860
 an article published by the magazine 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.050
 natures from the title public health the 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.910
 truth about sugar toxicity has 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.250
 highlighted as the damage caused 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.710
 from this food are very similar to 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.390
 those given by alcoholism according to many 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.669
 in fact scientists do not sugar 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.410
 provides only calories but in quantities 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.329
 consumed in the West changes the 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.399
 metabolism raises the pressure 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.960
 alters hormonal signals and causes damage 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.120
 significant to the liver 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.800
 from this study it would seem that i 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.660
 health hazards are largely 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.910
 similar to those you have while drinking 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.949
 too much alcohol which is not by chance derived from 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.660
 sugar distillation and there is 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.429
 more according to the scientists who have 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.190
 conducted this study 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:56.829
 so used it is widespread all over the world is 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.420
 one of the main responsible for the 35 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.190
 millions of deaths a year from diseases 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.909
 like diabetes or cardio problems 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.339
 circulatory 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.870
 naturally also in this case to do 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.360
 the difference is above all 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.100
 quantity for example in the united states 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.930
 the daily intake of calories given 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.820
 exclusively from sugar and often 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.710
 equal to or greater than 500 units 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.270
 this means that more than a third of the 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.009
 calories ingested daily by 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.700
 Americans derive only from this 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.740
 ingredient 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.780
 the problem therefore is that in the world e 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.460
 especially in some rich countries if any 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.110
 takes on too much and this can lead into 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.880
 time to even serious illnesses 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.710
 scholars are not talking about 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.899
 prohibit sugar but this must 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.789
 become a concern of governments 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.799
 which should make consumption of 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.509
 less convenient and at the same time sugar 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.060
 time to make the message understood 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.380
 population besides sugar then there 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.990
 are a series of other variants 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.909
 commonly found in so many foods 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.770
 they are no less dangerous than the classic 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.570
 sugar and then how to prevent the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.689
 dangerous diseases resulting from a 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.920
 excessive consumption of this ingredient 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.930
 definitely limiting consumption 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.000
 learning to eat drinking food and drink 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.590
 less sugary and trying to opt 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.079
 however for natural sweeteners 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.179
 like honey that for equal quantities 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.009
 have a sweetening power greater than 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.899
 that of sugar read the 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.869
 labels know what you really are 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.310
 buying for us and our loved ones 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.230
 therefore directing our choice on 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.700
 best products is a weapon that the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.890
 consumer to for himself and for 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.580
 influence manufacturers more and more 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.110
 sensitive 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.230
 the gain for its own sake than for the 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.330
 citizens' health 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.340
 then it is poured into the polari mÃ©tro a 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:33.760
 device that measures concentration 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.680
 of sugar the gravy of the mills flows 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.200
 down from this tower 10 meters high while 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.010
 from the bottom rise vapors of anhydride 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.500
 sulfur 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.620
 with this process called sulfation 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.360
 the sauce is then bleached 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.290
 flows in a device that measures it 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.290
 the ph level 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.769
 meanwhile in another cistern is added 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.050
 preparing lime water powder 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:02.620
 a solution called lime milk which 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:05.019
 will purify the sauce a machine mixes the 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.410
 gravy and lime milk for about six 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.989
 hours 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.620
 completing the process called the khali 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.620
 action 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.950
 in this way the ph of the is modified 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.200
 sauce and purify it by reaction to 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.800
 lime the color of the sauce changes from brown 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.800
 to yellow 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.460
 you know the man 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.610
 it has not damaged in sugar 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.790
 a large part of its history 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.590
 industry discovered that if in foods 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.960
 of bad quality adds some 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.700
 sugar is always of good quality 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.790
 people and ethics and 3 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.080
 find that a lot of stuff 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.300
 I still know that the supermarket continues 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.190
 sugar in the boxed drawing there 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.380
 sugar in mustard and sugar 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.720
 nissim the fronts there is sugar in the bread 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.530
 there is sugar in the rusks 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.210
 very difficult truncation of faith vi 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.280
 discounted for accepted by the pumpkin and 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:06.260
 because they always put us because if that 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.260
 I present mixed in axes catch fine 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.430
 end with calls against sugar 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.790
 seems like a good thing to eat 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.220
 because it is however the sugar goes down and 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.770
 a way to make good things come true 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.430
 which are not good 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:25.130
 it was all hurts but maybe the shape 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.110
 sugar that hurts the most is that 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.960
 of sugar not even sugar 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.120
 in the form of unsurpassed carbonated drinks 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.530
 of the game reached the fruit juices 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.910
 and to ask for another way from sugar 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.100
 its therefore perhaps it will have grown and already 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.240
 sweet and would need but if the fruit 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.780
 started if you do n't 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.949
 I know they never managed to sell it 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.710
 meanwhile this liquid sugar in the tool 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:48.380
 that liquid peculiarity that must be kept 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.060
 even if it is massages others do us 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.340
 pleasure because it would have done great 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.039
 large meal to drink a glass of 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.370
 Coke no very nearly there then the floodgates 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:00.340
 sink and you will be these drinks 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:05.120
 sweetened are the main cause 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:11.569
 of obesity of heroicity of children in 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:15.259
 especially the best way to 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:20.930
 sweeten and fruit 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:22.580
 for example if you can make a good one 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.919
 last sweet collection for example with 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.330
 the paper with the snouts the snout with 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.090
 oat flakes like hats with 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.930
 sultanas with small pieces of 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.789
 dried fruit 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.490
 if we eat i instead in the morning 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:36.949
 sweetened and sweetened Latin biscuits 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.080
 my life rises very much 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.960
 and when the beach situation my partner 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.889
 you respond by producing a lot of insulin 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.690
 civilization to lower blood sugar 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:46.099
 because it allows the sugar to enter 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:50.270
 in the cells you know our cells 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:52.699
 however, when burning glucose is when 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.099
 breakfast is very sweet 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:57.909
 the pack is on the very unusual light e 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:00.949
 after a while you go to discharge your blood sugar 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.750
 which means that the sweeter you eat them 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.720
 the more hungry for sugar because when 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.370
 you are afraid 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.050
 we have to make sugar this is the 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.730
 reason why many students eventually 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.470
 I'm nervous in the morning 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.240
 distracted they cannot concentrate 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.220
 because there is not enough sugar in the 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.680
 blood and not enough sugar 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.940
 because we launched too much sugar 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.230
 and honey even much better than 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.740
 sugar to better not mention to 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.660
 breakfast that the average honey eat it 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.430
 to have given that an intense has been made 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.370
 physical activity and if you play a game of 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.510
 ball of those that just cut it 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.340
 that eventually my legs hurt 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.110
 it means that you have all consumed it 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.760
 output sugar because it is not cheval 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.590
 but myth and ep quoted of muscles below 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.210
 glycogen form do not want 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.310
 consume all their sugars too 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.840
 if something comes in like mines it does 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.340
 increase blood sugar very quickly 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.530
 what they generate because I turned it 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.370
 the year because it will replace that 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.370
 who knew all together
