00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.460 
to use the gamepad myself I think
because<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.730> can<00:02:20.880> turn<00:02:21.120> off<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:24.470> motion

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
because you can turn off the motion

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.229 
because you can turn off the motion
control<00:02:25.950> because<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.370> don't<00:02:26.610> really<00:02:26.700> like<00:02:26.880> that

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
control because I don't really like that

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.030 
control because I don't really like that
stuff<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.019> this<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:28.920> top<00:02:29.310> still<00:02:29.670> nice<00:02:30.330> logo

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
stuff so this is top still nice logo

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.259 
stuff so this is top still nice logo
bottom<00:02:32.040> nothing<00:02:32.310> special<00:02:32.580> just<00:02:32.730> all<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.030> tax

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
bottom nothing special just all the tax

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.420 
bottom nothing special just all the tax
