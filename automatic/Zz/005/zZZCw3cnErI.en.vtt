cows<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.879> first<00:00:39.090> thing<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.329> need<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> know

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
cows so the first thing you need to know

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.150 
cows so the first thing you need to know
about<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:40.020> watch<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.500> addition<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.010> being

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
about this watch in addition to it being

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.680 
about this watch in addition to it being
very<00:00:41.280> interesting<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.210> has<00:00:42.360> two

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
very interesting is that it has two

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.889 
very interesting is that it has two
sides<00:00:43.309> so<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.850> wear<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.210> either<00:00:45.570> way

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
sides so you can wear this either way

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.900 
sides so you can wear this either way
because<00:00:46.200> there's<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.710> dial<00:00:46.950> for<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.309> time<00:00:47.550> on

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
because there's a dial for the time on

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.630 
because there's a dial for the time on
the<00:00:48.450> back<00:00:48.629> side<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:50.219> front<00:00:50.340> side<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the back side and the front side the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.240 
the back side and the front side the
reason<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.090> call<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.449> back<00:00:51.719> side<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.289> it's

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
reason I call this the back side is it's

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.860 
reason I call this the back side is it's
basically<00:00:53.550> more<00:00:54.120> or<00:00:54.180> less<00:00:54.270> meant<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
basically more or less meant to be the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.080 
basically more or less meant to be the
rear<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> case<00:00:55.350> as<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> flat<00:00:55.860> flat<00:00:56.579> sapphire

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
rear of the case as a flat flat sapphire

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.490 
rear of the case as a flat flat sapphire
crystal<00:00:57.480> well<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.690> slightly<00:00:57.930> rounded<00:00:58.199> but

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
crystal well it is slightly rounded but

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.420 
crystal well it is slightly rounded but
a<00:00:58.530> slightly<00:00:58.949> less<00:00:59.699> rounded<00:01:00.510> sapphire<00:01:00.930> crystal

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
a slightly less rounded sapphire crystal

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.009 
a slightly less rounded sapphire crystal
the<00:01:02.430> top<00:01:02.640> part<00:01:02.879> has<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> more<00:01:03.300> rounded<00:01:03.660> sapphire

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the top part has a more rounded sapphire

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.149 
the top part has a more rounded sapphire
crystals<00:01:04.439> because<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.920> little<00:01:05.010> bit

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
crystals because it's a little bit

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.210 
crystals because it's a little bit
higher<00:01:05.810> also<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.170> side<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> watch<00:01:07.890> is

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
higher also this side of the watch is

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.520 
higher also this side of the watch is
where<00:01:08.970> most<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> complications<00:01:10.110> exist

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
where most of the complications exist

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.200 
where most of the complications exist
even<00:01:11.220> though<00:01:11.430> there<00:01:11.700> are<00:01:11.820> certain

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
even though there are certain

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.640 
even though there are certain
complications<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> back<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.500> watch

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
complications on the back of the watch

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.890 
complications on the back of the watch
that<00:01:14.189> don't<00:01:14.430> exist<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.180> front<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.810> that's

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
that don't exist on the front so that's

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.390 
that don't exist on the front so that's
probably<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> most<00:01:16.619> interesting<00:01:16.979> thing<00:01:17.250> now

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
probably the most interesting thing now

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.690 
probably the most interesting thing now
the<00:01:17.520> virtuoso<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.750> line<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.590> movements<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the virtuoso is a line of movements the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.080 
the virtuoso is a line of movements the
family<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.240> movements<00:01:21.979> that<00:01:22.979> came<00:01:23.340> out<00:01:23.520> about

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
family of movements that came out about

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.820 
family of movements that came out about
two<00:01:24.450> years<00:01:24.720> ago<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.080> think<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:25.409> or<00:01:25.500> two<00:01:25.619> years

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
two years ago I think one or two years

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.850 
two years ago I think one or two years
ago<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.490> think<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.270> most<00:01:27.540> simple<00:01:28.110> version<00:01:28.140> of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
ago I think the most simple version of

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.050 
ago I think the most simple version of
the<00:01:29.100> virtuosa<00:01:29.520> movement<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.689> Beauvais

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
the virtuosa movement is in the Beauvais

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.700 
the virtuosa movement is in the Beauvais
recital<00:01:33.060> 12<00:01:33.479> watch<00:01:33.840> as<00:01:34.049> they're<00:01:34.229> very<00:01:34.409> that's

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
recital 12 watch as they're very that's

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.440 
recital 12 watch as they're very that's
their<00:01:34.829> ultra-thin<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.420> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
their ultra-thin one and so this is a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.830 
their ultra-thin one and so this is a
slightly<00:01:36.810> more<00:01:37.320> advanced<00:01:38.130> version<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
slightly more advanced version of the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.999 
slightly more advanced version of the
virtuoso<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.049> has<00:01:40.170> some<00:01:40.350> complications

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
virtuoso and it has some complications

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.639 
virtuoso and it has some complications
built<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.400> top<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.570> basic<00:01:43.110> movement

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
built on top of it so the basic movement

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.810 
built on top of it so the basic movement
I'm<00:01:43.860> actually<00:01:44.040> going<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.340> start<00:01:44.490> by<00:01:44.640> taking

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
I'm actually going to start by taking

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.300 
I'm actually going to start by taking
this<00:01:45.060> thing<00:01:45.240> apart<00:01:45.560> look<00:01:46.560> at<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.770> strap<00:01:47.070> just

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
this thing apart look at that strap just

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.800 
this thing apart look at that strap just
comes<00:01:47.490> off<00:01:48.680> other<00:01:49.680> strap<00:01:50.130> comes<00:01:50.369> off<00:01:50.810> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
comes off other strap comes off the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.749 
comes off other strap comes off the
basic<00:01:52.170> movement<00:01:52.560> has<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> power<00:01:53.070> reserve<00:01:53.340> of

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
basic movement has a power reserve of

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.450 
basic movement has a power reserve of
five<00:01:54.119> days<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:55.110> manually<00:01:55.710> wound<00:01:55.950> there<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.430> a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
five days it's manually wound there is a

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.639 
five days it's manually wound there is a
power<00:01:56.729> reserve<00:01:57.030> indicator<00:01:57.240> which<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.290> right

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
power reserve indicator which is right

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.340 
power reserve indicator which is right
here<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.250> left<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.509> dial<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.170> back

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
here to the left of the dial on the back

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.300 
here to the left of the dial on the back
on<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:03.119> back<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.450> also<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.310> subsidiary

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
on the back you also have a subsidiary

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.020 
on the back you also have a subsidiary
seconds<00:02:05.909> hand<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.299> they<00:02:06.659> call<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.020> coaxial

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
seconds hand and they call it a coaxial

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.190 
seconds hand and they call it a coaxial
subsidiary<00:02:09.030> seconds<00:02:09.509> hand<00:02:09.690> because<00:02:09.989> it

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
subsidiary seconds hand because it

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.440 
subsidiary seconds hand because it
actually<00:02:10.590> goes<00:02:10.770> all<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.039> way<00:02:11.370> through<00:02:11.489> so

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
actually goes all the way through so

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.670 
actually goes all the way through so
it's

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
it's

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.319 
it's
literally<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.129> same<00:02:13.400> seconds<00:02:14.000> hand<00:02:14.180> you're

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
literally the same seconds hand you're

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.800 
literally the same seconds hand you're
seeing<00:02:14.629> here<00:02:15.019> at<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.650> bottom<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:17.599> front

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
seeing here at the bottom of the front

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.599 
seeing here at the bottom of the front
of<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.019> front<00:02:18.469> dial<00:02:18.769> as<00:02:19.010> well<00:02:19.189> as<00:02:19.310> on<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.489> back

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:19.609 
of the front dial as well as on the back

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.459 
of the front dial as well as on the back
they're<00:02:19.879> simply<00:02:20.180> just<00:02:20.390> hands<00:02:20.750> on<00:02:20.870> either<00:02:21.319> side

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:21.469 
they're simply just hands on either side

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.589 
they're simply just hands on either side
and<00:02:21.739> that's<00:02:21.890> cool<00:02:22.159> now<00:02:22.609> the<00:02:22.670> dials<00:02:23.269> for<00:02:23.329> the

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
and that's cool now the dials for the

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.209 
and that's cool now the dials for the
time<00:02:23.840> are<00:02:24.079> interesting<00:02:24.439> because<00:02:24.560> they

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:25.219 
time are interesting because they

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.490 
time are interesting because they
they're<00:02:25.939> not<00:02:26.090> on<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.390> same<00:02:26.599> access<00:02:27.109> point<00:02:27.379> you

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
they're not on the same access point you

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.740 
they're not on the same access point you
can<00:02:27.620> see<00:02:27.769> here<00:02:28.219> the<00:02:28.519> dials<00:02:28.879> in<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.120> middle<00:02:29.389> or

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
can see here the dials in the middle or

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.569 
can see here the dials in the middle or
is<00:02:29.900> on<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.109> rear<00:02:30.349> of<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.590> dial<00:02:30.889> is<00:02:31.189> to<00:02:31.459> the

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
is on the rear of the dial is to the

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.069 
is on the rear of the dial is to the
upper<00:02:31.849> part<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.239> case<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.750> that's

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
upper part of the case and that's

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.869 
upper part of the case and that's
interesting<00:02:33.709> as<00:02:33.920> well<00:02:34.159> in<00:02:34.430> terms<00:02:34.459> of<00:02:34.790> the

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
interesting as well in terms of the

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.030 
interesting as well in terms of the
gearing<00:02:35.120> even<00:02:35.780> though<00:02:35.900> they<00:02:36.019> do<00:02:36.079> indicate<00:02:36.469> the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
gearing even though they do indicate the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.699 
gearing even though they do indicate the
same<00:02:37.280> time<00:02:37.519> so<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.389> back<00:02:38.599> of<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.139> of<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.469> case

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
same time so the back of the of the case

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:40.929 
same time so the back of the of the case
and<00:02:39.889> I'll<00:02:39.980> just<00:02:40.099> call<00:02:40.219> it<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.430> back<00:02:40.609> even

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939 
and I'll just call it the back even

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.309 
and I'll just call it the back even
though<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.239> can<00:02:41.389> wear<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.599> either<00:02:41.659> way<00:02:41.840> has

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
though you can wear it either way has

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.280 
though you can wear it either way has
the<00:02:42.560> time<00:02:42.799> powers<00:02:43.639> of<00:02:43.819> indicator<00:02:44.239> as<00:02:44.959> well<00:02:45.019> as

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
the time powers of indicator as well as

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.170 
the time powers of indicator as well as
the<00:02:45.409> superior<00:02:45.650> seconds<00:02:46.250> dial<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:46.730> there's<00:02:47.090> a

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
the superior seconds dial and there's a

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.179 
the superior seconds dial and there's a
view<00:02:47.389> of<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.659> escapement<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.409> the<00:02:48.889> balance

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
then when it gets to 31 it just jumps

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.559 
then when it gets to 31 it just jumps
back<00:03:34.250> and<00:03:34.549> you<00:03:34.879> can<00:03:35.000> see<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.209> little<00:03:35.389> hand

it's<00:03:50.359> fun<00:03:50.449> to<00:03:50.720> operate<00:03:51.139> it<00:03:51.819> I<00:03:52.819> like<00:03:53.419> the<00:03:53.629> layout

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
it's fun to operate it I like the layout

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.110 
it's fun to operate it I like the layout
of<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.139> perpetual<00:03:54.650> calendar<00:03:55.099> it's<00:03:55.579> it's<00:03:55.909> easy

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
of the perpetual calendar it's it's easy

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.539 
of the perpetual calendar it's it's easy
to<00:03:56.329> see<00:03:56.540> in<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.500> video<00:03:57.650> it<00:03:57.979> might<00:03:58.159> not<00:03:58.310> be<00:03:58.430> the

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
to see in the video it might not be the

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.189 
to see in the video it might not be the
easiest<00:03:58.579> thing<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.120> see<00:03:59.449> because<00:03:59.810> you<00:03:59.959> have

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:00.199 
easiest thing to see because you have

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.439 
easiest thing to see because you have
some<00:04:00.949> of<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.129> color<00:04:01.340> contrasting<00:04:02.120> here<00:04:02.329> and

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:02.449 
some of the color contrasting here and

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.089 
some of the color contrasting here and
have<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.659> look<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.930> little<00:04:03.049> bit<00:04:03.229> gently<00:04:03.620> but

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
have to look a little bit gently but

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.159 
have to look a little bit gently but
given<00:04:04.519> the<00:04:04.609> fact<00:04:04.639> that<00:04:04.939> this<00:04:05.150> is<00:04:05.359> what<00:04:05.930> I<00:04:05.959> call

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
given the fact that this is what I call

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.770 
given the fact that this is what I call
window<00:04:06.530> style<00:04:06.829> because<00:04:07.669> it's<00:04:07.970> it's<00:04:08.359> there's<00:04:08.689> a

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
window style because it's it's there's a

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.479 
window style because it's it's there's a
disc<00:04:09.049> that<00:04:09.199> indicates<00:04:09.769> it<00:04:09.949> and<00:04:10.250> there's<00:04:10.400> a

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
disc that indicates it and there's a

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.069 
disc that indicates it and there's a
small<00:04:10.759> back<00:04:11.030> plate<00:04:11.629> there<00:04:11.840> it's<00:04:11.959> like<00:04:12.019> a

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
small back plate there it's like a

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.689 
small back plate there it's like a
little<00:04:12.139> window<00:04:12.620> that<00:04:12.829> that<00:04:13.340> makes<00:04:13.549> it

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:13.699 
little window that that makes it

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.819 
little window that that makes it
relatively<00:04:13.970> easy<00:04:14.449> to<00:04:14.689> see<00:04:14.900> but<00:04:15.349> when<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.590> want

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
relatively easy to see but when you want

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.099 
relatively easy to see but when you want
to<00:04:15.919> just<00:04:16.070> look<00:04:16.250> at<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.489> watch<00:04:16.669> it's<00:04:17.109> basically

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
to just look at the watch it's basically

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.920 
to just look at the watch it's basically
most<00:04:18.409> of<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.620> time<00:04:18.859> so<00:04:19.039> you<00:04:19.220> can<00:04:19.400> actually

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
most of the time so you can actually

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.089 
most of the time so you can actually
enjoy<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.139> watch<00:04:21.289> we'll<00:04:21.529> say<00:04:21.650> it<00:04:21.769> that<00:04:21.889> one

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
enjoy the watch we'll say it that one

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.580 
enjoy the watch we'll say it that one
what<00:04:22.700> they<00:04:22.789> call<00:04:22.940> is<00:04:23.029> a<00:04:23.090> table<00:04:23.479> clock<00:04:23.690> on<00:04:23.990> this

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
what they call is a table clock on this

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.990 
what they call is a table clock on this
little<00:04:24.889> foot

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
little foot

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.900 
little foot
but<00:04:26.150> we<00:04:26.240> can<00:04:26.420> also<00:04:26.570> do<00:04:26.900> is<00:04:27.400> turn<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.460> into<00:04:28.730> a

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
but we can also do is turn it into a

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
is the version that they set me so this

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.340

is actually the the fake alligator strap

is actually the the fake alligator strap
and<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.560> reason<00:05:30.860> they<00:05:30.950> said<00:05:31.100> that<00:05:31.310> they<00:05:31.430> have

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
and the reason they said that they have

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.490 
and the reason they said that they have
to<00:05:31.580> send<00:05:31.850> a<00:05:31.910> fake<00:05:32.060> one<00:05:32.270> is<00:05:32.390> because<00:05:32.690> of<00:05:32.870> US

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
to send a fake one is because of US

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.080 
to send a fake one is because of US
customs<00:05:33.979> they<00:05:34.640> have<00:05:34.790> something<00:05:34.970> called

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
customs they have something called

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.420 
customs they have something called
societies<00:05:35.660> and<00:05:35.870> that<00:05:36.350> makes<00:05:36.620> it<00:05:36.770> difficult<00:05:37.070> to

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
societies and that makes it difficult to

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.860 
societies and that makes it difficult to
set<00:05:37.610> and<00:05:37.700> things<00:05:37.850> like<00:05:38.000> alligator<00:05:38.510> of<00:05:38.660> course

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
set and things like alligator of course

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.780 
set and things like alligator of course
the<00:05:39.050> the<00:05:39.500> joke<00:05:39.770> is<00:05:39.919> that<00:05:40.070> most<00:05:40.280> alligator

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
the the joke is that most alligator

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.730 
the the joke is that most alligator
straps<00:05:41.180> on<00:05:41.510> watches<00:05:42.020> are<00:05:42.200> Louisiana

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
straps on watches are Louisiana

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.850 
straps on watches are Louisiana
alligator<00:05:43.070> so<00:05:43.729> it's<00:05:44.150> it's<00:05:44.720> from<00:05:44.960> America<00:05:45.530> it

goes<00:05:46.100> to<00:05:46.250> Europe<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:46.729> then<00:05:47.090> it<00:05:47.210> has<00:05:47.330> problems

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
goes to Europe and then it has problems

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.600 
goes to Europe and then it has problems
coming<00:05:48.290> back<00:05:48.530> to<00:05:48.710> America<00:05:48.800> but<00:05:49.310> that's<00:05:49.460> an

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
coming back to America but that's an

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.250 
coming back to America but that's an
entirely<00:05:49.850> different<00:05:50.000> story<00:05:50.330> so<00:05:50.510> this<00:05:50.630> is<00:05:50.840> this

they tend to wear you know basically
just<00:06:19.190> one<00:06:19.850> side<00:06:20.180> of<00:06:20.210> the<00:06:20.450> watcher<00:06:20.810> or<00:06:20.840> use<00:06:21.500> it

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
just one side of the watcher or use it

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.890 
just one side of the watcher or use it
in<00:06:21.710> one<00:06:21.860> version<00:06:22.100> but<00:06:22.669> it's<00:06:22.820> fun<00:06:23.150> to<00:06:23.630> sort<00:06:23.840> of

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
in one version but it's fun to sort of

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.260 
in one version but it's fun to sort of
move<00:06:24.080> things<00:06:24.320> around<00:06:24.500> a<00:06:24.979> little<00:06:25.340> bit<00:06:25.640> I<00:06:25.970> can

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270

move things around a little bit I can
see<00:06:26.510> how<00:06:26.660> people<00:06:26.990> with<00:06:27.110> this<00:06:27.290> one<00:06:27.500> would<00:06:27.919> be

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
see how people with this one would be

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.950 
see how people with this one would be
switching<00:06:28.430> it<00:06:28.520> from<00:06:28.550> side<00:06:28.880> to<00:06:28.910> side<00:06:29.090> that's

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
switching it from side to side that's

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.690 
switching it from side to side that's
something<00:06:30.229> they<00:06:30.320> would<00:06:30.440> do<00:06:30.590> but<00:06:30.830> I<00:06:31.040> just<00:06:31.550> don't

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700 
something they would do but I just don't

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.550 
something they would do but I just don't

not<00:06:39.510> really<00:06:39.750> that<00:06:39.900> much<00:06:40.080> but<00:06:40.770> I<00:06:41.070> think<00:06:41.280> this<00:06:41.550> is

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:41.700 
not really that much but I think this is

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.860 
not really that much but I think this is
very<00:06:41.730> cool<00:06:42.030> that<00:06:42.090> you<00:06:42.210> can<00:06:42.330> change<00:06:42.510> the<00:06:42.600> size

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
very cool that you can change the size

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.200 
very cool that you can change the size
so<00:06:43.020> there<00:06:43.200> it<00:06:43.320> is<00:06:43.380> on<00:06:43.680> the<00:06:44.430> retrograde

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
so there it is on the retrograde

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.420 
so there it is on the retrograde
perpetual<00:06:45.870> calendar<00:06:46.440> side<00:06:46.680> of<00:06:46.860> it<00:06:46.980> which<00:06:47.190> I

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
perpetual calendar side of it which I

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.310 
perpetual calendar side of it which I
think<00:06:47.820> it's<00:06:47.940> cool<00:06:48.120> looking<00:06:48.450> you<00:06:48.570> know<00:06:48.690> if

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
think it's cool looking you know if

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.320 
think it's cool looking you know if
course<00:06:49.590> has<00:06:49.770> that<00:06:49.980> Beauvais<00:06:50.280> aesthetic<00:06:50.820> but

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
course has that Beauvais aesthetic but

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.840 
course has that Beauvais aesthetic but
it's<00:06:51.600> it's<00:06:51.900> useful<00:06:52.320> it's<00:06:52.500> complicated<00:06:53.280> it's

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:53.850 
it's it's useful it's complicated it's

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.120 
it's it's useful it's complicated it's
interesting<00:06:54.290> again<00:06:55.290> you<00:06:55.410> have<00:06:55.500> five<00:06:55.740> days<00:06:55.920> of

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.130 
interesting again you have five days of

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.670 
interesting again you have five days of
power<00:06:56.340> reserve<00:06:56.730> operates<00:06:57.540> three<00:06:57.930> Hertz<00:06:58.170> I've

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
power reserve operates three Hertz I've

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.380 
power reserve operates three Hertz I've
just<00:06:58.920> always<00:06:59.070> found<00:06:59.460> that<00:06:59.880> this<00:07:00.030> type<00:07:00.240> of

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:00.390 
just always found that this type of

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.750 
just always found that this type of
stuff<00:07:00.570> is<00:07:00.720> interesting<00:07:01.650> and<00:07:01.830> unique<00:07:02.280> and
