00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
skeptical about reading this so soon

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.880 
skeptical about reading this so soon
after<00:01:51.049> extremely<00:01:52.049> around<00:01:52.259> incredibly<00:01:52.680> close

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
after extremely around incredibly close

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.560 
after extremely around incredibly close
because<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.430> thought<00:01:53.610> they<00:01:53.759> kind<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.149> sounded

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
because I thought they kind of sounded

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.639 
because I thought they kind of sounded
like<00:01:54.659> they<00:01:54.810> dealt<00:01:54.990> with<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> same<00:01:55.350> themes

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
like they dealt with the same themes

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.679 
like they dealt with the same themes
like<00:01:55.979> Oscar<00:01:56.579> Shannon<00:01:57.149> extremely<00:01:57.570> odd

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
like Oscar Shannon extremely odd

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.120 
like Oscar Shannon extremely odd
incredibly<00:01:58.110> she's<00:01:58.380> nine<00:01:58.530> years<00:01:58.560> old<00:01:58.860> he's

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
etc but because this followed Matthew

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.959 
etc but because this followed Matthew
through<00:02:03.390> 10<00:02:03.630> years<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.079> his<00:02:04.200> life<00:02:04.369> it<00:02:05.369> wasn't
