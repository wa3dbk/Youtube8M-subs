00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 new temperature of 29 degrees 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.990
 centigrade thermal sensation of 32 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.389
 degrees centigrade a relative of 74 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.070
 percent and dew point 24 degrees 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.290
 cellular that is with height already 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.240
 somewhat more stable from 2 to 4 feet and the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.190
 port is open to all types 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.600
 of navigation we are registering 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.279
 also component winds this 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.050
 northeast at a speed of 11 kilometers 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.029
 per hour and in terms of pressure 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.160
 we are a little above normal and 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.740
 we know it's 1012 to a thousand 13,000 and bars 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.929
 but at the moment we are in 2014 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.790
 millibars the sunrise for the day 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.969
 tomorrow we will have it at 7 with 15 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.860
 minutes and sunset 19 hours with 44 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.910
 let's see the following image for 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.710
 know the values that we are 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.540
 reaching these next three days 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.000
 we expect values ​​that go from a maximum 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.980
 from 31 degrees to a minimum of 24 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.329
 conditions in which the sun appears 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.070
 for this weekend for the day of 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.350
 but know very good morning 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.539
 there can still be some pretty clouds 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.250
 heavy then being covered some 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.410
 moment is partly cloudy and then 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.629
 can be cleared completely there is the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.670
 possibility still this early morning 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.350
 we can expect electrical activity and 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.270
 duck precipitation probability for 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.329
 Saturday and Sunday 80 percent 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.189
 Monday 70 these precipitations wait 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:12.960
 that are concentrated throughout the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.479
 early morning and then along the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.520
 midday starts to lower the probability 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.049
 of precipitation then excellent we 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.000
 they say mom because surely we are 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.799
 He gathered a lot of clothes these days that 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.179
 we had a lot of rain so 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.069
 we can be a little calmer 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.200
 this weekend we can get 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:29.670
 very industrious and let's see the next 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.439
 picture to ask the question you 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.179
 observed the Lord today if 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.039
 I observe the sky will know that still 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.539
 we are waiting for rainfall to 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.369
 these precipitations are still expected 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.409
 throughout the early morning I reiterate 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.479
 still of moderate character can be 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.579
 a little bit stronger are squalls that 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.530
 yes they can vary in intensity and we have 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.729
 tall clouds and roku mules that 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.530
 The cumulus hills are still 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.970
 saying that water comes then 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.069
 we are prepared to have the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.149
 considerations in this regard do not leave 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.610
 the pets outside 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.560
 my mom careful not to leave the clothes hanging 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.969
 Now let's follow the next image to 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.979
 comment on everything in terms of territory 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.500
 national here we already see many changes 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.869
 yesterday I was still just entering the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.239
 tropical wave number 26 and we already see that 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.920
 moved quickly enough you are already 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.959
 in the southern portion it is generating 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.290
 rainfall in all its advance can 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.730
 leave 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.620
 quite rain now what we see 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.239
 also on this side it is still a 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.030
 important change tropical wave 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.769
 number 27 that is still found 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.420
 located in the Caribbean Sea but that 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.040
 its displacement to the west is 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.629
 wait now for tomorrow to 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.890
 this weekend that is already 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.049
 entering the yucatan peninsula 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.939
 propitiating also elevating the 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.439
 precipitation potential then not 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.269
 they stop because they also have 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.879
 enough humidity of the Caribbean Sea that 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.739
 just extends to portions 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.299
 from the southeast where anyway 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.400
 rain reigns right now what 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.129
 you see because now to this side still 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.989
 we have hurricane norbert but now it's 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.450
 of category 2 on the saffir scale 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.700
 simpson is located 300 kilometers away 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.680
 west-northwest of cabo san lucas baja 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.480
 Southern California is still moving towards 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.060
 the northwest at a speed of 13 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.590
 kilometers per hour is already generating 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.290
 winds still reaching gusts of 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.939
 185 kilometers per hour for waves 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.549
 high and pretty rainfall 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.900
 strong to torrential in low peninsula 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.939
 california all the western slope 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.889
 the western slope is still seeing 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.180
 affected in the same way that's why they are the 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.579
 instability that extends from the 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.810
 northwest west part of the center in 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.420
 parts of the center we still have 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.430
 hail potential 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.080
 for these activities throughout the 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.970
 center of the whole table of the republic 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.739
 Mexican is still temporary 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.140
 rains in much of the Mexican soil 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.640
 now we see here also a cante not us 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.500
 I like it a lot and it gives me a little bit of pity 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.300
 tell him but you owe this system 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.980
 frontal totally out of time that 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.319
 now the moment is located south of 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.360
 but if it is expected that the 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.000
 next few hours is approaching the 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.650
 northern border then this care and 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.060
 can not generate changes in terms of 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.560
 temperature not because right now 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.540
 we are in summer we have temperatures 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.670
 quite warm throughout the north table 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.920
 but what will change with respect to 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.780
 this frontal system is an increase in 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.430
 regarding the cloudiness propitiating 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.140
 potential rainfall in said 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.880
 regions that 2 - in all the north 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.650
 in much of the republic I reiterate 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.569
 rain continues until here the 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.130
 first part the information I thank 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.600
 art and super cheap super cool and 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.580
 I finished he knows that if he wants to dress 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.209
 everything you find in yourself 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.209
 Thank you
