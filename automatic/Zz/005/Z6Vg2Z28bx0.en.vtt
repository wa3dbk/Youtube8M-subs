them<00:00:29.910> overnight<00:00:30.029> two<00:00:30.869> reasons<00:00:31.050> for<00:00:31.380> this<00:00:31.439> one

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
them overnight two reasons for this one

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.350 
them overnight two reasons for this one
it<00:00:32.040> won't<00:00:32.160> break<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.610> machine<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.239> you

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360

putting<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.750> through<00:00:33.930> there<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.440> number<00:00:34.860> two

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
putting it through there and number two

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.069 
putting it through there and number two
it's<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.670> lot<00:00:35.880> easier<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.390> your<00:00:36.570> digestive

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
also make space and also LSA you just

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.539 
also make space and also LSA you just
have<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.320> change<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> cone<00:01:41.009> which<00:01:41.250> takes

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
have to change the cone which takes

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.399 
have to change the cone which takes
seconds<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.240> put<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.420> homogenizer<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.259> there

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
seconds and put the homogenizer in there

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.600
