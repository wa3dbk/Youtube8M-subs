 me 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:34.090
 There flame leaking the Bateru piece rather than Iedai bridge 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:38.200
 Such a style of guitar is quite difficult to play with tension 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:43.000
 Kai is there also I'd often harbor cruise 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:47.650

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.460
 Pickup is not only just removing the cover and opening it 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.460

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.810
 me 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.869
 It is a good bill 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.730
 I want to see this style run away 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.730
 All 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.730
 me 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:40.650
 It's a flying fish, so it's true to match the character of this pickup 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:45.310
 I'm writing an ordinal number when I'm down 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.650
 Yes I do not say it will be late or not 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.480
 It would be nice if the highs remain properly 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.760
 Such things 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:58.830
 How to use the Kozumi device after all squeezes this side and rage 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.480
 I think that crunch or lead is the pattern that you want to use. 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.700
 Corresponding to in those things 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.890

 It is also common to jazz and first time, and the sound of that deer is the other way around 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.280
 And very Tsu straight 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.120
 At that time the market with the reins 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.150
 I think there are many people who want to listen to this book 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.110
 In fact the sound is a good feeling easy to use more 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.160
