I<00:02:04.490> was<00:02:04.639> talking<00:02:04.789> about<00:02:05.149> with<00:02:05.329> my<00:02:05.709> what<00:02:06.709> is<00:02:06.829> it

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
I was talking about with my what is it

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.740 
I was talking about with my what is it
the<00:02:07.069> bleeding<00:02:07.369> edge<00:02:07.490> armor<00:02:07.999> I<00:02:08.030> think<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.450> mold

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
the bleeding edge armor I think the mold

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.900 
the bleeding edge armor I think the mold
may<00:02:09.020> possibly<00:02:09.560> be<00:02:09.800> blue<00:02:10.160> because<00:02:10.550> you<00:02:10.789> got

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
may possibly be blue because you got

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.610 
may possibly be blue because you got
these<00:02:11.030> little<00:02:11.330> like<00:02:11.510> weird<00:02:11.690> swirls<00:02:12.349> of

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
these little like weird swirls of

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.850 
these little like weird swirls of
plastic<00:02:13.220> in<00:02:13.370> there<00:02:13.990> for<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.080> blue<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.590> that's

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
plastic in there for the blue and that's

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.040 
plastic in there for the blue and that's
just<00:02:16.069> not<00:02:16.250> how<00:02:16.430> paint<00:02:16.880> that's<00:02:17.660> just<00:02:17.840> not<00:02:17.959> how

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
just not how paint that's just not how

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.900 
just not how paint that's just not how

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
they paint the figure so it's maybe I

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.339 
they paint the figure so it's maybe I
just<00:02:20.209> don't<00:02:20.390> know<00:02:20.569> what<00:02:20.690> I'm<00:02:20.810> talking<00:02:20.990> about<00:02:21.200> I

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
always been a smaller Iron Man but he

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.119 
always been a smaller Iron Man but he
does<00:03:10.540> stack<00:03:10.870> up<00:03:11.109> pretty<00:03:11.379> well<00:03:11.470> against<00:03:11.950> some

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
bullseye so yeah they are about the same

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.940 
bullseye so yeah they are about the same
height<00:03:27.940> so<00:03:28.180> technically<00:03:28.720> he<00:03:28.900> is<00:03:29.019> taller<00:03:29.349> or

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
height so technically he is taller or

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
maybe the Wolverine is shorter but you

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.960 
maybe the Wolverine is shorter but you
can<00:03:32.260> get<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.470> good<00:03:32.650> idea<00:03:32.709> of<00:03:33.099> him<00:03:33.609> being<00:03:33.639> in

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
can get a good idea of him being in

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.270 
can get a good idea of him being in
scale<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.480> everything<00:03:34.590> another<00:03:35.590> comparison

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.370 
armor I was talking about how they it
looks<00:03:48.430> more<00:03:49.030> frequently<00:03:49.540> looks<00:03:49.780> like<00:03:49.930> Hasbro

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
looks more frequently looks like Hasbro

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.420 
looks more frequently looks like Hasbro
has<00:03:50.470> been<00:03:50.650> taking<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.069> Marvel<00:03:51.400> Universe

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
has been taking the Marvel Universe

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.650 
has been taking the Marvel Universe
figures<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.560> just<00:03:53.560> upsizing<00:03:54.099> them<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:55.180> using

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
figures and just upsizing them and using

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.860 
figures and just upsizing them and using
the<00:03:55.780> articulation<00:03:56.500> for<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:58.150> Marvel<00:03:58.510> Legends

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
the articulation for the Marvel Legends

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.750 
the articulation for the Marvel Legends
now<00:03:59.470> I<00:03:59.530> know<00:03:59.650> this<00:03:59.859> figure<00:04:00.220> has<00:04:00.370> already<00:04:00.609> been

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
now I know this figure has already been

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.940 
now I know this figure has already been
out<00:04:00.940> for<00:04:01.530> close<00:04:02.530> to<00:04:02.560> a<00:04:02.769> year<00:04:03.099> now<00:04:04.380> but<00:04:05.380> if<00:04:05.650> you

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
out for close to a year now but if you

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.339 
out for close to a year now but if you
look<00:04:06.310> at<00:04:06.489> this<00:04:06.819> Marvel<00:04:07.389> Universe<00:04:07.810> figure<00:04:08.200> and

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
look at this Marvel Universe figure and

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.400 
look at this Marvel Universe figure and
you<00:04:08.440> compare<00:04:08.889> it<00:04:09.010> to<00:04:09.160> this<00:04:09.900> this<00:04:10.900> Iron<00:04:11.169> patriot

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
you compare it to this this Iron patriot

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.360 
you compare it to this this Iron patriot
figure<00:04:12.629> the<00:04:13.629> the<00:04:13.959> articulation<00:04:14.709> I<00:04:14.829> and<00:04:15.220> I

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
figure the the articulation I and I

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.900 
figure the the articulation I and I
you<00:04:15.609> not<00:04:15.760> is<00:04:16.120> exactly<00:04:17.019> the<00:04:17.650> same<00:04:17.950> so<00:04:18.549> let's<00:04:18.760> go

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
you not is exactly the same so let's go

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.120 
you not is exactly the same so let's go
through<00:04:19.410> articulation<00:04:20.410> while<00:04:20.620> I'm<00:04:20.739> comparing

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
through articulation while I'm comparing

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.890 
through articulation while I'm comparing
it<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.430> him<00:04:21.579> we've<00:04:22.090> got<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.389> head<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.750> goes

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
it to him we've got the head that goes

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.469 
it to him we've got the head that goes
up<00:04:23.229> and<00:04:23.470> down<00:04:23.680> side<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.370> side<00:04:24.760> it's<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.389> same

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
up and down side to side it's the same

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.240 
up and down side to side it's the same

same on the Marvel Universe figure same
thing<00:05:03.330> followed<00:05:03.660> on<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:03.810> other<00:05:04.020> side<00:05:04.350> on<00:05:04.500> the

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
thing followed on the other side on the

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.909 
thing followed on the other side on the
arm<00:05:04.740> then<00:05:05.310> we<00:05:05.460> go<00:05:05.639> down<00:05:05.880> here<00:05:05.910> to<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.419> legs

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
arm then we go down here to the legs

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.379 
arm then we go down here to the legs
instead<00:05:07.919> of<00:05:07.980> having<00:05:08.220> ball<00:05:08.490> joints<00:05:08.940> stuck<00:05:09.210> into

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
instead of having ball joints stuck into

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.180 
instead of having ball joints stuck into
the<00:05:09.630> legs<00:05:09.840> we've<00:05:10.020> got<00:05:10.200> these<00:05:10.320> these<00:05:10.919> little

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
the legs we've got these these little

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.129 
the legs we've got these these little
joints<00:05:11.520> that<00:05:11.639> kind<00:05:11.970> of<00:05:12.030> slip<00:05:12.450> into<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:12.840> armor

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
joints that kind of slip into the armor

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:14.810 
joints that kind of slip into the armor
right<00:05:13.320> here<00:05:13.560> which<00:05:13.680> is<00:05:13.710> really<00:05:14.010> nice<00:05:14.280> and

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
right here which is really nice and

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.390 
right here which is really nice and
those<00:05:15.000> go<00:05:15.150> out<00:05:15.419> and<00:05:15.690> front<00:05:16.410> and<00:05:16.500> back<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:16.830> then

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
those go out and front and back and then

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.590 
those go out and front and back and then
of<00:05:17.520> course<00:05:17.550> we've<00:05:17.880> got<00:05:17.910> the<00:05:18.240> piece<00:05:18.389> of

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
of course we've got the piece of

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.110 
of course we've got the piece of
articulation<00:05:19.440> which<00:05:19.620> is<00:05:19.800> relatively<00:05:20.700> new<00:05:20.880> we

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
articulation which is relatively new we

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.690 
articulation which is relatively new we
haven't<00:05:21.360> seen<00:05:21.600> this<00:05:21.780> until<00:05:22.139> the<00:05:22.290> last

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
haven't seen this until the last

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.190 
haven't seen this until the last
extremist<00:05:23.700> Iron<00:05:23.880> Man<00:05:24.030> came<00:05:24.270> out<00:05:24.479> and<00:05:24.750> that

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
extremist Iron Man came out and that

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.540 
extremist Iron Man came out and that
turns<00:05:25.560> 360<00:05:26.040> degrees<00:05:26.820> and<00:05:27.600> it<00:05:27.780> goes<00:05:28.400> which<00:05:29.400> is

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
turns 360 degrees and it goes which is

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.070 
turns 360 degrees and it goes which is
really<00:05:29.820> nice<00:05:30.000> it's<00:05:30.660> just<00:05:30.750> kind<00:05:31.020> of

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
really nice it's just kind of

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.409 
really nice it's just kind of
eliminating<00:05:31.830> that<00:05:32.010> joint<00:05:32.340> that's<00:05:32.910> usually

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
eliminating that joint that's usually

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.450 
eliminating that joint that's usually
right<00:05:33.660> there<00:05:33.900> on<00:05:34.139> your<00:05:34.530> regular<00:05:34.710> figures<00:05:35.280> so

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
right there on your regular figures so

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.560 
right there on your regular figures so
that's<00:05:35.610> really<00:05:35.760> nice<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.120> then<00:05:36.210> double

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
that's really nice and then double

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.330 
that's really nice and then double
jointed<00:05:36.900> knees<00:05:36.960> that<00:05:37.830> would<00:05:37.919> go<00:05:38.040> into<00:05:38.160> the

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
jointed knees that would go into the

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.930 
jointed knees that would go into the
feet<00:05:38.550> which<00:05:38.790> go<00:05:39.000> up<00:05:39.030> and<00:05:39.479> down<00:05:40.080> and<00:05:40.669> 360<00:05:41.669> degree

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.260 
feet which go up and down and 360 degree
turn<00:05:41.970> and<00:05:42.419> guess<00:05:43.020> what<00:05:43.320> it<00:05:43.590> is<00:05:44.039> exactly<00:05:44.669> the

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
turn and guess what it is exactly the

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.050 
turn and guess what it is exactly the
same<00:05:45.300> on<00:05:45.960> the<00:05:46.320> Marvel<00:05:46.620> Universe<00:05:46.680> figure<00:05:47.430> and<00:05:47.640> I

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
same on the Marvel Universe figure and I

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.300 
same on the Marvel Universe figure and I
mean<00:05:48.270> exactly<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:48.900> same<00:05:49.050> and<00:05:49.530> that<00:05:50.039> is<00:05:50.160> just

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
mean exactly the same and that is just

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.400 
mean exactly the same and that is just
kind<00:05:50.520> of<00:05:50.700> trippy<00:05:51.060> because<00:05:51.479> if<00:05:51.660> I<00:05:51.810> recall<00:05:51.990> this

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
kind of trippy because if I recall this

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.140 
kind of trippy because if I recall this
Marvel<00:05:52.860> Universe<00:05:53.220> figure<00:05:53.550> came<00:05:53.760> out<00:05:53.940> like<00:05:54.090> two

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
Marvel Universe figure came out like two

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.219 
Marvel Universe figure came out like two
or<00:05:54.510> three<00:05:54.539> years<00:05:54.750> ago<00:05:55.080> you<00:05:55.770> can<00:05:55.919> tell<00:05:56.190> by<00:05:56.370> how

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
or three years ago you can tell by how

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:00.020 
or three years ago you can tell by how
different<00:05:58.229> the<00:05:58.440> articulation<00:05:59.100> is<00:05:59.310> from<00:05:59.880> the

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
different the articulation is from the

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.300 
different the articulation is from the
newer<00:06:00.180> Marvel<00:06:00.539> Universe<00:06:00.900> figures<00:06:01.289> so<00:06:01.950> I<00:06:01.979> don't

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
newer Marvel Universe figures so I don't

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.890 
newer Marvel Universe figures so I don't
know<00:06:02.430> if<00:06:02.580> that<00:06:02.789> was<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.120> case<00:06:03.300> if<00:06:03.570> they<00:06:03.690> up

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
know if that was the case if they up

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.980 
know if that was the case if they up
scaled<00:06:04.289> the<00:06:04.500> articulation<00:06:05.190> or<00:06:05.340> whatever<00:06:05.990> but

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
scaled the articulation or whatever but

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.620 
scaled the articulation or whatever but
I'm<00:06:07.110> loving<00:06:07.530> it<00:06:07.680> like<00:06:08.039> McDonald's<00:06:08.729> but<00:06:09.300> check

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
I'm loving it like McDonald's but check

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.659 
I'm loving it like McDonald's but check

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
this out let's get let's get the

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.260 
this out let's get let's get the
extremis<00:06:12.330> armor<00:06:12.750> and<00:06:13.410> the<00:06:14.250> iron<00:06:14.520> Patriot<00:06:14.700> next

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
extremis armor and the iron Patriot next

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.430 
extremis armor and the iron Patriot next
to<00:06:15.330> each<00:06:15.450> other<00:06:15.600> you<00:06:15.780> can<00:06:15.840> see<00:06:16.080> the<00:06:16.200> color

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
to each other you can see the color

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.529 
to each other you can see the color
difference<00:06:16.530> you<00:06:17.310> can<00:06:17.460> see<00:06:17.639> that<00:06:17.820> is<00:06:17.970> in<00:06:18.120> fact<00:06:18.330> a

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 
difference you can see that is in fact a

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:20.450 
difference you can see that is in fact a
different<00:06:18.750> red<00:06:19.169> I<00:06:19.440> don't<00:06:19.800> know<00:06:19.919> if<00:06:20.010> my<00:06:20.130> camera

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
different red I don't know if my camera

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.879 
different red I don't know if my camera
will<00:06:20.760> pick<00:06:20.970> it<00:06:21.000> up<00:06:21.210> but<00:06:21.630> this<00:06:22.200> red<00:06:22.440> is<00:06:22.530> a<00:06:22.560> little

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
will pick it up but this red is a little

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:25.640 
will pick it up but this red is a little
bit<00:06:23.010> lighter<00:06:23.280> than<00:06:23.400> this<00:06:23.820> red<00:06:24.440> so<00:06:25.440> that's

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
bit lighter than this red so that's

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.029 
bit lighter than this red so that's
pretty<00:06:26.010> cool<00:06:26.340> like<00:06:26.880> I<00:06:27.060> said<00:06:27.360> just<00:06:27.900> because<00:06:28.740> of

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
pretty cool like I said just because of

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.279 
pretty cool like I said just because of
the<00:06:29.130> paint<00:06:29.400> scheme

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
the paint scheme

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.930 
the paint scheme
these<00:06:31.289> figures<00:06:31.650> are<00:06:31.740> definitely<00:06:32.280> set<00:06:32.580> apart

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
these figures are definitely set apart

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.279 
these figures are definitely set apart
and<00:06:33.180> of<00:06:33.600> course<00:06:33.810> they're<00:06:33.960> completely

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
and of course they're completely

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.350 
and of course they're completely
different<00:06:34.530> characters<00:06:35.160> I<00:06:35.370> just<00:06:36.150> think

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
different characters I just think

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.510 
different characters I just think
overall<00:06:36.810> this<00:06:37.139> iron<00:06:37.440> Patriot<00:06:38.070> figure<00:06:38.370> is

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
overall this iron Patriot figure is

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.460 
overall this iron Patriot figure is
really<00:06:39.060> nice<00:06:39.240> I<00:06:39.450> was<00:06:39.539> really<00:06:39.840> looking<00:06:40.139> forward

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
really nice I was really looking forward

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.100 
really nice I was really looking forward

to getting one I'm so glad I didn't make

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.860 
to getting one I'm so glad I didn't make
a<00:06:43.169> silly<00:06:43.889> custom<00:06:44.430> of<00:06:44.940> it<00:06:45.270> out<00:06:45.389> of<00:06:45.419> one<00:06:45.660> of<00:06:45.690> these

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
a silly custom of it out of one of these

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.750 
a silly custom of it out of one of these
what<00:06:46.200> a<00:06:46.229> waste<00:06:46.500> of<00:06:46.650> a<00:06:46.770> figure<00:06:47.099> right<00:06:47.280> that's

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
what a waste of a figure right that's
