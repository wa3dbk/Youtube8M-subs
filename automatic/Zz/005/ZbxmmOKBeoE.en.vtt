hassle<00:00:34.960> though<00:00:35.290> because<00:00:35.410> i<00:00:35.530> have<00:00:35.620> to<00:00:35.710> click

hassle though because i have to click

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.450 
hassle though because i have to click
the<00:00:35.980> icon<00:00:36.220> i<00:00:36.700> have<00:00:37.120> to<00:00:37.390> then<00:00:38.020> input<00:00:38.559> my<00:00:38.860> text<00:00:39.340> in

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
the icon i have to then input my text in

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.430 
the icon i have to then input my text in
a<00:00:39.550> separate<00:00:39.910> box<00:00:40.200> then<00:00:41.200> click<00:00:41.230> insert<00:00:43.440> then

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
a separate box then click insert then

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.770 
a separate box then click insert then
close<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:44.980> text<00:00:45.250> panel<00:00:45.550> so<00:00:46.240> i<00:00:46.270> think<00:00:46.390> that<00:00:46.660> we

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
close the text panel so i think that we

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.320 
close the text panel so i think that we
can<00:00:46.900> do<00:00:47.110> better<00:00:47.670> simply<00:00:48.670> by<00:00:48.790> taking<00:00:49.060> advantage

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
can do better simply by taking advantage

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.560 
can do better simply by taking advantage
of<00:00:49.720> an<00:00:50.230> ink<00:00:50.500> analysis<00:00:51.160> API<00:00:51.760> that's<00:00:52.030> available

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
of an ink analysis API that's available

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.720 
of an ink analysis API that's available
in<00:00:53.020> managed<00:00:53.470> code<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.530> in<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:56.920> saml<00:00:57.310> i'm<00:00:57.520> going

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
in managed code so in the saml i'm going

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.030 
in managed code so in the saml i'm going
to<00:00:57.790> go<00:00:57.880> find<00:00:58.120> those<00:00:58.420> text<00:00:58.989> boxes<00:00:59.440> i'm<00:00:59.829> actually

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
tho those granted settings we're going

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.539 
tho those granted settings we're going
to<00:01:22.690> make<00:01:22.870> it<00:01:23.020> a<00:01:23.080> text<00:01:23.350> block<00:01:23.740> instead<00:01:24.280> of<00:01:24.460> a

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
to make it a text block instead of a

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.620 
to make it a text block instead of a
text<00:01:24.880> box<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:25.390> I'm<00:01:25.990> going<00:01:26.110> to<00:01:26.170> give<00:01:26.290> it<00:01:26.409> a<00:01:26.440> name

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.050 

next<00:01:31.630> I'm<00:01:31.750> going<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:31.960> create<00:01:32.290> an<00:01:32.820> entity<00:01:33.820> of

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
next I'm going to create an entity of

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.469 
next I'm going to create an entity of
type<00:01:34.299> ink<00:01:34.810> canvas<00:01:35.590> right<00:01:36.159> so<00:01:36.400> this<00:01:36.610> gives<00:01:37.299> you

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
type ink canvas right so this gives you

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.090 
type ink canvas right so this gives you
a<00:01:37.510> lot<00:01:37.630> of<00:01:37.690> built-in<00:01:38.170> functionality<00:01:38.710> with

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
a lot of built-in functionality with

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.190 
a lot of built-in functionality with
respect<00:01:39.460> to<00:01:39.549> to<00:01:39.670> ink<00:01:39.909> so<00:01:40.630> i'll<00:01:40.720> give<00:01:40.840> it<00:01:40.869> a<00:01:41.020> name

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
respect to to ink so i'll give it a name

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.320 
respect to to ink so i'll give it a name
a<00:01:41.260> width<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:41.799> a<00:01:41.890> height<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.909> set<00:01:46.210> its

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
a width and a height it set its

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.960 
a width and a height it set its
background<00:01:46.570> color<00:01:47.110> so<00:01:47.650> we<00:01:47.799> can<00:01:47.979> tell<00:01:48.250> where

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
background color so we can tell where

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.210 
background color so we can tell where
the<00:01:49.119> canvas<00:01:49.510> is<00:01:49.720> it's<00:01:50.500> always<00:01:50.590> nice<00:01:50.920> for<00:01:50.950> the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
the canvas is it's always nice for the

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.830 
the canvas is it's always nice for the
user<00:01:51.369> to<00:01:51.460> be<00:01:51.670> able<00:01:51.700> to<00:01:51.909> see<00:01:52.090> where<00:01:52.689> they're

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840

going to write i'm also going to add an
event<00:01:54.549> handler<00:01:54.820> for<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.450> lost<00:01:55.869> focus<00:01:56.200> event

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
event handler for the lost focus event

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.770 
event handler for the lost focus event
let<00:01:57.640> me<00:01:57.700> go<00:01:57.820> back<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.150> add<00:01:58.330> an<00:01:58.420> event<00:01:58.510> handler

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
let me go back and add an event handler

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.539 
let me go back and add an event handler
for<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.320> text<00:01:59.680> block<00:01:59.799> as<00:02:00.159> well<00:02:00.430> for<00:02:01.180> it's

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
for the text block as well for it's

now you remember that we had three text
boxes<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.300> I'm<00:02:12.360> going<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.720> create<00:02:13.200> three

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
boxes so I'm going to create three

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.500 
boxes so I'm going to create three
copies<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.700> whole<00:02:15.290> set<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.819> elements<00:02:17.819> so

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
copies of that whole set of elements so

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.870 
copies of that whole set of elements so
three<00:02:19.020> grids<00:02:19.290> inside<00:02:20.069> of<00:02:20.190> which<00:02:20.340> are<00:02:20.550> three

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
three grids inside of which are three

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.090 
three grids inside of which are three
text<00:02:21.180> blocks<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.750> three<00:02:21.930> Inc<00:02:22.140> campuses<00:02:22.860> and

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
text blocks and three Inc campuses and

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.740 
text blocks and three Inc campuses and
I'm<00:02:23.610> going<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.790> fix<00:02:23.910> up<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.180> names<00:02:24.360> here<00:02:24.660> as

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
I'm going to fix up the names here as

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.140 
I'm going to fix up the names here as
well<00:02:24.930> just<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:25.620> they<00:02:25.709> all<00:02:25.800> have<00:02:25.980> unique<00:02:26.160> names

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.370 

now<00:02:30.150> I'm<00:02:30.209> going<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.420> go<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.570> code<00:02:30.810> behind<00:02:30.959> file

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
now I'm going to go to code behind file

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.080 
now I'm going to go to code behind file
and<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:32.340> first<00:02:32.520> thing<00:02:32.640> I'm<00:02:32.790> going<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.940> do<00:02:33.060> here

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
and the first thing I'm going to do here

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.650 
and the first thing I'm going to do here
is<00:02:33.630> add<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.670> using<00:02:35.670> statement<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.330> go<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.569> the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
is add a using statement so go to the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.010 
is add a using statement so go to the
top<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:37.640> day<00:02:38.640> using<00:02:38.850> statement<00:02:39.420> for<00:02:39.600> system

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
top a day using statement for system

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.380 
top a day using statement for system
windows<00:02:40.830> ink<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:43.550> then<00:02:44.550> go<00:02:44.730> back<00:02:44.760> down<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.300> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
windows ink and then go back down to the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.810 
windows ink and then go back down to the
event<00:02:45.780> handler<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.350> let's<00:02:46.830> implement<00:02:47.160> lost

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
event handler and let's implement lost

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.290 
event handler and let's implement lost
focus<00:02:48.120> first<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.769> I'm<00:02:49.860> going<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.120> retrieve<00:02:51.120> the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
focus first so I'm going to retrieve the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.630 
focus first so I'm going to retrieve the
ink<00:02:51.510> canvas<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:52.830> just<00:02:53.010> retrieve<00:02:53.430> that

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
ink canvas and I can just retrieve that

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.210 
ink canvas and I can just retrieve that
because<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.090> know<00:02:54.150> it's<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.540> sender<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.220> the

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.870 

next<00:03:12.750> I'm<00:03:12.900> going<00:03:13.079> to<00:03:13.170> retrieve<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.799> grid<00:03:14.100> that

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
next I'm going to retrieve the grid that

contains the Inca canvas because once i

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.030 
contains the Inca canvas because once i
have<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.760> grid<00:03:18.030> i<00:03:18.299> can<00:03:18.660> retrieve<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.560> text

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
have the grid i can retrieve the text

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.729 
have the grid i can retrieve the text
block<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.579> i<00:03:21.510> want<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.810> access<00:03:22.170> both<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.560> ink

all right now I want to create an object
of<00:03:33.569> type<00:03:33.629> ink<00:03:34.170> analyzer<00:03:34.739> but<00:03:35.129> you'll<00:03:35.220> notice

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
of type ink analyzer but you'll notice

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.869 
of type ink analyzer but you'll notice
that<00:03:35.519> it<00:03:35.730> doesn't<00:03:36.030> appear<00:03:36.269> there<00:03:37.879> that's

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
that it doesn't appear there that's

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.320 
that it doesn't appear there that's
because<00:03:39.299> it<00:03:40.069> does<00:03:41.069> not<00:03:41.099> ship<00:03:41.549> with<00:03:41.700> net<00:03:42.120> but

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
the ink canvas to our analyzer and then

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.529 
the ink canvas to our analyzer and then
here's<00:05:02.039> where<00:05:02.250> we<00:05:02.669> actually<00:05:02.789> do<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.360> ink

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539

here's where we actually do the ink
analysis<00:05:04.050> we<00:05:04.260> simply<00:05:04.560> call<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.770> analyze

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310

it'll perform the analysis and you can
