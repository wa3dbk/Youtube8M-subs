00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
on from comme des Garcons I think she's

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.289 
on from comme des Garcons I think she's
also<00:04:05.110> interesting<00:04:05.650> because<00:04:05.680> she<00:04:06.269> had<00:04:07.269> a

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
also interesting because she had a

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.870 
also interesting because she had a
magazine<00:04:07.870> in<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.350> 90s<00:04:08.799> called<00:04:08.950> six<00:04:09.489> which

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
magazine in the 90s called six which

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.949 
magazine in the 90s called six which
apparently<00:04:10.090> is<00:04:10.299> kind<00:04:10.450> of<00:04:10.480> really<00:04:10.720> hard<00:04:10.840> to

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
apparently is kind of really hard to

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.539 
apparently is kind of really hard to
find<00:04:11.140> I've<00:04:11.290> never<00:04:11.530> seen<00:04:11.739> a<00:04:11.769> copy<00:04:12.010> but<00:04:12.340> I'm

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
find I've never seen a copy but I'm

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.839 
find I've never seen a copy but I'm
trying<00:04:13.269> to<00:04:13.299> hunt<00:04:13.510> them<00:04:13.750> down<00:04:13.780> as<00:04:14.380> we<00:04:14.590> speak<00:04:14.849> she

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
trying to hunt them down as we speak she

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:16.819 
trying to hunt them down as we speak she
called<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.209> six

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829

has always been amazing at putting
there's<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.090> spirituality<00:04:21.659> and<00:04:22.079> an<00:04:22.139> energy

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
there's a spirituality and an energy

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.309 
there's a spirituality and an energy
behind<00:04:23.039> what<00:04:23.190> she<00:04:23.400> does<00:04:23.699> but<00:04:24.599> it's<00:04:25.199> not

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:25.319 
behind what she does but it's not

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.710 
behind what she does but it's not
obvious<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:26.370> he's<00:04:27.060> she's<00:04:27.330> not<00:04:27.479> trying<00:04:27.629> to

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
obvious and he's she's not trying to

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.749 
obvious and he's she's not trying to
shove<00:04:28.050> anything<00:04:28.199> down<00:04:28.590> your<00:04:28.770> throat<00:04:29.039> or<00:04:29.580> be<00:04:29.729> a

saint by any means I think it's just a

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.659 
saint by any means I think it's just a
continuous<00:04:32.690> exploration<00:04:33.690> of<00:04:33.870> her<00:04:34.050> own<00:04:34.669> wants
