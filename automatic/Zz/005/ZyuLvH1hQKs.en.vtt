00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 so I am right in the middle of the pampa 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.080
 stayed or after 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.179
 that does not work for a short while 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.700
 It is more like that when I am now 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.260
 Turn on the ignition works 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.390
 First of all, normal ignition is so 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:23.100
 instruments work on temper 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.609
 both trainers do not work 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.830
 more 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.590
 otherwise it does not work and if 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:37.950
 one wiggles at the ignition lock comes the 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:39.899
 the ads come back so meiners 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.520
 ignition lock as long as you must think 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.739
 be dismantled 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.360
 with five screws that was the last 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.219
 The upper panel does not bother now 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.870
 further now that have the ignition lock 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:04.199
 Mobile phone contact plate with a 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:06.180
 small circlip is provided 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.570
 Now you can be careful of this house 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.570
 pull 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.580
 important is that you get it straight out 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.479
 pull or what is even better in front of the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.890
 Battery disconnected 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:23.369
 so that there is a short circuit here 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:24.360
 and now you can already see that 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.049
 is broken 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.049
 the sz has completely dissolved 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.229
 There are also quick traces here 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.079
 So no wonder that here and not 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:46.290
 More works a lot if you 're in now 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.210
 Not it with a broken contact 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.290
 plate or otherwise damage the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.890
 To drive the ignition lock is very important 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.619
 plug in the key and open 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.390
 Turn on the steering wheel lock 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.189
 is developed and then we have one 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.390
 couple cable connect as well as that 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.750
 to make cars after too 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.020
 The brown ones come directly from the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.410
 alternator and these blue ones go 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.230
 for ignition and for 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.480
 to other botnet which we connect 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.850
 he just got up again 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.700
 the instruments accident in one 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:31.340
 ignition coil voltage and that the red 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.860
 here the orange pink pink that comes 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.510
 battery and now here goes 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.050
 directly to the occasion even if you the 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.190
 together shortly connect each plant 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:47.630
 and the vehicle jumps on 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:50.980
 stopping the cables is enough 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:57.170
 After taking off and the engine goes off 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.940
 the cables still go here to go 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.170
 to the euro and are under 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.510
 other things for light and such things 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.580
 responsible if you are still instructed 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.150
 you have to drive with light 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:16.130
 which the battery cable that 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:19.520
 Susanne stuck here next to the black one 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.780
 this is directly pressed and there goes 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.440
 not and things like that then go 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.690
 Likewise 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:37.810
 You can now back here where you 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:43.340
 here short connects the car to let 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:45.160
 Of course you have to do the broadcast 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.630
 associations 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.520
 so you 're so appealing too 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.470
 new cars and now it will be light 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.800
 and other features as well 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.800
 function
