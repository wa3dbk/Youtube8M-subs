00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
I'm originally from Mexico City when I

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.180

ever since

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.790 
ever since
I<00:00:12.530> think<00:00:13.530> my<00:00:13.710> first<00:00:14.210> influence<00:00:15.619> was<00:00:16.619> my

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
I think my first influence was my

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.769 
I think my first influence was my
parents<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.550> they<00:00:18.029> continue<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.600> be<00:00:18.720> an

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
parents and they continue to be an

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.290 
parents and they continue to be an
influence<00:00:19.170> my<00:00:19.980> mom's<00:00:20.220> an<00:00:20.400> artist<00:00:20.760> my<00:00:20.970> dad's<00:00:21.180> a

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
influence my mom's an artist my dad's a

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.560 
influence my mom's an artist my dad's a
photographer<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.859> think<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.490> was<00:00:24.000> basically

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
photographer so I think I was basically

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.859 
photographer so I think I was basically
born<00:00:24.750> into<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:26.060> printmaking<00:00:27.060> was<00:00:27.420> one<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.720> my

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
born into it printmaking was one of my

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.420 
born into it printmaking was one of my
first<00:00:28.429> like<00:00:29.429> serious<00:00:30.230> disciplines<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:32.130> this

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
first like serious disciplines so this

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.860 
first like serious disciplines so this
type<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.910> work<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.120> we're<00:00:33.420> looking<00:00:33.540> at<00:00:33.809> I

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
type of work that we're looking at I

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.780 
type of work that we're looking at I
think<00:00:34.050> comes<00:00:34.410> from<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
think comes from that I like the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.360 
think comes from that I like the
starkness<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.540> black<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.590> white<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.010> by

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
starkness of black and white and by

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.630 
starkness of black and white and by
contrast<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.440> never<00:00:40.440> felt<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.980> need<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.219> copy

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
contrast I never felt the need to copy

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.639 
contrast I never felt the need to copy
someone<00:00:42.059> else's<00:00:42.090> characters<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.320> always

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
someone else's characters so I always

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.920 
someone else's characters so I always
was<00:00:43.950> trying<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.340> invent<00:00:44.640> my<00:00:44.730> own<00:00:44.930> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
was trying to invent my own the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.380 
was trying to invent my own the
character<00:00:46.230> I'm<00:00:46.590> most<00:00:46.829> known<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.670> based<00:00:48.120> on

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
character I'm most known for is based on

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.389 
character I'm most known for is based on
the<00:00:48.510> Sabbath<00:00:48.840> Easter's<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.739> are<00:00:49.980> based<00:00:50.250> in

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the Sabbath Easter's that are based in

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.720 
the Sabbath Easter's that are based in
Chiapas<00:00:50.899> so<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.930> made<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> series<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.800> icons<00:00:53.070> that

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
Chiapas so I made a series of icons that

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.130 
Chiapas so I made a series of icons that
were<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.930> used<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:56.120> different<00:00:57.120> types<00:00:58.020> of

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
were to be used in different types of

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.930 
were to be used in different types of
activities<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.739> they're<00:00:59.070> promoting<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.910> I

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
activities that they're promoting so I

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.740 
activities that they're promoting so I
had<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> musician<00:01:00.930> Zapatista<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.920> had<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.750> spray

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
had a musician Zapatista I had the spray

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
cans up at ISA who represents visual

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.480

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490

of tar or chalk to me a street art Los
Angeles<00:01:47.820> gets<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.180> lot<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.360> attention<00:01:48.710> first

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
Angeles gets a lot of attention first

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.249 
Angeles gets a lot of attention first
for<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> cliched<00:01:50.850> reasons<00:01:51.240> where<00:01:51.479> Hollywood

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
for the cliched reasons where Hollywood

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.149 
for the cliched reasons where Hollywood
or<00:01:52.560> like<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.979> big<00:01:53.700> media<00:01:53.939> capital<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> world

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
or like a big media capital of the world

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.130 
or like a big media capital of the world
so<00:01:56.159> things<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.759> happen<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.180> LA<00:01:57.509> have<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> lot

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
so things that happen in LA have a lot

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.700 
so things that happen in LA have a lot
of<00:01:58.670> cameras<00:01:59.670> per<00:02:00.450> se<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.659> pointed<00:02:01.350> at<00:02:01.500> them

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
of course in a city like LA there's

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.499 
of course in a city like LA there's
risks<00:02:04.619> there's<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.189> rest<00:02:05.460> people<00:02:05.909> doing<00:02:06.149> time

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
risks there's the rest people doing time

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.469 
risks there's the rest people doing time
for<00:02:06.540> putting<00:02:07.259> work<00:02:07.530> out<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.129> streets

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
for putting work out on the streets

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.300 
for putting work out on the streets
there's<00:02:09.479> also<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.840> differentiation<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:11.250> the

there's also a differentiation in the
