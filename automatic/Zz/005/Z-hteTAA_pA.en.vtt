really<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> powerful<00:01:07.560> spec<00:01:07.979> sheet<00:01:08.250> what's

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
really it's a powerful spec sheet what's

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.190 
really it's a powerful spec sheet what's
interesting<00:01:08.939> though<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> US<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.020> we

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
find that these devices sell pretty well

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.160 
find that these devices sell pretty well
when<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.210> get<00:01:12.299> either<00:01:12.659> carrier
