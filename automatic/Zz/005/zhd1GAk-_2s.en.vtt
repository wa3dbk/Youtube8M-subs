00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.310
 second semifinal 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.820
 so it happened 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.769
 will pass 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.769
 I think 600 residents of the republic 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:17.689
 deputy pkrm at all 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.439
 Rashid Safin 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.070
 after fireworks lose 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.929
 such a move 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.779
 this 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.510
 m 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.350
 this approach to the question wanted 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.350
 such an approach 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.690
 since coupons 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.690
 Crowley 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.730
 This implies 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.500
 I will write 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.090
 adobe flash player 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.090
 pskov 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 I think 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.850
 it is better 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.850
 Yes indeed 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.960
 plenipotentiary 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.180
 when coming off 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.180
 lost 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.110
 Critics here is someone just 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.290
 cube 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.290
 bullet bullet ogly volume 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.229
 so like this 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.619
 while I tell you 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:15.389
 to Ukraine 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.669
 platform Kola Fukushima NPP buying 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.599
 square 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.599
 but defense 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:30.829
 and then 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.319
 the finalized draft will be 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.289
 Further 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:37.339
 about two square meters
