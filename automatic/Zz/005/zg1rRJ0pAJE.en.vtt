00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
so it's got a you know real low fire

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.470 
so it's got a you know real low fire
rate<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.280> still<00:00:38.460> does<00:00:38.670> have<00:00:38.850> an<00:00:38.940> explosive

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
it's got a very low fire rate so it's

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.500 
it's got a very low fire rate so it's
actually<00:00:47.039> not<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.250> great<00:00:47.520> sniper<00:00:47.789> rifle<00:00:48.239> for

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
