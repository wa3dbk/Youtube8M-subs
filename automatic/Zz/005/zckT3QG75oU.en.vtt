00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.080 
generation only comes in 32 and 64
gigabytes<00:00:50.200> because<00:00:50.710> it<00:00:51.190> needs<00:00:51.460> more<00:00:51.760> store

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
gigabytes because it needs more store

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.630 
gigabytes because it needs more store
more<00:00:52.630> storied<00:00:53.380> than<00:00:53.380> just<00:00:53.980> a<00:00:54.190> good<00:00:54.430> bite

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
more storied than just a good bite

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.510 
more storied than just a good bite
because<00:00:54.910> it<00:00:55.210> has<00:00:55.420> siri<00:00:55.750> it<00:00:56.380> has<00:00:56.680> better<00:00:56.980> better

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
because it has siri it has better better

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.510 
because it has siri it has better better
camera<00:00:58.300> so<00:00:58.510> that<00:00:58.540> means<00:00:58.899> better<00:00:59.620> quality<00:01:00.310> and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
camera so that means better quality and

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.660 
camera so that means better quality and
pictures<00:01:01.329> that<00:01:02.110> means<00:01:02.350> it<00:01:02.680> will<00:01:02.860> take<00:01:03.040> up<00:01:03.280> more

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
pictures that means it will take up more

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.820 
pictures that means it will take up more
space<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.870> that's<00:01:05.350> why<00:01:05.620> I<00:01:05.650> pitaj<00:01:06.960> requires<00:01:07.960> 32

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
space so that's why I pitaj requires 32

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.450 
space so that's why I pitaj requires 32
gigabytes<00:01:09.310> minimum<00:01:09.790> that's<00:01:10.450> what<00:01:10.659> I<00:01:10.690> think

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
gigabytes minimum that's what I think

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.690 
gigabytes minimum that's what I think

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
dock connector on ipod touch 4g was

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.339 
dock connector on ipod touch 4g was
pretty<00:02:38.720> big<00:02:39.019> it<00:02:39.319> was<00:02:39.680> 30<00:02:40.489> pin<00:02:40.819> connector<00:02:41.349> while

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
pretty big it was 30 pin connector while

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.309 
pretty big it was 30 pin connector while
the<00:02:42.709> new<00:02:42.859> ipod<00:02:43.340> touch<00:02:43.549> 5<00:02:44.540> general<00:02:44.900> 5th

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
the new ipod touch 5 general 5th

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.460 
the new ipod touch 5 general 5th
generation<00:02:45.879> has<00:02:46.879> the<00:02:47.060> new<00:02:47.239> connector<00:02:48.109> called

generation has the new connector called

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.059 
generation has the new connector called
lightning<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:50.060> that's<00:02:50.239> because<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:51.379> is<00:02:51.590> just

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
lightning so that's because it is just

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.550 
lightning so that's because it is just
faster<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.480> can<00:02:53.690> bake<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:54.200> can<00:02:54.409> buy

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
faster you can bake you can buy

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.890 
faster you can bake you can buy

if<00:03:50.510> I<00:03:50.780> talk<00:03:51.079> about<00:03:51.109> 8<00:03:51.590> gigabytes<00:03:52.099> is<00:03:52.879> two

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
if I talk about 8 gigabytes is two

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.080 
if I talk about 8 gigabytes is two
hundred<00:03:53.209> dollars<00:03:53.900> but<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:55.280> new<00:03:55.430> ipod<00:03:55.909> touch

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
hundred dollars but the new ipod touch

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.119 
hundred dollars but the new ipod touch
doesn't<00:03:56.419> come<00:03:56.780> in<00:03:57.879> you<00:03:58.879> can<00:03:59.090> buy<00:03:59.299> it<00:03:59.359> in<00:03:59.659> 8

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.789
