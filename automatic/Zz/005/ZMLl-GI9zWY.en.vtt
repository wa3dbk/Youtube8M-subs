00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 in february 2015 big big awaits us 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.560
 directorial debut in german cinemas and 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.360
 With that we take a look at the first one 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:19.529
 German trailer to the promise 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:22.350
 a life prince hussein asked the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.960
 man why to sell the carpet 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.960
 be sought so expensive and up 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.030
 tango a prince who is on this 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.660
 Carpet sets will instantly 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.660
 float through the air 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.940
 It was my job from my boys 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.879
 to make men and I failed 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.930
 you can find water but not 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.350
 of your own children three sons all 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.180
 dead 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.109
 That was a tough test for ever 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.010
 quieter i find you favorites i find 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.010
 she brings her back to you 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.570
 i am not that tourist 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.170
 I want to Gallipoli because there are 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.000
 Ghosts certainly know that 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.830
 here restricted area is here it is not 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.390
 I'm sure you'll have to go back 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.610
 maybe we can help them 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.290
 They know how hopeless his search 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.220
 he is the only driver of the 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.230
 he came is the type as at the 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.870
 Assassin has half a battalion 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.480
 killed we found your sons 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.130
 Edward and cellphone 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.820
 How in the world did they know 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.820
 that they are there 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.409
 take care of your brothers and get up 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.409
 the hat 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.909
 he was caught that you are son 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.909
 he did not die here 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.020
 I do not know but we have 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.680
 hope for now is indispensable 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.680
 come the camps do not exist anymore 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.060
 if you go home nobody comes 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.420
 let's say from penal camps in which 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.140
 Japan 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.640
 I had with him 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.520
 I promised her mother that 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.960
 I find her and bring her home 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.940
 I 'm measuring a man after how much 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.360
 his children, not after what he directly 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.360
 done 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.800
 when you find your son 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.800
 what will she say 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.319
 basically I see russell crowe 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.400
 I also like it quite clearly 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.379
 that must be enough for him 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.060
 be low topic because it just 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.560
 Australian soldiers and Australian 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.969
 also lost or caught 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.480
 taken soldiers in the first world war 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.859
 in 1915 1916 could give that one 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.299
 be special but on the 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.709
 on the other hand, it is the story 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.389
 a man after his sons 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.370
 look for and this fights for that 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.290
 promise a life the universal 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.870
 pictures expected from 26 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.010
 february 2015 in German cinemas 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.040
 bring tells the story of one 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.750
 family father the more 1919 his wife 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.669
 promises to find his sons again 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.889
 because 3 he had them as dead resp 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.510
 as lost and swears but this 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.280
 sum up to bring back to his mother 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.049
 and all that packed together 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.579
 of course a great historical drama 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.349
 also packed in a venue of the 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.849
 first world war for the German 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.680
 eye is not so typical right now because 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.079
 Australia felt so far away from the view 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.760
 Kerkau more care into it leaves the 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.260
 global happen at that time though 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.760
 also finally with russell crowe 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.409
 not only behind the camera but in front 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.879
 the camera has a main actor there 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.540
 just have a lot to offer and that 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.219
 I like it a bit 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.900
 curious that could be very soulful 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:47.639
 but drama are just at regiedebÃ¼ts 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.930
 hollywood stars like to lend a hand as well 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.519
 a bit on the nose but 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.079
 in addition, in his homeland measures 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.370
 it produces can quite be that he 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.659
 just trying a very own and 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.370
 important story of his own 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.540
 to tell and act on behalf of the country 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.709
 if it really is the heart of the story 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.780
 A father's is for his sons 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.009
 Fighting and wanting to go away can do that 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.299
 be very moving and I have to be quite 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:04.620
 I honestly say with the trailer 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.699
 not really what to expect 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.620
 then you can not assign correctly 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.060
 but basically russell crowe me 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.680
 I look forward to it and then we wait 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.819
 that's my second trailer off and 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.470
 until the 26th 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.299
 february is still a long way 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.820
 and that's what I'm about with the trailer 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.680
 the promise of a life in the original 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.449
 the water darwin like to have one 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.979
 thumbs since we made this video let 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.419
 we will not stay that way otherwise 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.680
 There are still a few left around me 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.659
 around and tomorrow at 15 o'clock of course 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.310
 at the latest a new video 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:33.710
 and then I hope you are again 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.710
 with of course at 3
