00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.260
 to be with her again today 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.710
 if we save on calories then 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.800
 there are hearty mozzarella far and wide 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.200
 while 1000 is still in the whole 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.710
 deep fried and this tasty nut 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.789
 are also suitable as a starter or for 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.710
 example as a snack for 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.010
 in between if you 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.570
 if neither simple heating and that 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.090
 As you can always find in the recipe below 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.590
 the video description and how that now 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.160
 goes and what you need it for 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.160
 I'll show you now 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.520
 three mozzarella balls 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:12.210
 pannier about 80 to 90 grams 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.210
 six slices of toast 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.250
 about 40 grams of flour 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.020
 two eggs 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.900
 a quarter teaspoon of garlic powder 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.900
 a quarter teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.979
 cornflour slightly oregano parsley 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.840
 and basil 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.940
 and some more salt and pepper too 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.500
 season the mozzarella and all that 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.690
 makes two big mozzarella toasts 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.220
 or for starters portions 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.710
 We halve the tour 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.030
 First we will prepare the three 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.979
 lose stations 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.979
 For that, we need the starch with the flour 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:01.530
 Whisk two eggs and seasoning the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.439
 breadcrumbs with a quarter teaspoon 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.970
 salt a philippina for garlic 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.590
 powder 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.590
 About half a teaspoon of oregano 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.730
 about a teaspoon dried 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.990
 parsley and some basil to 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.620
 Of course you can also dried 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.620
 take if you want 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.730
 well distributed and then everything first 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.560
 set aside then we cut from 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.959
 three slices of bread together 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.490
 around the edge off for one 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.040
 we need a total of relative patterns 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.760
 three slices of toast and one to 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.260
 one and a half ball mozzarella being there 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.100
 It depends on whether we prefer more 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.570
 or less cheese on it I want 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.280
 always take one and a half cool 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.950
 and quickly put these into series 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.110
 centimeters thick slices 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.550
 since we share a biplane build 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.800
 we have the whole mozzarella for one 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.330
 toast in half and top up with 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.860
 one half is the first tourist 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.599
 switch must be something strange and 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.940
 also be snipped something with it 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.840
 everything fits well and as well as possible 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.840
 is even 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.420
 then she will give me salt and pepper 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.160
 and give some oregano here too 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.470
 some parsley 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.430
 and basil on it 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.050
 something is covered with the second disc 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.830
 flatten and play the whole game 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.030
 again from the beginning 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.510
 as evenly as possible and mozzarella 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.510
 occupy 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.400
 and again with salt pepper 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.500
 oregano 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.500
 parsley 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.650
 and basil seasoning 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.930
 Press the top of the lid a little and 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.000
 may want to be harder over the 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.470
 edges looks around so cut 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.470
 that we get smooth edges 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.220
 breading does me the whole house 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.220
 first in the eggs 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.290
 then in the mixture 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.870
 beautiful in it sees world 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.820
 back in the eggs 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.870
 and then comes his today's bmi 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.180
 and if it's nice even with it 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.500
 is covered comes around again 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:33.110
 a thin layer of the media already 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:35.590
 on it again evenly 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.590
 to think about it 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.970
 and off we go to fry 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.970
 like you see mozzarella thom 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.920
 something high so that the 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.720
 surface is not completely covered but 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.610
 that it's not that bad because we turn 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.660
 they'll just be good so soon afterwards 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.660
 on the one hand wanted 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.440
 and if he has a nice golden brown 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.360
 is and not from my feeling 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.280
 think that he's in melted cheese 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.720
 I'll get him out and suck you with one 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.720
 kitchen paper first some oil on 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:27.639
 to make the toast every six months 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:31.389
 diagonal 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.860
 that would be triangles out and so on 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:36.099
 a triangle is one for me 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.610
 appetizer otherwise it just becomes something 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:38.610
 powerful 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:43.269
 we always eat this dish with the 

00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:45.579
 Tomato sauce I recently told you 

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:48.929
 have shown and the video to this 

00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:48.929
 Sauce is also linked here 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:53.990
 still wrestling fast with a few olives 

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:55.909
 to decorate parsley and done 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.979
 put mozzarella tourist and serve 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:07:00.050

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:01.879

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.229
