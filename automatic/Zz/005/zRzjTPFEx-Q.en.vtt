I wanted to tell you a couple different
ways<00:00:02.879> that<00:00:03.179> you<00:00:03.210> can<00:00:03.389> trigger<00:00:03.600> your<00:00:03.870> flash<00:00:04.250> now

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:05.299 
ways that you can trigger your flash now

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.480 
ways that you can trigger your flash now
this<00:00:06.299> particular<00:00:06.509> flash<00:00:07.140> fits<00:00:07.950> right<00:00:08.160> on<00:00:08.220> my

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
this particular flash fits right on my

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.669 
this particular flash fits right on my
candidate<00:00:09.000> it's<00:00:09.150> also<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.450> can<00:00:09.719> until<00:00:10.019> it's

candidate it's also a can until it's

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.320 
candidate it's also a can until it's
made<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.040> work<00:00:11.190> really<00:00:11.490> well<00:00:11.610> with<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.240> it

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
made of work really well with it and it

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.390 
made of work really well with it and it
can<00:00:12.509> just<00:00:12.599> slide<00:00:12.870> right<00:00:12.900> on<00:00:13.139> there<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:14.040> flash

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
can just slide right on there this flash

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.099 
can just slide right on there this flash
is<00:00:14.700> triggered<00:00:15.030> when<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.420> press<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.080> shutter

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
is triggered when you press the shutter

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.050 
is triggered when you press the shutter
speed<00:00:16.680> as<00:00:16.859> long<00:00:17.310> as<00:00:17.430> you've<00:00:17.550> got<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.850> flash

bracket<00:00:21.750> like<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:23.720> this<00:00:24.720> would<00:00:24.930> actually

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
bracket like this this would actually

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.269 
bracket like this this would actually
attached<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.740> bottom<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.519> camera<00:00:27.480> and

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
attached to the bottom of the camera and

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.950 
attached to the bottom of the camera and
then<00:00:29.279> you've<00:00:29.460> got<00:00:29.699> your<00:00:29.730> flash<00:00:30.150> up<00:00:30.420> here<00:00:30.689> but

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
then you've got your flash up here but

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.330 
then you've got your flash up here but
you<00:00:31.050> still<00:00:31.109> need<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.439> connect<00:00:31.769> your<00:00:31.890> flash<00:00:32.130> to

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
you still need to connect your flash to

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.670 
you still need to connect your flash to
your<00:00:32.430> camera<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.840> way<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> do<00:00:34.320> that

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
your camera and the way that I do that

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.530 
your camera and the way that I do that
is<00:00:34.920> with<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:36.120> hot<00:00:36.420> shoe<00:00:36.690> adapter<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:39.360> hot

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
is with this hot shoe adapter the hot

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.299 
is with this hot shoe adapter the hot
shoe<00:00:39.750> adapter<00:00:39.780> connects<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> hot<00:00:40.950> shoe<00:00:41.160> on

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
shoe adapter connects to the hot shoe on

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.729 
shoe adapter connects to the hot shoe on
your<00:00:41.460> camera<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.180> also<00:00:43.079> makes<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> same

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
your camera and also makes the same

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.760 
your camera and also makes the same
connection<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:45.030> bottom<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.360> your<00:00:45.390> flash

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
connection on the bottom of your flash

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.590 
connection on the bottom of your flash
so<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.370> only<00:00:47.520> works<00:00:47.850> though<00:00:48.059> if<00:00:48.210> your<00:00:48.360> flash

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
so that only works though if your flash

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.020 
so that only works though if your flash
is<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> very<00:00:49.200> close<00:00:49.680> distance<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:50.550> camera

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
is a very close distance to your camera

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.060 
is a very close distance to your camera
what<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:51.899> your<00:00:52.020> flash<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.410> even<00:00:52.649> further<00:00:52.829> away

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
what if your flash is even further away

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.110 
what if your flash is even further away
in<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:54.420> case<00:00:54.660> you're<00:00:55.110> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> need<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:56.120> sync

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
in that case you're going to need a sync

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.630 
in that case you're going to need a sync
cord<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:58.379> cord<00:00:58.739> will<00:00:58.949> run<00:00:59.129> all<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.609> way

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
cord and this cord will run all the way

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.869 
cord and this cord will run all the way
to<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.600> pc<00:01:00.780> import<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.440> your<00:01:01.590> flash<00:01:01.859> from<00:01:02.820> your

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
to the pc import on your flash from your

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.450 
to the pc import on your flash from your
camera<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.680> as<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.040> see<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.430> a

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
camera and as you can see this is a

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.969 
camera and as you can see this is a
pretty<00:01:06.240> long<00:01:06.869> sync<00:01:07.530> cord<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.310> third<00:01:08.610> way<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
pretty long sync cord the third way and

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.190 
pretty long sync cord the third way and
the<00:01:10.979> way<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.119> most<00:01:12.299> latitude

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the way that you have the most latitude

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.289 
the way that you have the most latitude
is<00:01:13.470> with<00:01:14.010> these<00:01:14.250> things<00:01:14.400> called<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.970> pocket

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
is with these things called a pocket

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.649 
is with these things called a pocket
wizard<00:01:15.630> now<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:17.100> sell<00:01:17.400> these<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.479> don't

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
wizard now they sell these and you don't

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.179 
wizard now they sell these and you don't
have<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.869> buy<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> pocketwizard<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.890> pocket

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
have to buy the pocketwizard the pocket

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.030 
have to buy the pocketwizard the pocket
wizard<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.520> probably<00:01:20.970> um<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.470> know<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.619> most

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
wizard is probably um you know the most

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.910 
wizard is probably um you know the most
well-known<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.360> brands<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.049> also

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
well-known of the brands and also

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.249 
well-known of the brands and also
probably<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> most<00:01:26.820> expensive<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.990> can

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
probably the most expensive so you can

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.660 
probably the most expensive so you can
go<00:01:28.409> online<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.979> find<00:01:29.159> different

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
go online and find different

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.510 
go online and find different
transmitters<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.659> are<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> lot<00:01:31.619> less<00:01:31.829> each

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
transmitters that are a lot less each

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.760 
transmitters that are a lot less each
one<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.850> these<00:01:33.140> transceivers<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.409> about<00:01:34.619> two

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
one of these transceivers is about two

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.190 
one of these transceivers is about two
hundred<00:01:34.860> dollars<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> piece<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.600> need<00:01:36.810> one

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
hundred dollars a piece and you need one

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.170 
hundred dollars a piece and you need one
for<00:01:37.530> your<00:01:37.650> camera<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.400> then<00:01:38.700> an<00:01:39.030> additional

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
for your camera and then an additional

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.950 
for your camera and then an additional
one<00:01:39.720> for<00:01:40.020> each<00:01:40.259> flash<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.360> if

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
one for each flash that you have so if

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.980 
one for each flash that you have so if
you<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.350> find<00:01:43.560> some<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> more<00:01:44.220> affordable

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
you can find some of the more affordable

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.929 
you can find some of the more affordable
transceivers<00:01:45.990> sometimes<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.490> less

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
transceivers sometimes the less

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.760 
transceivers sometimes the less
expensive<00:01:48.270> ones<00:01:48.630> actually<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.409> a

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
expensive ones actually have a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.510 
expensive ones actually have a
transmitter<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.420> receiver<00:01:51.530> or<00:01:52.530> these<00:01:52.740> you

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
transmitter and a receiver or these you

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.630 
transmitter and a receiver or these you
know<00:01:53.640> they<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.210> either<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.799> but<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:56.159> lot<00:01:56.610> of

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
know they can be either one but a lot of

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.770 
know they can be either one but a lot of
times<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.030> get<00:01:57.299> away<00:01:57.390> with<00:01:57.630> that

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
times you can get away with that

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.359 
times you can get away with that
especially<00:01:58.439> if<00:01:58.590> you're<00:01:58.770> not<00:01:58.950> trying<00:01:59.280> to

especially if you're not trying to

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.940 
especially if you're not trying to
transmit<00:01:59.759> far<00:02:00.119> distances<00:02:00.799> where<00:02:01.799> these

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
transmit far distances where these

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.120 
transmit far distances where these
really<00:02:02.369> come<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.670> handy<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:03.469> if<00:02:04.469> you're<00:02:04.890> doing

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
really come in handy is if you're doing

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.039 
really come in handy is if you're doing
something<00:02:05.340> portable<00:02:05.790> like<00:02:06.360> for<00:02:06.630> example<00:02:06.689> I

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
something portable like for example I

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.229 
something portable like for example I
just<00:02:07.259> shot<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.469> wedding<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> beach<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.819> had

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
just shot a wedding on a beach so I had

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.969 
just shot a wedding on a beach so I had
one<00:02:09.720> pocket<00:02:10.110> wizard<00:02:10.319> attached<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.860> this

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
one pocket wizard attached to this

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.580 
one pocket wizard attached to this
camera<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.700> then<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.150> used<00:02:12.450> my<00:02:12.569> small<00:02:13.110> straw

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
camera and then I used my small straw

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.250 
camera and then I used my small straw
bulb<00:02:13.739> on<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.040> stand<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.209> an<00:02:15.330> umbrella<00:02:15.599> light<00:02:15.989> a

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
few feet away from me and it was great

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.640 
few feet away from me and it was great
because<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.690> didn't<00:02:18.870> have<00:02:18.959> any<00:02:19.140> cords<00:02:19.530> for

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650

anyone to trip on and I was able to fire

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.589 
anyone to trip on and I was able to fire
my<00:02:21.810> flash<00:02:22.340> these<00:02:23.340> also<00:02:23.640> work<00:02:24.030> through<00:02:24.300> walls

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
my flash these also work through walls

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.479 
my flash these also work through walls
so<00:02:25.260> if<00:02:25.530> you're<00:02:25.650> trying<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.980> do<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.190> very

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
so if you're trying to do a very

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.550 
so if you're trying to do a very
intricate<00:02:26.910> set<00:02:27.239> up<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.870> could<00:02:28.050> fire<00:02:28.290> your

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
intricate set up you could fire your

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.890 
intricate set up you could fire your
flash<00:02:28.830> remotely<00:02:29.550> using<00:02:29.879> your<00:02:30.299> pocket<00:02:30.629> wizard

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
flash remotely using your pocket wizard

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.070 
flash remotely using your pocket wizard
and<00:02:31.250> if<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.400> wanted<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.790> do<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.000> self<00:02:33.330> portrait<00:02:33.599> I

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
and if I wanted to do a self portrait I

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.920 
and if I wanted to do a self portrait I
could<00:02:34.680> actually<00:02:34.860> have<00:02:35.430> one<00:02:35.700> connected<00:02:36.299> to<00:02:36.810> my

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
could actually have one connected to my

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.119 
could actually have one connected to my
camera<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.760> fire<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.030> camera<00:02:39.360> remotely<00:02:39.720> or

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
camera and fire the camera remotely or

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.589 
camera and fire the camera remotely or
one<00:02:41.129> connected<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.879> strobe<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.480> the

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
one connected to the strobe and the

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.900 
one connected to the strobe and the
camera<00:02:42.930> on<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.080> self-timer<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.980> fire<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:44.730> that

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
camera on a self-timer and fire it that

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.670 
camera on a self-timer and fire it that
way<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.780> there's<00:02:46.049> a<00:02:46.110> lot<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.319> different<00:02:46.440> ways

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
way so there's a lot of different ways

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.339 
way so there's a lot of different ways
that<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.010> can<00:02:47.220> trigger<00:02:47.489> your<00:02:48.269> flashes<00:02:49.140> and

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
that you can trigger your flashes and

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.740 
that you can trigger your flashes and
they<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.310> be<00:02:50.340> beneficial<00:02:50.610> depending<00:02:51.450> on<00:02:51.569> your

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
they can be beneficial depending on your

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.270 
they can be beneficial depending on your
exposure<00:02:52.200> or<00:02:52.530> if<00:02:52.680> you're<00:02:52.799> trying<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.069> create<00:02:53.160> a

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
exposure or if you're trying to create a

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.880 
exposure or if you're trying to create a
certain<00:02:53.579> effect
