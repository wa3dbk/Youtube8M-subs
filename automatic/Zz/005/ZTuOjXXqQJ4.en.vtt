00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
pull them out now when I come across one

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.950 
pull them out now when I come across one

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
doesn't quite go all the way through I

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.130 
doesn't quite go all the way through I
just<00:02:03.060> skip<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:05.420> then<00:02:06.420> at<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> very<00:02:06.840> end
