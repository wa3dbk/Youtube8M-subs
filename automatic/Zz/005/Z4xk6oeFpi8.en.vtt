maximum aperture of f/4 means you're not

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.520 
maximum aperture of f/4 means you're not

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
really letting in a huge amount of light

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.920 
really letting in a huge amount of light
even<00:03:43.370> if<00:03:43.519> this<00:03:43.700> is<00:03:43.880> a<00:03:43.910> bit<00:03:44.180> better<00:03:44.389> than<00:03:44.780> the

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
even if this is a bit better than the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.110 
even if this is a bit better than the
cheaper<00:03:45.349> lenses

the amazing image quality will make it
