00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
so what we're going to do is we're

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.750 
so what we're going to do is we're
actually<00:04:22.420> going<00:04:22.660> to<00:04:22.750> remove<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:24.430> Wabash

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
actually going to remove the Wabash

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.340 

start<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.910> see<00:04:30.030> how<00:04:30.120> big<00:04:30.420> the<00:04:30.570> actual<00:04:31.110> gather

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
start to see how big the actual gather

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.840 
start to see how big the actual gather
is<00:04:31.620> now<00:04:32.540> it's<00:04:33.540> actually<00:04:34.310> it's<00:04:35.310> quite<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:35.550> large

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
is now it's actually it's quite a large

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.260 
is now it's actually it's quite a large
piece<00:04:37.400> probably<00:04:38.400> about<00:04:38.610> still<00:04:38.970> have<00:04:39.060> two

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
piece probably about still have two

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.420 
piece probably about still have two
inches<00:04:39.690> it's<00:04:40.350> leaking<00:04:40.650> for<00:04:40.800> tutors<00:04:41.070> plenty<00:04:41.340> of

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
inches it's leaking for tutors plenty of

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.400

haven't<00:04:43.650> actually<00:04:43.830> been<00:04:44.100> out<00:04:44.250> and<00:04:44.400> collected

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
haven't actually been out and collected

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.820 
haven't actually been out and collected
than<00:04:44.910> you<00:04:45.000> would<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:45.300> do<00:04:45.420> this<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:45.870> I'm<00:04:46.710> not

than you would to do this and I'm not
going<00:04:47.010> to<00:04:47.070> sit<00:04:47.190> in<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.430> because<00:04:47.580> it's<00:04:48.120> made<00:04:48.720> out

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
going to sit in it because it's made out

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.500 
going to sit in it because it's made out
of<00:04:49.440> pause<00:04:49.910> but<00:04:50.910> it<00:04:51.030> just<00:04:51.180> give<00:04:51.390> you<00:04:51.450> the

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
of pause but it just give you the

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.830 
of pause but it just give you the
idea<00:04:51.660> of<00:04:51.930> how<00:04:52.080> it<00:04:52.110> can<00:04:52.350> be<00:04:52.440> used<00:04:53.570> then<00:04:54.570> you<00:04:54.660> take

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
idea of how it can be used then you take

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.920 
idea of how it can be used then you take
your<00:04:54.870> gathered<00:04:55.320> piece<00:04:57.920> try<00:04:58.920> that<00:04:59.130> off<00:04:59.900> to<00:05:00.900> the

a<00:05:03.450> little<00:05:03.570> bit<00:05:03.720> bigger<00:05:03.870> than<00:05:04.020> this<00:05:04.170> worried

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
a little bit bigger than this worried

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.570 
a little bit bigger than this worried
about<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.830> same<00:05:05.010> package<00:05:05.310> your<00:05:05.430> head

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
stick up a little bit I like to tidy up

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.420 
stick up a little bit I like to tidy up
inning<00:05:15.260> and<00:05:15.470> he's<00:05:15.560> sharp<00:05:15.830> modules<00:05:16.370> that

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
inning and he's sharp modules that

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.880 
inning and he's sharp modules that
hanging<00:05:16.790> up<00:05:16.910> and<00:05:17.120> we<00:05:18.110> made<00:05:18.320> these<00:05:18.470> are<00:05:18.620> quite<00:05:18.860> a

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
hanging up and we made these are quite a

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.830 
hanging up and we made these are quite a
lightweight<00:05:19.250> fabric<00:05:19.760> for<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:20.360> reason<00:05:20.630> of<00:05:20.720> its

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
lightweight fabric for the reason of its

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.280 
lightweight fabric for the reason of its
being<00:05:21.050> lightweight<00:05:21.430> so<00:05:22.930> it's<00:05:23.930> good<00:05:24.110> practice

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
being lightweight so it's good practice

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.770 
being lightweight so it's good practice
really<00:05:24.770> too<00:05:25.030> tiny<00:05:26.030> the<00:05:26.240> mother's<00:05:26.570> going

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
really too tiny the mother's going

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.240 
really too tiny the mother's going
through<00:05:26.870> fabric<00:05:27.230> and<00:05:27.560> you<00:05:27.800> don't<00:05:27.950> really<00:05:28.070> want

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
through fabric and you don't really want

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.030 
through fabric and you don't really want
to<00:05:28.310> look<00:05:28.430> to<00:05:28.610> this<00:05:28.730> the<00:05:29.300> fabric<00:05:29.690> itself<00:05:30.040> being

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
to look to this the fabric itself being

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.760 
to look to this the fabric itself being
slightly<00:05:31.310> pulled<00:05:31.640> through<00:05:32.350> can<00:05:33.350> you<00:05:33.440> pop<00:05:33.620> it

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
slightly pulled through can you pop it

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.530 
slightly pulled through can you pop it
down<00:05:33.890> now<00:05:34.190> what<00:05:34.370> happens<00:05:34.400> is<00:05:34.820> when<00:05:35.240> you<00:05:35.330> sit

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
down now what happens is when you sit

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.140 
down now what happens is when you sit
into<00:05:35.690> there<00:05:36.050> that's<00:05:37.010> it<00:05:37.250> so<00:05:37.460> and<00:05:37.910> what<00:05:38.060> you

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
into there that's it so and what you

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.999 
into there that's it so and what you
actually<00:05:38.240> creating<00:05:38.750> it<00:05:38.870> like<00:05:38.990> a<00:05:39.020> book<00:05:39.230> at<00:05:39.380> sea

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:42.009 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:47.830 

your<00:05:43.009> area<00:05:43.580> not<00:05:43.699> a<00:05:43.729> lot<00:05:43.969> bigger

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.540 

as<00:05:48.840> I<00:05:48.930> mentioned<00:05:48.960> to<00:05:49.740> the<00:05:49.830> back<00:05:50.010> to<00:05:50.160> the<00:05:50.280> next

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
as I mentioned to the back to the next

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.629 
as I mentioned to the back to the next
so<00:05:51.210> that's<00:05:51.389> it<00:05:51.510> use<00:05:51.750> in<00:05:52.230> what<00:05:53.070> the<00:05:53.160> traditional

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
so that's it use in what the traditional

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.360 
so that's it use in what the traditional
method<00:05:53.730> used<00:05:54.630> to<00:05:54.750> build<00:05:55.080> grain<00:05:55.350> sacks<00:05:55.710> and

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
method used to build grain sacks and

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.460 
method used to build grain sacks and
just<00:05:56.880> cut<00:05:57.120> holding<00:05:57.479> the<00:05:57.570> bottom<00:05:57.870> of<00:05:57.960> them<00:05:58.080> put

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
just cut holding the bottom of them put

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.340 
just cut holding the bottom of them put
a<00:05:58.500> stick<00:05:58.710> through<00:05:58.740> and<00:05:59.610> gather<00:05:59.790> one<00:06:00.000> end<00:06:00.150> up

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
a stick through and gather one end up

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.620 
a stick through and gather one end up
look<00:06:01.350> they're<00:06:01.470> kind<00:06:01.650> of<00:06:01.710> took<00:06:01.889> the<00:06:01.949> adoption

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
look they're kind of took the adoption

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.230 
look they're kind of took the adoption
and<00:06:03.630> simply<00:06:04.080> by<00:06:04.229> adding<00:06:04.520> two<00:06:05.520> pieces<00:06:05.850> of<00:06:05.910> cards

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
and simply by adding two pieces of cards

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.120 
and simply by adding two pieces of cards
weekend<00:06:06.660> you<00:06:07.229> turned<00:06:07.470> it<00:06:07.590> into<00:06:07.710> a<00:06:07.830> hammock

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
weekend you turned it into a hammock

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.590 
weekend you turned it into a hammock
chair<00:06:08.160> that<00:06:08.520> can<00:06:08.639> be<00:06:08.729> slim<00:06:08.880> between<00:06:09.210> two<00:06:09.360> trees

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
chair that can be slim between two trees

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.740 
chair that can be slim between two trees
between<00:06:10.080> two<00:06:10.440> cars<00:06:10.710> to<00:06:11.100> land<00:06:11.340> rovers<00:06:11.750> actually

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
between two cars to land rovers actually

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.469 
between two cars to land rovers actually
put<00:06:12.900> one<00:06:13.020> between<00:06:13.139> two<00:06:13.610> signposts<00:06:14.610> ulit<00:06:14.940> the

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
put one between two signposts ulit the

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.510 
put one between two signposts ulit the
two<00:06:15.660> where<00:06:15.870> legs<00:06:16.470> of<00:06:16.650> a<00:06:16.710> big<00:06:16.860> sign<00:06:17.070> posting

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
two where legs of a big sign posting

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.570 
two where legs of a big sign posting
hung<00:06:17.669> between<00:06:17.850> those<00:06:18.180> two<00:06:19.070> and<00:06:20.070> then<00:06:20.340> it<00:06:20.460> could

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
hung between those two and then it could
