i'm a very horrible gardener but that's

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.590 
i'm a very horrible gardener but that's
why<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.539> do<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.199> botanical<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> can't<00:00:57.360> kill

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
why I do the botanical so I can't kill

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.979 
why I do the botanical so I can't kill
it<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:59.039> take<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.550> photograph<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.870> then

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
it so I take the photograph and then

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.720 
it so I take the photograph and then
what<00:01:01.350> I'd<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> do<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:01.920> simplify<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
what I'd like to do is simplify the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.200 
what I'd like to do is simplify the
photographs<00:01:03.449> uh-huh<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:05.610> start<00:01:05.939> out<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
photographs uh-huh and to start out the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.100 
photographs uh-huh and to start out the
process<00:01:07.020> I'll<00:01:07.430> I'll<00:01:08.430> take<00:01:09.060> my<00:01:09.210> drawing<00:01:09.750> which

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
process I'll I'll take my drawing which

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.370 
process I'll I'll take my drawing which
I've<00:01:10.260> simplified<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.130> all<00:01:11.610> I'll<00:01:12.229> transfer<00:01:13.229> it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
I've simplified and all I'll transfer it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.440 
I've simplified and all I'll transfer it
over<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.890> poem<00:01:14.100> or<00:01:14.310> clay<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.299> what

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
over to the poem or clay and what

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.859 
over to the poem or clay and what
happens<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.140> when<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.920> turn<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.430> over<00:01:17.869> that

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
happens is when you turn it over that

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.359 
happens is when you turn it over that
image<00:01:19.259> actually<00:01:19.470> goes<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:19.979> top<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
image actually goes on top of the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.320 
image actually goes on top of the
polymer<00:01:20.790> clay<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.330> then<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.840> take<00:01:23.330> various

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
polymer clay and then I take various

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.469 
polymer clay and then I take various
tools<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.229> burnish<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.479> transfer

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
tools to burnish that on and transfer

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.240 
tools to burnish that on and transfer
that<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.200> gives<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.470> dimension<00:01:28.650> when

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
that in it so it gives it dimension when

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.010 
that in it so it gives it dimension when
you<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.729> well<00:01:30.329> actually<00:01:30.570> I'm<00:01:30.840> just

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
you do that well actually I'm just

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.990 
you do that well actually I'm just
burnishing<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> joint<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.549> when<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.790> lift

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
burnishing in the joint so when you lift

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.210 
burnishing in the joint so when you lift
it<00:01:33.119> off<00:01:33.270> guy<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> guide<00:01:34.140> got<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:34.979> then

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
it off guy have a guide got it and then

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.069

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
wet polymer clay and what I'm trying to

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.770 
wet polymer clay and what I'm trying to
achieve<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.430> when<00:01:44.759> i<00:01:44.790> press<00:01:45.149> into<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.479> palmer

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
achieve is when i press into the palmer

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.980 
achieve is when i press into the palmer
clay<00:01:46.170> what<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.799> get<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> end<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.479> low<00:01:48.720> real

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
clay what I get in the end is a low real

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.080 
clay what I get in the end is a low real
because<00:01:49.290> I'm<00:01:49.500> working<00:01:49.860> opposite<00:01:50.369> right<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.060> I

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
because I'm working opposite right so I

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.090 
because I'm working opposite right so I
get<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> load<00:01:51.540> relief<00:01:51.750> image<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.500> I'm<00:01:52.649> just

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.639 
get a load relief image and I'm just
roughing<00:01:53.700> out<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.570> high<00:01:54.750> areas<00:01:55.350> at<00:01:55.530> this

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
roughing out the high areas at this

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.800 
roughing out the high areas at this
point<00:01:55.920> I'm<00:01:56.009> not<00:01:56.159> doing<00:01:56.460> any<00:01:56.610> detail<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.329> don't

and then I use

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.550 
and then I use
metal<00:02:06.909> clay<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.509> flexible<00:02:10.959> metal<00:02:11.170> and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
metal or it like like it's clay so it's

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.160 
metal or it like like it's clay so it's
very<00:02:18.209> interesting<00:02:19.209> like<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:19.930> press

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.880 
that into the mold so I press it into
the<00:02:22.239> mold<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.720> basically<00:02:23.020> I'll<00:02:23.260> DAP<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.739> in

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
the mold and basically I'll DAP it in

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.340 
the mold and basically I'll DAP it in
with<00:02:24.340> this<00:02:24.819> is<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.030> tool<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.540> made<00:02:25.870> it's<00:02:26.260> a

mold because it's a very deep I would

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.080 
mold because it's a very deep I would
like<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.300> get<00:02:34.780> all<00:02:35.050> that<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:36.100> detail<00:02:36.459> right<00:02:36.730> on

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.199 
like to get all that the detail right on
that<00:02:37.360> texture<00:02:38.019> and<00:02:38.350> shape<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.880> then<00:02:40.030> when<00:02:40.180> I

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
that texture and shape so then when I

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.350 
that texture and shape so then when I
take<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.690> out<00:02:41.670> like<00:02:42.670> I<00:02:42.790> said<00:02:42.970> I'm<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.150> working

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
take it out like I said I'm a working

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.420

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
actually is hot the high areas so then I

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.949 
actually is hot the high areas so then I
will<00:02:49.420> dry<00:02:49.660> it<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:50.019> then<00:02:50.560> I'll<00:02:50.739> take<00:02:51.010> various

will dry it and then I'll take various

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.170 
will dry it and then I'll take various
tools<00:02:52.959> parking<00:02:53.830> tools<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:54.519> here<00:02:55.060> are<00:02:55.120> some

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
example examples of the different

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.400 
example examples of the different
textures<00:02:57.610> that<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:58.000> can<00:02:58.239> get<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:59.110> i'll<00:02:59.200> take

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
various tools and start carving out the

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.479 
various tools and start carving out the
design<00:03:01.810> so<00:03:02.500> sometimes<00:03:02.890> i<00:03:02.980> think<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.310> myself

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
design so sometimes i think of myself

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.479 
design so sometimes i think of myself
more<00:03:03.790> as<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.060> carver<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:04.930> i<00:03:05.380> am<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:06.100> jeweler
