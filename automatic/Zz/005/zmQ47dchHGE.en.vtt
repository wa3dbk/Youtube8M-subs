00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
ability level and their reading level

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.670 
ability level and their reading level
they're<00:01:19.480> really<00:01:19.990> good<00:01:20.170> for<00:01:20.260> students<00:01:20.590> with

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
they're really good for students with
