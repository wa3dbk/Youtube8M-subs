00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.230
 in a video here today completely 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.010
 fast is on boxing day at boxing today 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.360
 Covers cool by activision ware and high 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.650
 moon studios have a wrap 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.599
 heimweg studios are indeed the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.970
 transformer and that of cybertron and 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.160
 Transformer struggles to develop wood 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.930
 I think the game should be like that 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.730
 good but i found him trainer 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.890
 Funny I like the character because that is 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.429
 a little antihero and yes the game 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.359
 there's the xbox 360 and ps3 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.740
 probably there is no guidance 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.300
 of that activision had already been at the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.890
 made walking dead but at the wii 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.480
 version at the last in my ps3 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.739
 instruction at the expo 2000 nothing 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.149
 think here is exactly the same 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.910
 but I have the game one time 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.730
 partnershop ip gate purchase facebook page 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.930
 and shop page and in the description 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.430
 Unfortunately it did not appear like video 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.170
 and jackets who is by the way in the next 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.940
 So I do not believe video if there is nothing tomorrow 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.930
 is the next video with the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.699
 attacks br for the adaptation of the fans 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.649
 to comic because my english is so good 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.270
 I prefer not to read this before the 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.159
 characterize the show ces once deadpool 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.140
 and that would have to be cable I had 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.520
 times as a sharpener this man from the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.450
 future with half the robot face 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.330
 then appears at the benches judith very 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.680
 In any case, the war is already over 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.439
 is there a player needs one 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.759
 megabyte to save simon 25 1080 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.189
 later like the dolby digital 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.470
 support xbox live content and yes 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.689
 i have 18 has violence and bad words 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.159
 and that's growing on now as I said 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.979
 probably there is no guidance in it 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.540
 will go fast 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.900
 and we'll do it quickly 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.810
 next video what longer go that way 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.070
 cover looks like wolverine and the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.509
 other I do not know now also 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.310
 cable here I still believe in the 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.970
 other characters are now even 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.380
 nothing more 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.350
 and yes, tell me how I said I got it 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.640
 I also thought no instructions times 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.950
 Watching you've got to even a unboxing 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.270
 see the ps3 version 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.979
 Maybe then alone because here 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.290
 I do not know now when walking 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.390
 dead it was like that was the xbox version 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.760
 no spam 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.860
 and I think that's the same disco 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.870
 but beautiful so simple but also 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.370
 how cool do I think that was mine 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.260
 short unboxing i hope it has you 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.030
 We have fallen and come five weeks 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.120
 with the friend was goodbye to 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.530

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.450
 i am probably uploading this evening i am 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.950

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.880
