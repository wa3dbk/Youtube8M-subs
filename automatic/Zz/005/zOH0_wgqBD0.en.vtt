00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
hi I'm Mandy holiness and this is the 10

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.220 
hi I'm Mandy holiness and this is the 10
minute<00:00:10.950> Atelier<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.700> our<00:00:12.269> last<00:00:12.480> video<00:00:12.780> we

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
minute Atelier in our last video we

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.890 
minute Atelier in our last video we
talked<00:00:13.500> about<00:00:13.620> notional<00:00:14.400> space<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.000> just<00:00:15.750> to

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
talked about notional space and just to

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.990 
talked about notional space and just to
review<00:00:16.230> notional<00:00:16.890> space<00:00:17.160> as<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.580> amount<00:00:17.880> of

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
review notional space as the amount of

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.390 
review notional space as the amount of
space<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.300> drawing<00:00:18.750> takes<00:00:19.140> up<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:20.100> if<00:00:20.160> we<00:00:20.340> were

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
space a drawing takes up so if we were

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.689 
space a drawing takes up so if we were
to<00:00:20.609> try<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.880> copy<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.449> drawing<00:00:21.840> over<00:00:22.710> here<00:00:23.160> we

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
to try to copy this drawing over here we

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.040 
to try to copy this drawing over here we
would<00:00:23.850> want<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.119> figure<00:00:24.269> out<00:00:24.390> where's<00:00:24.960> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
would want to figure out where's the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.990 
would want to figure out where's the
furthest<00:00:25.439> leftmost<00:00:25.859> point<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.640> furthest

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
furthest leftmost point the furthest

furthest leftmost point the furthest
rightmost<00:00:27.510> point<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.410> highest<00:00:28.800> point<00:00:29.099> and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
rightmost point the highest point and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.030 
rightmost point the highest point and
the<00:00:29.369> lowest<00:00:29.490> point<00:00:30.090> put<00:00:30.929> horizontal<00:00:31.769> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the lowest point put horizontal and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.910 
the lowest point put horizontal and
vertical<00:00:32.910> lines<00:00:33.110> through<00:00:34.110> those<00:00:34.320> points<00:00:34.770> and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
vertical lines through those points and

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.400 
vertical lines through those points and
transfer<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.610> box<00:00:36.059> over<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:37.050> our<00:00:37.170> drawing

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
transfer that box over to our drawing

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.130 
transfer that box over to our drawing
space<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:39.059> video<00:00:39.390> we're<00:00:39.780> going<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.930> talk

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
space in this video we're going to talk

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.069 
space in this video we're going to talk
about<00:00:40.469> plumb<00:00:41.040> lines<00:00:41.280> plumb<00:00:42.149> lines<00:00:42.450> are<00:00:42.809> these

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
about plumb lines plumb lines are these

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.360 
about plumb lines plumb lines are these
two<00:00:43.850> vertical<00:00:44.850> lines<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.570> our<00:00:46.469> original<00:00:46.770> bark

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
two vertical lines on our original bark

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.069 
two vertical lines on our original bark
plate<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.910> I'm<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.510> highlight<00:00:48.750> those

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
plate and I'm going to highlight those

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.900 
plate and I'm going to highlight those
in<00:00:49.110> red<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.280> focus<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.760> them

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
in red just so that we can focus on them

00:00:50.910 --> 00:01:04.160 
in red just so that we can focus on them
a<00:00:51.090> little<00:00:51.390> better

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.800 

so<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.400> said<00:01:05.640> these<00:01:05.970> two<00:01:06.030> lines<00:01:06.570> are

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
so as I said these two lines are

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.230 
so as I said these two lines are
perfectly<00:01:07.380> vertical<00:01:08.040> lines<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:08.940> really

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
perfectly vertical lines and it's really

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.120 
perfectly vertical lines and it's really
important<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.200> use<00:01:10.440> vertical<00:01:10.680> lines

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
important that you use vertical lines

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.770 
important that you use vertical lines
because<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.940> use<00:01:12.060> plumb<00:01:12.330> lines<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.750> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
because we use plumb lines for a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.870 
because we use plumb lines for a
reference<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:13.650> want<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:13.890> make<00:01:14.010> sure<00:01:14.040> that

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
reference and we want to make sure that

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.040 
reference and we want to make sure that
we're<00:01:15.390> referencing<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.229> perfect<00:01:16.680> vertical<00:01:16.909> now

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
we're referencing a perfect vertical now

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.950 
we're referencing a perfect vertical now
there's<00:01:19.050> two<00:01:19.260> reasons<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:20.010> use<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.430> plumb<00:01:20.729> line

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
there's two reasons to use a plumb line

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.320 
there's two reasons to use a plumb line
one<00:01:21.960> reason<00:01:22.410> is<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.160> see<00:01:23.430> here<00:01:23.910> that<00:01:24.270> our

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
one reason is you can see here that our

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.210 
one reason is you can see here that our
plumb<00:01:24.570> line<00:01:24.750> starts<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.350> here<00:01:25.650> even<00:01:25.979> though

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
plumb line starts up here even though

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.550 
plumb line starts up here even though
our<00:01:26.250> notional<00:01:26.700> space<00:01:26.970> box<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.630> all<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> way

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
our notional space box is all the way

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.580 
our notional space box is all the way
over<00:01:29.159> here<00:01:29.190> and<00:01:29.659> what<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.080> artist<00:01:31.229> was<00:01:31.560> trying

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
over here and what the artist was trying

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.770 
over here and what the artist was trying
to<00:01:32.040> discover<00:01:32.430> by<00:01:32.670> using<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.090> plumb<00:01:33.300> line<00:01:33.330> on

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
to discover by using a plumb line on

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.260 
to discover by using a plumb line on
this<00:01:34.080> side<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.400> he<00:01:35.670> dropped<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
this side is that if he dropped a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.719 
this side is that if he dropped a
vertical<00:01:36.630> line<00:01:36.780> from<00:01:37.080> this<00:01:37.229> corner<00:01:37.770> he<00:01:38.490> wanted

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
vertical line from this corner he wanted

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.870 
vertical line from this corner he wanted
to<00:01:38.820> know<00:01:38.940> how<00:01:39.210> far<00:01:39.450> out<00:01:39.720> does<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:41.340> bottom<00:01:41.670> of

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
to know how far out does the bottom of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.930 
to know how far out does the bottom of
this<00:01:42.390> sculpture<00:01:43.080> stick<00:01:43.590> out<00:01:43.800> because<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
this sculpture stick out because the

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.359 
this sculpture stick out because the
edge<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> slight<00:01:46.289> angle<00:01:46.590> this

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
edge of this is on a slight angle this

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.910 
edge of this is on a slight angle this
way<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.600> he<00:01:48.780> wanted<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.110> know<00:01:49.200> how<00:01:49.590> far<00:01:49.890> over

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
way and he wanted to know how far over

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.249 
way and he wanted to know how far over
does<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.429> stick<00:01:50.789> out<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.210> by<00:01:51.720> putting<00:01:52.080> a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
does a stick out so by putting a

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.870 
does a stick out so by putting a
perfectly<00:01:52.649> vertical<00:01:53.009> line<00:01:53.220> through<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.550> top

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
perfectly vertical line through the top

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.749 
perfectly vertical line through the top
point<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.600> he<00:01:55.410> was<00:01:55.590> able<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.009> see<00:01:56.220> oh<00:01:56.429> it

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
point here he was able to see oh it

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.419 
point here he was able to see oh it
sticks<00:01:57.000> out<00:01:57.210> about<00:01:57.720> that<00:01:57.960> much<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.399> other

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
sticks out about that much and the other

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.060 
sticks out about that much and the other
reason<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.030> use<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:00.360> plumb<00:02:00.690> line<00:02:00.720> is<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.590> this

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
reason to use a plumb line is on this

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.770 
reason to use a plumb line is on this
side<00:02:02.369> he's<00:02:02.789> using<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.179> for<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> very<00:02:03.479> different

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
side he's using it for a very different

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.310 
side he's using it for a very different
purpose<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.800> case<00:02:05.100> he<00:02:05.850> sees<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.929> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
purpose in this case he sees that the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.740 
purpose in this case he sees that the
top<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.310> forehead<00:02:08.549> and<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.209> bottom<00:02:09.600> of

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
top of the forehead and the bottom of

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.050 
top of the forehead and the bottom of
the<00:02:09.869> collar<00:02:10.110> here<00:02:10.560> are<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:11.549> perfect<00:02:11.790> alignment

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
the collar here are in perfect alignment

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.600 
the collar here are in perfect alignment
on<00:02:12.720> this<00:02:13.019> vertical<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:14.070> that's<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.430> coincidence

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
on this vertical so that's a coincidence

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.000 
on this vertical so that's a coincidence
they<00:02:15.180> both<00:02:15.360> happen<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.959> be<00:02:16.110> on<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.410> vertical

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
they both happen to be on a vertical

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.400 
they both happen to be on a vertical
line<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.519> he<00:02:18.120> wants<00:02:18.329> to<00:02:18.420> know<00:02:18.570> how<00:02:18.959> far<00:02:19.170> out

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
line and he wants to know how far out

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.400 
line and he wants to know how far out
does<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:19.860> nose<00:02:20.190> shape<00:02:20.910> stick<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:22.079> you<00:02:22.170> can

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
does this nose shape stick so you can

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.140 
does this nose shape stick so you can
see<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.739> he's<00:02:22.950> kind<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.280> made<00:02:23.519> this<00:02:23.670> triangle

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
see that he's kind of made this triangle

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.280 
see that he's kind of made this triangle
shape<00:02:24.269> here<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.100> by<00:02:26.450> comparing<00:02:27.450> how<00:02:27.780> far<00:02:28.049> out

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
shape here and by comparing how far out

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.590 
shape here and by comparing how far out
this<00:02:28.920> triangle<00:02:29.430> point<00:02:29.700> hits<00:02:29.970> from<00:02:30.450> this

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
this triangle point hits from this

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.830 
this triangle point hits from this
perfect<00:02:30.989> vertical<00:02:31.880> he's<00:02:32.880> able<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.450> get<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.630> more

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
perfect vertical he's able to get a more

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.590 
perfect vertical he's able to get a more
accurate<00:02:33.870> measurement<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:35.519> see<00:02:35.850> better<00:02:36.180> how

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
accurate measurement and see better how

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.920 
accurate measurement and see better how
far<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:37.079> sticks<00:02:37.410> out<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:39.030> what<00:02:39.660> we're<00:02:39.810> going

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
far that sticks out so what we're going

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.949 
far that sticks out so what we're going
to<00:02:40.019> do<00:02:40.200> today<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:41.160> we<00:02:42.090> are<00:02:42.120> going<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.390> transfer

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
to do today is we are going to transfer

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.870 
to do today is we are going to transfer
our<00:02:43.170> plumb<00:02:43.440> lines<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:44.040> our<00:02:44.070> original<00:02:44.310> because

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
our plumb lines to our original because

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.580 
our plumb lines to our original because
we're<00:02:45.060> going<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.299> use<00:02:45.630> them<00:02:45.840> as<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.049> reference

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
we're going to use them as a reference

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.310 
we're going to use them as a reference
as<00:02:46.799> we<00:02:47.040> continue<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.700> draw<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.780> spark<00:02:49.049> plate

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
as we continue to draw the spark plate

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.680 
as we continue to draw the spark plate
just<00:02:49.769> like<00:02:49.950> he<00:02:50.430> did<00:02:50.760> when<00:02:50.910> he<00:02:51.090> created<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
just like he did when he created the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.229 
just like he did when he created the
spark<00:02:51.959> plate<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.730> may<00:02:53.880> remember<00:02:54.090> from

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
spark plate so you may remember from

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.470 
spark plate so you may remember from
last<00:02:54.540> time<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.070> we<00:02:56.070> can<00:02:56.310> use<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> skewer<00:02:57.090> this

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
last time that we can use a skewer this

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.900 
last time that we can use a skewer this
will<00:02:57.720> help<00:02:57.870> us<00:02:58.049> measure<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.680> all<00:02:59.459> I'm<00:02:59.579> doing

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
will help us measure and all I'm doing

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.490 
will help us measure and all I'm doing
is<00:03:00.090> I'm<00:03:00.390> measuring<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.870> distance<00:03:01.200> between

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
is I'm measuring the distance between

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.860 
is I'm measuring the distance between
the<00:03:02.100> edge<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.459> my<00:03:02.489> notional<00:03:02.940> space<00:03:03.180> box<00:03:03.510> and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
the edge of my notional space box and

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.800 
the edge of my notional space box and
the<00:03:04.079> start<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.650> microplate<00:03:05.340> vertical<00:03:05.730> line<00:03:05.910> so

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
the start of microplate vertical line so

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.410 
the start of microplate vertical line so
I'm<00:03:07.230> going<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.680> measure<00:03:08.519> as<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.850> very<00:03:09.120> short

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
I'm going to measure as a very short

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.540 
I'm going to measure as a very short
distance<00:03:09.900> in<00:03:10.079> this<00:03:10.200> case<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:12.860> I'm<00:03:13.860> going<00:03:14.340> to

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
distance in this case and I'm going to

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.720 
distance in this case and I'm going to
put

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
put

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.809 
put
a<00:03:15.790> mark<00:03:16.629> where<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.440> think<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.920> vertical<00:03:18.640> line

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
a mark where I think that vertical line

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.990 
a mark where I think that vertical line
is<00:03:19.060> again<00:03:20.019> I'm<00:03:20.200> using<00:03:20.319> a<00:03:20.620> red<00:03:20.950> pen<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:21.909> you

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
is again I'm using a red pen so that you

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.280 
is again I'm using a red pen so that you
can<00:03:22.120> see<00:03:22.299> it<00:03:22.390> better<00:03:22.480> in<00:03:22.599> the<00:03:22.750> video<00:03:22.959> but<00:03:23.230> I

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
can see it better in the video but I

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.110 
can see it better in the video but I
strongly<00:03:23.560> suggest<00:03:24.040> that<00:03:24.099> use<00:03:24.310> pencil<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:27.120> I

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
strongly suggest that use pencil and I

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.509 
strongly suggest that use pencil and I
am<00:03:28.870> just<00:03:29.140> going<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.500> make<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:29.950> perfectly

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
am just going to make a perfectly

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.610 
am just going to make a perfectly
vertical<00:03:30.940> line<00:03:31.180> from<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:32.049> point<00:03:32.110> and<00:03:32.530> just

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
vertical line from that point and just

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:42.000 
vertical line from that point and just
drop<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.220> perfectly<00:03:33.610> forever<00:03:39.720> okay<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:41.019> now

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
drop it perfectly forever okay and now

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.280 
drop it perfectly forever okay and now
I'm<00:03:42.400> going<00:03:42.819> to<00:03:42.940> find<00:03:43.450> where<00:03:43.720> this<00:03:43.840> plumb<00:03:44.110> line

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
I'm going to find where this plumb line

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.970 
I'm going to find where this plumb line
is<00:03:44.879> so<00:03:45.879> I'm<00:03:46.390> going<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:46.900> measure<00:03:47.079> from<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.829> edge

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
is so I'm going to measure from the edge

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.900 
is so I'm going to measure from the edge
of<00:03:48.129> the<00:03:48.190> box<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.239> plumb<00:03:49.840> line<00:03:52.379> make<00:03:53.379> a<00:03:53.410> mark

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
of the box to the plumb line make a mark

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.619 
of the box to the plumb line make a mark
and<00:03:56.010> again<00:03:57.010> put<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.310> perfectly<00:03:57.790> vertical<00:03:58.209> line

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:07.589 

through<00:04:01.629> here<00:04:04.859> all<00:04:05.859> right<00:04:06.129> so<00:04:06.790> we<00:04:07.299> now<00:04:07.569> have

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
through here all right so we now have

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.930 
through here all right so we now have
transferred<00:04:08.200> our<00:04:08.349> two<00:04:08.560> plumb<00:04:08.859> lines<00:04:09.099> onto<00:04:09.489> our

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
transferred our two plumb lines onto our

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.830 
transferred our two plumb lines onto our
drawing<00:04:10.269> page<00:04:10.660> over<00:04:11.500> here<00:04:11.769> I<00:04:12.660> just<00:04:13.660> want<00:04:13.780> to

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
drawing page over here I just want to

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.080 
drawing page over here I just want to
say<00:04:13.959> a<00:04:13.989> few<00:04:14.290> more<00:04:14.379> things<00:04:14.829> about<00:04:15.129> plumb<00:04:15.849> lines

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
say a few more things about plumb lines

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.020 
say a few more things about plumb lines
one<00:04:16.600> is<00:04:16.930> that<00:04:17.199> you<00:04:17.739> can<00:04:18.070> make<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.280> plumb<00:04:18.549> line<00:04:18.579> at

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
one is that you can make a plumb line at

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.990 
one is that you can make a plumb line at
home<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.840> can<00:04:20.019> just<00:04:20.410> tie<00:04:20.620> an<00:04:21.370> object<00:04:21.789> in<00:04:21.880> this

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
home you can just tie an object in this

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.900 
home you can just tie an object in this
case<00:04:22.180> I<00:04:22.300> tied<00:04:22.479> a<00:04:22.510> key<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:23.139> a<00:04:23.169> piece<00:04:23.380> of<00:04:23.410> string

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
case I tied a key to a piece of string

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.279 
case I tied a key to a piece of string
and<00:04:24.910> when<00:04:25.180> you<00:04:25.270> hold<00:04:25.539> it<00:04:25.690> perfectly

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
and when you hold it perfectly

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.800 
and when you hold it perfectly
straight<00:04:27.220> up<00:04:27.400> and<00:04:27.669> let<00:04:27.849> it<00:04:27.970> rest<00:04:28.240> it<00:04:28.479> gives<00:04:28.660> you

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
straight up and let it rest it gives you

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.620 
straight up and let it rest it gives you
a<00:04:28.840> vertical<00:04:29.500> line<00:04:30.070> so<00:04:30.490> you<00:04:31.000> know<00:04:31.090> I<00:04:31.150> can<00:04:31.389> check

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
a vertical line so you know I can check

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.570 
a vertical line so you know I can check
is<00:04:31.840> this<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.229> true<00:04:32.470> vertical<00:04:32.919> here<00:04:33.280> on<00:04:33.460> the

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
is this a true vertical here on the

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.600 
is this a true vertical here on the
plate<00:04:33.849> and<00:04:34.060> if<00:04:34.990> it<00:04:35.169> lines<00:04:35.320> up<00:04:35.560> it's<00:04:35.919> such<00:04:36.580> a

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
plate and if it lines up it's such a

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.469 
plate and if it lines up it's such a
vertical<00:04:37.229> if<00:04:38.229> we<00:04:38.590> do<00:04:38.950> the<00:04:39.070> same<00:04:39.250> here<00:04:39.639> we<00:04:40.330> can

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
vertical if we do the same here we can

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.540 
vertical if we do the same here we can
see<00:04:40.660> again<00:04:40.930> that<00:04:40.990> we<00:04:41.260> have<00:04:41.470> a<00:04:41.889> pretty<00:04:42.340> good

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
see again that we have a pretty good

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.210 
see again that we have a pretty good
vertical<00:04:43.030> coming<00:04:43.570> down<00:04:43.750> here<00:04:44.050> what's<00:04:44.950> great

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
vertical coming down here what's great

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.740 
vertical coming down here what's great
about<00:04:45.400> this<00:04:45.760> is<00:04:46.000> that<00:04:46.210> it<00:04:46.389> applies<00:04:46.720> to

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
about this is that it applies to

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.190 
about this is that it applies to
anything<00:04:47.530> that<00:04:47.710> you<00:04:47.889> want<00:04:48.070> to<00:04:48.130> draw<00:04:48.310> so<00:04:48.729> I<00:04:49.660> have

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
anything that you want to draw so I have

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.690 
anything that you want to draw so I have
this<00:04:50.410> sculpture<00:04:51.130> over<00:04:51.310> here<00:04:52.110> and<00:04:53.520> I<00:04:54.520> just

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
this sculpture over here and I just

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.969 
this sculpture over here and I just
wanted<00:04:54.910> to<00:04:54.970> show<00:04:55.210> you<00:04:55.270> again<00:04:55.840> how<00:04:56.200> we<00:04:56.260> can<00:04:56.590> use

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
wanted to show you again how we can use

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.900 
wanted to show you again how we can use
this<00:04:57.610> plumb<00:04:58.000> line<00:04:58.210> for<00:04:58.630> a<00:04:58.870> reference<00:04:59.260> point<00:04:59.910> so

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
this plumb line for a reference point so

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.750 
this plumb line for a reference point so
I<00:05:01.300> said<00:05:01.630> that<00:05:01.840> this<00:05:02.020> line<00:05:02.380> is<00:05:02.710> showing<00:05:03.099> us<00:05:03.400> how

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
I said that this line is showing us how

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.450 
I said that this line is showing us how
far<00:05:03.970> out<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.479> nose<00:05:04.690> sticks<00:05:05.139> and<00:05:05.440> so<00:05:06.039> what<00:05:06.340> they

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
far out the nose sticks and so what they

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.089 
far out the nose sticks and so what they
did<00:05:06.520> is<00:05:06.729> they<00:05:06.940> lined<00:05:07.360> up<00:05:07.690> their<00:05:08.530> plumb<00:05:08.860> line

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
did is they lined up their plumb line

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.270 
did is they lined up their plumb line
with<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:09.880> top<00:05:10.090> of<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.300> head<00:05:10.919> and<00:05:11.919> maybe<00:05:12.160> the

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
with the top of the head and maybe the

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.010 
with the top of the head and maybe the
bottom<00:05:12.550> of<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.729> chin<00:05:12.970> and<00:05:13.300> then<00:05:13.870> they

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
bottom of the chin and then they

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.040 
bottom of the chin and then they
imagined<00:05:14.650> straight<00:05:15.580> lines<00:05:15.910> coming<00:05:16.510> off<00:05:16.720> those

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
imagined straight lines coming off those

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.170 
imagined straight lines coming off those
points<00:05:17.530> to<00:05:17.680> figure<00:05:17.949> out<00:05:18.039> how<00:05:18.280> far<00:05:18.580> out<00:05:18.820> the

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
points to figure out how far out the

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.980 
points to figure out how far out the
front<00:05:19.389> of<00:05:19.449> the<00:05:19.539> face<00:05:19.889> may<00:05:20.889> be<00:05:21.990> another

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
front of the face may be another

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.110 
front of the face may be another
reference<00:05:23.740> that<00:05:24.159> he<00:05:24.370> did<00:05:24.550> is<00:05:24.669> he<00:05:24.700> wanted<00:05:25.060> to

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
reference that he did is he wanted to

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.480 
reference that he did is he wanted to
figure<00:05:25.300> out<00:05:25.419> how<00:05:26.320> far<00:05:26.620> away<00:05:26.680> is<00:05:27.190> that

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
figure out how far away is that

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.150 
figure out how far away is that
top<00:05:27.610> of<00:05:27.759> the<00:05:27.789> head<00:05:28.030> from<00:05:28.599> the<00:05:29.080> bottom<00:05:29.410> of<00:05:29.590> best

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
top of the head from the bottom of best

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.580 
top of the head from the bottom of best
sculpture<00:05:30.520> so<00:05:31.389> if<00:05:31.780> I<00:05:31.930> put<00:05:32.169> a<00:05:32.199> perfectly

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
sculpture so if I put a perfectly

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.670 
sculpture so if I put a perfectly
vertical<00:05:33.039> line<00:05:33.250> on<00:05:33.690> the<00:05:34.690> edge<00:05:34.870> of<00:05:35.080> the<00:05:35.199> head<00:05:35.410> I

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
vertical line on the edge of the head I

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.770 
vertical line on the edge of the head I
can<00:05:36.009> see<00:05:36.280> that<00:05:36.520> in<00:05:36.669> this<00:05:36.849> case<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:37.419> back<00:05:37.599> of

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
can see that in this case the back of

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.170 
can see that in this case the back of
the<00:05:37.870> head<00:05:38.050> sticks<00:05:38.380> out<00:05:38.530> further<00:05:38.889> than<00:05:39.280> this

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
the head sticks out further than this

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.100 
the head sticks out further than this
point<00:05:40.860> and<00:05:41.860> we<00:05:42.669> also<00:05:42.819> talked<00:05:43.180> about<00:05:43.599> there

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
point and we also talked about there

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.680 
point and we also talked about there
being<00:05:44.560> coincidences<00:05:45.310> and<00:05:45.580> all<00:05:46.120> that<00:05:46.270> means<00:05:46.479> is

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
being coincidences and all that means is

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.930 
being coincidences and all that means is
in<00:05:46.840> this<00:05:47.050> case<00:05:47.259> this<00:05:47.440> vertical<00:05:47.889> line<00:05:47.919> hit<00:05:48.910> a

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
in this case this vertical line hit a

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.270 
in this case this vertical line hit a
couple<00:05:49.419> key<00:05:49.630> points<00:05:49.660> it<00:05:50.199> hit<00:05:50.440> the<00:05:50.650> very<00:05:50.860> corner

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
couple key points it hit the very corner

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.059 
couple key points it hit the very corner
of<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.520> forehead<00:05:51.759> and<00:05:52.150> it<00:05:52.930> hit<00:05:53.199> the<00:05:53.440> bottom<00:05:53.889> of

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:54.069 
of the forehead and it hit the bottom of

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:56.100 
of the forehead and it hit the bottom of
the<00:05:54.220> collar<00:05:54.490> and<00:05:55.060> actually<00:05:55.419> look<00:05:55.660> at<00:05:55.750> this<00:05:55.930> it

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
the collar and actually look at this it

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.499 
the collar and actually look at this it
hit<00:05:56.349> the<00:05:56.620> bot<00:05:56.830> that<00:05:57.250> inside<00:05:57.849> edge<00:05:58.090> of<00:05:58.210> the<00:05:58.270> nose

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
hit the bot that inside edge of the nose

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:01.439 
hit the bot that inside edge of the nose
under<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:59.020> nostril<00:05:59.560> here<00:06:00.370> it<00:06:00.940> also<00:06:01.090> hit<00:06:01.330> the

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449 
under the nostril here it also hit the

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:03.719 
under the nostril here it also hit the
very<00:06:01.599> top<00:06:01.870> of<00:06:01.900> the<00:06:02.110> eye<00:06:02.139> socket<00:06:02.710> so<00:06:03.250> those<00:06:03.580> are

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
very top of the eye socket so those are

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.670 
very top of the eye socket so those are
coincidences<00:06:04.599> and<00:06:04.659> that's<00:06:05.020> another<00:06:05.349> great

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
coincidences and that's another great

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.969 
coincidences and that's another great
way<00:06:05.919> to<00:06:06.430> use<00:06:06.639> a<00:06:06.880> plumb<00:06:07.300> line<00:06:07.330> so<00:06:07.870> you<00:06:08.590> know<00:06:08.710> if<00:06:08.800> I

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
way to use a plumb line so you know if I

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:11.430 
way to use a plumb line so you know if I
wanted<00:06:09.340> to<00:06:09.460> draw<00:06:09.699> this<00:06:10.030> face<00:06:10.270> here<00:06:10.659> I<00:06:10.840> can<00:06:11.169> move

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
wanted to draw this face here I can move

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.140 
wanted to draw this face here I can move
my<00:06:12.449> plumb<00:06:13.449> line<00:06:13.659> around<00:06:14.220> to<00:06:15.220> try<00:06:15.520> to<00:06:15.550> find<00:06:15.699> a

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
my plumb line around to try to find a

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.939 
my plumb line around to try to find a
coincidence<00:06:16.659> in<00:06:16.810> this<00:06:16.930> case<00:06:17.169> maybe<00:06:17.530> the<00:06:17.770> edge

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
coincidence in this case maybe the edge

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.550 
coincidence in this case maybe the edge
of<00:06:18.130> the<00:06:18.220> hairline<00:06:18.430> hits<00:06:19.030> the<00:06:19.240> front<00:06:19.539> of<00:06:19.810> the

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
of the hairline hits the front of the

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.200 
of the hairline hits the front of the
neck<00:06:20.770> or<00:06:21.069> over<00:06:22.030> here<00:06:22.300> maybe<00:06:22.659> the<00:06:22.930> inside<00:06:24.210> study

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
neck or over here maybe the inside study

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.629 
neck or over here maybe the inside study
this<00:06:25.419> a<00:06:25.449> little<00:06:25.720> bit<00:06:26.220> you<00:06:27.220> know<00:06:27.250> maybe<00:06:27.490> the

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
this a little bit you know maybe the

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.730 
this a little bit you know maybe the
inside<00:06:28.060> of<00:06:28.270> this<00:06:28.360> eye<00:06:28.599> socket<00:06:29.110> hits<00:06:29.380> the<00:06:29.590> edge

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
inside of this eye socket hits the edge

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.659 
inside of this eye socket hits the edge
of<00:06:30.159> the<00:06:30.909> mouth<00:06:31.090> here<00:06:31.599> so<00:06:31.960> a<00:06:32.860> plumb<00:06:33.340> line<00:06:33.370> just

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
of the mouth here so a plumb line just

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.249 
of the mouth here so a plumb line just
helps<00:06:33.880> us<00:06:33.940> figure<00:06:34.150> out<00:06:34.300> how<00:06:34.570> did<00:06:34.630> things<00:06:34.870> line

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:35.259 
helps us figure out how did things line

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:38.610 
helps us figure out how did things line
up<00:06:35.289> how<00:06:35.740> do<00:06:35.800> we<00:06:36.330> find<00:06:37.330> coincidences<00:06:38.139> what<00:06:38.440> all

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
up how do we find coincidences what all

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.610 
up how do we find coincidences what all
what<00:06:39.009> else<00:06:39.190> hits<00:06:39.550> a<00:06:39.699> vertical<00:06:40.060> line<00:06:40.620> because

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
what else hits a vertical line because

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.230 
what else hits a vertical line because
you<00:06:41.800> know<00:06:41.889> part<00:06:42.070> of<00:06:42.099> the<00:06:42.190> trick<00:06:42.430> to<00:06:42.580> drawing<00:06:42.909> is

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
you know part of the trick to drawing is

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.570 
you know part of the trick to drawing is
being<00:06:43.659> able<00:06:43.750> to<00:06:43.900> see<00:06:44.229> big<00:06:44.800> seeing<00:06:45.280> the<00:06:45.400> whole

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
being able to see big seeing the whole

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.370 
being able to see big seeing the whole
thing<00:06:45.610> and<00:06:46.120> so<00:06:46.330> by<00:06:46.539> understanding<00:06:46.690> how<00:06:47.199> these

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
thing and so by understanding how these

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.839 
thing and so by understanding how these
things<00:06:47.620> line<00:06:47.860> up<00:06:47.889> we<00:06:48.340> can<00:06:48.520> be<00:06:48.669> better

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:48.849 
things line up we can be better

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:54.089 
things line up we can be better
draftsman<00:06:51.090> so<00:06:52.090> that<00:06:52.900> is<00:06:53.229> essentially<00:06:53.770> what<00:06:54.070> a

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:54.099 
draftsman so that is essentially what a

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:57.719 
draftsman so that is essentially what a
fun<00:06:54.370> line<00:06:54.580> is<00:06:54.789> and<00:06:55.710> in<00:06:56.710> our<00:06:56.889> next<00:06:57.099> video<00:06:57.430> we're

00:06:57.719 --> 00:06:57.729 
fun line is and in our next video we're

00:06:57.729 --> 00:06:59.129 
fun line is and in our next video we're
going<00:06:57.849> to<00:06:57.909> continue<00:06:58.180> with<00:06:58.599> our<00:06:58.719> bark<00:06:58.930> plate

00:06:59.129 --> 00:06:59.139 
going to continue with our bark plate

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:00.719 
going to continue with our bark plate
and<00:06:59.380> we're<00:06:59.530> going<00:06:59.650> to<00:06:59.710> work<00:06:59.889> on<00:07:00.099> this<00:07:00.460> envelope

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:00.729 
and we're going to work on this envelope

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:04.559 
and we're going to work on this envelope
which<00:07:01.719> is<00:07:01.750> just<00:07:02.199> the<00:07:02.349> surrounding<00:07:03.250> shape<00:07:03.550> here

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:04.569 
which is just the surrounding shape here

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:06.480 
which is just the surrounding shape here
I'm<00:07:04.780> mannequin<00:07:05.319> lanius<00:07:05.590> and<00:07:05.889> this<00:07:06.009> is<00:07:06.130> the<00:07:06.280> ten

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
I'm mannequin lanius and this is the ten

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.129 
I'm mannequin lanius and this is the ten
minute<00:07:06.699> and<00:07:06.819> telly<00:07:06.969> and<00:07:07.360> I'll<00:07:07.780> see<00:07:07.960> you<00:07:08.020> in<00:07:08.080> the
