just<00:01:12.240> calling<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> phone<00:01:13.140> number<00:01:13.200> isn't

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
just calling the phone number isn't

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.370 
just calling the phone number isn't
enough<00:01:14.509> because<00:01:15.509> when<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.780> call<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.170> phone

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
enough because when you call the phone

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.380 
enough because when you call the phone
number<00:01:16.549> and<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:19.460> disconnected<00:01:20.460> or<00:01:21.180> not

number and it is disconnected or not
answering<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.049> doesn't<00:01:22.619> mean<00:01:22.740> it's

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
answering that doesn't mean it's

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.890 
answering that doesn't mean it's
available<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.610> just<00:01:23.880> means<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.270> doesn't<00:01:24.479> point

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900
