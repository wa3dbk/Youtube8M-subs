depends really on what you have in here
of<00:05:13.260> course<00:05:13.410> but<00:05:13.949> I<00:05:13.979> have<00:05:14.130> remembered<00:05:14.699> to<00:05:14.729> have

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
of course but I have remembered to have

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:23.180 
of course but I have remembered to have
two<00:05:15.330> huge<00:05:16.970> long<00:05:17.970> zooms<00:05:18.300> here<00:05:19.280> 580<00:05:20.419> px<00:05:21.419> 2<00:05:22.160> now<00:05:23.160> I

two huge long zooms here 580 px 2 now I

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.939 
two huge long zooms here 580 px 2 now I
know<00:05:23.370> this<00:05:23.430> looks<00:05:24.240> really<00:05:24.419> stuck<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:25.410> again

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
know this looks really stuck and again

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:27.430 
know this looks really stuck and again
that's<00:05:26.130> because<00:05:26.220> of<00:05:26.520> what<00:05:26.639> I<00:05:26.669> have<00:05:26.880> in<00:05:26.910> the<00:05:27.090> bag

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
that's because of what I have in the bag

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.530 
that's because of what I have in the bag
but<00:05:28.440> essentially<00:05:28.979> for<00:05:29.010> most<00:05:29.520> carrying<00:05:30.120> inner

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.760 
solutions
I<00:05:31.410> think<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:32.700> UD<00:05:33.030> 40<00:05:33.360> comes<00:05:34.229> up<00:05:34.380> into<00:05:34.590> quite

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
I think the UD 40 comes up into quite

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.659 
I think the UD 40 comes up into quite
the<00:05:34.919> right<00:05:35.040> answer<00:05:37.040> at<00:05:38.040> the<00:05:38.130> back<00:05:38.310> of<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.490> bag

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
the right answer at the back of the bag

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:45.950 
the right answer at the back of the bag
is<00:05:38.910> a<00:05:40.400> flat<00:05:41.400> yeah<00:05:42.139> that's<00:05:43.340> transparent<00:05:44.960> into

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
is a flat yeah that's transparent into

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.110 
is a flat yeah that's transparent into
which<00:05:46.110> you<00:05:46.200> can<00:05:46.229> place<00:05:46.560> your<00:05:46.800> address<00:05:47.729> labels

which you can place your address labels

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.020 
which you can place your address labels
of<00:05:48.300> course<00:05:50.120> so<00:05:51.120> there<00:05:51.270> you<00:05:51.330> have<00:05:51.389> it<00:05:53.030> think

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
of course so there you have it think

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.129 
of course so there you have it think
