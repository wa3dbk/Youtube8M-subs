something that would enhance that we're

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.389 
something that would enhance that we're

the boat so limiting or or eliminating

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.289 
the boat so limiting or or eliminating
the<00:01:11.250> learning<00:01:11.670> curve<00:01:11.820> was<00:01:11.850> something<00:01:12.180> people

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
the learning curve was something people

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.580 
the learning curve was something people
were<00:01:12.450> interested<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.840> doing<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> thrust

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
were interested in doing so the thrust

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.620 
were interested in doing so the thrust
vector<00:01:13.740> excels<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.820> very<00:01:15.090> first<00:01:15.390> thing<00:01:15.600> that

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
vector excels the very first thing that

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.380 
vector excels the very first thing that
we<00:01:15.750> wanted<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.220> to<00:01:17.220> set<00:01:17.640> out<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.909> accomplish

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
we wanted to to set out to accomplish

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.410 
we wanted to to set out to accomplish
was<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.659> solve<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> slow<00:01:19.619> speed<00:01:19.830> steering

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
was to solve the slow speed steering

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.730 
was to solve the slow speed steering
difficulty<00:01:21.420> or<00:01:21.600> eliminate<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> learning

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
difficulty or eliminate the learning

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.990 
difficulty or eliminate the learning
curve<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.009> that's<00:01:23.159> what<00:01:23.310> they've<00:01:23.460> done<00:01:23.670> if

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
curve and that's what they've done if

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.249

you're<00:01:24.240> filing<00:01:24.420> with<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.720> camera<00:01:24.990> real<00:01:25.080> quick

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
you're filing with the camera real quick

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.359 
you're filing with the camera real quick
here<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.439> want<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.650> point<00:01:25.830> out<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.979> couple<00:01:26.040> of

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
here I want to point out a couple of

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.740 
here I want to point out a couple of
things<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.909> notice<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> egg<00:01:27.479> cells

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
things if you notice with the egg cells

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.770 
things if you notice with the egg cells
right<00:01:27.930> away<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> long<00:01:29.220> fin<00:01:29.780> hanging

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
right away you have a long fin hanging

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.050 
right away you have a long fin hanging
down<00:01:30.960> beneath<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:32.310> lower<00:01:32.460> portions<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
down beneath the lower portions of the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.020 
down beneath the lower portions of the
hull<00:01:33.360> here<00:01:33.799> so<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> lot<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.460> water<00:01:35.729> flow

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
hull here so you get a lot of water flow

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.240 
hull here so you get a lot of water flow
across<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> fins<00:01:36.900> obviously<00:01:37.829> helping<00:01:38.100> you

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
across the fins obviously helping you

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.160 
across the fins obviously helping you
steer<00:01:38.520> at<00:01:38.579> slow<00:01:38.759> speeds<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.750> they<00:01:39.900> are<00:01:39.960> not

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
steer at slow speeds but they are not

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.050 
steer at slow speeds but they are not
protruding<00:01:40.860> beneath<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.549> keel<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> boat

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
protruding beneath the keel of the boat

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.149 
protruding beneath the keel of the boat
the<00:01:42.570> keel<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.899> still<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.170> lowest<00:01:43.290> point<00:01:43.710> so

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the keel is still the lowest point so

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.130 
the keel is still the lowest point so
it's<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.399> going<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.670> increase<00:01:45.000> your<00:01:45.119> draw<00:01:45.509> but

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
it's not going to increase your draw but

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.840 
it's not going to increase your draw but
it<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.350> going<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.530> help<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.829> significantly<00:01:47.070> at

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
it is going to help you significantly at

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.450 
it is going to help you significantly at
slow<00:01:48.119> speeds<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.200> what<00:01:49.350> you'll<00:01:49.470> find<00:01:49.649> now<00:01:49.979> with

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
slow speeds so what you'll find now with

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.340 
slow speeds so what you'll find now with
adding<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> thrust<00:01:51.149> raters<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> Yamaha<00:01:52.140> jet

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350

boat<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.280> significantly

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
boat it's going to significantly

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.520 
boat it's going to significantly
increase<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.780> slow<00:01:54.960> speed<00:01:55.170> steering

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
increase the slow speed steering

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.139 
increase the slow speed steering
responsiveness<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.640> it's<00:01:56.790> not<00:01:56.939> going<00:01:57.090> to

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
responsiveness but it's not going to

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.289 
responsiveness but it's not going to
take<00:01:57.390> away<00:01:57.570> from<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.820> responsiveness

that<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.630> feel<00:02:00.780> at<00:02:00.899> higher<00:02:01.049> speeds<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.530> we'll

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
that you feel at higher speeds and we'll

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.920 
that you feel at higher speeds and we'll
