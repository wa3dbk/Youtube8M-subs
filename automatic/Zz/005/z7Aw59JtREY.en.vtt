a<00:04:01.989> slam-dunk<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.830> do<00:04:03.250> think<00:04:03.640> that<00:04:03.700> we'll<00:04:03.910> see

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709

death the other strike against him is

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.840 
death the other strike against him is
that<00:04:41.320> he's<00:04:41.470> almost<00:04:41.590> too<00:04:42.070> big<00:04:42.250> of<00:04:42.370> a<00:04:42.460> character

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
that he's almost too big of a character

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.879 
that he's almost too big of a character
to<00:04:43.270> be<00:04:43.389> the<00:04:43.570> lesser<00:04:43.930> villain<00:04:44.260> of<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.560> Captain

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
to be the lesser villain of a Captain

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.980 
to be the lesser villain of a Captain
America<00:04:44.949> movie<00:04:45.460> I<00:04:45.610> feel<00:04:46.210> like<00:04:46.330> any<00:04:46.540> movie<00:04:46.840> he

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
America movie I feel like any movie he

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.390 
America movie I feel like any movie he
stepped<00:04:47.199> into<00:04:47.380> he<00:04:47.650> would<00:04:47.770> automatically

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
stepped into he would automatically

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.120 
stepped into he would automatically
become<00:04:48.729> the<00:04:49.090> big<00:04:49.270> villain<00:04:49.570> of<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:50.350> my<00:04:50.770> number

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
become the big villain of and my number

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.219 
become the big villain of and my number
one<00:04:51.280> pick<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.850> pretty<00:04:52.180> obvious<00:04:52.540> choice<00:04:52.570> Baron

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
one pick the pretty obvious choice Baron

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.129 
one pick the pretty obvious choice Baron
Mordo<00:04:53.410> the<00:04:54.370> reason<00:04:54.699> I<00:04:54.850> think<00:04:55.120> Baron<00:04:55.540> Mordo<00:04:55.750> is

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
Mordo the reason I think Baron Mordo is

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.950 
Mordo the reason I think Baron Mordo is
the<00:04:56.410> best<00:04:56.650> pick<00:04:56.949> is<00:04:57.160> because<00:04:57.760> he's<00:04:58.360> not<00:04:58.570> quite

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
the best pick is because he's not quite

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.010 
the best pick is because he's not quite
as<00:04:59.139> powerful<00:04:59.740> or<00:05:00.220> as<00:05:00.250> famous<00:05:00.760> or<00:05:01.120> infamous<00:05:01.360> as

as powerful or as famous or infamous as

as powerful or as famous or infamous as

if variety is right and Daniel Bruhl is
playing<00:05:13.030> a<00:05:13.180> character<00:05:13.360> that'll<00:05:13.750> be<00:05:13.840> a<00:05:13.960> lesser

it's a pretty clear pick Baron Mordo all
the<00:05:20.800> way<00:05:20.919> it'd<00:05:21.550> be<00:05:21.700> totally<00:05:22.030> awesome<00:05:22.180> to<00:05:22.570> see

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
the way it'd be totally awesome to see

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.600 
the way it'd be totally awesome to see
Dormammu<00:05:23.470> as<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:23.770> main<00:05:23.919> villain<00:05:23.950> of<00:05:24.280> a<00:05:24.340> Doctor

Dormammu as the main villain of a Doctor
Strange<00:05:24.669> movie<00:05:24.880> but<00:05:25.600> since<00:05:25.810> he's<00:05:25.960> a<00:05:25.990> godly

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
Strange movie but since he's a godly

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.010 
Strange movie but since he's a godly
demonic<00:05:27.160> construct<00:05:27.940> I<00:05:28.090> feel<00:05:28.360> like<00:05:28.510> it's<00:05:28.900> just

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
demonic construct I feel like it's just

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.560 
demonic construct I feel like it's just
a<00:05:29.139> little<00:05:29.320> too<00:05:29.740> outlandish<00:05:30.060> for<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.090> first

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
a little too outlandish for a first

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.540 
a little too outlandish for a first
movie<00:05:31.930> outing<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.500> villain<00:05:32.800> needs<00:05:33.039> to<00:05:33.190> be<00:05:33.310> a

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
movie outing the villain needs to be a

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.460 
movie outing the villain needs to be a
physical<00:05:34.120> person<00:05:34.360> that<00:05:34.750> you<00:05:34.840> could<00:05:35.020> punch

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
physical person that you could punch

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.469 
physical person that you could punch
with<00:05:35.800> your<00:05:35.919> fists<00:05:36.160> if<00:05:36.400> you<00:05:36.490> needed<00:05:36.700> to<00:05:36.820> not

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
with your fists if you needed to not

that<00:05:37.690> Doctor<00:05:37.960> Strange<00:05:38.020> is<00:05:38.320> gonna<00:05:38.470> be<00:05:38.590> that

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
that Doctor Strange is gonna be that

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.320 
that Doctor Strange is gonna be that
kind<00:05:38.889> of<00:05:38.979> movie<00:05:39.280> but<00:05:39.760> just<00:05:39.940> think<00:05:40.090> about<00:05:40.120> it

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
kind of movie but just think about it

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.090 
kind of movie but just think about it
this<00:05:40.389> way<00:05:40.570> Daniel<00:05:40.900> Bruhl<00:05:41.169> can't<00:05:41.740> wait<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:41.950> see

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
this way Daniel Bruhl can't wait to see

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.070 
this way Daniel Bruhl can't wait to see
him<00:05:42.190> as<00:05:42.310> a<00:05:42.340> villain<00:05:42.669> and<00:05:42.760> Captain<00:05:43.090> America<00:05:43.479> but

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
him as a villain and Captain America but

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.080 
him as a villain and Captain America but
imagine<00:05:44.530> he<00:05:44.860> gets<00:05:45.039> his<00:05:45.160> hands<00:05:45.520> on<00:05:45.639> the<00:05:45.849> soul

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
imagine he gets his hands on the soul

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.690 
imagine he gets his hands on the soul
gem<00:05:46.389> at<00:05:46.660> the<00:05:46.960> end<00:05:47.139> of<00:05:47.289> that<00:05:47.380> movie<00:05:47.590> gains<00:05:48.490> the

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
gem at the end of that movie gains the

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.180 
gem at the end of that movie gains the
power<00:05:48.880> he<00:05:49.210> needs<00:05:49.240> to<00:05:49.900> become<00:05:50.200> the<00:05:50.380> big<00:05:50.620> bad<00:05:50.889> in

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
power he needs to become the big bad in

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.250 
power he needs to become the big bad in
Doctor<00:05:51.880> Strange<00:05:51.940> and<00:05:52.510> then<00:05:52.870> that<00:05:52.990> movie

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
Doctor Strange and then that movie

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.690 
Doctor Strange and then that movie
becomes<00:05:53.560> the<00:05:53.680> battle<00:05:53.979> for<00:05:54.160> the<00:05:54.280> soul<00:05:54.460> gem

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
becomes the battle for the soul gem

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.879 
becomes the battle for the soul gem
that's<00:05:55.539> just<00:05:55.750> a<00:05:55.810> theory<00:05:56.080> but<00:05:56.440> I<00:05:56.500> feel<00:05:56.740> like

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
that's just a theory but I feel like

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.620 
that's just a theory but I feel like
it's<00:05:57.039> the<00:05:57.099> most<00:05:57.250> plausible<00:05:57.610> one<00:05:58.060> of<00:05:58.270> all<00:05:58.450> these

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
it's the most plausible one of all these

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.420 
it's the most plausible one of all these
picks<00:05:58.900> regardless<00:05:59.800> of<00:05:59.950> whether<00:06:00.130> or<00:06:00.190> not<00:06:00.250> the

picks regardless of whether or not the

picks regardless of whether or not the
soul<00:06:00.610> gem<00:06:00.789> is<00:06:00.940> involved<00:06:01.360> and<00:06:01.539> just<00:06:01.900> the<00:06:02.139> idea

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
soul gem is involved and just the idea

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.620 
soul gem is involved and just the idea

the<00:06:58.970> soul<00:06:59.270> is<00:06:59.540> a<00:06:59.600> much<00:06:59.900> more<00:07:00.110> mystical<00:07:00.650> idea

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:00.950 
the soul is a much more mystical idea

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.500 
the soul is a much more mystical idea
than<00:07:01.250> what<00:07:01.400> the<00:07:01.550> movies<00:07:01.850> have<00:07:02.000> dealt<00:07:02.210> with<00:07:02.270> so
