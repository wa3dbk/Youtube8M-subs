00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
way he grabs one of those things is a

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.780

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
really think that an internet-connected

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.060 
really think that an internet-connected
device<00:06:23.200> really<00:06:24.200> should<00:06:24.560> should<00:06:24.860> have<00:06:24.950> had

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
device really should should have had

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.320 
device really should should have had
something<00:06:25.250> like<00:06:25.430> this<00:06:25.550> from<00:06:25.670> the<00:06:25.820> start<00:06:26.060> just
