can<00:02:07.780> actually<00:02:07.840> also<00:02:08.170> turn<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:08.709> back<00:02:08.830> into<00:02:09.009> 2d

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
can actually also turn it back into 2d

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.940 
can actually also turn it back into 2d
as<00:02:09.489> well<00:02:09.929> as<00:02:10.929> far<00:02:11.170> as<00:02:11.200> goes<00:02:11.410> for<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.680> video

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
as well as far as goes for a video

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.220 
as well as far as goes for a video
recording<00:02:12.430> we<00:02:12.640> can<00:02:12.849> record<00:02:13.120> in<00:02:13.269> 3d<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.810> that

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
recording we can record in 3d and that

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.949 
recording we can record in 3d and that
recording<00:02:14.680> 720<00:02:15.280> HD<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.970> if<00:02:16.420> we're<00:02:16.569> according

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
recording 720 HD and if we're according

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.320 
recording 720 HD and if we're according
to<00:02:17.290> d<00:02:17.470> then<00:02:17.739> we<00:02:17.890> can<00:02:18.010> record<00:02:18.220> in<00:02:18.370> 1080<00:02:18.730> HD<00:02:18.970> as

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
to d then we can record in 1080 HD as

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.259 
to d then we can record in 1080 HD as
well<00:02:19.920> another<00:02:20.920> benefit<00:02:21.370> will<00:02:21.550> have<00:02:21.730> also<00:02:22.150> on

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
well another benefit will have also on

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.240 
well another benefit will have also on
the<00:02:22.390> 3d<00:02:22.690> section<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.319> portion<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:23.920> have<00:02:24.099> some

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
the 3d section is a portion of have some

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.940 
the 3d section is a portion of have some
games<00:02:24.540> which<00:02:25.540> is<00:02:25.660> always<00:02:25.810> fun<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.500> we<00:02:26.800> can

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
games which is always fun so we can

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.680 
games which is always fun so we can
actually<00:02:27.069> go<00:02:27.310> on<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.790> 3d<00:02:28.090> gaming<00:02:28.769> let's<00:02:29.769> go

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.420 

so<00:02:33.690> there<00:02:34.080> are<00:02:34.110> going<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.290> be<00:02:34.380> three<00:02:34.680> games

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
so there are going to be three games

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.840 
so there are going to be three games
already<00:02:35.730> uploaded<00:02:36.000> onto<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:36.570> at<00:02:36.750> launch

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.770 

three<00:02:41.850> games<00:02:42.090> along<00:02:42.300> this<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:42.510> going<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.720> be

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
three games along this is going to be

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.300 
three games along this is going to be
asked<00:02:42.930> for<00:02:43.140> six<00:02:43.470> pieces<00:02:43.710> you're<00:02:43.830> driving<00:02:44.160> game

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
asked for six pieces you're driving game

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.470 
asked for six pieces you're driving game
it's<00:02:44.550> going<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.730> be<00:02:44.790> knowable<00:02:45.090> which<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.390> going

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
it's going to be knowable which is going

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.850 
it's going to be knowable which is going
to<00:02:45.570> be<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.690> shoot-'em-up<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.350> it's<00:02:46.470> also<00:02:46.590> going

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
to be a shoot-'em-up and it's also going

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.380 
to be a shoot-'em-up and it's also going
to<00:02:46.920> be<00:02:46.980> dull<00:02:47.190> as<00:02:47.370> well<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.970> that's<00:02:48.060> done<00:02:48.270> by

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
to be dull as well and that's done by

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.470 
to be dull as well and that's done by
gameloft<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:50.100> hopefully<00:02:50.520> at<00:02:50.610> Lord<00:02:50.820> later<00:02:51.270> on

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
gameloft so hopefully at Lord later on

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.180 
gameloft so hopefully at Lord later on
there's<00:02:51.690> going<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.870> be<00:02:51.900> more<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.140> more<00:02:52.260> just

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
there's going to be more and more just

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.530 
there's going to be more and more just
because<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:53.490> don't<00:02:53.640> know<00:02:53.700> when<00:02:53.850> launches<00:02:54.270> yet

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
because we don't know when launches yet

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.240 
because we don't know when launches yet
it<00:02:54.750> depends<00:02:55.290> on<00:02:55.410> developers<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.040> when<00:02:56.130> that's

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
it depends on developers and when that's

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.780 
it depends on developers and when that's
going<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.460> happen<00:02:57.860> we<00:02:58.860> can<00:02:59.070> actually<00:02:59.340> search

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
going to happen we can actually search

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.260 
going to happen we can actually search
out<00:02:59.970> here

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:10.620 

there's<00:03:03.750> been

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.480 

so<00:03:11.110> this<00:03:11.230> is<00:03:11.380> just<00:03:11.470> take<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.710> second<00:03:12.100> to<00:03:12.130> load<00:03:12.310> on

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
so this is just take a second to load on

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.310 
so this is just take a second to load on
here<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:13.360> because<00:03:13.480> this<00:03:13.690> has<00:03:13.840> got<00:03:13.990> the<00:03:14.110> dual

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
here so because this has got the dual

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.140 
here so because this has got the dual
core<00:03:14.530> dual<00:03:14.740> channel<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.310> your<00:03:15.580> memory<00:03:15.910> is

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
core dual channel and your memory is

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.730 
core dual channel and your memory is
going<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.510> be<00:03:16.570> one<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.810> fastest<00:03:17.290> handsets

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
going to be one of the fastest handsets

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.640 
going to be one of the fastest handsets
are<00:03:17.920> on<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.370> market<00:03:18.730> at<00:03:18.880> launch<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:20.230> let's

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
are on the market at launch so let's

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.120 
are on the market at launch so let's
just<00:03:20.800> down<00:03:20.950> here<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.970> you'd<00:03:22.120> as<00:03:22.240> you<00:03:22.330> can<00:03:22.510> see

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
just down here and you'd as you can see

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:44.770 
just down here and you'd as you can see
should<00:03:24.130> give<00:03:24.250> a<00:03:24.280> great<00:03:24.550> demo

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.830 

so<00:03:45.440> this<00:03:46.280> also<00:03:46.459> does<00:03:46.790> other<00:03:46.880> axes<00:03:47.330> motion<00:03:47.720> you

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
so this also does other axes motion you

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.910 
so this also does other axes motion you
can<00:03:47.870> change<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.290> settings<00:03:48.620> throughout<00:03:48.800> the

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
can change the settings throughout the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.340 
can change the settings throughout the
screen<00:03:49.400> on<00:03:49.550> it<00:03:49.580> or<00:03:49.850> in<00:03:49.970> connection<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.540> on<00:03:51.080> here

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
screen on it or in connection to on here

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.170 
screen on it or in connection to on here
as<00:03:51.500> well<00:03:51.680> I'll<00:03:52.190> have<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.340> excuse<00:03:52.760> my<00:03:52.910> driving

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
as well I'll have to excuse my driving

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.410 
as well I'll have to excuse my driving
I'm<00:03:53.840> not<00:03:53.959> very<00:03:54.080> great

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.089 

so<00:04:00.080> that's<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.349> main<00:04:00.500> features<00:04:00.890> of<00:04:00.920> the

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
so that's the main features of the

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.190 
so that's the main features of the
handset<00:04:01.430> on<00:04:01.610> here<00:04:01.849> we<00:04:02.750> go<00:04:02.870> through<00:04:03.080> the

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
handset on here we go through the

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.490 
handset on here we go through the
hardware<00:04:03.700> okay<00:04:04.700> yep<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.270> as<00:04:05.540> far<00:04:05.989> as<00:04:06.050> it<00:04:06.170> is<00:04:06.290> and

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
hardware okay yep so as far as it is and

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.890 
hardware okay yep so as far as it is and
this<00:04:06.950> handset<00:04:07.370> I<00:04:07.520> just<00:04:07.700> even<00:04:07.940> for<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.239> TI<00:04:08.750> t

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
this handset I just even for the TI t

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.710 
this handset I just even for the TI t
which<00:04:09.290> is<00:04:09.319> texture<00:04:09.890> instrument<00:04:10.489> and<00:04:11.390> that<00:04:11.569> of

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
which is texture instrument and that of

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.600 
which is texture instrument and that of
course<00:04:11.780> is<00:04:12.020> what<00:04:12.080> supports<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.800> actual<00:04:13.099> jewel

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
course is what supports the actual jewel

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.420 
course is what supports the actual jewel
for<00:04:13.849> and<00:04:14.780> we<00:04:15.170> pretty<00:04:15.380> much<00:04:15.500> need<00:04:15.830> that<00:04:16.040> in<00:04:16.220> here

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
for and we pretty much need that in here

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.460 
for and we pretty much need that in here
to<00:04:16.639> actually<00:04:16.910> on<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.209> 3d<00:04:17.480> and<00:04:17.840> all<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.290> stuff
