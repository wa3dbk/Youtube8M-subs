00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello, my friends, we are here today 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.000
 video and these guys I'm super hurried 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.280
 the box has already been launched we are in the 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.679
 second episode runs correct we are 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.900
 in the second episode of the box 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.299
 Christmas I do not know how like the one called the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.980
 episode honestly but we are here 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.410
 in the second episode 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.689
 let's try to catch the box yesterday we 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.519
 uploaded I did not upload the episode yesterday 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.980
 because I was not basically at home 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.550
 I had none of the time to record so 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.500
 in bagua let's see 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.260
 I think there are no people 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.820
 apart from that I have a new television 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.270
 Super big 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.580
 I do not see practically anything at night 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.230
 but magnetic we are going to throw ourselves 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.590
 Here more or less 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.750
 for 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.240
 the box has been launched. 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.290
 OK OK OK vale vale nose can 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.290
 use on the roof 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.230
 do not 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.230
 it's perfect 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:09.010
 to see no no I'm not going to commit suicide fuck 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.070
 male 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.550
 ok ok let's hope that nobody comes 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.550
 why 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.670
 ok I think I'm close 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.650
 ok yes yes yes this we wanted 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 and let's go 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.730
 you run, you run, you run, you are not 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.730
 Colombia runs 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:40.550
 fuck where it comes goodbye 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.180
 did not give improvements or improvements 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.180
 OK 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.650
 worth one less 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.940
 It is good here perfect perfect 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.970
 I think no one is coming, this makes me happy 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.360
 flatter me sincerely we're going to 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.360
 hide 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.130
 ok let's see the box we're going to catch 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.400
 the box we're going to open the box man we're going 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.270
 pim pam sincerely has been easier 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.860
 of what he thought was easier than it was 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.690
 in the first in the first episode 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.480
 rather easier to see that I have been given 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.230
 the actor by annie shirt feeds me 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.510
 with a new shirt, you guys, I 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.430
 I think I'm going to try and I've come to this 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.050
 again for the box because yesterday not 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.560
 I could bring you episode and for 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.440
 compensate them in the absence of episodes of 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.870
 video then I will try to capture two 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.700
 boxes in this episode so the most 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.020
 probable and no more sure is that 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.720
 continuation of this sequence you will have 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.610
 again the same but then capturing 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.770
 again the box but surely they give me 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.030
 another prize but I do not assure you anything if 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.209
 you see nothing to exclude from this 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.160
 sequence means that I have not 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.010
 got it worth it has been too 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.420
 difficult that I had to go or something for the 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.280
 style, I had some little problem 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.870
 good guys here we are with many 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.270
 turbulence as you can see to be a 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.599
 Host wind so good guys 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.040
 in the box are 11 and 57 as you can 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.349
 see the box will arrive around twelve and 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.150
 average about 12 and 20 around like that 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.530
 that we are going to go around here without 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.260
 get away from the center of the map 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.310
 because not better here in the center and everything 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.620
