is really good you are really doing a
good<00:01:51.689> job<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.320> looking<00:01:52.890> at<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.070> few<00:01:53.250> things<00:01:53.399> that

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
good job so looking at a few things that

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.130 
good job so looking at a few things that
we<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.790> adjust<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.240> improve<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.869> even

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
we can adjust to improve on this even

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.840 
we can adjust to improve on this even
more<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.740> start<00:01:55.920> with<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.159> took<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.430> photograph

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
more to start with I took the photograph

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.060 
more to start with I took the photograph
that<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.090> submitted<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:58.200> has<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> very<00:01:58.770> pink

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
that you submitted it has a very pink

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.130 
that you submitted it has a very pink
tint<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.390> did<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> Photoshop

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
tint to it so I just did a Photoshop

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.450 
tint to it so I just did a Photoshop
adjustment<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:02.070> make<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.430> look

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
adjustment on it to make it look

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.399 
adjustment on it to make it look
actually<00:02:03.450> black<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.930> white<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.380> a

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
actually black and white so I have a

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.630 
actually black and white so I have a
feeling<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.799> was<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:05.070> an<00:02:05.159> issue<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
feeling that was just an issue in the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.039 
feeling that was just an issue in the
photograph<00:02:06.000> itself<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.509> I'm<00:02:06.630> pretty<00:02:06.930> sure

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
photograph itself so I'm pretty sure

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.839 
photograph itself so I'm pretty sure
this<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.380> more<00:02:07.649> what<00:02:07.950> yours<00:02:08.280> looks<00:02:08.340> like<00:02:08.550> so

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
this is more what yours looks like so

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.770 
this is more what yours looks like so
we're<00:02:08.970> gonna<00:02:09.060> go<00:02:09.239> with<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.509> for<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
we're gonna go with that for the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.029 
we're gonna go with that for the
critique<00:02:09.959> I've<00:02:10.560> also

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
critique I've also

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.440 
critique I've also
taking<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.370> reference<00:02:11.700> photo<00:02:11.909> and<00:02:12.120> made<00:02:12.269> that

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
taking the reference photo and made that

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.520 
taking the reference photo and made that
black-and-white<00:02:12.689> so<00:02:13.079> it's<00:02:13.230> easier<00:02:13.469> to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
black-and-white so it's easier to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.740 
black-and-white so it's easier to
compare<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.040> two<00:02:14.189> and<00:02:14.370> really<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:15.150> reason<00:02:15.599> to

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
compare the two and really the reason to

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.599 
compare the two and really the reason to
do<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.319> just<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.890> look<00:02:17.010> at<00:02:17.159> the<00:02:17.250> values

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
do that is just to look at the values

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.130 
do that is just to look at the values
sometimes<00:02:18.299> when<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.569> look<00:02:18.659> at<00:02:18.810> something<00:02:18.989> in

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
sometimes when you look at something in

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.170 
sometimes when you look at something in
color<00:02:19.409> what<00:02:19.769> you<00:02:19.799> think<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.250> value<00:02:20.579> is<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:21.000> not

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
color what you think the value is is not

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.179 
color what you think the value is is not
even<00:02:21.450> close<00:02:21.719> to<00:02:21.900> what<00:02:22.049> it<00:02:22.170> actually<00:02:22.409> is<00:02:22.739> when

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
even close to what it actually is when

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.949 
even close to what it actually is when
you<00:02:23.310> adjust<00:02:23.579> it<00:02:23.730> into<00:02:24.000> black<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.209> white<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.810> by

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
you adjust it into black and white so by

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.270 
you adjust it into black and white so by
doing<00:02:25.019> that<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.560> just<00:02:25.590> makes<00:02:25.859> it<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.040> lot<00:02:26.219> easier

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
doing that it just makes it a lot easier

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.119 
doing that it just makes it a lot easier
for<00:02:26.879> you<00:02:27.329> when<00:02:27.750> you're<00:02:27.900> working<00:02:28.079> now<00:02:28.470> this<00:02:28.980> guy

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
has a bit of a lopsided nose and in the

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.839 
has a bit of a lopsided nose and in the
photograph<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.829> can<00:02:31.950> see<00:02:32.099> his<00:02:32.250> nostril<00:02:32.760> on

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
photograph you can see his nostril on

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.610 
photograph you can see his nostril on
the<00:02:32.970> one<00:02:33.120> side<00:02:33.299> is<00:02:33.420> really<00:02:33.870> really<00:02:34.049> large<00:02:34.349> and

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
the one side is really really large and

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.309 
the one side is really really large and
really<00:02:34.920> really<00:02:35.340> dark<00:02:35.609> this<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.540> one<00:02:36.900> thing<00:02:37.139> as

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
really really dark this is one thing as

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.080 
really really dark this is one thing as
the<00:02:37.560> artist<00:02:37.889> I<00:02:38.010> would<00:02:38.340> tone<00:02:38.579> down<00:02:38.609> a<00:02:38.849> little

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
the artist I would tone down a little

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.490 
the artist I would tone down a little
bit<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.329> wouldn't<00:02:39.629> make<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.870> quite<00:02:40.049> that<00:02:40.260> dark

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
bit I wouldn't make it quite that dark

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.410 
bit I wouldn't make it quite that dark
because<00:02:40.980> when<00:02:41.099> I<00:02:41.129> look<00:02:41.370> at<00:02:41.489> this<00:02:41.609> my<00:02:41.790> attention

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
because when I look at this my attention

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.240 
because when I look at this my attention
after<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:42.840> look<00:02:43.049> at<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.260> eyes<00:02:43.409> I'm<00:02:43.709> drawn<00:02:44.040> right

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
after I look at the eyes I'm drawn right

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.759 
after I look at the eyes I'm drawn right
to<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.489> nostril<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:46.139> I<00:02:46.230> say<00:02:46.349> you<00:02:46.409> copy

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
to that nostril and like I say you copy

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.440 
to that nostril and like I say you copy
your<00:02:46.920> reference<00:02:47.430> photo<00:02:47.670> but<00:02:47.879> I<00:02:47.909> would<00:02:48.239> tone

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
your reference photo but I would tone

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.879 
your reference photo but I would tone
that<00:02:48.629> down<00:02:48.659> because<00:02:49.049> people<00:02:49.379> who<00:02:49.590> are<00:02:49.620> not

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
that down because people who are not

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.080 
that down because people who are not
looking<00:02:50.159> at<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.340> reference<00:02:50.459> photo<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.000> then

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
looking at the reference photo and then

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.580 
looking at the reference photo and then
looking<00:02:51.359> at<00:02:51.480> your<00:02:51.629> work<00:02:51.780> they're<00:02:52.169> going<00:02:52.379> to

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
looking at your work they're going to

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.990 
looking at your work they're going to
assume<00:02:52.859> that<00:02:52.919> you<00:02:53.159> did<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.489> wrong<00:02:53.669> and<00:02:53.970> that

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
assume that you did it wrong and that

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.059 
assume that you did it wrong and that
nostril<00:02:54.629> is<00:02:54.780> actually<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.349> reason<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.769> wanted

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
nostril is actually the reason I wanted

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.710 
nostril is actually the reason I wanted
to<00:02:56.129> find<00:02:56.400> your<00:02:56.579> reference<00:02:56.939> photo<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:57.359> badly

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
to find your reference photo so badly

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.330 
to find your reference photo so badly
because<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:58.019> wanted<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.379> see<00:02:58.560> how<00:02:58.769> close<00:02:59.099> you

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
because I wanted to see how close you

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.860 
because I wanted to see how close you
actually<00:02:59.669> were<00:02:59.819> if<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.120> was<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.299> mistake<00:03:00.659> or

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
actually were if this was a mistake or

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.509 
actually were if this was a mistake or
if<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.079> is<00:03:01.260> really<00:03:01.439> how<00:03:01.590> this<00:03:01.799> guy's<00:03:01.950> nose<00:03:02.280> is

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
if this is really how this guy's nose is

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.309 
if this is really how this guy's nose is
and<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.120> really<00:03:03.329> is<00:03:03.510> how<00:03:03.659> his<00:03:03.810> noses<00:03:04.200> but

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
and it really is how his noses but

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.259 
and it really is how his noses but
because<00:03:04.590> he<00:03:04.739> he's<00:03:05.129> in<00:03:05.159> such<00:03:05.579> a<00:03:05.609> strong<00:03:05.970> shadow

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
because he he's in such a strong shadow

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.020 
because he he's in such a strong shadow
there<00:03:06.629> I<00:03:06.750> would<00:03:07.169> definitely<00:03:07.549> lighten<00:03:08.549> up<00:03:08.730> some

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
there I would definitely lighten up some

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.520 
there I would definitely lighten up some
of<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.450> tone<00:03:09.659> that<00:03:09.840> down<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:10.169> it's<00:03:10.319> not

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
of that and tone that down so it's not

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.379 
of that and tone that down so it's not
so<00:03:10.859> dark<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.459> you're<00:03:11.609> just<00:03:11.760> drawn<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.120> the

these things up are going to help

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.039 
these things up are going to help
balance<00:03:24.120> out<00:03:24.269> some<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.659> the<00:03:24.720> areas<00:03:25.019> that

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
balance out some of the areas that

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
got the shadows on the ears the nostril

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.379 
got the shadows on the ears the nostril
some<00:03:28.979> of<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.129> areas<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.459> have<00:03:29.849> is<00:03:30.030> dark<00:03:30.269> as

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
some of the areas you have is dark as

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.729 
some of the areas you have is dark as
they<00:03:30.510> should<00:03:30.569> be<00:03:30.870> but<00:03:31.019> then<00:03:31.139> other<00:03:31.349> areas

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
they should be but then other areas

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.289 
they should be but then other areas
aren't<00:03:31.919> dark<00:03:32.129> enough<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.549> because<00:03:33.090> of<00:03:33.120> that

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
aren't dark enough and because of that

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.879 
aren't dark enough and because of that
it<00:03:33.569> makes<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.840> areas<00:03:34.169> that<00:03:34.319> are<00:03:34.440> as<00:03:34.560> dark<00:03:34.769> as

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
it makes the areas that are as dark as

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.199 
it makes the areas that are as dark as
they<00:03:35.010> should<00:03:35.069> be<00:03:35.370> look<00:03:35.639> like<00:03:35.790> they're<00:03:35.970> too

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
they should be look like they're too

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.180 
they should be look like they're too
dark<00:03:36.479> but<00:03:36.840> in<00:03:36.930> reality<00:03:37.079> it's<00:03:37.590> just<00:03:37.709> that<00:03:37.919> a<00:03:37.949> lot

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
dark but in reality it's just that a lot

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.219 
dark but in reality it's just that a lot
of<00:03:38.310> other<00:03:38.459> areas<00:03:38.699> can<00:03:39.209> be<00:03:39.239> darkened<00:03:39.659> up<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.959> his

a dark shadow and that's also going to

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.750 
a dark shadow and that's also going to
help<00:03:45.510> offset<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:46.379> dark<00:03:46.650> nostril<00:03:47.190> having
