00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
didn't seem too special to me and then

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.590 
didn't seem too special to me and then
the<00:00:35.190> second<00:00:35.520> thing<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.149> powered

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the second thing is this powered

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.630 
the second thing is this powered
contoured<00:00:37.140> cleansing<00:00:37.500> system<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.070> has<00:00:38.340> these

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
contoured cleansing system it has these

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.660 
contoured cleansing system it has these
silicone<00:00:39.149> brushes<00:00:39.690> or<00:00:39.989> bristles<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.829> its<00:00:41.489> got

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
silicone brushes or bristles and its got

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.520 
silicone brushes or bristles and its got
like<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.940> vibrating<00:00:42.480> capability<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.200> really

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
like a vibrating capability to really

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.040 
like a vibrating capability to really
work<00:00:43.739> into<00:00:44.129> all<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.460> nooks<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.000> crannies<00:00:45.480> so

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
work into all your nooks and crannies so

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.750 
work into all your nooks and crannies so
it's<00:00:46.260> outta<00:00:46.469> by<00:00:46.649> batteries<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> think<00:00:47.640> this

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
it's outta by batteries and I think this

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.060 
it's outta by batteries and I think this
system<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.059> pretty<00:00:48.329> comparable<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
system is pretty comparable to the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.130 
system is pretty comparable to the
Neutrogena<00:00:50.670> wave<00:00:50.879> which<00:00:51.629> I've<00:00:51.780> used<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.020> few

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
Neutrogena wave which I've used a few

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.619 
Neutrogena wave which I've used a few
times<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.160> love<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> wave<00:00:53.670> original<00:00:54.390> more

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
times and I love the wave original more

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.630 
times and I love the wave original more
than<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.899> sonic<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.370> seems<00:00:56.550> a

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
than the sonic but this one seems a

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.459 
than the sonic but this one seems a
little<00:00:56.789> bit<00:00:56.969> more<00:00:57.120> portable<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.230> great

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
little bit more portable and it's great

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.060 
little bit more portable and it's great
for<00:00:58.710> travel<00:01:03.019> so<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.290> i<00:01:04.320> am<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.680> washing<00:01:04.979> my

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
for travel so here i am just washing my

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.620 
for travel so here i am just washing my
face<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.580> getting<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.970> splash<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.479> some

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
face and getting it splash of some

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.679 
face and getting it splash of some
really<00:01:06.900> warm<00:01:07.229> water<00:01:07.700> 1<00:01:08.700> water<00:01:08.939> helps<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.390> open

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
really warm water 1 water helps to open

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.649 
really warm water 1 water helps to open
up<00:01:09.780> your<00:01:09.900> pores<00:01:10.200> before<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.740> exfoliate<00:01:10.979> and

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.390 

then<00:01:18.659> i<00:01:18.900> also<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.350> heat<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.979> bristles

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
then i also like to heat up the bristles

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.240 
then i also like to heat up the bristles
by<00:01:20.820> running<00:01:21.060> them<00:01:21.270> under<00:01:21.720> hot<00:01:21.960> water<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.740> this

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
by running them under hot water and this

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.039 
by running them under hot water and this
helps<00:01:23.640> because<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.180> bristles<00:01:24.509> themselves

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
helps because the bristles themselves

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.160 
helps because the bristles themselves
are<00:01:25.170> pretty<00:01:25.439> stiff<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.930> want<00:01:28.110> to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
are pretty stiff and you just want to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.630 
are pretty stiff and you just want to
make<00:01:28.290> sure<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.680> warm<00:01:28.979> up<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.460> they're<00:01:29.610> a

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
make sure you warm up so they're a

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.010 
make sure you warm up so they're a
little<00:01:29.790> bit<00:01:30.000> softer<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:30.630> bit<00:01:30.900> more

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
little bit softer a little bit more

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.940 
little bit softer a little bit more
gentle<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.680> your<00:01:31.890> skin

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.709 

and<00:01:38.950> then<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.880> use<00:01:40.060> this<00:01:40.210> I<00:01:40.359> just<00:01:40.539> take<00:01:40.689> a

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
and then to use this I just take a

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.840 
and then to use this I just take a
little<00:01:40.960> bit<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.229> a<00:01:41.380> cleanser<00:01:41.829> and<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.280> can<00:01:42.490> put

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
over your face or you can stick them on

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.380 
over your face or you can stick them on
the<00:01:46.570> bristles<00:01:47.110> like<00:01:47.320> I'm<00:01:47.469> doing<00:01:47.740> right<00:01:47.770> here<00:01:48.390> I

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
particular reason but then I spread it

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.949 
particular reason but then I spread it
out<00:01:53.020> over<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.409> bristles<00:01:57.659> there<00:01:58.659> it<00:01:58.780> is<00:01:58.929> right

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959

around<00:02:13.540> my<00:02:13.780> face<00:02:14.079> so<00:02:15.040> my<00:02:15.160> first<00:02:15.340> impression<00:02:15.849> is

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
around my face so my first impression is

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.699 
around my face so my first impression is
that<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.360> isn't<00:02:16.720> nearly<00:02:16.959> as<00:02:17.079> gentle<00:02:17.200> as<00:02:17.650> I

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
that this isn't nearly as gentle as I

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.890 
that this isn't nearly as gentle as I
would<00:02:17.860> hope<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.549> you<00:02:18.940> can<00:02:19.090> tell<00:02:19.269> as<00:02:19.390> my<00:02:19.510> skin

would hope and you can tell as my skin

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.750 
would hope and you can tell as my skin
starts<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.290> turn<00:02:20.500> pink<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.220> then<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.519> turns

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
starts to turn pink and then it turns

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.850 
starts to turn pink and then it turns
red<00:02:22.090> but<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.810> doesn't<00:02:22.989> matter<00:02:23.110> too<00:02:23.500> much<00:02:23.530> which

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
red but it doesn't matter too much which

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.199
