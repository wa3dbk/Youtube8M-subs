half<00:05:40.930> marathon<00:05:40.960> even<00:05:41.950> though<00:05:42.100> it<00:05:42.280> wasn't<00:05:42.460> my

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
half marathon even though it wasn't my

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.410 
half marathon even though it wasn't my
fault<00:05:42.930> but<00:05:43.930> God<00:05:44.770> said<00:05:45.460> just<00:05:46.030> because<00:05:46.180> you

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
fault but God said just because you

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.000 
fault but God said just because you
can't<00:05:46.660> run<00:05:46.930> doesn't<00:05:47.440> mean<00:05:47.530> you<00:05:47.590> can't<00:05:47.890> do

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
can't run doesn't mean you can't do

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.490 
can't run doesn't mean you can't do
other<00:05:48.250> things<00:05:48.400> so<00:05:49.270> now<00:05:49.540> my<00:05:49.750> half<00:05:49.900> marathon<00:05:50.080> has

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
other things so now my half marathon has
