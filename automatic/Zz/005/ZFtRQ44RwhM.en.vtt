really breathe great because she's

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.769

wearing like all these old vintage style
dresses<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.760> they<00:00:23.760> probably<00:00:23.970> wouldn't<00:00:24.390> look

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
dresses and they probably wouldn't look

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.700 
dresses and they probably wouldn't look
as<00:00:25.039> good<00:00:26.039> on<00:00:26.340> her<00:00:26.550> as<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.330> would<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.900> me<00:00:28.320> like
