00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
your essays there'll be two types of

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.819 
your essays there'll be two types of
composition<00:00:43.270> one<00:00:43.810> will<00:00:44.020> be<00:00:44.140> factual<00:00:44.380> based

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
composition one will be factual based

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.070 
composition one will be factual based
and<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.280> other<00:00:45.400> one<00:00:45.640> will<00:00:45.790> be<00:00:45.820> creative<00:00:46.360> under

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
and the other one will be creative under

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.630 
and the other one will be creative under
factual<00:00:47.500> basis<00:00:47.920> two<00:00:48.070> types<00:00:48.340> one<00:00:48.610> is

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
factual basis two types one is

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.340 
factual basis two types one is
argumentative<00:00:49.540> and<00:00:49.720> the<00:00:49.840> other<00:00:49.990> one<00:00:50.200> is<00:00:50.290> a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
argumentative and the other one is a

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.440 
argumentative and the other one is a
discussion<00:00:50.680> based<00:00:51.010> testing<00:00:51.340> so<00:00:51.850> you<00:00:51.910> have<00:00:52.240> to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
discussion based testing so you have to

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.000 
discussion based testing so you have to
know<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:52.720> difference<00:00:53.140> because<00:00:53.350> both<00:00:53.710> of<00:00:53.740> them

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
know the difference because both of them

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.680 
know the difference because both of them
require<00:00:54.400> a<00:00:54.430> different<00:00:54.850> structure<00:00:55.270> to<00:00:55.540> write

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
require a different structure to write

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.780 
require a different structure to write
so<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.440> criteria<00:00:56.950> to<00:00:57.100> identify<00:00:57.130> are

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
so the criteria to identify are

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.130 
so the criteria to identify are
argumentative<00:00:58.180> is<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.760> question<00:01:01.300> always<00:01:01.930> has

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
argumentative is the question always has

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.710 
argumentative is the question always has
then<00:01:04.830> okay<00:01:05.830> what<00:01:06.670> do<00:01:06.759> I<00:01:06.850> mean<00:01:07.030> by<00:01:07.090> having<00:01:07.600> a

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
then okay what do I mean by having a

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.530 
then okay what do I mean by having a
stead<00:01:07.990> look<00:01:08.470> at<00:01:08.590> this<00:01:08.710> question<00:01:09.540> examinations

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.130 

okay<00:02:10.619> they<00:02:10.800> won't<00:02:10.950> have<00:02:11.250> these<00:02:11.459> words<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.450> if

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
okay they won't have these words so if

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.170 
okay they won't have these words so if
you<00:02:13.290> have<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.620> too<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.160> satisfies<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.910> two

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
you have this too it satisfies this two

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.690 
you have this too it satisfies this two
criteria<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:16.440> know<00:02:16.739> that<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.310> question

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
criteria you know that the question

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.949 
criteria you know that the question
you're<00:02:17.879> looking<00:02:18.180> at<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.480> an<00:02:18.599> argumentative

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
you're looking at is an argumentative

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.280 
you're looking at is an argumentative
all<00:02:19.920> right<00:02:20.099> so<00:02:20.549> once<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.940> identify<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.690> then

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
all right so once you identify that then

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.050 
all right so once you identify that then
it's<00:02:22.470> easy<00:02:22.680> for<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.099> go<00:02:23.310> into<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.640> the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
it's easy for you to go into the the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.930 
it's easy for you to go into the the
