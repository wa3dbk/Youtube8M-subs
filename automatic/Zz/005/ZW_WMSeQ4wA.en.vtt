00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:03.890
 Human 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.360
 Not fast 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.140
 It is not strong 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.600
 And unable to overcome the laws of gravity 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.320
 In terms of physical capacity 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.820
 Just look at yourself in the mirror for 5 minutes 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.440
 To note it is compared to predators 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.880
 Nature has done an impressive job 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.180
 If yes ... we are very intelligent beings 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.080
 Our brain has made us control the whole animal kingdom 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.920
 With great support from technology 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.380
 But nevertheless .. 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.080
 Why did nature not give us too? 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.520
 Superhuman abilities 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.420
 Allow us to run at speeds of up to 100 km / h .. Like leopard? 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.600
 Or cutting a tree with one hand stroke as the bear does? 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.900
 In fact we should not forget 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.740
 That "evolution" has given us the strongest powers of supernatural nature 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.460
 Rather, the most distinctive and solitary force 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.600
 It is astonishing in its effectiveness 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.900
 They are endurance and follow-up 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.560
 Tens of thousands of years ago 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.960
 Our ancestors were powerful fishermen 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.520
 Able to endure large and continuous efforts for a long time 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.360
 Where they became experts in the art of tracking and stalking 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.520
 They were able to hunt down any prey of any kind 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.740
 Over long kilometers 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.880
 Until their prey collapses from fatigue or suffers a heart attack 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.560
 Unlike other predators 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.340
 Those who are prepared to run chase on short distances. 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.900
 A person who has gone a long way in endurance 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.660
 Frysth wish to wish the chase time and expiry! 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.680
 But eventually it collapses 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.640
 Before his perseverance and his insistence on repeated attacks 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.940
 But ... how have we become capable of this performance?! 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.560
 Well ... First of all, we are sweating and this is not what happens when many animals 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.540
 Which regulates the temperature of her body through the exhaustion! 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.160
 If it gives them preference in mid-distance chases 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.000
 The sweating is an ideal solution 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.920
 To cool the body that makes long efforts 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.860
 As in the case of long haul 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.680
 Also ... thanks to the full range of muscles and special tendons 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.560
 - specifically the muscles of the ankles and neck muscles - 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.380
 We are able to run erect 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.840
 They reveal what surrounds us with ease 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.940
 And in a very stable position 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.180
 In addition to that we are able to breathe 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.300
 As we want during every step we take 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.260
 While most animals can only do it once! 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.740
 (Which is not perfect for improving their oxygen supply) 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.020
 You will easily understand why our ancestors in prehistoric times 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.300
 Despite the complete absence of advanced technology 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.080
 They were already the most terrifying predators in the animal kingdom 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.640
 Our fishing techniques were not as spectacular as hunting techniques for cats 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.480
 But our chances of success in fishing will make her feel jealous! 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.500
