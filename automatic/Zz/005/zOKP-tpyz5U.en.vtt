00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.280
 at 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:29.040
 sail explains after explains all 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.770
 able to get back to me it's 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:40.379
 one of the excerpts of the three dvd's because 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:42.150
 just like a theme of magic after 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.350
 love is the mean magic as much 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.379
 more than I think it is with us 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.300
 because magic play for you a 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.890
 important role I would say school that's 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.390
 was going more or less well the magic 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.710
 clear arrival but actually me on my 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.180
 internal newsletter is written I had some 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.129
 difficulty integrating myself into the group that I 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.210
 speak too loudly that I bothered because 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.820
 that I was in the category 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.589
 curious little ones but too curious he 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.239
 was tired he's still hand 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.260
 that one must always replace one's place 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.869
 because they want to answer all 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.400
 the questions that often his selection 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.740
 curiosity it's not necessarily because 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.820
 we are so, but it ends up 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.770
 children often do not end up being 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.750
 frustrated because they are constantly 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.490
 snubbed and in my case the magic is 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.229
 arrived very early my parents at the age of 7 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.760
 years of me doing a whole 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.020
 houdini which we end up losing all 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:31.620
 pieces and view on pallet 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.150
 of actors actually no then the magic has 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.860
 changed my life that channeling my energy 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.780
 it's a way to get a lot 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.120
 of self-esteem also because a child 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.160
 who is constantly being rebuked to whoever says 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.780
 comatose waow managed to do that you're 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.990
 so good I'm impressed even if we 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.280
 see the trick times it's really 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.810
 really good then finally my 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.500
 school path is really very 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.020
 fine 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.950
 then that's and it's a key element in 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.810
 my journey and ultimately 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.540
 finally you make a little more 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.940
 to children in schools I make you 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.430
 to appear then a dvd 10 tours explain 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.540
 among others for the family parts the 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.979
 magic of the story explained for 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.780
 impress visit often we hear 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.940
 defending oneself of the world knows that there is 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.580
 always a little children's show 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.930
 antoine salon but it's the 6 the dvd 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.310
 ideal because I teach rates that 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.740
 are easy to do with 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.540
 easy to find accessories 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.370
 home one can become a magician 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.320
 brand is in you did you shock and 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.540
 Marie-Pierre could do some tricks of 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:29.120
 magic at you visit and rates 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.650
 interest it is for you to choose 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.270
 fashions on a show if she puts to 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.830
 the assumption this call and louis 24 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.420
 December at 3 pm and I'm a 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.980
 show is called science or magic and 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.260
 I use magic to make 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.000
 popularization science too i'm going 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.620
 ask you I ask you and patrick

 talk about redoing her life composed of 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.220
 several guards in vigen and asia 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.250
 so it's not complicated so all the 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.150
 world is nice with a mix 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.260
 of fatty acids then falls on the task 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.850

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.230
 not chop if it's going to make walls yes 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.870

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.950
 drop it obviously it will fall 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.320
 on the table it's the same density as 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.480
 there around us while this one 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.680
 density obviously know it without 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.060
 sail in the air to dance like a 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.459
