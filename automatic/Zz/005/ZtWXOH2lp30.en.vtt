l6 10 so far it's the first video that
I'm<00:00:47.820> shooting<00:00:48.090> with<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.750> seems<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.140> be

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
I'm shooting with it and it seems to be

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.910 
I'm shooting with it and it seems to be
really<00:00:49.530> nice<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.100> did<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> ga<00:00:51.710> fungus<00:00:52.710> gnat

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
really nice I did have a ga fungus gnat

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.040 
really nice I did have a ga fungus gnat
problem<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:55.190> it<00:00:56.190> seems<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:56.699> good<00:00:57.270> no<00:00:57.870> more

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
problem and it seems to be good no more

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.130 
problem and it seems to be good no more
fungus<00:00:58.410> gnats<00:00:58.789> good<00:00:59.789> for<00:01:00.030> me<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.149> guess<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.809> use

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
fungus gnats good for me I guess I use

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.170 
fungus gnats good for me I guess I use
the<00:01:01.350> Blackmagic<00:01:02.010> strips<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.579> window<00:01:02.850> strips

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the Blackmagic strips the window strips

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.509 
the Blackmagic strips the window strips
actually<00:01:03.690> they<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.199> hook<00:01:04.409> up<00:01:04.589> or<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.070> connect

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
actually they you hook up or you connect

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.240 
actually they you hook up or you connect
to<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> window<00:01:06.049> works<00:01:07.049> wonders<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.830> think

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
to the window works wonders I think

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.179 
to the window works wonders I think
that's<00:01:08.400> probably<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.729> best<00:01:09.000> way<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.450> go

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
that's probably the best way you can go

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.460 
that's probably the best way you can go
here's<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.280> super<00:01:11.670> dwarf<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.960> mom<00:01:13.170> put

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
here's a super dwarf that the mom put

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.340 
here's a super dwarf that the mom put
off<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.040> puff<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.720> guys<00:01:15.930> know<00:01:18.350> they

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
off it's a puff as you guys know they

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.710 
off it's a puff as you guys know they
find<00:01:19.560> some<00:01:19.830> stock<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.460> there<00:01:20.729> there<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.540> go

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
find some stock in there there you go

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.520 
find some stock in there there you go
not<00:01:22.140> too<00:01:22.380> bad<00:01:22.619> looking<00:01:23.580> good<00:01:27.110> things<00:01:28.110> pretty

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
not too bad looking good things pretty

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.340 
not too bad looking good things pretty
good<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> plant<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.820> far<00:01:30.150> we'll<00:01:30.869> see<00:01:31.049> how<00:01:31.229> it

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
good a plant so far we'll see how it

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.609 
good a plant so far we'll see how it
goes<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:32.689> thought<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.960> super<00:01:34.290> doors<00:01:34.500> were

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
goes I thought that super doors were

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.960 
goes I thought that super doors were
supposed<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.890> get<00:01:35.009> bigger<00:01:35.220> about<00:01:35.369> up<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.759> 4

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
supposed to get bigger about up to 4

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.420 
supposed to get bigger about up to 4
foot<00:01:36.210> for<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> flower<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.740> think<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.159> one's

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
foot for a flower but I think this one's

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.060 
foot for a flower but I think this one's
heading<00:01:38.759> into<00:01:38.909> flowering<00:01:39.240> as<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.689> speak<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
heading into flowering as we speak the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.670 
heading into flowering as we speak the
leaves<00:01:41.310> were<00:01:41.610> pretty<00:01:42.150> big<00:01:42.450> at<00:01:42.689> one<00:01:42.869> point<00:01:43.170> as

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
leaves were pretty big at one point as

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
leaves were pretty big at one point as
you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:45.950> and<00:01:46.950> they're<00:01:47.250> pretty<00:01:47.460> big

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
you can see and they're pretty big

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.080 
you can see and they're pretty big
leaves<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.229> new<00:01:49.380> leaves<00:01:49.649> are<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.880> big

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
leaves and the new leaves are that big

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.219 
leaves and the new leaves are that big
so<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:52.350> big<00:01:52.560> jump<00:01:53.630> those<00:01:54.630> could<00:01:54.869> be<00:01:54.899> flag

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
so it's big jump those could be flag

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.830 
so it's big jump those could be flag
leaves<00:01:55.530> they're<00:01:56.460> probably<00:01:56.700> not<00:01:56.969> though<00:01:57.240> I

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
leaves they're probably not though I

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.899 
leaves they're probably not though I
guess<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.829> going<00:01:59.040> into<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.280> spurt<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.610> shooting

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
guess is going into a spurt of shooting

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.620 
guess is going into a spurt of shooting
on<00:02:00.000> small<00:02:00.299> leaves

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
on small leaves

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.899 
on small leaves
well<00:02:01.020> what<00:02:01.170> gets<00:02:01.380> me<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.490> starting<00:02:02.670> to

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
well what gets me is it's starting to

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.859 
well what gets me is it's starting to
bubble<00:02:03.119> here<00:02:03.680> as<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.920> can<00:02:04.950> see<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.869> it's

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
bubble here as you can see and it's

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.050 
bubble here as you can see and it's
starting<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.200> fatten<00:02:07.590> up<00:02:07.710> here<00:02:08.099> which<00:02:08.789> tells

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
starting to fatten up here which tells

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.100 
starting to fatten up here which tells

produce<00:03:13.280> pumps<00:03:14.280> what<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.760> do<00:03:14.940> is<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:15.690> cut<00:03:15.900> it

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
produce pumps what you do is you cut it

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.050 
produce pumps what you do is you cut it
down<00:03:16.200> all<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.130> leaves<00:03:17.340> off<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.790> stick<00:03:18.030> a

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
down all the leaves off and you stick a

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.820 
down all the leaves off and you stick a
pole<00:03:18.360> right<00:03:18.630> down<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.989> center<00:03:19.320> of<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.560> and

pole right down the center of it and

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.150 
pole right down the center of it and
that<00:03:20.610> forces<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.209> pup<00:03:21.770> just<00:03:22.770> to<00:03:22.890> get<00:03:23.040> extra

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
that forces it to pup just to get extra

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.640 
that forces it to pup just to get extra
pups<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.570> can<00:03:24.720> give<00:03:24.840> them<00:03:24.930> away<00:03:25.080> or<00:03:25.170> sell
