they dont have space for fortress dragon

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.990 
they dont have space for fortress dragon
so<00:06:21.340> I<00:06:21.880> mean<00:06:22.240> they<00:06:22.960> might<00:06:23.110> make<00:06:23.410> space<00:06:23.740> but<00:06:24.730> I

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
so I mean they might make space but I

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.580 
so I mean they might make space but I
mean<00:06:25.180> chances<00:06:25.630> are<00:06:25.840> that<00:06:25.870> they're<00:06:26.350> not<00:06:26.500> going

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
mean chances are that they're not going

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.990 
mean chances are that they're not going
to<00:06:26.650> have<00:06:26.830> the<00:06:26.980> fortress<00:06:27.310> dragon<00:06:27.430> because<00:06:27.850> they

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
to have the fortress dragon because they

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.850 
to have the fortress dragon because they

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
would rather run better cards because

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.860 
would rather run better cards because
they're<00:06:30.040> not<00:06:30.100> going<00:06:30.280> to<00:06:30.340> think<00:06:30.610> that<00:06:30.850> a<00:06:30.880> good
