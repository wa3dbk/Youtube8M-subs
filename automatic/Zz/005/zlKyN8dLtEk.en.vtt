00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
yeah is a very sharp game after the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.230 
yeah is a very sharp game after the
opening<00:00:16.470> which<00:00:16.740> he<00:00:17.250> played<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.490> bit<00:00:17.670> risky<00:00:18.060> but

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
opening which he played a bit risky but

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.620 
opening which he played a bit risky but
also<00:00:18.600> very<00:00:19.140> interestingly<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:20.360> his<00:00:21.360> peace

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
also very interestingly and his peace

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.990 
also very interestingly and his peace
sacrifice<00:00:22.170> at<00:00:23.010> first<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.460> didn't<00:00:23.670> take<00:00:23.790> it<00:00:23.910> too

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
sacrifice at first I didn't take it too

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.020 
sacrifice at first I didn't take it too
seriously<00:00:24.450> but<00:00:24.690> then<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.960> realized<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.820> if<00:00:26.820> I

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.030 
seriously but then I realized that if I

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.840 
seriously but then I realized that if I
made<00:00:27.420> any<00:00:27.600> mistake<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.350> could<00:00:28.650> easily<00:00:28.890> lose<00:00:29.310> and

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
made any mistake I could easily lose and

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.269 
made any mistake I could easily lose and
I<00:00:30.330> had<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.600> find<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.930> number<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.830> very<00:00:32.070> nice

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
I had to find a number of very nice

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.910 
I had to find a number of very nice
moves<00:00:32.550> too<00:00:32.930> although<00:00:33.930> he<00:00:34.320> also<00:00:34.470> made<00:00:34.710> some

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
moves too although he also made some

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.500 
moves too although he also made some
mistakes<00:00:35.220> in<00:00:35.309> time<00:00:35.520> trouble<00:00:35.879> for<00:00:36.510> instance<00:00:38.510> my

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
mistakes in time trouble for instance my

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.660 
mistakes in time trouble for instance my
d4<00:00:40.199> would<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.410> been<00:00:40.530> better<00:00:40.710> though<00:00:41.430> it

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
d4 would have been better though it

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.819 
d4 would have been better though it
wouldn't<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:41.970> been<00:00:42.030> clear<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.420> any<00:00:42.540> case

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
wouldn't have been clear in any case

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.020 
wouldn't have been clear in any case
actually<00:00:43.829> probably<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.340> time<00:00:44.550> trouble<00:00:44.850> he

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
actually probably in time trouble he

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.490 
actually probably in time trouble he
might<00:00:45.060> have<00:00:45.300> had<00:00:45.420> better<00:00:45.570> practical<00:00:46.170> chances

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
might have had better practical chances

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.729 
might have had better practical chances
but<00:00:46.940> I<00:00:47.940> think<00:00:48.540> I<00:00:48.630> handled<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.050> situation<00:00:49.079> well

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
but I think I handled the situation well

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.010 
but I think I handled the situation well
I<00:00:49.980> didn't<00:00:50.399> take<00:00:50.520> too<00:00:50.640> much<00:00:50.760> time<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:52.010> I<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.840> I

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
I didn't take too much time and I and I

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.790 
I didn't take too much time and I and I
had<00:00:55.200> enough<00:00:55.410> time<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.820> yeah<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.559> think<00:00:58.559> about

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
had enough time to yeah to think about

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.280 
had enough time to yeah to think about
all<00:00:58.950> my<00:00:59.070> moves<00:00:59.370> yeah<00:00:59.790> and<00:01:00.090> no<00:01:00.719> you're<00:01:01.110> one

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
all my moves yeah and no you're one

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.040 
all my moves yeah and no you're one
point<00:01:01.920> ahead<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.370> Neji<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.180> tomorrow<00:01:03.809> you

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
point ahead of Neji and tomorrow you

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.540 
point ahead of Neji and tomorrow you
will<00:01:04.199> play<00:01:04.410> him<00:01:04.559> or<00:01:04.739> what<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.009> expect<00:01:05.369> from

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
will play him or what do you expect from

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.749 
will play him or what do you expect from
the<00:01:05.729> game<00:01:05.880> well<00:01:06.840> I'll<00:01:07.350> play<00:01:07.740> for<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.039> win<00:01:08.190> but<00:01:08.460> I

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
the game well I'll play for a win but I

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.730 
the game well I'll play for a win but I
don't<00:01:09.509> want<00:01:09.690> to<00:01:09.780> take<00:01:09.930> too<00:01:10.080> many<00:01:10.140> risks<00:01:10.289> I

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
don't want to take too many risks I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.710 
don't want to take too many risks I
don't<00:01:11.460> want<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> play<00:01:11.789> like<00:01:11.970> today<00:01:12.300> I<00:01:12.330> draw<00:01:12.570> is

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
don't want to play like today I draw is

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.190 
don't want to play like today I draw is
enough

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
enough

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.350 
enough
yeah<00:01:13.619> draw<00:01:14.010> wouldn't<00:01:14.340> throw<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> fair

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
yeah draw wouldn't throw it be a fair

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.180 
yeah draw wouldn't throw it be a fair
result<00:01:15.690> but<00:01:15.900> also<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.590> think<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.920> should<00:01:17.070> play

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
result but also I think I should play

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.940 
result but also I think I should play
for<00:01:17.640> win<00:01:17.790> because<00:01:17.940> I'm<00:01:18.180> white<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.950> even

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
for win because I'm white and even

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.280 
for win because I'm white and even
already<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.720> tournament<00:01:22.140> situation

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
already and the tournament situation

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.539 
already and the tournament situation
doesn't<00:01:23.250> matter<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.750> case

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
doesn't matter for you in in that case

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.030 
doesn't matter for you in in that case
well<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.580> mean<00:01:26.760> I<00:01:27.119> hope<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.080> won't<00:01:28.650> lose<00:01:28.860> of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
well I mean I hope that I won't lose of

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.039 
well I mean I hope that I won't lose of
course<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.580> think<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.450> play<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.900> win

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
course I think that I can play for a win

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.010 
course I think that I can play for a win
without<00:01:31.520> without<00:01:32.520> striving<00:01:33.420> too<00:01:33.540> hard<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.990> I

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
without without striving too hard that I

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.010 
without without striving too hard that I
might<00:01:34.320> actually<00:01:34.770> lose<00:01:35.130> yeah<00:01:35.760> if<00:01:36.510> you<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.869> to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
might actually lose yeah if you have to

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.380 
might actually lose yeah if you have to
prepare<00:01:37.409> tonight<00:01:37.770> yeah<00:01:38.430> will<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.790> be<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.119> some

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
prepare tonight yeah will it be so some

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.039 
prepare tonight yeah will it be so some
calm<00:01:39.810> line<00:01:40.140> all<00:01:40.590> right<00:01:40.830> you<00:01:41.400> will<00:01:41.580> normal<00:01:42.570> I'll

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
calm line all right you will normal I'll

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.810 
calm line all right you will normal I'll
probably<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:43.439> play<00:01:43.590> my<00:01:43.740> normal<00:01:44.040> opens<00:01:44.369> yeah

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
probably just play my normal opens yeah

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.940 
probably just play my normal opens yeah
that<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.509> quite<00:01:45.689> risky<00:01:45.960> doesn't<00:01:46.650> it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
that can be quite risky doesn't it

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.700 
that can be quite risky doesn't it
well<00:01:47.610> usually<00:01:48.299> not<00:01:48.630> too<00:01:48.840> risky<00:01:49.259> what<00:01:49.530> black

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
well usually not too risky what black

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.230 
well usually not too risky what black
it's<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.970> harder<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.450> control<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.900> game<00:01:52.049> so

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
it's it's harder to control the game so

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.490 
it's it's harder to control the game so
we<00:01:54.240> would<00:01:54.420> white<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.930> pretty<00:01:55.200> much<00:01:55.290> control

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
we would white I can pretty much control

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.109 
we would white I can pretty much control
the<00:01:55.799> pace<00:01:55.979> whatever<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.400> feel<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:56.670> doing

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
the pace whatever I feel like doing

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.590 
the pace whatever I feel like doing
yeah<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.290> far<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.860> seem<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.280> deal<00:02:00.030> quite<00:02:00.299> well

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
yeah so far you seem to deal quite well

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.929 
yeah so far you seem to deal quite well
with<00:02:00.780> pressure<00:02:01.229> yeah<00:02:02.130> do<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.759> any

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
with pressure yeah do you have any
