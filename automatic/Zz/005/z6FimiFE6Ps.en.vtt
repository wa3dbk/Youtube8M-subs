a pretty dark still back one started in
the<00:02:50.140> front<00:02:51.959> well<00:02:52.959> this<00:02:53.140> is<00:02:53.350> it<00:02:54.330> very<00:02:55.330> pleased

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.940 

friend<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.070> mine<00:03:00.190> said<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.459> lower<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:01.950> he's

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
friend of mine said to lower it he's

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.350 
friend of mine said to lower it he's
probably<00:03:03.190> right<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.730> would<00:03:03.910> make<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.239> look

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
probably right it would make it look

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.690 
probably right it would make it look
pretty<00:03:04.600> darn<00:03:04.870> cold<00:03:05.140> by<00:03:05.500> in<00:03:05.709> lowered<00:03:06.280> it<00:03:06.400> just<00:03:06.610> a

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
pretty darn cold by in lowered it just a

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.360 
pretty darn cold by in lowered it just a
tad<00:03:07.350> I'm<00:03:08.350> not<00:03:08.530> sure<00:03:08.680> if<00:03:08.770> I<00:03:08.860> want<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.100> do<00:03:09.220> that

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
tad I'm not sure if I want to do that

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.090 
tad I'm not sure if I want to do that
though<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:12.100> is<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.310> 2008<00:03:13.380> by<00:03:14.380> 2008

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
though so this is a 2008 by 2008

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
though so this is a 2008 by 2008
