chatting<00:01:10.909> to<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:11.299> US<00:01:11.509> president<00:01:11.930> well<00:01:12.470> I'm

on<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.570> table<00:01:14.600> that<00:01:15.020> is<00:01:15.290> as<00:01:15.500> once<00:01:15.770> I<00:01:16.070> think

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
on the table that is as once I think

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.859 
on the table that is as once I think
he'll<00:01:16.400> probably<00:01:16.670> suggest<00:01:17.150> some<00:01:17.330> things<00:01:17.540> to<00:01:17.750> do

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
he'll probably suggest some things to do

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.289 
he'll probably suggest some things to do
with<00:01:18.049> global<00:01:18.560> climate<00:01:19.070> issues<00:01:19.400> which<00:01:19.909> is<00:01:20.090> one

with global climate issues which is one
of<00:01:20.329> the<00:01:20.509> Americans<00:01:20.900> to<00:01:21.140> sort<00:01:21.619> of<00:01:21.680> fallen

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
of the Americans to sort of fallen

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.429 
of the Americans to sort of fallen
behind<00:01:22.729> his<00:01:23.090> ETS<00:01:23.570> idea<00:01:24.140> their<00:01:24.320> own

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
behind his ETS idea their own

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.620 
behind his ETS idea their own
cap-and-trade<00:01:24.950> legislation<00:01:25.430> is<00:01:26.390> fairly

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
cap-and-trade legislation is fairly

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.899

slowly<00:01:27.110> going<00:01:27.439> through<00:01:27.710> their<00:01:27.890> Congress<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:28.850> I

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
slowly going through their Congress so I

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.370 
slowly going through their Congress so I
think<00:01:28.970> that<00:01:29.210> would<00:01:29.299> be<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.450> big<00:01:29.600> issue<00:01:29.750> the

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
think that would be a big issue the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.569 
think that would be a big issue the
other<00:01:30.530> issue<00:01:30.740> will<00:01:30.979> be<00:01:31.009> some<00:01:31.340> kind<00:01:31.520> of

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
other issue will be some kind of

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.300 
other issue will be some kind of
regional<00:01:32.500> agreement<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:33.619> pack<00:01:33.860> that<00:01:34.130> might

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
regional agreement and pack that might

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.670 
regional agreement and pack that might
build<00:01:34.579> on<00:01:34.700> apex<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:35.509> I<00:01:35.540> think<00:01:35.810> he's<00:01:35.960> a<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.649> know

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
build on apex so I think he's a you know

to him and what about mr. Abbott how do
you<00:01:42.470> think<00:01:42.619> that<00:01:42.740> relationship<00:01:43.399> will<00:01:43.549> go

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
you think that relationship will go

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.639 
you think that relationship will go
considering<00:01:44.210> previous<00:01:44.659> history<00:01:45.020> well<00:01:45.619> I

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
considering previous history well I

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.039 
considering previous history well I
think<00:01:45.829> I<00:01:46.159> think<00:01:46.399> both<00:01:46.880> both<00:01:47.570> leader<00:01:47.869> of<00:01:47.960> the

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
think I think both both leader of the

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.480 
think I think both both leader of the
Opposition<00:01:48.500> in<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.619> Prime<00:01:48.890> Minister<00:01:49.310> will

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
Opposition in the Prime Minister will

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.789 
Opposition in the Prime Minister will
want<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.759> see<00:01:49.939> themselves<00:01:50.149> as<00:01:50.689> men<00:01:51.590> in<00:01:51.710> the

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
want to see themselves as men in the

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.590 
want to see themselves as men in the
style<00:01:52.159> of<00:01:52.310> Barack<00:01:52.670> Obama<00:01:53.149> kind<00:01:53.540> of

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
style of Barack Obama kind of

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.660 
style of Barack Obama kind of
politicians<00:01:54.290> that<00:01:54.560> are<00:01:54.619> energetic<00:01:55.430> and

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
politicians that are energetic and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.940 
politicians that are energetic and
charismatic<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:57.020> think<00:01:57.259> just<00:01:57.439> being<00:01:57.619> near

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
charismatic and I think just being near

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.370 
charismatic and I think just being near
Obama<00:01:58.340> has<00:01:58.909> some<00:01:59.240> benefits<00:01:59.450> in<00:01:59.899> that<00:02:00.049> regard

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
Obama has some benefits in that regard

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.340 
Obama has some benefits in that regard

previous a u.s. president do you think
we've<00:02:09.410> got<00:02:09.619> such<00:02:09.860> a<00:02:09.890> similar<00:02:10.340> relationship

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
we've got such a similar relationship

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.390 
we've got such a similar relationship
with<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.210> new<00:02:11.390> leaders<00:02:11.690> now<00:02:11.900> because<00:02:12.200> the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
with the new leaders now because the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.890 
with the new leaders now because the
a lot<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.700> criticism<00:02:13.299> throne<00:02:13.659> of<00:02:13.689> that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
a lot of criticism throne of that

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.869 
a lot of criticism throne of that
relationship<00:02:14.170> with<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.709> US<00:02:14.980> during<00:02:15.370> mr.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
relationship with the US during mr.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.550 
relationship with the US during mr.
Howard's<00:02:16.329> leadership<00:02:16.750> I<00:02:16.989> think<00:02:17.140> there<00:02:17.439> was<00:02:17.530> a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
Howard's leadership I think there was a

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.710 
Howard's leadership I think there was a
fairly<00:02:17.829> unique<00:02:18.220> time<00:02:18.579> I<00:02:18.879> mean<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.390> only<00:02:19.420> other

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
fairly unique time I mean the only other

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.059 
fairly unique time I mean the only other
time<00:02:19.959> would<00:02:20.140> be<00:02:20.170> during<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.680> Second<00:02:21.040> World

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
time would be during the Second World

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.319 
time would be during the Second World
War<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.610> there<00:02:21.760> was<00:02:21.879> that<00:02:22.030> kind<00:02:22.180> of

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
War that there was that kind of

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.479 
War that there was that kind of
closeness<00:02:22.689> and<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.530> think<00:02:23.769> how<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.129> made<00:02:24.370> this

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
closeness and I think how it made this

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.979 
closeness and I think how it made this
calculation<00:02:25.269> that<00:02:25.299> Bush<00:02:25.659> wasn't

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
calculation that Bush wasn't

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.990 
calculation that Bush wasn't
particularly<00:02:26.319> popular<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:27.159> a<00:02:27.519> lot<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.700> parts

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
particularly popular and a lot of parts

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.190 
particularly popular and a lot of parts
of<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.209> world<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.569> it<00:02:28.659> was<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.810> good<00:02:28.930> time<00:02:29.140> for

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
of the world and it was a good time for

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.199 
of the world and it was a good time for
Australia<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:29.829> get<00:02:29.980> closer<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.519> the<00:02:30.640> US<00:02:30.970> I

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
Australia to get closer to the US I

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.729 
Australia to get closer to the US I
think<00:02:31.659> that<00:02:31.780> moment<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.260> not<00:02:32.379> going<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.620> be

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
think that moment is not going to be

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.500 
think that moment is not going to be
sort<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.069> replicated<00:02:33.670> Obama<00:02:33.939> is<00:02:34.120> very<00:02:34.269> popular

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
sort of replicated Obama is very popular

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.110 
sort of replicated Obama is very popular
in<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.900> lot<00:02:35.079> of<00:02:35.170> places<00:02:35.439> I'm<00:02:35.950> sure<00:02:36.340> Mr<00:02:36.700> Rudd<00:02:36.909> will

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
in a lot of places I'm sure Mr Rudd will

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.789 
in a lot of places I'm sure Mr Rudd will
want<00:02:37.359> to<00:02:37.510> have<00:02:37.689> that<00:02:37.870> close<00:02:38.019> relationship

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
want to have that close relationship

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.740 
want to have that close relationship
Australian<00:02:39.489> Prime<00:02:39.519> Minister's<00:02:40.060> tend<00:02:40.359> to<00:02:40.480> like

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
Australian Prime Minister's tend to like

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.140 
Australian Prime Minister's tend to like
being<00:02:41.500> close<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.040> air<00:02:42.220> of<00:02:42.340> Washington<00:02:42.909> but

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
being close to the air of Washington but

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.149 
being close to the air of Washington but
I<00:02:43.359> don't<00:02:44.019> think<00:02:44.140> going<00:02:44.319> to<00:02:44.470> be<00:02:44.590> as<00:02:44.709> close<00:02:44.950> this

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
I don't think going to be as close this

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.670 
I don't think going to be as close this
is<00:02:45.239> very<00:02:46.239> unlikely<00:02:46.629> to<00:02:46.870> be<00:02:46.900> replicated<00:02:47.560> what

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
is very unlikely to be replicated what

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.710 
is very unlikely to be replicated what
happened<00:02:47.980> with<00:02:48.129> Howard<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.639> bush<00:02:49.120> now<00:02:49.659> we

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:56.889 
cornerstone of security surely this is

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.259

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
quite rare for a president to come Bush

presidents like Reagan never came so it

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.619 
presidents like Reagan never came so it
is<00:03:24.010> an<00:03:24.160> unusual<00:03:24.340> thing<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.150> suppose<00:03:25.419> we

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
is an unusual thing and I suppose we

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.780 
is an unusual thing and I suppose we
we're<00:03:26.349> a<00:03:26.379> little<00:03:26.500> bit<00:03:26.680> attention<00:03:27.340> needy<00:03:27.579> in

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
we're a little bit attention needy in

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.939 
we're a little bit attention needy in
some<00:03:28.060> regards<00:03:28.510> with<00:03:28.690> our<00:03:28.840> alliances<00:03:29.409> I'm<00:03:29.739> sure

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:29.949 
some regards with our alliances I'm sure

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:31.530 
some regards with our alliances I'm sure
we'll<00:03:30.099> see<00:03:30.129> unprecedented<00:03:30.790> security<00:03:31.150> during

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
we'll see unprecedented security during

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.839 
we'll see unprecedented security during
the<00:03:31.569> visit<00:03:31.810> as<00:03:31.900> well<00:03:31.930> yes<00:03:32.680> yes<00:03:33.099> yes<00:03:33.159> I<00:03:33.669> mean

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
the visit as well yes yes yes I mean

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.460 
the visit as well yes yes yes I mean
this<00:03:34.299> I<00:03:34.510> think<00:03:34.720> people<00:03:34.840> might<00:03:35.049> be<00:03:35.199> a<00:03:35.230> bit<00:03:35.379> more

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
this I think people might be a bit more

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.129 
this I think people might be a bit more
patient<00:03:35.949> about<00:03:36.129> this<00:03:36.190> time<00:03:36.699> you<00:03:37.540> know<00:03:37.690> Bush

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
patient about this time you know Bush

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.869 
patient about this time you know Bush
kind<00:03:38.379> of<00:03:38.470> second<00:03:38.769> time<00:03:38.919> for<00:03:39.159> a<00:03:39.190> pack<00:03:39.519> of<00:03:39.549> course

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
kind of second time for a pack of course

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.580 
kind of second time for a pack of course
in<00:03:40.090> Sydney<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.659> there<00:03:41.169> was<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.290> lot<00:03:41.379> of

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
in Sydney and there was a lot of

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.110 
in Sydney and there was a lot of
security<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:42.430> think<00:03:42.639> there<00:03:42.760> was<00:03:42.849> a<00:03:42.879> lot<00:03:43.090> of

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
security and I think there was a lot of

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.270 
security and I think there was a lot of
controversy<00:03:44.079> around<00:03:44.319> that<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:44.799> it<00:03:45.159> was

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
controversy around that and it was

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.920 
controversy around that and it was
probably<00:03:45.489> because<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.359> nature<00:03:46.569> of<00:03:46.720> who

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
probably because of the nature of who

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.599 
probably because of the nature of who
the<00:03:47.049> president<00:03:47.500> was<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:47.919> think<00:03:48.250> people<00:03:48.400> might

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
the president was I think people might

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.219 
the president was I think people might
be<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:48.790> little<00:03:49.000> more<00:03:49.180> tolerant<00:03:49.659> this<00:03:49.780> time<00:03:50.049> but

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:50.229 
be a little more tolerant this time but

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.930 
be a little more tolerant this time but
I<00:03:50.319> suppose<00:03:50.560> some<00:03:51.159> people<00:03:51.190> caught<00:03:51.609> in<00:03:51.639> rush

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
I suppose some people caught in rush

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.520 
I suppose some people caught in rush
hour<00:03:52.180> won't<00:03:52.449> be<00:03:52.569> very<00:03:52.780> tolerant<00:03:53.229> all<00:03:53.379> right

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
hour won't be very tolerant all right

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.390 
hour won't be very tolerant all right
