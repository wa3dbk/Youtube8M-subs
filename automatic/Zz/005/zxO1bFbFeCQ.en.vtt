00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
ahead of time yeah how it loses its

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.510 
ahead of time yeah how it loses its
consistency<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:49.350> exactly<00:00:50.039> because<00:00:50.399> we

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
consistency and all exactly because we

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.950

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.380 
problems and so it does it does degrade
over<00:00:58.379> time<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.250> exposed<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.760> air<00:00:59.969> so

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
over time as it's exposed to air so
