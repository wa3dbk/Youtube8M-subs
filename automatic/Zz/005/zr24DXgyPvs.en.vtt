00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.100
 mallya 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.019
 no use regret 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:18.240
 let's go 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.820
 the crime 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.820
 in her 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.979
 exercise 5 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:35.610
 the new chapter of the saga returns to concentrate on the figure of chris redfield 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.010
 after dismantling the umbrella corporation 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.840
 responsible for experiences that led to mutations or sales in 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.020
 human and animal 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.660
 the hero strives in the light 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.440
 against the trafficking of these experiments used as biological weapons 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.139
 by terrorists and other criminal groups their most recent mission or 

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:59.829
 to send a fictitious country on the African continent to investigate a new 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.829
 epidemic 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.320
 to georgia 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.320
 should travel all over the eyelid to correct 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.060
 they lost risk premium 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.720
 first she 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.720
 she 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.510
 as part of the antibiotic agency elismo greece artist chris ally 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.430
 a local agent 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.200
 the emergence of 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.500
 and part in a journey that in the end is not limited to studying the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.970
 origins of infection 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.270
 but explores the past of the franchise as well as much-loved characters 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.270
 by the fans 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.220
 the plot is certainly the great trump of DM capable of absorbing not only the fans 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.820
 of the series 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.820
 but also first-time sailors 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.400
 the narrative does not shy away dumps references to previous games 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.620
 I will present flashback to be winners 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.890
 maintaining an important excess of progression of the series 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:28.079
 playing alone the user handles crisis as the computer cent 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:33.399
 the construction of their different postures a more aggressive and another of 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:38.479
 fry the show very useful not only in the fighting but also in the holding 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:43.409
 of scenarios for solving puzzles unfortunately the computer 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.339
 is not very smart and puts at stake as a true creator 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.539
 she does not hesitate to accept bullets paranÃ¡ 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.539
 I registered first aid 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.319
 which may compromise its history and for more critical moments such as 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.179
 contrast fights and fitch 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:05.849
 I made the game be so addictive inside with two friends controlling the 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.159
 protagonists 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:12.029
 date strange a little view of the screen here is the 31 shows two screens one 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:13.760
 little apart from each other 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.369
 similar to the effect r 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.649
 is brash about televisions but does not get used to it 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:21.379
 Indeed 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.799
 everything gets more interesting we act intertwined so the scheme can be 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.799
 repeated america 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:35.070
 Circus music and video presentation also follows the tradition of the series 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.270
 while delivering from her sensational spy a strong cinematographic climate that 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.270
 enjoyed the muscles of the consoles 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:50.810
 there is a wealth of places 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.680
 since the girl was close to closing the school industrial leaders 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.539
 also of enemies that surprise by the vivacity characterization 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:05.069
 there was also quite complex if taking advantage of multiple channels to 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.749
 bombard the player's ears 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:10.190
 with information from all corners 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.470
 causing a great movement only the dubbing left a bit to be desired yet 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.540
 maintaining a certain air of canastrice of the first copies 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:21.840
 still several of them 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.050
 but studies to be enabled as traditionally and mercenaries 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.380
 plus boys transit and the other secrets revealed france 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.180
 in 2009 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.490
 to face everything 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.710
 again without blinking 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.909
 as there are not many moments of real suspense in the plot 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:43.959
 and the concern about storing ammunition was now much reduced now 

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:48.229
 lies in the limitation of the characters without reacting to the constant attacks 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.229
 enemies 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.930
 OK 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.289
 blankfein on all sides is a rather lazy bet of if 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.229
 dismiss but that ended up working 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.180
 the exercise of five is a great chapter in the traditional franchise of having 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.319
 Warm Register exploring the mythology of the series 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.389
 with a neat presentation and good synergy between the protagonists 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.310
 in the rare moments of action there is much the content to be discovered what it will do 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.970
 with which yesterday's main campaign fans repeatedly repeated mainly 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.210
 when multiplayer mode turns out to be so interesting 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.960
 unfortunately the controls are old fashioned kept this yes 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.780
 intentionally to accentuate the attention of the shootings, which should not 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.400
 players who are accustomed to playing more agents, but it is mandatory for 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.060
 fans 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.780
 you should find here 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.689
 an episode that does not leave 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:52.319
 nothing due to previous ones
