looks<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.949> those<00:00:53.129> headphones<00:00:53.460> that

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
looks like one of those headphones that

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.029 
looks like one of those headphones that
are<00:00:54.030> noise<00:00:54.420> cancelling<00:00:55.140> when<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.800> really

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
are noise cancelling when it is really

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.060 
are noise cancelling when it is really
not<00:00:56.370> these<00:00:57.000> are<00:00:57.239> actually<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.780> cheap<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.559> I

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
not these are actually just cheap like I

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.450 
not these are actually just cheap like I
guess<00:01:00.030> foam<00:01:00.480> inserts<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.469> when<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.250> put<00:01:02.399> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
guess foam inserts that when you put it

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.100 
guess foam inserts that when you put it
around<00:01:02.520> your<00:01:02.760> head<00:01:03.000> let<00:01:03.180> me<00:01:03.270> show<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:06.110> yeah

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
around your head let me show you yeah

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.340 
around your head let me show you yeah
there's<00:01:07.439> my<00:01:07.560> beautiful<00:01:08.040> face<00:01:08.540> basically<00:01:09.540> what

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
there's my beautiful face basically what

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.469 
there's my beautiful face basically what
you<00:01:10.470> do<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.619> put<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:10.979> around<00:01:11.040> your<00:01:11.280> head<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.790> it

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
you do is put it around your head and it

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.899 
you do is put it around your head and it
doesn't<00:01:13.470> really<00:01:13.560> block<00:01:13.920> out<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.159> much<00:01:14.580> sound

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
doesn't really block out that much sound

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.640 
doesn't really block out that much sound
but<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.840> does<00:01:16.170> somewhat<00:01:17.810> block<00:01:18.810> out<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.439> sound

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
but it does somewhat block out the sound

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.140 
but it does somewhat block out the sound
there's<00:01:22.650> somewhat<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.310> blocking<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.820> sound

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
there's somewhat of a blocking on sound

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.240 
there's somewhat of a blocking on sound
but<00:01:24.810> basically<00:01:25.259> these<00:01:25.409> are<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:25.979> comfort

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
but basically these are just for comfort

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.490 
but basically these are just for comfort
it's<00:01:26.820> not<00:01:27.030> really<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:28.380> for<00:01:30.290> blocking<00:01:31.290> out<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it's not really for for blocking out the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.880 
it's not really for for blocking out the
noise<00:01:31.939> so<00:01:32.939> let's<00:01:33.210> let's<00:01:33.570> go<00:01:33.840> back<00:01:33.869> stare<00:01:34.799> at

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
noise so let's let's go back stare at

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.149 
noise so let's let's go back stare at
the<00:01:35.040> product<00:01:35.549> itself<00:01:35.909> instead<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.509> my<00:01:36.659> face

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
the product itself instead of my face

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.590 
the product itself instead of my face

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
remember it is not noise cancelling the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.100

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
things you could feel that it is kind of

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.679 
things you could feel that it is kind of
cheap<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.939> plastic<00:02:03.270> right<00:02:03.630> here

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
cheap and so is this plastic right here

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.940 
cheap and so is this plastic right here
but<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.439> well<00:02:04.740> built<00:02:04.950> not<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.579> creaky

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.610 

even<00:02:09.489> though<00:02:09.670> if<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.360> plastic<00:02:10.599> is<00:02:10.989> country

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
even though if the plastic is country

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.300 
even though if the plastic is country
the<00:02:12.220> built<00:02:12.849> quality<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.420> pretty<00:02:13.629> good<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:17.709> 3.5

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
the built quality is pretty good the 3.5

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.080 
the built quality is pretty good the 3.5
millimeter<00:02:18.760> jack

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
millimeter jack

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.339 
millimeter jack
I<00:02:19.269> believe<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:19.959> device<00:02:20.379> came<00:02:20.799> with<00:02:21.069> a<00:02:22.349> 3.5

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
I believe this device came with a 3.5

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.900 
I believe this device came with a 3.5
millimeter<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:24.129> 1/4<00:02:24.760> Jack<00:02:26.519> adapter<00:02:27.519> but<00:02:27.849> I

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
millimeter to 1/4 Jack adapter but I

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.599 

wire<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:22.810> just<00:03:23.139> left<00:03:23.440> on<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:24.010> ground<00:03:24.280> if<00:03:24.579> you

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
wire I just left on the ground if you

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.170 
wire I just left on the ground if you
can<00:03:24.819> see<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:25.739> there's<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.980> wire<00:03:27.160> all<00:03:27.579> the<00:03:27.639> way

can see it there's the wire all the way

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.250 
can see it there's the wire all the way
around<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:30.010> here<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.579> believe<00:03:31.569> it<00:03:31.780> is<00:03:31.930> ten<00:03:32.230> feet

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
around to here I believe it is ten feet

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.020 
around to here I believe it is ten feet
long<00:03:32.709> maybe<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.370> think<00:03:34.440> more<00:03:35.440> than<00:03:35.590> ten<00:03:35.799> feet

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
long maybe I think more than ten feet

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.640 
long maybe I think more than ten feet
but<00:03:37.030> they<00:03:37.150> are<00:03:37.299> stereo<00:03:37.750> headphone<00:03:38.230> so<00:03:38.440> what<00:03:38.590> do

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
but they are stereo headphone so what do

but they are stereo headphone so what do
you<00:03:38.709> expect<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:39.750> basically<00:03:40.750> this<00:03:41.079> is<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.260> good

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
you expect the basically this is a good

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.680 
you expect the basically this is a good
product<00:03:41.709> for<00:03:42.099> those<00:03:42.190> guys<00:03:42.459> who<00:03:42.519> don't<00:03:42.849> very
