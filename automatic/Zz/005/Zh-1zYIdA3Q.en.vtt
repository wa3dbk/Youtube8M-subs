feet which I showed you previously just
as<00:00:13.530> we're<00:00:13.679> doing<00:00:13.769> now<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.309> then<00:00:15.089> taking<00:00:15.420> this

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
as we're doing now and then taking this

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.230 
as we're doing now and then taking this
to<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.929> saddle<00:00:16.440> for<00:00:16.619> use<00:00:17.550> when<00:00:17.910> we're<00:00:18.090> trying

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
to the saddle for use when we're trying

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.000 
to the saddle for use when we're trying
to<00:00:18.420> learn<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.810> piaff<00:00:19.170> just<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.680> make<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
to learn the piaff just to make this a

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.220 
to learn the piaff just to make this a
useful<00:00:20.550> tool<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:21.779> I've<00:00:21.900> taught<00:00:22.109> him

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
useful tool that I've taught him

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.200 
useful tool that I've taught him
something<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> ground<00:00:23.160> that's<00:00:23.850> then

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
something on the ground that's then

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.050 
something on the ground that's then
going<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.510> translate<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.880> something<00:00:26.880> that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
going to translate to something that

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.080 
going to translate to something that
means<00:00:27.449> something<00:00:28.140> from<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> saddle<00:00:29.000> one<00:00:30.000> of

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
means something from the saddle one of

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.790 
means something from the saddle one of
the<00:00:30.179> big<00:00:30.330> things<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.289> do<00:00:31.470> with<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
the big things I like to do with the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.069 
the big things I like to do with the
horse<00:00:31.980> training<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.579> as<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.940> learn<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.450> when<00:00:34.050> I

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
horse training is as I learn it when I

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.660 
horse training is as I learn it when I
can<00:00:34.290> break<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.649> down<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:35.010> something<00:00:35.219> simple

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
can break it down to something simple

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.850 
can break it down to something simple
that<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.630> do<00:00:36.899> together<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.530> ground

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
that we can do together on the ground

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.850 
that we can do together on the ground
and<00:00:38.250> then<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.579> get<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.879> saddle<00:00:39.200> it<00:00:40.200> helps

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and then I get in the saddle it helps

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.290 
and then I get in the saddle it helps
because<00:00:41.040> then<00:00:41.309> there's<00:00:41.460> not<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.730> confusion

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
because then there's not the confusion

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.030 
because then there's not the confusion
of<00:00:42.420> did<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.660> shift<00:00:42.960> my<00:00:43.050> weight<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.590> wrong<00:00:43.770> way

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
of did I shift my weight the wrong way

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.979 
of did I shift my weight the wrong way
or<00:00:44.340> did<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:44.579> something<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.090> confused<00:00:45.719> him

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
or did I do something that confused him

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.610 
or did I do something that confused him
and<00:00:46.399> this<00:00:47.399> helps<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:47.940> make<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.329> simple<00:00:48.620> it

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
and this helps just make it simple it

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.020 
and this helps just make it simple it
makes<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.950> simple<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.250> him<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.879> also

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
makes it simple for him but it also

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.810 
makes it simple for him but it also
makes<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.570> much<00:00:51.780> more<00:00:52.020> simple<00:00:52.320> for<00:00:52.559> me<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.699> you

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
makes it much more simple for me so you

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.270 
makes it much more simple for me so you
can<00:00:53.940> see<00:00:54.149> here<00:00:54.390> also<00:00:54.600> dancers<00:00:55.289> stepping

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
can see here also dancers stepping

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.040 
can see here also dancers stepping
nicely<00:00:56.640> up<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.969> mounting<00:00:57.360> block<00:00:57.510> which<00:00:57.899> I

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
nicely up to the mounting block which I

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.720 
nicely up to the mounting block which I
have<00:00:58.260> shown<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.559> how<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.949> teach<00:00:59.250> them<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.670> a

submission issue I found that really

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.149 
submission issue I found that really
helps<00:01:25.740> out<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.450> sets<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.600> right<00:01:27.780> tone<00:01:28.159> for

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
helps out and sets the right tone for

helps out and sets the right tone for
the<00:01:29.280> entire<00:01:29.310> ride<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:31.619> we're<00:01:31.799> doing<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.100> same

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the entire ride so we're doing the same

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.300 
the entire ride so we're doing the same
thing<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.790> other<00:01:32.820> side<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.590> then<00:01:34.590> this

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
thing on the other side and then this

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.880

but<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:45.990> makes<00:01:46.320> sure<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.530> he's<00:01:46.860> flexing

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
but it just makes sure that he's flexing

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.380 
but it just makes sure that he's flexing
at<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.759> pole<00:01:48.049> jaw<00:01:49.049> line<00:01:49.759> back<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.000> forth<00:01:51.240> and

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
at the pole jaw line back and forth and

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.600 
at the pole jaw line back and forth and
a<00:01:51.450> nice<00:01:51.630> soft<00:01:51.930> way<00:01:52.229> before<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.649> move<00:01:52.920> off<00:01:53.100> just

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
a nice soft way before I move off just

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.859 
a nice soft way before I move off just
kind<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.880> make<00:01:54.000> sure<00:01:54.030> some<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.540> control

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
kind of make sure some of the control

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.959 
kind of make sure some of the control
buttons<00:01:55.200> are<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.439> place<00:01:55.710> before<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:56.579> even<00:01:56.729> go

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
buttons are in place before we even go

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.789 
buttons are in place before we even go
so<00:01:57.659> now<00:01:57.780> I'm<00:01:57.869> going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.020> reach<00:01:58.229> down<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.649> is

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
so now I'm going to reach down this is

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.230 
so now I'm going to reach down this is
the<00:01:58.860> first<00:01:59.070> time<00:01:59.250> I've<00:01:59.399> tried<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.000> I'm

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
the first time I've tried it and I'm

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.760 
the first time I've tried it and I'm
asking<00:02:00.570> him<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.750> pick<00:02:00.960> up<00:02:01.140> each<00:02:01.350> one<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.710> his

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
asking him to pick up each one of his

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.240 
asking him to pick up each one of his
legs<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:03.619> interested<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.860> see<00:02:05.040> if<00:02:05.100> he's

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
legs I was interested to see if he's

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.130 
legs I was interested to see if he's
going<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.460> pick<00:02:05.610> up<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.850> front<00:02:06.060> legs<00:02:06.329> but<00:02:07.020> you

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
going to pick up the front legs but you

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.290 
going to pick up the front legs but you
can<00:02:07.290> see<00:02:07.469> he<00:02:07.649> picked<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:08.039> all<00:02:08.280> four<00:02:08.580> legs<00:02:08.819> so

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
can see he picked up all four legs so

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.559 
can see he picked up all four legs so
I'm<00:02:09.569> counting<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.110> as<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> huge<00:02:10.679> success<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
I'm counting this as a huge success and

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.460 
I'm counting this as a huge success and
we'll<00:02:12.569> be<00:02:12.720> moving<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:13.110> to

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
we'll be moving on to

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.080 
we'll be moving on to
next<00:02:13.680> steps<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.130> I'll<00:02:14.220> share<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:14.550> with<00:02:14.760> you
