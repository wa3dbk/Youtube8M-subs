00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.090
 sometimes personal good of the speaker is the john and 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.590
 be welcome is more a video is in the 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.970
 jacques band channel 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.310
 today we bring you a 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.039
 foundation of the series b of the mass color 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.029
 amb 700 second version targeted 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.730
 mainly for systems 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.250
 basic and average computational 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.500
 now well this represents more 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.960
 the series with 60 years of 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.180
 total sesi and dates of the source of 700 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.309
 released earlier but with a vision 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.980
 to comply with all new regulations 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.750
 to join the fathers approved on the 1st of 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.760
 July last year 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.340
 from all the attractions of greater 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.030
 difference with the previous version is use 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.670
 15 Rafael claim 54 with a standing 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.010
 is instead of the israel museum 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.990
 is this lack presents even more 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.590
 some important criticisms and that 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.299
 be cold as is the case with certification 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.040
 80plus when you want to explain more 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.009
 in the textile segment 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.869
 saucer still the smart control the voice 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.960
 of the fan to ensure greater 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.000
 longevity and a reduction of the club is 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.689
 presents yours totally black and without 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.979
 major issues ahead of being mentioned 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.009
 connections are available from a 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.990
 20 + 4 20 obligation for grandmother one 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:38.390
 from the four plus four pits to the cpu 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:42.380
 14 pci express of 424 2010 and boring three 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.899
 and a phobic among these 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.270
 Power is only the edge of the cpu 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.250
 presented the cars are taken looks 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.740
 really deals with a point against this 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.159
 source and will give you a cleaner look. 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.439
 Anyone saw it before we went any further. 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.780
 it is important to refer to the final because 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.549
 so important in a way because 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.979
 reinforcing a source is to transform 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.750
 alternating current through the network to 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.610
 direct current in a centralized way 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.220
 by the decision of the respective components 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.200
 of the computer as a form never 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.390
 can transform all the energy 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.010
 that pulls the net because there is always 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.439
 several stones dantas 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.019
 so early on that the importance of 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.549
 efficiency pass a photo with more 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.769
 disabilities need less energy 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.659
 to deliver a certain power 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.810
 than a shape like this is lower 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.970
 which will cause not only the lowest 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.860
 energy at the end of the month as 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.680
 more moderate use of sustainable 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.569
 energy of all the importance of 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.220
 distinguish the forms that the project 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.409
 really good performances from those 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.120
 600 lots for example more 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:47.329
 which you can not really avoid 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.879
 more than 300 to 350 deaths due to 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.049
 their low efficiency 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.900
 there is this way to help 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.420
 buyers the 80plus certification that 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.670
 aims to certify products presenting 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.900
 this project tries three percent 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.190
 different dates of 150% and is always 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.290
 winning always presents the 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.090
 80plus certification that represents the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.220
 first level of the set five levels 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.129
 and presented in this 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.650
 also by el we then verify that 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.870
 this source has at least 80% 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.519
 disability regardless of UOL 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.410
 which represented quite a result 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.260
 satisfactory and a point in favor of this 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.790
 product to complete 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.769
 we are also on the list for 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.180
 answer an issue that may already 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.400
 It has occurred to many of 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.519
 our children how to know the source 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.230
 ideal for a particular configuration 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.669
 to expose a source but not enough to 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.840
 arrive to power the computer in 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:41.150
 London but I'm going back 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.560
 however a source at 0 with the attempt ends 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.629
 also because it costs much more 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.459
 and in which our 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.980
 all its potentialities 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.449
 to help with this decision you have 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.730
 available on your website a 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:54.650
 Calculator with the insertion 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.049
 components of our computer will give us 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.319
 the recommended minimum value of happening 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.449
 the source we should have wanted to see 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.629
 presentation is quite extensive 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:07.519
 several components are me that in general do not 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.250
 is more specific and directed towards 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.500
 each setting is important only 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.780
 refer to the project presented value 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.459
 minimum recommended value is the 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.320
 importance of having some tc this 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.750
 both avoid problems 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.610
 future with the change of the continent 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.099
 how to overclock 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.630
 some components and that having the 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:29.150
 protect children 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.650
 is that it is not taken into account by the 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.350
 calculator 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.690
 yet this is a tool that 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.060
 showed very capable enough accurate and 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.880
 how much simplified being san 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.010
 antonio coca cola but without haste 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.260
 tool will be left in the description is 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.790
 as well as in what more detail about the 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.370
 efficiency of the source and the different 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.250
 80plus certification levels spoken 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.740
 previously for the completion of this 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.310
 son to be able to say in relation to this 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.310
 60 b 4 motion as it goes this is a photo 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.990
 which unfortunately did not get frustrated 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.310
 differentiate in a specific area and 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.170
 we think that the most serious point of your 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.840
 implementation is lack of cars taken 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.730
 for all connections because this is a 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.870
 characteristics will most influence 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.790
 any buyer 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.440
 we decree head will sit back 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.180
 some competing models that 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.610
 not only has this characteristic 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.920
 as a reduced price 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.440
 even if you visit the fair to 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.540
 this source has a performance 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.400
 more than satisfactory for large 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.150
 part of the basic and average settings 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.130
 is at its current market price 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.260
 benson and so we conclude more 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.490
 banal our channel do not forget to 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.660
 do click on the shared video 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.460
 please 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.190
 we also thank all the suggestions and 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.960
 opinions and politicians want to let 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.960
 in the comments either through the page 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.340
 from facebook we will leave the description 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.340
 for everyone and until the next
