sure<00:04:21.239> this<00:04:21.450> is<00:04:21.600> one<00:04:21.780> of<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.989> new<00:04:22.290> vestroia

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
sure this is one of the new vestroia

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.909 
sure this is one of the new vestroia
ones<00:04:23.450> who<00:04:24.450> ever<00:04:24.630> seen<00:04:25.080> that<00:04:25.350> in<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.590> show

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
ones who ever seen that in the show

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.640 
ones who ever seen that in the show
that's<00:04:26.910> what<00:04:27.120> it<00:04:27.510> looks<00:04:27.720> like<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.169> I<00:04:28.320> think

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
that's what it looks like and I think

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.150 
that's what it looks like and I think
it's<00:04:28.800> when<00:04:29.150> Drago<00:04:30.150> has<00:04:30.540> both<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.680> Infinity

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
it's when Drago has both the Infinity

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.710 
it's when Drago has both the Infinity
core<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.730> silent<00:04:32.910> core<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:33.390> that's<00:04:33.510> what

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
core and the silent core and that's what

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.270 
core and the silent core and that's what
he<00:04:33.780> looks<00:04:33.960> like<00:04:34.050> neo<00:04:34.440> Dragonoid<00:04:35.060> in<00:04:36.060> ball<00:04:36.300> form

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.400 

conjectures<00:04:41.280> you<00:04:41.610> what<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.150> bakugan<00:04:42.630> is<00:04:42.870> the

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410
