 Circus Naturally, it goes to primary school students in 5th-10th. grade - 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.720
 - to give them an insight into science. 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.400
 The purpose is to reach out to the young, create interest in science - 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.360
 - and get them to think about what's going on in everyday life. 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.720
 We come with energy, fun trials and hands-on things they can play with. 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.760
 We are between 20 and 30, so we can better relate to the young. 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.960
 The little ones always think it's exciting. The larger ones are skeptical at first - 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.760
 - But when we leave, they always think it's been great. 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.040
 It's always fun for kids to get their hands on something. That's why they crawl around. 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.440
 That's what we can offer. 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.120
 We say, "Here is a chemistry experiment, a physics experiment. Play with it!" 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.520
 After a visit, there are often people who say, "I want to be the same as you." 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.080
 If we've got one or two to choose something like that, it's really cool. 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.320
 The most important thing is that they have experienced that science can be fun. 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.440
 It can also be cool. It's not just for nerdy people with big glasses.
