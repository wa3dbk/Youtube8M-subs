driver's seat dude to do it's actually

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.680 
driver's seat dude to do it's actually
quite<00:05:07.280> a<00:05:07.370> bit<00:05:07.550> closer<00:05:07.790> than<00:05:08.030> that<00:05:08.060> this<00:05:08.540> is

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
quite a bit closer than that this is

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.760 
quite a bit closer than that this is
actually<00:05:08.990> what<00:05:09.110> it<00:05:09.169> looks<00:05:09.290> like<00:05:09.410> from<00:05:09.560> my

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
actually what it looks like from my

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.960 
actually what it looks like from my
standpoint<00:05:10.190> like<00:05:10.880> that<00:05:11.410> so<00:05:12.460> of<00:05:13.460> course<00:05:13.669> this

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
standpoint like that so of course this

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.700 
standpoint like that so of course this
isn't<00:05:14.180> very<00:05:14.450> safe<00:05:14.690> to<00:05:14.960> play<00:05:15.110> video<00:05:15.350> games
