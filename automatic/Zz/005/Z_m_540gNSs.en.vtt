but I still didn't have like that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.189 
but I still didn't have like that
confidence<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.010> needed<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.850> um<00:00:51.480> actually

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
confidence that I needed to um actually

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.860 
confidence that I needed to um actually
go<00:00:52.590> through<00:00:52.620> with<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.879> got<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> relaxer<00:00:54.750> in

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.209 
September and then like maybe a week or
two<00:00:57.510> after<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.989> was<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.379> yeah<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:58.949> not<00:00:59.100> going

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
two after I was like yeah I'm not going

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.370 
two after I was like yeah I'm not going
to<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.370> again

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
to do that again

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:19.090 
to do that again
natural<00:01:02.370> let's<00:01:03.030> see<00:01:06.950> right<00:01:07.950> there

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.460 

I'm<00:01:19.640> done<00:01:19.909> quite<00:01:20.270> a<00:01:20.299> few<00:01:20.390> lengths<00:01:20.810> checks<00:01:21.170> in

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
I'm done quite a few lengths checks in

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.200 
I'm done quite a few lengths checks in
the<00:01:21.830> past<00:01:22.040> with<00:01:22.369> measuring<00:01:22.759> tape<00:01:22.970> and<00:01:23.090> all

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
the past with measuring tape and all

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.149 
the past with measuring tape and all
that<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:23.689> I<00:01:23.960> think<00:01:24.320> I<00:01:24.530> didn't<00:01:24.799> want<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:25.009> few

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
that so I think I didn't want a few

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.710 
that so I think I didn't want a few
months<00:01:25.280> ago<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:25.850> if<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:26.180> want<00:01:26.420> to<00:01:26.479> know<00:01:26.509> how

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
months ago so if you want to know how

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.120 
months ago so if you want to know how
long<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:27.140> is<00:01:27.200> an<00:01:27.380> interest<00:01:27.680> go<00:01:27.860> ahead<00:01:28.009> and

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
long it is an interest go ahead and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.830 
long it is an interest go ahead and
check<00:01:28.280> that<00:01:28.310> video<00:01:28.610> out<00:01:28.759> if<00:01:29.060> I<00:01:29.240> could<00:01:29.420> get<00:01:29.630> back

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
check that video out if I could get back

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.530 
check that video out if I could get back
to<00:01:30.200> bra<00:01:30.650> strap<00:01:30.979> length<00:01:31.220> or<00:01:31.580> mid-back<00:01:31.820> length

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
to bra strap length or mid-back length

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.289 
to bra strap length or mid-back length
or<00:01:32.869> whatever<00:01:33.140> I'd<00:01:33.500> be<00:01:33.770> very<00:01:34.520> happy<00:01:34.700> with<00:01:35.090> that

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
but when i get to that length i'm not

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.249 
but when i get to that length i'm not
