 Hi, Today I am making any truffle-baked 3-ingredient, Brazilian Brigadeiro. 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.660
 First, sift 3 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder. 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.440
 Then add 12 ounces of condensed condensed milk in a thick sauce down the pan. 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.660
 Add in the emaciated cocoa powder. 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.660
 And more than medium heat stir with a wooden stick until mixed. 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.740
 Now add in 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.740
 And stir constantly until the butter melts. 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.030
 When boiling, stir thoroughly until the mixture thickens like this. 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.110
 Now transfer to a heat-resistant container and allow to cool. This is a brigadeiro. 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.650
 To make truffles, rub the butter on your palms. 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.640
 And make truffles with a teaspoon of brigadeiro. 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.930
 The butter will prevent brigadeiro from sticking to your palms. 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.090
 Then roll in uncooked cocoa powder. 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.090
 This is a 3-element truffle brigadeiro. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 You can decorate truffles with green tea powder, 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Grated coconut, 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Chopped walnuts, 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Chopped pistachios, 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.900
 Chocolate strawberries, etc. 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.750
 Voila! 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.080
 Truffles Brigadeiro. 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.740
 It is very easy to make, you can make it with children. 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.740
 This is a great recipe for parties and holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.140
 Bon appetite. 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.140
 My favorite is pistachios. Brigadeiro is as creamy as chocolate ganache. 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.880
 Alex can not eat this because cocoa is dangerous to dogs. 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.980
 Thank you, isabella0985, for your suggestion. 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.780
 There will be more festive recipes this month. 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.780
 See you soon, goodbye!
