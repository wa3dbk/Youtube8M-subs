the reason these poses are so popular is

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:12.270 
the reason these poses are so popular is
because<00:01:02.170> they<00:01:02.950> bloom<00:01:03.220> from<00:01:11.160> there<00:01:12.160> are

because they bloom from there are
different<00:01:12.610> kinds<00:01:13.210> but<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.900> two<00:01:14.080> most<00:01:14.290> popular

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
bad knockout rose another reason and you
