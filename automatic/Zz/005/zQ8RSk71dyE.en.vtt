when you want to do a bonded
installation<00:00:44.690> we<00:00:45.469> recommend<00:00:46.010> liquid<00:00:46.640> gold

for<00:00:47.239> a<00:00:47.269> couple<00:00:47.570> reasons<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:48.230> first<00:00:48.649> is<00:00:48.949> your

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
for a couple reasons the first is your

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.229 
for a couple reasons the first is your
installation<00:00:50.890> length<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:52.070> time<00:00:52.280> so<00:00:52.910> you<00:00:53.030> can

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
installation length of time so you can

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.560 
installation length of time so you can
do<00:00:53.660> a<00:00:53.899> bonded<00:00:54.350> extension<00:00:54.920> method<00:00:55.850> with<00:00:56.179> latex

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
do a bonded extension method with latex

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.599 
do a bonded extension method with latex
bond<00:00:56.870> that<00:00:57.140> will<00:00:57.260> last<00:00:57.469> you<00:00:57.739> about<00:00:57.920> one<00:00:58.429> to<00:00:58.579> two

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
bond that will last you about one to two

weeks<00:00:59.230> with<00:01:00.230> latex<00:01:00.739> it<00:01:01.429> doesn't<00:01:01.879> really<00:01:02.149> get

weeks with latex it doesn't really get

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.020 
weeks with latex it doesn't really get
you<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.629> longevity<00:01:03.010> whereas<00:01:04.010> liquid<00:01:04.430> gold<00:01:04.699> is

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
you the longevity whereas liquid gold is

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.780 
you the longevity whereas liquid gold is
going<00:01:05.330> to<00:01:05.420> last<00:01:05.630> between<00:01:05.960> four<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:06.530> five<00:01:06.920> so

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
going to last between four to five so

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.950 
going to last between four to five so
you<00:01:07.850> have<00:01:08.090> that<00:01:08.330> that<00:01:08.600> length<00:01:08.780> of<00:01:08.900> time

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
you have that that length of time

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.040 
you have that that length of time
difference<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:09.770> second<00:01:10.340> is<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:11.360> ease<00:01:11.600> with

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
difference the second is the ease with

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.530 
difference the second is the ease with
which<00:01:12.230> it<00:01:12.560> comes<00:01:12.800> out<00:01:12.979> of<00:01:13.399> the<00:01:13.520> hair<00:01:13.759> latex

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540

which it comes out of the hair latex
bond<00:01:14.750> is<00:01:14.990> incredibly<00:01:15.920> difficult<00:01:16.250> to<00:01:16.880> get<00:01:17.299> off

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
bond is incredibly difficult to get off

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.370 
bond is incredibly difficult to get off
of<00:01:18.049> the<00:01:18.200> hair<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:19.479> agents<00:01:20.479> that<00:01:20.509> they<00:01:20.720> have<00:01:20.990> to

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
of the hair the agents that they have to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.859 
of the hair the agents that they have to
break<00:01:21.680> it<00:01:21.829> down<00:01:22.040> typically<00:01:22.909> common<00:01:23.509> more<00:01:23.689> of<00:01:23.780> a

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
break it down typically common more of a

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.649 
break it down typically common more of a
lotion<00:01:24.110> form<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:24.890> it<00:01:25.579> actually<00:01:25.820> makes<00:01:26.299> the

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
lotion form and it actually makes the

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.770 
lotion form and it actually makes the
latex<00:01:27.380> crumbly<00:01:28.280> but<00:01:28.460> also<00:01:28.610> very<00:01:28.939> sticky<00:01:29.420> and

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
latex crumbly but also very sticky and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.170 
latex crumbly but also very sticky and
then<00:01:30.259> the<00:01:30.380> idea<00:01:30.710> is<00:01:30.799> that<00:01:31.009> you<00:01:31.159> will<00:01:31.610> comb<00:01:31.969> that

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
then the idea is that you will comb that

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.899 
then the idea is that you will comb that
out<00:01:32.390> of<00:01:32.540> your<00:01:32.689> hair<00:01:32.930> if<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.950> do<00:01:34.189> find<00:01:34.460> that<00:01:34.640> you

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
out of your hair if you do find that you

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.539 
out of your hair if you do find that you
have<00:01:35.149> used<00:01:35.479> latex<00:01:36.229> bond<00:01:36.560> in<00:01:36.860> your<00:01:37.130> hair<00:01:37.340> and

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
have used latex bond in your hair and

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.399 
have used latex bond in your hair and
you're<00:01:37.759> stuck<00:01:38.180> at<00:01:38.479> that<00:01:38.869> point<00:01:39.170> in<00:01:39.320> the

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
you're stuck at that point in the

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.370 
you're stuck at that point in the
process<00:01:39.619> you<00:01:40.490> can<00:01:40.850> always<00:01:41.360> use<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:42.049> liquid

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
process you can always use the liquid

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.920 
process you can always use the liquid
gold<00:01:42.740> remover<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.610> what<00:01:43.939> that<00:01:44.149> does<00:01:44.420> is<00:01:44.600> it

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
gold remover and what that does is it

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.920 
gold remover and what that does is it
actually<00:01:44.960> goes<00:01:45.439> in<00:01:45.680> and<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.189> dissolves<00:01:46.969> the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
actually goes in and it dissolves the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.139 
actually goes in and it dissolves the
latex<00:01:48.680> bonding<00:01:49.189> product<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:49.939> actually

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
latex bonding product so you actually

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.990 
latex bonding product so you actually
can<00:01:50.539> get<00:01:50.659> it<00:01:50.750> out<00:01:50.899> of<00:01:50.960> their<00:01:51.259> hair<00:01:51.409> easier<00:01:52.000> the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
can get it out of their hair easier the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.630 
can get it out of their hair easier the
liquid<00:01:53.390> gold<00:01:53.619> dissolver<00:01:54.619> dissolves<00:01:55.340> liquid

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
liquid gold dissolver dissolves liquid

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.179 
liquid gold dissolver dissolves liquid
gold<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.149> latex<00:01:57.109> bond<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:57.649> it's<00:01:57.770> much<00:01:57.979> easier

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
gold and latex bond and it's much easier

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.319 
gold and latex bond and it's much easier
to<00:01:58.909> get<00:01:59.359> out<00:01:59.539> of<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.780> hair<00:01:59.990> so<00:02:00.680> while<00:02:01.490> latex<00:02:02.030> is
