00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
opinion and I think jagex did a great

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.610 
opinion and I think jagex did a great
job<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.600> quest<00:00:39.809> itself<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.440> was

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
job with that so the quest itself it was

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.779 
job with that so the quest itself it was
pretty<00:00:40.950> fun<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:43.789> cauldron

minigame<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.570> not<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.200> awesome<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.010> be

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
minigame is not that awesome to be

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.950 
minigame is not that awesome to be
honest<00:00:47.370> compared<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.850> falcon<00:00:48.030> which<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.629> 10

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
honest compared to falcon which is 10

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.869 
honest compared to falcon which is 10
times<00:00:49.170> better<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.129> takes<00:00:50.340> also<00:00:50.520> longer

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
times better like it takes also longer

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.139 
times better like it takes also longer
and<00:00:51.559> there's<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.010> final<00:00:53.430> boss<00:00:53.610> which<00:00:54.000> is

defensive wise it's different cause

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.550 
defensive wise it's different cause
let's<00:01:47.909> say<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.149> fought<00:01:48.420> over<00:01:48.990> I'll<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.380> weak

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
let's say I fought over I'll be weak

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.359 
let's say I fought over I'll be weak
against<00:01:49.979> magic

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
against magic

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.429 
against magic
while<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.060> upsetting<00:01:51.450> armor<00:01:51.780> doesn't<00:01:52.200> really

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
while the upsetting armor doesn't really

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.800 
while the upsetting armor doesn't really
have<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.829> defensive<00:01:53.520> weakness<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.479> let's<00:01:54.689> say

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
have a defensive weakness so let's say

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.200 
have a defensive weakness so let's say
I've<00:01:55.049> got<00:01:55.110> full<00:01:55.590> upsetting<00:01:56.310> armor<00:01:56.700> mage

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
I've got full upsetting armor mage

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.850 
I've got full upsetting armor mage
on<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.780> only<00:01:57.960> changed<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.439> helm<00:01:58.680> by<00:01:58.799> the

change the helm to get the 10% courtesy
so<00:02:03.329> if<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.659> ready<00:02:04.020> arrange<00:02:04.350> help<00:02:04.590> I'll<00:02:04.799> be

having 10% more courtesy in using range

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.160 
having 10% more courtesy in using range
or<00:02:08.640> defensive<00:02:09.119> wise<00:02:09.300> they<00:02:09.599> don't<00:02:09.780> matter<00:02:09.959> what

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
or defensive wise they don't matter what

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.010 
or defensive wise they don't matter what
you<00:02:10.289> wear<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:11.039> has<00:02:11.310> all<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.790> same<00:02:12.000> defense<00:02:12.510> we

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
you wear it has all the same defense we

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.090 
you wear it has all the same defense we
just<00:02:13.200> kind<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.470> read<00:02:13.680> what

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
just kind of read what

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.280 
just kind of read what
does<00:02:14.250> make<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.700> Amin<00:02:15.000> pretty<00:02:15.210> good<00:02:15.480> but<00:02:16.020> he<00:02:16.230> is

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
does make the Amin pretty good but he is

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.830 
does make the Amin pretty good but he is
a<00:02:16.380> down<00:02:16.590> point<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.460> armor<00:02:17.730> does<00:02:17.940> degrade<00:02:18.180> like

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
a down point the armor does degrade like

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.130 
a down point the armor does degrade like
it<00:02:19.020> has<00:02:19.170> 3k<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.100> can<00:02:20.280> get<00:02:21.120> 3k<00:02:21.630> hits<00:02:21.810> on<00:02:21.990> it

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
it has 3k you can get 3k hits on it

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.320 
it has 3k you can get 3k hits on it
every<00:02:22.740> monster<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.070> does<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> hit<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.910> gets

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
every monster that does a hit it gets

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.290 
every monster that does a hit it gets
like<00:02:24.600> decreased<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.280> can<00:02:26.490> receive<00:02:26.700> 3k

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
like decreased so you can receive 3k

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.360 
like decreased so you can receive 3k
total<00:02:27.780> hits<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.170> then<00:02:28.290> normal<00:02:28.680> go<00:02:28.800> like<00:02:29.070> break

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
total hits and then normal go like break

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.940 
total hits and then normal go like break
I<00:02:29.400> think<00:02:29.790> also<00:02:30.570> using<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.290> obsidian<00:02:31.800> armor

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
I think also using the obsidian armor

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.390 
I think also using the obsidian armor
outside<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.380> desert<00:02:34.380> area<00:02:34.740> like<00:02:34.950> outside

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
outside of the desert area like outside

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.820 
outside of the desert area like outside
e5<00:02:35.760> kion<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.090> in<00:02:36.240> five<00:02:36.390> games<00:02:36.600> you'll<00:02:37.410> receive

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
e5 kion and in five games you'll receive

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.000 
e5 kion and in five games you'll receive
triple<00:02:38.430> damage<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.810> let's<00:02:40.230> say<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.710> am

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
triple damage on you so let's say I am

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.250 
triple damage on you so let's say I am
fighting<00:02:41.280> somebody<00:02:41.670> in<00:02:42.150> PvP<00:02:42.630> or<00:02:42.660> PvE<00:02:42.900> M

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
fighting somebody in PvP or PvE M

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.090 
fighting somebody in PvP or PvE M
doesn't<00:02:43.590> even<00:02:43.710> matter

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
doesn't even matter

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.920 
doesn't even matter
so<00:02:44.700> let's<00:02:44.970> say<00:02:45.060> I'm<00:02:45.270> fighting<00:02:45.600> somebody<00:02:45.750> in

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
so let's say I'm fighting somebody in

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.680 
so let's say I'm fighting somebody in
PvP<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.590> he's<00:02:46.920> wearing<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.310> armor<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.820> I

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
PvP and he's wearing the armor and I

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.080 
PvP and he's wearing the armor and I
would<00:02:48.840> normally<00:02:49.020> do<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.530> 3000<00:02:50.400> hit<00:02:50.550> on<00:02:50.730> him<00:02:50.940> it

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
would normally do a 3000 hit on him it

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.810 
would normally do a 3000 hit on him it
will<00:02:51.420> be<00:02:51.570> tripled<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.290> will<00:02:52.560> be<00:02:52.650> in<00:02:52.830> 9k<00:02:53.520> hit

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
will be tripled so it will be in 9k hit

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.210 
will be tripled so it will be in 9k hit
on<00:02:54.000> him<00:02:54.210> which<00:02:54.780> can<00:02:55.260> pretty<00:02:55.500> much<00:02:55.590> kill<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.040> in

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
on him which can pretty much kill you in

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.960 
on him which can pretty much kill you in
one<00:02:56.250> hit

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
one hit

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.930 
one hit
so<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.600> armor<00:02:57.960> isn't<00:02:58.290> good<00:02:58.620> it's<00:02:58.890> outside<00:02:59.760> the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
so the armor isn't good it's outside the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.410 
so the armor isn't good it's outside the
desert<00:03:00.270> area<00:03:00.660> at<00:03:00.870> all<00:03:00.900> like<00:03:01.800> if<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.190> went<00:03:02.760> okay

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
desert area at all like if I went okay

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.270 
desert area at all like if I went okay
you'll<00:03:03.570> see<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.780> clip<00:03:04.080> of<00:03:04.230> co-op<00:03:04.470> later<00:03:04.740> on<00:03:05.010> or

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
you'll see a clip of co-op later on or

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.120 
you'll see a clip of co-op later on or
now<00:03:05.700> then<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.180> went<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.170> co-op<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.710> got<00:03:07.950> like

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
now then I went to co-op and I got like

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.550 
now then I went to co-op and I got like
a<00:03:08.190> 4<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:08.790> 6k<00:03:09.150> hit<00:03:09.330> on<00:03:09.510> me<00:03:09.660> which<00:03:09.870> pretty<00:03:10.350> much

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
a 4 and 6k hit on me which pretty much

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.130 
a 4 and 6k hit on me which pretty much
almost<00:03:10.920> won<00:03:11.250> it's<00:03:11.430> me<00:03:11.610> or<00:03:11.820> hope<00:03:12.030> it's<00:03:12.270> me<00:03:12.480> it

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
almost won it's me or hope it's me it

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.680 
almost won it's me or hope it's me it
makes<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:13.950> almond<00:03:14.310> really<00:03:14.730> not<00:03:14.970> useful<00:03:15.180> it's

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
makes the almond really not useful it's

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.860 
makes the almond really not useful it's
outside<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.650> desert<00:03:17.250> area<00:03:17.550> at<00:03:17.670> all<00:03:17.700> so<00:03:18.570> it's

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
outside the desert area at all so it's

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.290 
outside the desert area at all so it's
still<00:03:19.110> kind<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.470> good<00:03:19.650> against<00:03:20.520> desert

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
still kind of good against desert

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.930 
still kind of good against desert
creatures<00:03:21.780> like<00:03:22.440> fight<00:03:22.740> kill<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.220> makes<00:03:23.580> it<00:03:23.790> a

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
creatures like fight kill it makes it a

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.670 
creatures like fight kill it makes it a
bit<00:03:24.090> more<00:03:24.270> easy<00:03:24.570> since<00:03:24.870> it's<00:03:25.020> hybrid<00:03:25.200> arm<00:03:25.530> as

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
bit more easy since it's hybrid arm as

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.150 
bit more easy since it's hybrid arm as
well<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:27.030> also<00:03:27.240> have<00:03:27.600> like<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:28.020> 5%<00:03:28.890> damage

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
well and you also have like a 5% damage
