00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.319
 especially extraordinary new 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.189
 mainboard is the sabertooth chat 7 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.389
 I rely on the tbv cm 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.330
 that this series should 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.130
 extreme conditions stable accordingly 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.590
 it has plastic cover here 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.460
 which is not only special for protection 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:25.510
 Make sure that the system is better cooled 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.560
 The one here and there is a fan 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.380
 can attach 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.680
 then cold air is distributed over 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.530
 the components on the circuit board, a 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.640
 difference to the predecessor we were the 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.020
 area namely also decided on 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.190
 currently 770 variant 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.520
 you can now here with one 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:51.620
 Slider soon works with a 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:54.829
 open hand or open if you are here 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.589
 has a top flow cooler or the buck 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.780
 For example, then the card will be 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.920
 from the processor cooler here 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.659
 and should also be wayne 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.729
 exciting only the excitingly active 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.680
 distribute closed 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.600
 when using a racial coinage 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.999
 do not match the fan on the cdu 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:16.479
 Presence of the predecessors are all slots 

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:20.289
 they plastic cover not one so 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.329
 reservoir when run two modules should one 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:26.049
 already use if you take four 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:29.049
 ortmann would like this plastic cover 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.789
 simply from the latest concept consistently 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.209
 was continued namely for the sata 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.209
 connections 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.020
 if in tempus operates 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.390
 when 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.920
 Here, too, you can see the new statutes 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.920
 sporty caps 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.830
 absolutely extraordinary new 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.990
 mainboard 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.990
 exciting for you the concert in st
