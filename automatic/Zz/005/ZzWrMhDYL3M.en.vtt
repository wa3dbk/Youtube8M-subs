couple<00:02:10.060> other<00:02:10.300> interesting<00:02:10.539> little<00:02:11.140> bits<00:02:11.380> on

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
couple other interesting little bits on

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.559 
couple other interesting little bits on
here<00:02:11.860> if<00:02:12.610> we<00:02:12.700> look<00:02:12.730> at<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.090> rear<00:02:13.270> sight

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
here if we look at the rear sight

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.720 
here if we look at the rear sight
there's<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.290> rivet<00:02:14.680> that's<00:02:14.890> been<00:02:15.130> slapped

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
there's a rivet that's been slapped

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.460 
there's a rivet that's been slapped
right<00:02:15.970> through<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.480> range<00:02:16.930> adjuster

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
right through the the range adjuster

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.589 
right through the the range adjuster
that's<00:02:18.099> in<00:02:18.310> there<00:02:18.489> so<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.790> can<00:02:19.239> no<00:02:19.360> longer

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
that's in there so you can no longer

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.770 
that's in there so you can no longer
move<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.200> range<00:02:20.380> slider<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:22.000> course<00:02:22.239> it's<00:02:22.599> a

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
move the range slider of course it's a

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.449 
move the range slider of course it's a
410<00:02:23.140> shotgun<00:02:23.170> it's<00:02:23.770> not<00:02:24.040> like<00:02:24.220> you're<00:02:24.370> going

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
410 shotgun it's not like you're going

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.550 
410 shotgun it's not like you're going
to<00:02:24.520> be<00:02:24.640> shooting<00:02:24.940> at<00:02:25.030> 2,000<00:02:25.569> yards<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:26.440> they

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
to be shooting at 2,000 yards so they

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.810 
to be shooting at 2,000 yards so they
just<00:02:26.770> pinned<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.130> so<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:28.260> it's<00:02:29.260> idiot-proof

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
just pinned it so that it's idiot-proof

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.640 
just pinned it so that it's idiot-proof
if<00:02:30.820> we<00:02:31.270> look<00:02:31.390> at<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.570> muzzle

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
if we look at the muzzle

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.250 
if we look at the muzzle
you<00:02:33.340> can<00:02:33.489> see<00:02:33.640> that<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.940> muzzle<00:02:34.150> is<00:02:34.450> larger

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
you can see that the muzzle is larger

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.869 
you can see that the muzzle is larger
than<00:02:35.409> normal<00:02:35.590> that's<00:02:36.069> of<00:02:36.280> course<00:02:36.430> been<00:02:36.670> bored

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
than normal that's of course been bored

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.539 
than normal that's of course been bored
out<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.180> 410<00:02:37.569> and<00:02:37.810> it's<00:02:37.930> smoothbore<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:39.280> does

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
out to 410 and it's smoothbore it does

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.000 
out to 410 and it's smoothbore it does
retain<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.390> plug<00:02:40.659> and<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.140> lug<00:02:41.680> for<00:02:41.980> a

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
retain the plug and the lug for a

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.649 
retain the plug and the lug for a
bayonet<00:02:42.190> so<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:42.849> will<00:02:43.030> take<00:02:43.209> a<00:02:43.239> standard

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
bayonet so this will take a standard

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.500 
bayonet so this will take a standard
bayonet<00:02:44.549> now<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.610> reason<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.060> these<00:02:46.269> guns

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
bayonet now the reason that these guns

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.030 
bayonet now the reason that these guns
were<00:02:46.690> converted<00:02:47.110> like<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.409> was<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.799> arm

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
were converted like this was to arm

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.720 
were converted like this was to arm
police<00:02:48.640> units<00:02:49.079> jail<00:02:50.079> guards<00:02:50.640> people<00:02:51.640> who

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
police units jail guards people who

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.110 
police units jail guards people who
needed<00:02:52.000> weapons<00:02:52.450> but<00:02:52.959> not<00:02:53.140> necessarily

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
needed weapons but not necessarily

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.819 
needed weapons but not necessarily
repeating<00:02:55.120> rifles<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:55.870> this<00:02:56.260> would<00:02:56.409> be<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.560> good

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
repeating rifles so this would be a good

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.860 
repeating rifles so this would be a good
gun<00:02:57.040> for<00:02:57.280> riot<00:02:57.519> police<00:02:57.940> or<00:02:58.209> at<00:02:58.390> least<00:02:58.540> they

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
gun for riot police or at least they

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.339 
gun for riot police or at least they
decided<00:02:59.349> it<00:02:59.440> would<00:02:59.560> be<00:03:00.090> they<00:03:01.090> used<00:03:01.390> they<00:03:02.200> had<00:03:02.319> a

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
decided it would be they used they had a

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.530 
decided it would be they used they had a
buckshot<00:03:02.590> load<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.220> they<00:03:03.280> also<00:03:03.430> had<00:03:03.819> a<00:03:04.120> single

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
buckshot load and they also had a single

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.890 
buckshot load and they also had a single
round<00:03:05.459> not<00:03:06.459> really<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.730> slug<00:03:07.060> as<00:03:07.239> it's<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.540> single

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
round not really a slug as it's a single

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.580 
round not really a slug as it's a single
round<00:03:08.440> ball<00:03:08.769> load<00:03:09.519> that<00:03:09.730> they<00:03:09.819> used<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.590> I

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
round ball load that they used and I

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.890 
round ball load that they used and I
should<00:03:11.799> say<00:03:11.920> this<00:03:12.099> wasn't<00:03:12.310> originally<00:03:13.060> the

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
should say this wasn't originally the

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.319 
should say this wasn't originally the
American<00:03:14.379> style<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:14.829> 410<00:03:15.280> when<00:03:16.000> we<00:03:16.150> think

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
American style of 410 when we think

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.839 
American style of 410 when we think
about<00:03:16.480> 410<00:03:17.170> we<00:03:17.379> think<00:03:17.590> about<00:03:17.709> this<00:03:18.519> sort<00:03:18.790> of

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
about 410 we think about this sort of

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.360 
about 410 we think about this sort of
thing<00:03:19.060> well<00:03:20.019> these<00:03:20.349> rifles<00:03:20.829> were<00:03:20.920> designed

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
thing well these rifles were designed

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.149 
thing well these rifles were designed
for<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:21.870> proprietary<00:03:22.870> 410<00:03:23.440> round<00:03:23.709> that<00:03:24.010> was

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
for a proprietary 410 round that was

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.240 
for a proprietary 410 round that was
made<00:03:24.870> by<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:25.900> British<00:03:26.140> or<00:03:26.560> by<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.799> Indians

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
made by the British or by the Indians

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.920 
made by the British or by the Indians
basically<00:03:28.239> they'd<00:03:28.390> go<00:03:28.540> through<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.810> whole

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
basically they'd go through the whole

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.630 
basically they'd go through the whole
manufacturing<00:03:29.230> process<00:03:30.040> for<00:03:30.069> a<00:03:30.310> 303

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
manufacturing process for a 303

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.390 
manufacturing process for a 303
cartridge<00:03:31.359> but<00:03:31.810> not<00:03:32.049> neck<00:03:32.319> it<00:03:32.470> down<00:03:32.709> so<00:03:33.340> you

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
cartridge but not neck it down so you

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.069 
cartridge but not neck it down so you
ended<00:03:33.640> up<00:03:33.730> with<00:03:33.879> a<00:03:33.909> straight<00:03:34.180> walled<00:03:34.420> 303

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
ended up with a straight walled 303

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.500 
ended up with a straight walled 303
which<00:03:35.260> was<00:03:35.470> in<00:03:35.709> effect<00:03:35.799> a<00:03:36.129> 410<00:03:36.579> and<00:03:36.790> that's<00:03:37.269> the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
which was in effect a 410 and that's the

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.610 
which was in effect a 410 and that's the
cartridge<00:03:37.900> that<00:03:37.930> these<00:03:38.200> rifles<00:03:38.560> were

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
cartridge that these rifles were

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.710 
cartridge that these rifles were
chambered<00:03:39.010> for<00:03:39.220> that<00:03:39.849> made<00:03:40.060> ammunition

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
chambered for that made ammunition

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.750 
chambered for that made ammunition
logistics<00:03:41.230> pretty<00:03:41.440> easy<00:03:41.680> now<00:03:42.430> when<00:03:42.609> they<00:03:42.669> were

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
logistics pretty easy now when they were

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.940 
logistics pretty easy now when they were
imported<00:03:43.060> into<00:03:43.389> the<00:03:43.599> u.s.<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:44.169> lot<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.769> guns

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
imported into the u.s. a lot of the guns

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.920 
imported into the u.s. a lot of the guns
including<00:03:45.609> this<00:03:45.700> particular<00:03:46.209> one<00:03:46.419> were

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
including this particular one were

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.990 
including this particular one were
reamed<00:03:47.230> out<00:03:47.470> for<00:03:47.859> standard<00:03:48.430> two<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:48.819> a<00:03:48.849> half

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
reamed out for standard two and a half

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.530 
reamed out for standard two and a half
or<00:03:49.239> sometimes<00:03:49.599> three<00:03:49.930> inch<00:03:50.639> us<00:03:51.639> for<00:03:52.060> ten<00:03:52.269> shot

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
or sometimes three inch us for ten shot

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.270 
or sometimes three inch us for ten shot
shells<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:55.260> here<00:03:56.260> we<00:03:56.379> put<00:03:56.829> a<00:03:56.889> couple<00:03:57.069> rounds

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
shells so here we put a couple rounds

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.949 
shells so here we put a couple rounds
through<00:03:57.730> this<00:03:57.819> see<00:03:58.060> how<00:03:58.150> it<00:03:58.269> shoots<00:03:58.450> should

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
through this see how it shoots should

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.110 
through this see how it shoots should
obviously<00:03:59.109> have<00:03:59.410> very<00:03:59.590> little<00:04:00.010> recoil<00:04:00.310> 410<00:04:01.000> is

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
obviously have very little recoil 410 is

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
to need to ever fire very many round so

to need to ever fire very many round so
the<00:04:53.000> ammo<00:04:53.270> lasts<00:04:53.600> a<00:04:53.660> long<00:04:53.780> time<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:54.550> it

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
the ammo lasts a long time and it

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.070 
the ammo lasts a long time and it
doesn't<00:04:55.910> get<00:04:56.090> much<00:04:56.240> more<00:04:56.270> stout<00:04:56.900> and

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
doesn't get much more stout and

doesn't get much more stout and
dependable<00:04:57.740> and<00:04:57.890> durable<00:04:58.220> than<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.900> nicely

dependable and durable than a nicely

dependable and durable than a nicely
Enfield<00:05:00.290> rifle<00:05:00.940> he'll<00:05:01.940> do<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:02.720> couple<00:05:03.020> more

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110

Enfield rifle he'll do a couple more
rounds<00:05:03.260> just<00:05:03.620> for<00:05:03.770> fun

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.900 

all<00:05:37.710> right<00:05:37.889> so<00:05:38.069> we<00:05:38.220> took<00:05:38.370> a<00:05:38.430> look<00:05:38.639> at<00:05:38.759> this

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
all right so we took a look at this

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.580 
all right so we took a look at this
whole<00:05:39.090> setup<00:05:39.360> and<00:05:39.660> we<00:05:39.750> figured<00:05:40.080> this<00:05:40.289> really

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
whole setup and we figured this really

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.589 
whole setup and we figured this really
calls<00:05:40.770> for<00:05:40.979> team<00:05:41.490> operations<00:05:42.120> so<00:05:42.330> you<00:05:42.389> don't

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
calls for team operations so you don't

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:43.999 
calls for team operations so you don't
have<00:05:42.720> to<00:05:42.870> pull<00:05:43.110> the<00:05:43.229> gun<00:05:43.380> off<00:05:43.530> your<00:05:43.710> shoulder

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
have to pull the gun off your shoulder

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:58.550 
have to pull the gun off your shoulder
to<00:05:44.130> reload<00:05:44.460> ready<00:05:46.849> open<00:05:47.849> fire<00:05:57.349> we<00:05:58.349> don't<00:05:58.380> know

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
to reload ready open fire we don't know

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.620 
to reload ready open fire we don't know
if<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:58.860> Indian<00:05:59.250> police<00:05:59.820> actually<00:06:00.060> use<00:06:00.419> this

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
if the Indian police actually use this

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:13.110 
if the Indian police actually use this
method<00:06:01.050> but<00:06:01.849> seems<00:06:02.849> to<00:06:03.000> work

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.730 

bloody<00:06:14.120> hell

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
bloody hell

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:21.280 
bloody hell
