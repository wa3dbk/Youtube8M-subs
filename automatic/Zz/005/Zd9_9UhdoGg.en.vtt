00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
at the bottom I thought that was really

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.940 
at the bottom I thought that was really
neat<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:16.959> was<00:02:17.080> still<00:02:17.410> there<00:02:17.590> these

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
neat that that was still there these

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.130 
neat that that was still there these
vandals<00:02:18.490> have<00:02:18.850> not<00:02:19.030> destroyed<00:02:19.630> that<00:02:20.500> message

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
so again that's from 2001 probably the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.870 
so again that's from 2001 probably the
last<00:02:25.720> day<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.560> schoolhouse<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.790> was

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880
