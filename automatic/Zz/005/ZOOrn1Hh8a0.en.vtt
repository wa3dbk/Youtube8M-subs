a table what we're going to see there's
some<00:01:07.670> very<00:01:07.850> interesting<00:01:08.210> techniques<00:01:08.900> that

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
some very interesting techniques that

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.960 
some very interesting techniques that
will<00:01:09.560> go<00:01:09.740> through<00:01:10.009> in<00:01:10.159> making<00:01:10.580> this<00:01:10.700> let's

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
will go through in making this let's

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.570 
will go through in making this let's
look<00:01:11.479> at<00:01:11.690> it<00:01:11.810> in<00:01:11.960> detail<00:01:12.170> of<00:01:12.650> course<00:01:12.890> it's<00:01:13.130> a

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
look at it in detail of course it's a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.540 
look at it in detail of course it's a
call<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:13.880> sawbuck<00:01:14.450> because<00:01:14.720> of<00:01:14.840> these

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
call to sawbuck because of these

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.800 
call to sawbuck because of these
x-shaped<00:01:16.550> trestles<00:01:17.060> here<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.570> there's<00:01:17.750> a

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
x-shaped trestles here and there's a

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.040 
x-shaped trestles here and there's a
long<00:01:18.590> stretcher<00:01:19.310> down<00:01:19.430> below<00:01:19.789> later<00:01:20.750> on<00:01:20.930> we'll

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
long stretcher down below later on we'll

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.779 
long stretcher down below later on we'll
have<00:01:21.200> to<00:01:21.320> put<00:01:21.500> this<00:01:21.619> wedge<00:01:21.979> through<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.610> hold

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
have to put this wedge through to hold

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
the business here we're going to see how

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.170 
the business here we're going to see how
that's<00:01:24.190> pierced<00:01:25.190> all<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.490> way<00:01:25.580> through<00:01:25.940> and

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
that's pierced all the way through and

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.270 
that's pierced all the way through and
these<00:01:26.600> are<00:01:26.660> half-lapped<00:01:27.440> again<00:01:27.800> there<00:01:28.039> are

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
these are half-lapped again there are

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.820 
these are half-lapped again there are
two<00:01:28.640> pieces<00:01:28.880> half<00:01:29.690> cut<00:01:30.020> away<00:01:30.200> from<00:01:30.410> one<00:01:30.560> half

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
two pieces half cut away from one half

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.620 
two pieces half cut away from one half
from<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.220> other<00:01:31.399> and<00:01:31.670> you<00:01:32.240> put<00:01:32.420> them<00:01:32.509> together

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
from the other and you put them together

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.690 
from the other and you put them together
it<00:01:32.960> makes<00:01:33.140> them<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.470> same<00:01:33.710> thickness<00:01:34.250> all<00:01:34.610> the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
it makes them the same thickness all the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.359 
it makes them the same thickness all the
way<00:01:34.789> across<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.390> then<00:01:35.990> on<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.380> front<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:37.130> see

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
way across and then on the front you see

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.130 
way across and then on the front you see
the<00:01:37.490> pattern<00:01:37.729> very<00:01:38.149> clearly<00:01:38.450> of<00:01:38.690> these

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
the pattern very clearly of these

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.889 
the pattern very clearly of these
s-shaped<00:01:39.950> oh<00:01:40.130> geez<00:01:40.820> here<00:01:41.270> they<00:01:41.420> go<00:01:41.570> all<00:01:41.780> the

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
s-shaped oh geez here they go all the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.109 
s-shaped oh geez here they go all the
way<00:01:41.929> around<00:01:42.020> we're<00:01:42.530> going<00:01:42.619> to<00:01:42.679> see<00:01:42.830> how<00:01:42.860> to<00:01:43.119> lay

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
way around we're going to see how to lay

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.719 
way around we're going to see how to lay
out<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:44.600> cut<00:01:44.960> these<00:01:45.410> s<00:01:45.740> shapes<00:01:46.160> that<00:01:46.310> make<00:01:46.429> it

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
out and cut these s shapes that make it

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.179 
out and cut these s shapes that make it
such<00:01:47.119> a<00:01:47.179> nice<00:01:47.420> looking<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.929> little<00:01:48.560> table<00:01:48.860> there

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
such a nice looking a little table there

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.819 
such a nice looking a little table there
hey<00:01:49.490> all<00:01:49.970> right<00:01:50.060> now<00:01:50.720> there's<00:01:51.320> one<00:01:51.560> other

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
hey all right now there's one other

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
can see on the end here there's what's

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.710 
can see on the end here there's what's
called<00:01:57.259> a<00:01:57.650> clamp<00:01:58.070> this<00:01:58.369> is<00:01:58.490> a<00:01:58.520> clamped<00:01:59.060> top

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
called a clamp this is a clamped top

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.980 
called a clamp this is a clamped top
table<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:01.340> clamp<00:02:01.670> is<00:02:01.909> this<00:02:02.060> outer<00:02:02.570> piece

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
table and the clamp is this outer piece

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.230 
table and the clamp is this outer piece
here<00:02:03.320> of<00:02:03.470> long<00:02:03.890> grain<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.640> you<00:02:04.729> can<00:02:04.880> see<00:02:05.090> the

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
here of long grain and you can see the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.630 
here of long grain and you can see the
main<00:02:05.450> boards<00:02:05.960> tenant<00:02:06.530> through<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:07.430> now<00:02:07.549> the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
main boards tenant through it now the

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.100 
main boards tenant through it now the
reason<00:02:07.790> we<00:02:07.970> do<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.119> is<00:02:08.299> is<00:02:08.600> of<00:02:08.750> course<00:02:08.899> the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
reason we do that is is of course the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.380 
reason we do that is is of course the
wood<00:02:09.290> wants<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.799> expand<00:02:10.459> and<00:02:10.700> contract<00:02:10.820> we've

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
wood wants to expand and contract we've

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.870 
wood wants to expand and contract we've
got<00:02:11.540> two<00:02:11.750> boards<00:02:12.200> here<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:12.650> in<00:02:13.250> humid<00:02:13.700> weather

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
got two boards here and in humid weather

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.150 
got two boards here and in humid weather
they<00:02:14.120> want<00:02:14.299> to<00:02:14.450> get<00:02:14.570> wider<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:15.590> we<00:02:15.739> do<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:15.980> make

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
they want to get wider so we do is make

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.670 
they want to get wider so we do is make
too<00:02:16.430> tight<00:02:16.880> central<00:02:17.510> tenants<00:02:18.019> and<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.470> couple

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
too tight central tenants and a couple

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.740 
too tight central tenants and a couple
of<00:02:18.829> loose<00:02:19.010> outer<00:02:19.310> ones<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.850> that<00:02:20.060> allows<00:02:20.390> the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
of loose outer ones and that allows the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.140 
of loose outer ones and that allows the
boards<00:02:21.079> to<00:02:21.230> go<00:02:21.350> out<00:02:21.620> they<00:02:22.250> slide<00:02:22.610> out<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.060> then

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
boards to go out they slide out and then

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.789 
boards to go out they slide out and then
they<00:02:23.269> slide<00:02:23.510> back<00:02:23.540> in<00:02:23.989> but<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.200> always<00:02:24.380> stays

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
they slide back in but it always stays

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.650 
they slide back in but it always stays
flat<00:02:25.190> so<00:02:25.489> we've<00:02:25.640> got<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.790> clamp<00:02:26.180> on<00:02:26.329> one<00:02:26.510> end

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
flat so we've got a clamp on one end

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.699 
flat so we've got a clamp on one end
we'll<00:02:26.750> have<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:26.930> put<00:02:27.079> one<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.410> other<00:02:27.530> end

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
we'll have to put one on the other end

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.160 
we'll have to put one on the other end
and<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:28.340> see<00:02:28.579> on<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.790> far<00:02:29.209> end<00:02:29.450> here<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
and you see on the far end here the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.979 
and you see on the far end here the
groove<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.880> goes<00:02:32.150> into<00:02:32.360> so<00:02:32.660> we<00:02:32.780> have<00:02:32.959> a

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
groove that it goes into so we have a

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.199 
groove that it goes into so we have a
cut<00:02:33.290> of<00:02:33.410> tenant<00:02:33.829> in<00:02:33.950> addition<00:02:34.459> to<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.850> tenons

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
cut of tenant in addition to the tenons

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.430 
cut of tenant in addition to the tenons
like<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.540> see<00:02:35.720> here<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.930> go<00:02:36.140> all<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.380> way

through we got a shoulder all the way
across<00:02:37.850> we've<00:02:38.660> got<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:38.870> groove<00:02:39.170> this<00:02:39.410> piece<00:02:39.620> it

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860

tables yeah but this is called a Sawbuck
now<00:03:22.110> let's<00:03:22.560> figure<00:03:22.800> out<00:03:22.950> how<00:03:23.040> this<00:03:23.280> goes

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
now let's figure out how this goes

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.890 
now let's figure out how this goes
together<00:03:23.640> I'm<00:03:23.850> gonna<00:03:24.000> take<00:03:24.240> out<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:24.660> long

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
together I'm gonna take out that long

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.310 
together I'm gonna take out that long
stretcher<00:03:25.620> first<00:03:26.490> are<00:03:27.330> you<00:03:27.570> see<00:03:27.810> how<00:03:27.990> that

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
stretcher first are you see how that

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.830 
stretcher first are you see how that
goes<00:03:28.890> through<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.490> mortise<00:03:30.210> that<00:03:30.390> goes<00:03:30.540> all

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
goes through the mortise that goes all

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.170 
goes through the mortise that goes all
the<00:03:30.870> way<00:03:31.140> through<00:03:31.170> these<00:03:32.130> two<00:03:32.490> pieces<00:03:32.730> here

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
the way through these two pieces here

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.750 
the way through these two pieces here
alright<00:03:34.140> this<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.380> just<00:03:34.560> some<00:03:34.710> pine<00:03:35.040> i'm<00:03:35.400> using

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760

half laps and then put it back together

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.010 
half laps and then put it back together
right<00:03:41.520> fast<00:03:41.820> so<00:03:42.030> we<00:03:42.060> can<00:03:42.180> see<00:03:42.450> how<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.660> lay<00:03:42.870> them

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.450 
out you see the half laps how they're
cut<00:03:45.210> half<00:03:45.540> away<00:03:45.840> on<00:03:46.020> one<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.440> half<00:03:46.800> away<00:03:47.190> on

the way through let me go ahead and put
it<00:03:57.990> back<00:03:58.170> up<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.980> we'll<00:03:59.190> start<00:03:59.400> laying<00:03:59.790> out<00:03:59.910> i

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
it back up and we'll start laying out i

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.650 
it back up and we'll start laying out i
guess<00:04:00.150> first<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.750> half<00:04:01.020> lap<00:04:01.320> and<00:04:02.120> then<00:04:03.120> we'll

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
guess first the half lap and then we'll

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.390 
guess first the half lap and then we'll
go<00:04:03.900> ahead<00:04:03.990> and<00:04:04.200> do<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:06.870> OG<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.800> then<00:04:08.280> we'll

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
go ahead and do the OG and then we'll

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.000 
go ahead and do the OG and then we'll
move<00:04:08.730> on<00:04:08.940> up<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.240> the<00:04:09.360> top<00:04:09.540> before<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.740> know<00:04:10.860> it

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
move on up to the top before you know it

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.740 
move on up to the top before you know it
lots<00:04:11.310> of<00:04:11.520> stuff<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:11.880> will<00:04:12.000> just<00:04:12.150> get<00:04:12.240> to<00:04:12.450> look

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
lots of stuff it will just get to look

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.330 
lots of stuff it will just get to look
at<00:04:13.820> as<00:04:14.820> we<00:04:15.030> go<00:04:15.150> through<00:04:15.390> this<00:04:15.510> all<00:04:15.720> right<00:04:16.340> let

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
at as we go through this all right let

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.979 
at as we go through this all right let
me<00:04:17.370> get<00:04:17.520> some<00:04:17.700> boards<00:04:18.060> here<00:04:18.210> now

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
me get some boards here now

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.170 
me get some boards here now
mathematically<00:04:19.710> it<00:04:20.190> should<00:04:20.430> be<00:04:20.580> kind<00:04:20.910> of<00:04:21.030> eat

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
mathematically it should be kind of eat

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.180 
mathematically it should be kind of eat
you'd<00:04:21.390> think<00:04:21.600> it'd<00:04:21.780> be<00:04:21.870> easy<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.850> lay<00:04:23.850> out<00:04:24.120> a

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
you'd think it'd be easy to lay out a

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.020 
you'd think it'd be easy to lay out a
you<00:04:26.190> know<00:04:26.280> because<00:04:26.460> they're<00:04:26.550> all<00:04:26.670> studied

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
you know because they're all studied

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.700 
you know because they're all studied
about<00:04:27.240> how<00:04:27.420> triangles<00:04:28.050> working<00:04:28.350> do<00:04:28.410> you<00:04:28.470> think

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
about how triangles working do you think

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.340 
about how triangles working do you think
about<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:29.100> this<00:04:29.550> thing<00:04:29.760> is<00:04:29.910> 27<00:04:30.660> inches<00:04:30.750> tall

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
about it this thing is 27 inches tall

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.220 
about it this thing is 27 inches tall
and<00:04:31.830> it's<00:04:32.010> 24<00:04:32.520> inches<00:04:32.850> wide<00:04:33.060> on<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.300> spread<00:04:33.660> so

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
and it's 24 inches wide on the spread so

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.440 
and it's 24 inches wide on the spread so
you<00:04:34.320> could<00:04:34.500> do<00:04:34.620> that<00:04:34.650> with<00:04:35.010> a<00:04:35.040> triangle<00:04:35.580> right

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
you could do that with a triangle right

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.320 
you could do that with a triangle right
triangle<00:04:37.010> 27<00:04:38.010> high<00:04:38.160> 24<00:04:38.730> on<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:38.940> bottom<00:04:39.240> then

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
triangle 27 high 24 on the bottom then

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.210 
triangle 27 high 24 on the bottom then
you<00:04:39.420> just<00:04:39.570> figure<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:39.870> hypotenuse<00:04:40.440> the

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
you just figure the hypotenuse the

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.030 
you just figure the hypotenuse the
problem<00:04:41.790> is<00:04:41.940> with<00:04:42.150> that<00:04:42.740> because<00:04:43.740> of<00:04:44.010> the

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
problem is with that because of the

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.550 
problem is with that because of the
width<00:04:44.370> of<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.790> boards<00:04:45.210> that<00:04:45.810> measures

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
width of the boards that measures

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.700 
width of the boards that measures
actually<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.190> diagonal<00:04:48.030> see<00:04:48.690> if<00:04:49.350> we<00:04:49.500> were<00:04:49.590> to

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
actually the diagonal see if we were to

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.610 
actually the diagonal see if we were to
go<00:04:49.890> up<00:04:50.040> 27<00:04:50.850> inches<00:04:51.150> here<00:04:51.510> all<00:04:51.900> right<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.140> then

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
go up 27 inches here all right and then

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.910 
go up 27 inches here all right and then
24<00:04:53.310> cross<00:04:53.520> on<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:53.940> bottom<00:04:54.740> alright<00:04:55.740> what

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
24 cross on the bottom alright what

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.110 
24 cross on the bottom alright what
we're<00:04:56.010> actually<00:04:56.220> doing<00:04:56.520> we<00:04:56.670> don't<00:04:56.880> have<00:04:57.090> that

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
we're actually doing we don't have that

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.790 
we're actually doing we don't have that
angle<00:04:57.630> generate<00:04:57.930> we<00:04:58.020> had<00:04:58.140> the<00:04:58.260> angle<00:04:58.680> of<00:04:58.740> the

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
angle generate we had the angle of the

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.550 
angle generate we had the angle of the
diagonal
