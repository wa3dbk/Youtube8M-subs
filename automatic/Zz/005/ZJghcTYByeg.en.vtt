the screen right now wears a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.779 
the screen right now wears a
nice-looking<00:00:51.899> silver<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.800> flying<00:00:53.160> Bravo<00:00:53.610> is

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
nice-looking silver the flying Bravo is

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.660

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the front chassis and then read it near

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.950 
the front chassis and then read it near
the<00:00:58.920> tail<00:00:59.160> end<00:00:59.399> now<00:00:59.820> overall<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.270> think<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the tail end now overall I think the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.959 
the tail end now overall I think the
classic<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> best<00:01:02.010> way<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.219> go<00:01:02.460> because

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
classic is the best way to go because

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.060 
classic is the best way to go because
you're<00:01:03.270> not<00:01:03.390> really<00:01:03.539> unless<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.589> really<00:01:04.799> like

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.010 
you're not really unless you really like
those<00:01:05.220> cars<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.729> flying<00:01:05.970> Bravo<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.570> all

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
classic version of the Swift in my

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.620 
classic version of the Swift in my
opinion<00:01:20.009> are<00:01:20.189> not<00:01:20.640> really<00:01:20.850> worth<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.450> money

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
opinion are not really worth the money

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.899 
opinion are not really worth the money
