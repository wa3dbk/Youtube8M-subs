00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:06.189
 hello everyone welcome to my channel and 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:08.799
 we are in every busti crop and today we 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:11.019
 I bring gameplay if you remember it already 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.330
 a long time more or less when it came out 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.390
 the call of duty ghosts I made 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.300
 video more or less to show you how 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.170
 doing it is a very good class with 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.420
 specialist and more or less it was like 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.490
 I was taking my class then 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.890
 Now I bring you the best kind of 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.949
 moment the best class you can 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.350
 equip that right now I have I'm going 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.690
 to teach what I've done myself and 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.449
 It's going to luxury I've been pretty 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.989
 schemes with that class and the truth is 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:46.269
 that does not take anything away from you 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.979
 disappoints so you can put here 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.989
 the weapon you want, I always carry it 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:51.339
 or if I have honey I will love until 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.989
 take until it reaches the maximum level 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.580
 when it reaches the maximum level it will remove me 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.190
 from honey I will start to take out the weapons 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.470
 of gold and you will have more variety of camps 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.680
 with different weapons because I at a low level 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.050
 that took her with 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.060
 the handle and with large loaders 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.890
 then you put on the camouflage or what 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.930
 you want but I do not put it here 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.480
 Attentive because you do not have to get 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.450
 secondary neither lethal nor tactical anymore 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.890
 we pass to advantage if we put ourselves 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.380
 pÃ©rez fingering that is here scavenger 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.170
 hard line pink if you want to put on 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.320
 player I put it on because I like it and 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.509
 also shaking tremor is fundamental 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.190
 these advantages already with these advantages is 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.540
 as if you carry is common 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.820
 specialist only with the advantages 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.450
 main for me are the perfect ones 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.680
 they are the fundamentals to be able to play 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.229
 as if you were carrying say a 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.630
 specialist with this I always 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.380
 I put these because they are the most 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.420
 they balance when it comes to being more 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.850
 specialist and I put packages 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.360
 Streak packages I always have now 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.060
 help takes help because I like it and I 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.140
 I feel safer carrying help that I do not 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.979
 specialist because I always carry what 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.570
 same the sat with vests and now with 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.899
 when young a team always 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.610
 we put almost all the help and 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.860
 fundamental to get that msi and have 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.050
 an active radar every two times the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.269
 vests save you from many more 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.550
 the dogs and now cause good 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.800
 now with are the oracles good and 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.720
 so crepes specialist I have a there 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.420
 or a class but I never put it on 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.480
 what is it I get ready 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.010
 knock down and also here you can put the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.340
 that you want you can raise your conscience 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.970
 but I do not recommend temper for the 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.380
 jumps do not hurt you or be on the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.300
 march that smears that is pretty bad 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.940
 but good put what you want to 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.480
 get us the specialist to 7 points to 7 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.489
 no to 7 I think it sounds like this to 7 to 7 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.530
 you already get the specialist and here 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.500
 you can put whatever you want as 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.620
 for example play with I would get to 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.110
 play with and stable aim or me 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.489
 I would also draw fast but 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.800
 good here is your choice 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.260
 also shield protector ti could 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.580
 save life enough but good here 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.860
 at your choice, how do I wear it? 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.680
 specialist I can not comment on those 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.290
 advantages but the main advantages 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.170
 If I can give you an opinion this is the one that is going 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.239
 to go better and you're going to enjoy it 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.830
 maximum good I will finish since here the 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.370
 pretty fast video I wanted to do it 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.430
 quite 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.810
 light so you do not have too much 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.890
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.269

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.269
