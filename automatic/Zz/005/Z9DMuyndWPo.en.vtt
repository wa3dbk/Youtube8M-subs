00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
photoshop which is pretty cool because

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.410 
photoshop which is pretty cool because
it<00:01:15.100> means<00:01:15.280> that<00:01:15.610> you<00:01:15.729> can<00:01:15.940> take<00:01:16.119> images

directly<00:01:16.960> from<00:01:17.050> lightroom<00:01:17.500> and<00:01:17.590> build<00:01:17.830> a

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
directly from lightroom and build a

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.920 
directly from lightroom and build a
panorama<00:01:18.430> without<00:01:18.820> having<00:01:19.180> to<00:01:19.360> open<00:01:19.630> them<00:01:19.900> up

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
panorama without having to open them up

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.660 
panorama without having to open them up
all<00:01:20.229> individually<00:01:20.799> first<00:01:21.070> as<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.310> had<00:01:21.520> to

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
all individually first as you had to

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.420 
all individually first as you had to
library<00:01:22.119> one<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.960> only<00:01:23.140> problem<00:01:23.470> is<00:01:23.770> is<00:01:24.070> that

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
library one the only problem is is that

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.340 
library one the only problem is is that
you<00:01:24.670> are<00:01:24.759> forced<00:01:25.119> to<00:01:25.210> do<00:01:25.450> this<00:01:25.690> using<00:01:26.140> the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
you are forced to do this using the

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.590 
you are forced to do this using the
maximum<00:01:26.979> size<00:01:27.220> of<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.850> vials<00:01:28.210> you<00:01:28.300> have<00:01:28.390> no

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
maximum size of the vials you have no

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.200 
maximum size of the vials you have no
control<00:01:28.780> over<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.440> file<00:01:29.649> size<00:01:29.890> so<00:01:30.190> this<00:01:30.820> image

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
control over the file size so this image

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.870 
control over the file size so this image
will<00:01:31.810> end<00:01:31.960> up<00:01:32.140> becoming<00:01:32.290> really<00:01:33.130> huge<00:01:33.580> but<00:01:33.759> be

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
will end up becoming really huge but be

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.310 
will end up becoming really huge but be
much<00:01:34.090> bigger<00:01:34.330> than<00:01:34.479> you<00:01:34.630> really<00:01:34.869> need<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.050> work

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
much bigger than you really need to work

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.440 
much bigger than you really need to work
with<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:35.770> what<00:01:36.729> critically<00:01:37.149> is<00:01:37.240> going<00:01:37.390> to

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
with and what critically is going to

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.870 
with and what critically is going to
take<00:01:37.600> forever<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:38.080> process<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:39.160> here's<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.550> tip

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
take forever to process so here's a tip

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.719 
take forever to process so here's a tip
which<00:01:40.090> I<00:01:40.270> was<00:01:40.479> actually<00:01:40.960> shown<00:01:41.560> by<00:01:41.830> Ian<00:01:42.310> Lions

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
which I was actually shown by Ian Lions

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.719 
which I was actually shown by Ian Lions
and<00:01:43.690> he<00:01:43.840> said<00:01:44.110> instead<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:44.890> using<00:01:45.100> that<00:01:45.340> direct

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
and he said instead of using that direct

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.400 
and he said instead of using that direct
control<00:01:45.940> just<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.300> choose<00:01:46.509> open<00:01:46.780> as<00:01:47.020> layers<00:01:47.200> in

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
control just to choose open as layers in

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.680 
control just to choose open as layers in
Photoshop<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.610> what<00:01:48.850> this<00:01:48.970> does<00:01:49.210> is<00:01:49.509> that<00:01:49.630> it

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
Photoshop and what this does is that it

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.680 
Photoshop and what this does is that it
will<00:01:49.929> open<00:01:50.110> up<00:01:50.410> miss<00:01:50.710> selected<00:01:51.190> images<00:01:51.690> using

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
will open up miss selected images using

in<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:02.020> minute<00:02:02.110> what<00:02:02.380> we<00:02:02.470> can<00:02:02.619> do<00:02:02.740> with<00:02:02.860> it<00:02:03.039> first

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
in a minute what we can do with it first

of all let's just wait whilst it does
the<00:02:04.810> processing<00:02:06.899> okay<00:02:07.899> so<00:02:07.960> now<00:02:08.380> you<00:02:08.440> can<00:02:08.619> see

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
the processing okay so now you can see

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.530 
the processing okay so now you can see
that<00:02:09.009> we've<00:02:09.130> got<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.550> image<00:02:09.880> that's<00:02:10.209> been

scale<00:02:34.540> down<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:35.050> overall<00:02:35.350> size<00:02:35.620> because

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
scale down the overall size because

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.920

originally<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.520> save<00:02:42.730> time<00:02:43.020> I'm<00:02:44.020> going<00:02:44.140> to

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
originally and to save time I'm going to

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.860 
originally and to save time I'm going to
cut<00:02:44.380> back<00:02:44.620> on<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.920> size<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.430> say<00:02:45.670> two<00:02:46.360> thousand

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
cut back on the size to say two thousand

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.240 
cut back on the size to say two thousand
pixels<00:02:47.080> tall<00:02:47.530> which<00:02:47.770> i<00:02:47.860> think<00:02:47.920> is<00:02:48.100> probably

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
pixels tall which i think is probably

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.800 
pixels tall which i think is probably
going<00:02:48.520> to<00:02:48.580> be<00:02:48.640> plenty<00:02:48.970> enough<00:02:49.240> for<00:02:49.300> me<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.630> work

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
going to be plenty enough for me to work

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.780 
going to be plenty enough for me to work
with<00:02:49.840> on<00:02:50.110> this<00:02:50.260> damn<00:02:50.500> bus<00:02:50.680> so<00:02:50.980> I'm<00:02:51.610> going<00:02:51.670> to

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
with on this damn bus so I'm going to

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.970 
with on this damn bus so I'm going to
reduce<00:02:52.060> down<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.540> overall<00:02:53.080> image<00:02:53.290> in<00:02:53.620> size

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
reduce down the overall image in size

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.910 
reduce down the overall image in size
now<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:55.890> here<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:57.010> can<00:02:57.130> see<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:57.430> we've<00:02:57.700> now
