00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.160
 hello to all then load back here 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.049
 there is a bit of fuss because I have to 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.830
 go on this evening that by the way 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.650
 I am very late to meet with 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.570
 some friends to write the papyrus of 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.180
 degree of Aragon because he graduated with 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.520
 me anyway then this video 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.000
 I thought about making it just for the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.410
 fact that we often wear a lot of make-up 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.690
 quickly 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.239
 we don't want something super elaborate 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.890
 and then it must be said very many girls 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.350
 they do not have the opportunity to have 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.510
 lots of sim the tricks but maybe they have 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.359
 only two or three eyeshadows then 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.890
 this trick is made only and 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:58.739
 exclusively using an eye shadow 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.309
 a black mascara pencil of course and a 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.379
 lip gloss however with a blush 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:11.910
 on the eyes we have only one 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:14.850
 so eyeshadow is a chimera 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.630
 duochrome coming from ii 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.660
 snow chrome cosmetics so too 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.010
 metallic iridescent so let's go back 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.610
 also in the trends this fall 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.670
 winter 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.980
 no girls i hope you can 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.750
 glad you can keep an idea 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.630
 useful I send you a kiss I go because I am 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.060
 the very late as my face 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.580
 currently it has some imperfections 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.260
 also quite red 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.650
 I'm going to apply this concealer 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:49.440
 green penalty which is specific to 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:51.450
 acneic skin is just a little bit el 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.280
 we are going to apply precisely on 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.990
 our red imperfections with this 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.500
 product I am finding myself very well 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.780
 because it is perfect as a makeup base for 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.780
 who just a day at some problems 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.440
 I usually don't 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.410
 I didn't have these problems but in 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.720
 this period I do n't know will be stress 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.920
 accumulated in this period ie i 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.370
 previous periods 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.490
 a somewhat strange outburst now I go to 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.730
 apply with foundation and dedicated list 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:29.239
 reuse the number one I recommend 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.180
 especially to women perhaps beyond the 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.300
 thirty because precisely containing 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.610
 this smoothing primer will go to give 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.900
 a much younger and more youthful appearance 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.790
 your skin and more 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.310
 also contains a sunscreen 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.620
 so I find it a perfect mix for 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.420
 women a little more mature but in each 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.880
 also for young people 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:56.030
 I eliminate dark circles and imperfections with the 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:58.280
 my palette of fry line correctors on 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.850
 I go to apply this base 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:07.760
 of collistar which is an isoc driver 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:11.390
 illuminating now we're going to create one 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.180
 as a base I use the pencil of 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.620
 collistar number 105 which is a purple 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.430
 very bright 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.430
 a start 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.060
 and with a flat brush 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.060
 later it faded 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.080
 later seen considering that 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.709
 the eye shadow will be the protagonist of this 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.180
 trick I choose the eye shadow 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.209
 particular and original maybe 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.610
 metallic iridescent that will go 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.269
 very much this fall winter and me 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:58.310
 I choose chimera from the palette 2 chrome di 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:01.159
 snow cosmetics always a picket 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.159
 from top to bottom not to create 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:08.420
 of unsightly folds and see 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:11.959
 like these metallic colors e 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:15.109
 changing of abnormal self with a base 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:19.760
 below after making each one i 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:23.960
 contours of the color remaining enough 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.030
 delicate with the hand 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.270
 you can play with the nuances you can 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.210
 fade out more than on a 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.539
 right than left depending on the 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.550
 shape you want to give to your eye 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.380
 then you can choose if 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.190
 apply a light pencil or a pencil 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:48.169
 dark pencil in the internal rhyme 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:52.610
 of the eye or externally I and 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.410
 just house the dark apply now with a 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.160
 small tip brush lada resume 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:03.080
 the eye shadow I applied to mine 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.520
 eyelid and with this faded black here 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.650
 under 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.169
 then I go to apply in one 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:13.849
 essence scale the multi action that 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:17.449
 I have to positively review 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:21.199
 but I have to tell you that rather than volumizing 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:25.220
 or curl we say that it lengthens 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:29.479
 only because absolutely this 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.410
 mascara will not create any volume there 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.509
 I can assure 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.580
 so it is not a multi action does it 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:36.979
 only one of action then that of 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.830
 lengthen then anyway the color is 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.880
 quite intense black so anyway 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.639
 I review it positively as mascara 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:49.639
 see how it stretches after applying 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:52.849
 a beautiful gloss that to the many 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:56.870
 co circles that I'm really working 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:58.009
 I'm going to apply a blush on the rose if 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:07.699
 had my prof 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:10.120
 it would be better but I don't have it and the 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:14.210
 makeup made with just one eye shadow is 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.159
 finished i hope i enjoyed that 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.789
 an erika kiss may be useful 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:18.789
