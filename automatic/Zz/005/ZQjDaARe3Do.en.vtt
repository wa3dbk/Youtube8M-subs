00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.599 
these three sons kind of all tie
together<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:58.049> know<00:03:58.220> but<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.250> love<00:03:59.579> it

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
together and you know but I love it

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.629 
together and you know but I love it
definitely<00:04:00.359> a<00:04:00.389> Reaper<00:04:00.810> ch<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:01.169> wasn't<00:04:02.099> able<00:04:02.280> to

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
definitely a Reaper ch I wasn't able to

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.020 
definitely a Reaper ch I wasn't able to
grab<00:04:03.449> a<00:04:03.479> lot<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.959> refresh<00:04:04.549> while<00:04:05.549> it<00:04:05.760> was

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
grab a lot of the refresh while it was

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.479 
grab a lot of the refresh while it was
refreshed<00:04:06.419> because<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:07.049> just<00:04:07.290> did<00:04:08.189> and<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.340> was

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
refreshed because I just did and I was

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.939 
refreshed because I just did and I was
fairly<00:04:09.000> new<00:04:09.359> to<00:04:09.389> the<00:04:09.599> whole<00:04:09.840> test<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.769> thing

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
fairly new to the whole test and thing

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.249 
fairly new to the whole test and thing
so<00:04:11.129> I<00:04:11.189> thought<00:04:11.400> they'd<00:04:12.060> be<00:04:12.209> around<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:13.079> could

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:13.259 
so I thought they'd be around you could

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:17.930 
so I thought they'd be around you could
wait<00:04:13.500> but<00:04:14.810> moving<00:04:15.810> on<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.229> being<00:04:16.440> smarter<00:04:17.159> now

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
wait but moving on and being smarter now

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.190 
wait but moving on and being smarter now
