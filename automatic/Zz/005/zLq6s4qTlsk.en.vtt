00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 inhabitant 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.060
 back on this second day on 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.890
 the plateau of the confines for the cut of the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.689
 world of cross-country skiing I wanted 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.280
 promised we will show you 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.200
 backstage at this world cup 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.149
 and here I am behind the scenes before any 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.030
 thing I remind you via the stands 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.610
 spectators natural tribune in the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.590
 stage of departure for the modest sum the 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.320
 small sum of 5 euros you can 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.670
 have particular benefits to see 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.770
 the relays but relay passage the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.649
 departures the arrivals as close as 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.240
 surveys with small benefits that 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.069
 you are given at the entrance this area 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.110
 to the spectators for me I'm going back 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.640
 a little in the shade the sun 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.860
 unfortunately still not quite 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.440
 arrival this material right on the left 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.750
 So that's the job for you 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.340
 it's rather before now it's more 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.549
 cool I still have a lot of things to 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.770
 make 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.270
 yeah the bottleneck and upstream for us 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.520
 staff teams like that or 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.080
 legalistic if we did well our 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.950
 work there the two days of racing on 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.750
 is rather quiet 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.959
 we are watching that everything is going well and 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.459
 that's okay so it's going well 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.200
 there is not too much work on the other hand 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.910
 there is always the race damien we go 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.269
 spank going there I wish you a good 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.180
 day 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.120
 it is rather a good success for 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.440
 the moment everything works pretty well 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.540
 understood it's perfect for today 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.239
 it's perfect to read if damien we get 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.380
 see you later on the day 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.280
 and we will find immediately 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.280
 side of the teams 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.239
 the draw of the three winners in 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.790
 meeting the arts and the aisles 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.980
 progress people have each the podium and one 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.540
 not good when all the 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.849
 big lottery is what it will make sense 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.400
 the coop is very upset there because 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.800
 everything was not rosy between for his case 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.110
 the person recalling the Swedish 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.000
 rainier pacific are due to let 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.590
 things he followed well and others of 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.450
 5.8 it will be intense to the authorities 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.560
 watch out for that Norwegian weather 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.700
 sing them to mans it's 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.890
 completely different 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.940
 it's even more open there are 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.980
 pressures that are completely 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.400
 different not say proud but it's in 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.710
 Italy 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.270
 m 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.490
 finally did not feel if your breast of the 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.020
 home yes it is sure that the big 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.330
 goal of the season it would be when 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.440
 even the world championships 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.870
 after not hiding by continuing 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.730
 our Mauritian wrestler is harder on 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.760
 you are the main thing is that it speaks 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.530
 not even at the farm and maximum 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.970
 today and stop in a month this 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.840
 will be a whole other race with a whole 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.560
 different angle and they will be there I will 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.690
 seems 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.920
 and above all we still have others 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.360
 shares thanks robin thank you 5 6 meters from 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.040
 delay in any case he may take 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.810
 go back to the slide he's not out 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.260
 suction it was difficult 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:51.670
 the outcome of the race in 457 300 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.830
 m now their prognosis 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.269
 there is no prediction there is no 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.530
 predictions there now that's gonna kill the 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.599
 power the Czechs who seems to be 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.459
 nor did I listen to the podium attention when 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.010
 even that comes back very strong the Czechs 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.239
 for now it's still norway 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.120
 who takes the speed in the suction 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.370
 they will be fifteen 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.310
 going 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.340
 right here 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.590
 3

 after so many years spent by synapse 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.850
 received what connects them recognizes them 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:23.540
 they are the case there are four in 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.540
 a place by the crisis has lived 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.900
