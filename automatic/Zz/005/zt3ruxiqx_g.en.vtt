have a feeling this is what a lot of you
tech<00:00:50.010> people<00:00:50.309> out<00:00:50.370> there<00:00:50.579> thinking<00:00:50.969> as<00:00:51.090> well

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
tech people out there thinking as well

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.450 
tech people out there thinking as well
I'm<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.079> opinion<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.829> we've<00:00:53.129> really<00:00:53.340> got

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
I'm of the opinion that we've really got

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.920 
I'm of the opinion that we've really got
to<00:00:53.489> make<00:00:53.670> some<00:00:53.820> changes<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> software

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
to make some changes on the software

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.689 
to make some changes on the software
side<00:00:55.020> something<00:00:55.620> has<00:00:55.739> got<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:55.980> change<00:00:56.160> because

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
side something has got to change because

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490 
side something has got to change because
honestly<00:00:57.090> Android<00:00:57.899> kind<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.140> looks<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> same

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
honestly Android kind of looks the same

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.290 
honestly Android kind of looks the same
across<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> board<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.579> innovation<00:01:00.059> they're

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
across the board the innovation they're

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.299 
across the board the innovation they're
from<00:01:00.870> different<00:01:00.899> version<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.770> version<00:01:01.800> is

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
from different version to version is

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.280 
from different version to version is
becoming<00:01:02.969> less<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.210> less<00:01:03.449> comparatively

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
becoming less and less comparatively

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.870 
becoming less and less comparatively
speaking<00:01:04.409> than<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:04.979> was<00:01:05.129> obviously<00:01:05.700> from

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
speaking than what it was obviously from

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.390 
speaking than what it was obviously from
Android<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.360> one<00:01:06.600> point<00:01:06.930> 0<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.560> Android<00:01:07.890> 2.3

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400

I've<00:01:42.390> typed<00:01:42.630> out<00:01:42.869> 8<00:01:43.110> megapixel<00:01:43.770> camera<00:01:44.070> with

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
I've typed out 8 megapixel camera with

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.639 
I've typed out 8 megapixel camera with
1080p<00:01:44.399> HD<00:01:45.149> video<00:01:45.270> recording<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.990> type<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
1080p HD video recording I type that

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.319 
1080p HD video recording I type that
stuff<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.009> all<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.399> time<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.759> almost<00:01:48.000> becomes

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
stuff in all the time it almost becomes

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.480 
stuff in all the time it almost becomes
second<00:01:48.840> nature<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:49.979> exciting

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
second nature so it's not that exciting

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.770 
second nature so it's not that exciting
anymore<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.090> know<00:01:51.149> even<00:01:51.329> when<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.600> see<00:01:51.750> a

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
anymore you know even when you see a

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.940 
anymore you know even when you see a
camera<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.470> pantech<00:01:52.829> discover

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
camera like on the pantech discover

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.670 
camera like on the pantech discover
whereas<00:01:53.880> 12.6<00:01:54.479> megapixels<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.409> there<00:01:55.560> and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
whereas 12.6 megapixels are in there and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.590 
whereas 12.6 megapixels are in there and
there<00:01:55.799> are<00:01:55.860> more<00:01:56.040> devices<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:57.060> higher

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
there are more devices that have higher

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.940 
there are more devices that have higher

resolution cameras or have more
megapixels<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.640> should<00:01:59.790> say<00:01:59.969> then<00:02:00.600> some<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
megapixels I should say then some of the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.870 
megapixels I should say then some of the
8<00:02:01.020> megapixel<00:02:01.170> options<00:02:01.920> out<00:02:02.100> there<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.790> my

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
8 megapixel options out there but my

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.280 
8 megapixel options out there but my
question<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.689> exciting<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.259> a

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
question is is that exciting as a

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.899 
question is is that exciting as a
flexible<00:02:04.799> display<00:02:05.159> does<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.520> excite<00:02:05.850> you

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
flexible display does that excite you

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.999 
flexible display does that excite you
does<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> better<00:02:06.689> camera<00:02:07.079> excite<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.799> does<00:02:07.979> a

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
does a better camera excite you does a

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.790 
does a better camera excite you does a
higher<00:02:08.340> spec<00:02:08.729> processor<00:02:09.509> or<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:10.050> quad-core

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
higher spec processor or a quad-core

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.400 
higher spec processor or a quad-core
processor<00:02:11.580> versus<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> dual-core

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
processor versus a dual-core

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.230 
processor versus a dual-core
processor<00:02:12.710> does<00:02:13.190> it<00:02:13.340> excite<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:13.610> for<00:02:13.940> me<00:02:14.060> what

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
processor does it excite you for me what

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.790 
processor does it excite you for me what
excites<00:02:14.570> me<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.750> see<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.080> lot<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.500> same<00:02:15.650> in

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
excites me I see a lot of the same in

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.900 
excites me I see a lot of the same in
