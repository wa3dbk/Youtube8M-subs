00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.800
 congratulations you chose chloride 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.950
 as a guarantee of health for water and bathers of subtlety 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.339
 thank you for choosing us 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.309
 in this video what we will do step by step so you can install chlorine 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.309
 an easy and safe way 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.770
 let's see first the different types of layout your pool can have 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.999
 and how one should be in the resurrected 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.009
 in all cases the ideal is to try to locate the drum as close as possible 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.280
 of the water mirror 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.900
 It can also be placed underneath 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.590
 but no more than 60 posse tempted I felt meters deep 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.990
 the creator can be installed from 60 centimeters on the water mirror 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.560
 up to 60 centimeters under the mirror of water 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.070
 in case of impossibility to lower the level of the million 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.660
 you must install a compensating tube so that it stops and hit when 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.080
 stop the bomb 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.070
 if centrifugal sum is more than 70 to 80 centimeters deep 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.820
 we do not recommend removing the prepositions 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.820
 without first making a specialized consultation 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.820
 with the process in all the necessary elements because you will need 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.010
 as tools I should have 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.350
 a hole that for your safety we recommend that the battery works 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.540
 that there is a risk that the extensions fall into the pool 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.380
 a four-point wick 75 millimeters 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.340
 one of 10 millimeters 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.760
 a 16 mm wick 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.030
 a screwdriver 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.030
 a scissors mÃ³nica ty a pineapple 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.910
 the first thing we must solve 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.760
 from where another side will be located 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.020
 since it must be 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.130
 everything to be able to observe the drip and we also cooperate with 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.350
 then we disassemble the motherboard 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.350
 with the help of a lever in this case l 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.940
 we support it in the chosen place we mark the younger centers called with a 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.940
 mix of 6000 videos 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.029
 in this case as the practical cabinet wall 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:13.729
 we are facing a normal event of two millimeters 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.729
 and there is no need to use the efficacy data 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.129
 we start the motherboard 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:28.379
 then we locate the smelting of the wine taking into account 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.359
 can take it out and put it back in a way 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.509
 we take the script cover and we drill a hole with the wick 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:38.819
 10 million 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.819
 we went from the sector from the inside out 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:51.299
 the filter level indicator 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.299
 we put the hose next to the drum they have 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.709
 that the filter would touch the bottom of the script 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.039
 we open the indicator by the slot and place it in the ring 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:06.009
 the seal headquarters and want to enter the script 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:07.089
 as far 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:10.089
 that explored comes out towards deficit 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.929
 Once the lid of the 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:20.459
 they put it back in its place 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.229
 we see take the hose to the 2 and fixed 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.009
 and they left about 50 centimeters this time 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.009
 so that it allows us to make the replacement with fa 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.379
 now we perform 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.430
 this end that comes from the script we must insert it into the connector that 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.909
 says chlorine reservoir located at the bottom of the dispenser 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:44.889
 We can use a little detergent as a lubricant if necessary 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.999
 15 high seas a check valve 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:52.479
 in the connector that says bombs in 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.479
 and in the free connector of the check valve 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.959
 me so that we stayed after the 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.549
 we put the doser on the motherboard 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.449
 we locate the cannon corresponding to the corner 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:16.669
 and now we only have to drill with the wick of four like 75 millimeters 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:31.309
 insert in the sector 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.039
 and placing the clamp on its side make pressure so that the seal of the pdsc 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.039
 key and no water losses occur 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.669
 now we are ready to continue 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.809
 he wanted the pump glass if gm 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:54.809
 god the devil serious way 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:02.570
 now we must regulate the frequency 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.570
 according to your needs using the following table 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.139
 you should know how many hours you filter per day 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.300
 how many liters of chlorine is added 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.370
 and where these coordinates are crossed you can see the amount of quotas that 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.370
 they should pass every ten 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:28.819
 review the installation manual where it explains the necessary verifications 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.189
 after installation 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:32.150
 imp
