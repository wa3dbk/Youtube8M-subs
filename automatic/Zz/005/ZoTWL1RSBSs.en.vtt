00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
something new and James Spader I thought

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.890 
something new and James Spader I thought
was<00:02:10.070> just<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.490> brilliant<00:02:11.000> piece<00:02:11.270> of<00:02:11.300> casting

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
was just a brilliant piece of casting

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.120 
was just a brilliant piece of casting
for<00:02:12.080> Ultron<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:13.670> always<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:15.620> always<00:02:15.860> hope

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
for Ultron you always you always hope

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.700 
for Ultron you always you always hope
that<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.460> just<00:02:16.490> defies<00:02:16.940> expectation<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.080> then

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
that it just defies expectation and then

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.320 
that it just defies expectation and then
I<00:02:18.770> guess<00:02:18.980> this<00:02:19.160> time<00:02:19.190> around<00:02:19.610> we<00:02:19.790> just<00:02:20.030> really

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
I guess this time around we just really

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.570 
I guess this time around we just really
wanted<00:02:20.570> people<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.050> not<00:02:21.560> say<00:02:21.860> well<00:02:22.100> that's<00:02:22.370> all

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
wanted people to not say well that's all

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.550 
wanted people to not say well that's all
right<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.760> first<00:02:22.940> one<00:02:23.120> was<00:02:23.270> great<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:24.050> we<00:02:24.380> saw

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
right the first one was great so we saw

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.150 
right the first one was great so we saw
it<00:02:24.680> anyway

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
it anyway

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.220 
it anyway
you<00:02:25.310> know<00:02:25.460> what<00:02:26.240> is<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.480> about<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.750> dynamic

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
actor relationship is so different and

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.370 
actor relationship is so different and
Joss<00:02:39.110> is<00:02:39.350> a<00:02:39.380> is<00:02:40.160> very<00:02:40.550> in<00:02:41.060> control<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.110> really

wants<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.650> have<00:02:42.770> authorship<00:02:43.190> over<00:02:43.670> things<00:02:43.880> so

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
wants to have authorship over things so

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.700 
wants to have authorship over things so
I<00:02:44.120> think<00:02:44.270> for<00:02:44.630> me<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:44.900> was<00:02:44.990> about<00:02:45.110> just<00:02:45.440> being<00:02:45.650> a

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
I think for me it was about just being a

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.840 
I think for me it was about just being a
little<00:02:45.860> bit<00:02:45.980> more<00:02:46.220> receptive<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:49.250> makes

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
little bit more receptive and it makes

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.220 
little bit more receptive and it makes
it<00:02:50.060> in<00:02:50.210> some<00:02:50.600> ways<00:02:50.720> just<00:02:50.840> makes<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.200> job

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
it in some ways just makes the job

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.600 
it in some ways just makes the job
easier<00:02:51.710> because<00:02:51.920> he's<00:02:52.070> kind<00:02:52.310> of<00:02:52.370> got<00:02:52.490> it

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
easier because he's kind of got it

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.900 
easier because he's kind of got it
