00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello everyone with you row and in this video I 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.919
 tell you about the rest 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.200
 to begin with, what is it watermelon watermelon 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.780
 special attack modifier which 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.870
 add some effect to regular attacks 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.690
 hero but remember one rule on 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.390
 heroes can not be more than one 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.210
 of the object that is, of course, they can 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.039
 But the work is there something modifier 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.289
 attacks which earlier appears in 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.130
 inventory if you want to take you 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.710
 have to throw it away 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.360
 both objects to the ground and take first to 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.750
 the buffet you want 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.030
 and then 2 but in this rule too 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.790
 exceptions about which I will talk a little 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.950
 a little later and it is also worth remembering that 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.260
 some heroes have their objects 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.039
 which naturally won't stack with 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.649
 items 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.260
 but the abilities abilities I will talk in 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.480
 The following video and in this I will consider 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.489
 orb effects of objects and we start with 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.890
 most popular art effect in 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.140
 empiricism choose zoom lets you 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.510
 be treated depending on the applied 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.270
 you damage from normal attacks that is 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.950
 inability that is exactly the subjects 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.840
 which gives vampirism this is a morbid mask 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.470
 dominator hills 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:20.040
 mask of madness is at they also in 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.320
 empiricism gives vladmir's offering but she 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.729
 is not an album as this item 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.400
 gives effect 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.579
 auras and works only on nearby heroes 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.729
 that is, remember okay, not the following 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.310
 we will consider mana burning item 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.829
 play diffuser allows you to 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.229
 attacks burn the enemy's mana and 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.189
 deal bonus damage depending on 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.439
 mana wives 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.360
 in the amount of 100 percent to passengers 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.909
 she that is how much mono you burned 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.060
 so much damage again you will inflict 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.130
 It is worth paying attention to the fact that this 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.200
 ward effect works on the illusion then 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.159
 there is if you buy a phantom lancer 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.530
 diffusal blade 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.570
 his illusions will also burn mana but 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.909
 note mana burning only works 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.520
 melee hero rest hero 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.670
 battle river Neman and not the way the next 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.360
 the object is a reduction in armor and subject 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.200
 giving here's the effect is 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.140
 This he removes 6 enemy armor on 15 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.260
 seconds that is after even one of yours 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.230
 enemy shots will be removed 6 armor on 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.280
 as long as 15 seconds but if you shoot 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.470
 data cross-section 15 seconds once again given 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.840
 the effect will be updated and will be constantly 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.000
 hang while you shoot him next 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.140
 snout sector is slowing down 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.650
 objects give slowdown and the orb of 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.320
 venom 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.760
 which just slows down your running speed 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.340
 adversary as well 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.800
 of skadi which not only slows down 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.860
 enemy running speed but also 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.630
 reduces his attack speed also 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.570
 story and is one of the subjects 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.110
 exceptions which I said should 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.150
 know what is the effect of the story and 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.190
 add up with vampirism 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.040
 but keep in mind it only works for 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.570
 ranged for melee does not work then 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.750
 there you will not only slows down 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.420
 an adversary but also a treat creator and 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.600
 finally the latest rest chained 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.959
 lightning items like myelir email 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.230
 a storm gives a 25 percent chance that 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.090
 the enemy with auto attacks will fly also 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.890
 additional chain lightning which 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.600
 will deal bonus damage everything seems 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.810
 quite simple but with near 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.330
 review it turns out that the data 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.519
 objects may not be hordes 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.420
 Now I will explain to you that is, if you 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.709
 collect mail storm and any other or well 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.910
 for example desolator 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.690
 when fired, it will first be considered 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.630
 will lightning fall 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.480
 that is, there is a miscalculation of these 25 percent 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.910
 and if it doesn't fall out then it works 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.850
 the effect of another effect you see now 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.860
 that the enemy is flying a cartridge from an insulator 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.220
 which is highlighted in red friend 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.260
 but when these 25 percent pass and 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.600
 the enemy is flying a lightning effect desolator 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.610
 does not work that is, does not work but 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.549
 just not updated that is about it 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.690
 effects can be said that he seems to be 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.930
 there is no way of it, and considering that 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.479
 the story 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.320
 combined with a chime then you can 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:26.460
 run with three orb effects 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.220
 that is, if you buy euskadi then 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.650
 mail storm legioner as well as any 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.160
 subject empirism well for example mask of 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.460
 madness 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.620
 then they will all work ie you 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.380
 can run with three orb effects 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.960
 that will work but I again 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.500
 I will explain that is, when the shot will be 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.680
 considered first 25 percent of yonir 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.140
 or mail the storm and if they pass you 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.390
 you will shoot lightning on fast 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.700
 if they don't pass then you will 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.680
 shoot 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.290
 slowdown plus vampirism on this for now 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.360
 all orb effects that give abilities 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.820
 heroes and their interactions sport 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.670
 I make out objects in the following video and 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.520
 for now put likes subscribe to 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.370
 comment on the channel join the group 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.200
 vkontakte and remember and collect two 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.200
 effect which is not combined
