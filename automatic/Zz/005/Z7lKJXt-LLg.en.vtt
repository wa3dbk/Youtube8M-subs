00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
like the least of the three I kind of

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.719 
like the least of the three I kind of
agree<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:10.240> second<00:01:10.720> season<00:01:11.110> AIDS<00:01:11.410> is<00:01:11.770> by<00:01:12.460> far

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
agree the second season AIDS is by far

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.940 
agree the second season AIDS is by far
my<00:01:12.790> favorite<00:01:13.420> and<00:01:13.810> probably<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.530> favorite<00:01:14.680> of

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
my favorite and probably the favorite of

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.680 
my favorite and probably the favorite of
most<00:01:15.340> no<00:01:15.580> no<00:01:15.640> no<00:01:15.850> offense<00:01:16.119> if<00:01:16.479> not<00:01:16.900> all<00:01:18.690> the

most no no no offense if not all the
third<00:01:19.960> one<00:01:20.200> I<00:01:20.229> think<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.860> major<00:01:21.040> problem<00:01:21.400> with

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
come off as well like the wings on the

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.950 
come off as well like the wings on the
skates<00:05:41.520> although<00:05:41.970> unlike<00:05:42.330> the<00:05:42.479> skates<00:05:42.750> at

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
skates although unlike the skates at

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.010 
skates although unlike the skates at
leaves<00:05:43.169> are<00:05:43.349> rather<00:05:43.530> well<00:05:44.039> bigger

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
leaves are rather well bigger

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.969 
leaves are rather well bigger
rectangular<00:05:46.020> hole<00:05:46.259> in<00:05:46.349> the<00:05:46.440> back<00:05:46.590> of<00:05:46.740> her<00:05:46.800> head

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
rectangular hole in the back of her head

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.290 
rectangular hole in the back of her head
so<00:05:47.160> I'm<00:05:47.250> not<00:05:47.370> quite<00:05:47.550> sure<00:05:47.580> it's<00:05:47.910> meant<00:05:48.150> to<00:05:48.270> be

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
so I'm not quite sure it's meant to be

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.379 
so I'm not quite sure it's meant to be
displayed<00:05:48.690> without<00:05:48.930> it<00:05:49.110> but<00:05:49.259> it<00:05:49.410> can<00:05:49.620> be<00:05:50.389> also

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
displayed without it but it can be also

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.360 
displayed without it but it can be also
as<00:05:51.960> we<00:05:52.169> continue<00:05:52.500> to<00:05:52.530> turn<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:52.860> figure<00:05:53.160> out

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
as we continue to turn the figure out

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.040 
as we continue to turn the figure out
here<00:05:53.699> I'm<00:05:53.910> sure<00:05:54.180> he'll<00:05:54.360> notice<00:05:54.690> that<00:05:54.930> even

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
here I'm sure he'll notice that even

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.570 
here I'm sure he'll notice that even

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:53.779 
well done now when I review a figure I
look<00:06:52.050> at<00:06:52.169> the<00:06:52.259> sculpting<00:06:52.710> quality<00:06:53.159> the<00:06:53.550> paint

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:53.789 
look at the sculpting quality the paint

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:57.999 
look at the sculpting quality the paint
job<00:06:54.090> um<00:06:55.009> and<00:06:56.009> especially<00:06:56.969> I<00:06:57.240> look<00:06:57.509> at<00:06:57.659> the

00:06:57.999 --> 00:06:58.009 
job um and especially I look at the

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:00.320 
job um and especially I look at the
likeness<00:06:59.009> the<00:06:59.400> character<00:06:59.820> and<00:06:59.849> the<00:06:59.940> anime<00:07:00.300> or

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
likeness the character and the anime or

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.390 
likeness the character and the anime or
manga<00:07:00.650> because<00:07:01.650> if<00:07:01.800> it<00:07:01.919> doesn't<00:07:02.070> look<00:07:02.340> like

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
manga because if it doesn't look like

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.310 
manga because if it doesn't look like
the<00:07:02.669> character<00:07:03.060> that<00:07:03.300> you<00:07:03.330> like<00:07:03.659> I<00:07:03.870> don't<00:07:04.199> know

the character that you like I don't know

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.080 
the character that you like I don't know
why<00:07:04.500> it<00:07:04.560> won't<00:07:04.800> again<00:07:05.009> unless<00:07:05.430> of<00:07:05.610> course<00:07:05.639> um

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
why it won't again unless of course um

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.730 
why it won't again unless of course um
