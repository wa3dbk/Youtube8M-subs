method<00:00:43.559> i<00:00:44.070> will<00:00:44.610> use<00:00:44.730> flash<00:00:44.969> 360<00:00:45.539> because<00:00:45.750> its

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
method i will use flash 360 because its

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.500 
method i will use flash 360 because its

you<00:01:23.640> will<00:01:23.820> end<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.210> having<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.810> resole<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.530> all

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
you will end up having to resole to all

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.410 
you will end up having to resole to all
those<00:01:25.799> lpt<00:01:26.340> connections<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.210> don't

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
those lpt connections if you don't

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.420 
those lpt connections if you don't
already<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.990> connector<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.650> there<00:01:28.860> which

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
already have a connector in there which

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.390 
already have a connector in there which
is<00:01:29.640> really<00:01:29.939> not<00:01:30.390> very<00:01:30.420> much<00:01:30.869> fun<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.740> try

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
is really not very much fun is it so try

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.310 
is really not very much fun is it so try
to<00:01:32.430> bear<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.060> mind<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.810> method<00:01:34.140> for

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
to bear that in mind the method for

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.260 
to bear that in mind the method for

part of the follow-up series now the
method<00:01:40.950> behind<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.670> extremely<00:01:42.240> simple

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
method behind this is extremely simple

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.630 
method behind this is extremely simple
and<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.140> some<00:01:43.560> what's<00:01:43.740> basis<00:01:44.159> whether<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.460> would

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
and I some what's basis whether I would

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.730 
and I some what's basis whether I would
actually<00:01:45.030> create<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.750> video<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.710> thought

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
actually create this video but I thought

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.980 
actually create this video but I thought
what<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> heck<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.549> only<00:01:47.850> two<00:01:48.600> minutes<00:01:48.750> or

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
what the heck is only two minutes or

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.780 
what the heck is only two minutes or
three<00:01:49.229> minutes<00:01:49.259> long<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.159> they<00:01:50.520> really

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
three minutes long and and they really

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.330 
three minutes long and and they really
owe<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.939> guys<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.299> new<00:01:51.479> jtag<00:01:51.990> video<00:01:52.380> aside<00:01:53.100> from

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
my DVD key or cpu key because they are

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.400 
my DVD key or cpu key because they are
absolutely<00:02:31.680> no<00:02:32.100> use<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.750> let's<00:02:33.930> go<00:02:34.170> and

absolutely no use to you so let's go and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.840 
absolutely no use to you so let's go and
copy<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.190> cpu<00:02:35.640> key<00:02:35.880> first<00:02:36.530> copy<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.980> then<00:02:38.730> we

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
copy the cpu key first copy and then we

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.790 
copy the cpu key first copy and then we
will<00:02:38.970> download<00:02:39.209> our<00:02:39.510> own<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.900> which<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.440> right

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
will download our own and which is right

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.110 
will download our own and which is right
here<00:02:42.140> very<00:02:43.140> good<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.590> we<00:02:44.130> can<00:02:44.250> close<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.730> now

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
here very good and we can close that now

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.360 
here very good and we can close that now
if<00:02:45.930> only<00:02:46.050> my<00:02:46.350> internet<00:02:46.800> connection<00:02:46.890> really

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
if only my internet connection really

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.270 
if only my internet connection really
downloaded<00:02:47.940> stuff<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.300> quickly<00:02:48.769> so<00:02:49.769> let's

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
downloaded stuff that quickly so let's

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.090 
downloaded stuff that quickly so let's
go<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.760> find<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.660> file<00:02:51.900> drag<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.799> drop<00:02:52.920> it

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
we'll go and grab our flash TMP here and

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.080 
we'll go and grab our flash TMP here and
place<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.319> inside<00:03:07.500> our<00:03:07.950> easy<00:03:08.280> free<00:03:08.580> put<00:03:08.760> folder
