00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
much like the anchor eyes pre-event like

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.130 
much like the anchor eyes pre-event like
we're<00:02:02.700> gonna<00:02:02.790> try<00:02:03.210> build<00:02:03.509> up<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.719> garrison

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
and ask for daily since we build up this

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.249 
and ask for daily since we build up this
giant<00:02:08.759> garrison<00:02:09.179> which<00:02:09.420> abyss<00:02:09.780> would<00:02:09.989> become

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
giant garrison which abyss would become

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.220 
giant garrison which abyss would become
our<00:02:10.379> towns<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.250> cities<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.140> we

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
our towns and cities is like so that we

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.740 
our towns and cities is like so that we
do<00:02:13.379> really

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
do really

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.120 
do really
early<00:02:13.990> on<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.890> we're<00:02:15.220> not<00:02:15.310> sure<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:16.120> terms<00:02:16.480> of

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
early on and we're not sure in terms of

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.030 
early on and we're not sure in terms of
who<00:02:18.130> our<00:02:18.310> enemies<00:02:18.730> going<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:18.970> be<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:20.040> no

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
who our enemies going to be and no

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.890 
who our enemies going to be and no
probably<00:02:21.790> cuz<00:02:21.910> we<00:02:22.000> got<00:02:22.090> back<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:22.270> time<00:02:22.570> I

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
probably cuz we got back a time I

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.490 
probably cuz we got back a time I
characters<00:02:23.410> ignore<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:24.340> past<00:02:24.640> quite<00:02:25.060> well

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
characters ignore the past quite well

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.560 
characters ignore the past quite well
predominantly<00:02:26.500> probably<00:02:26.860> thrall<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:28.270> fun

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
predominantly probably thrall and so fun

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.930 
predominantly probably thrall and so fun
maybe<00:02:28.780> for<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.500> side<00:02:30.160> of<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.310> Ox<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:30.760> there's

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
maybe for that side of the Ox so there's

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.970 
maybe for that side of the Ox so there's
next<00:02:31.120> look<00:02:31.510> at<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.900> duel<00:02:32.290> then<00:02:32.500> cooled<00:02:32.800> down

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
next look at the duel then cooled down

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
we've seen in the trailer and you should

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.820 
we've seen in the trailer and you should
know<00:02:43.750> from<00:02:44.020> law<00:02:44.290> if<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.620> don't<00:02:44.950> spoilers<00:02:46.830> but

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
know from law if you don't spoilers but

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.199 
know from law if you don't spoilers but
yeah<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.130> looks<00:02:48.400> like<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.790> could<00:02:48.820> share

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
yeah this looks like it could share

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.320 
yeah this looks like it could share
about<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.480> be<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.630> career<00:02:50.200> expansion

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
about to be a career expansion

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.370 
about to be a career expansion
specifically<00:02:52.330> because<00:02:52.450> we're<00:02:52.690> going<00:02:52.900> we're

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
specifically because we're going we're

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.780 
specifically because we're going we're
bringing<00:02:53.680> back<00:02:53.709> some<00:02:54.040> characters<00:02:54.520> that<00:02:54.610> we'd

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
bringing back some characters that we'd

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.670 
bringing back some characters that we'd
previously<00:02:55.150> seen<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:56.110> we'll<00:02:56.230> be<00:02:56.350> seeing<00:02:56.560> them

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
previously seen and we'll be seeing them

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.860 
previously seen and we'll be seeing them
again<00:02:56.770> I<00:02:57.250> think<00:02:58.090> it's<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.209> really<00:02:58.390> good<00:02:58.510> move

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
again I think it's a really good move

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.990 
again I think it's a really good move
and<00:02:59.760> if<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:01.030> also<00:03:01.300> watched<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.350> stream

improvements<00:03:43.500> should<00:03:44.500> be<00:03:44.590> good<00:03:44.769> basically

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
improvements should be good basically

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.660 
improvements should be good basically
going<00:03:47.079> back<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:47.530> run<00:03:47.680> off<00:03:47.860> which<00:03:48.640> is

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
going back to to run off which is

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.030 
going back to to run off which is
basically<00:03:49.209> outland<00:03:49.750> before<00:03:50.350> I<00:03:50.380> was<00:03:50.500> destroyed
