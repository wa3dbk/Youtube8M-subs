00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.259 
because unfortunately and I do
understand<00:03:28.160> er<00:03:28.250> line<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.519> word<00:03:28.670> underlying

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
like this and it is wrong and so I think

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.920 
like this and it is wrong and so I think
it's<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.160> true<00:03:37.549> reflection<00:03:37.910> of<00:03:38.269> society

I don't know about that lady nah I think
it<00:03:44.569> totally<00:03:44.750> romanticizes<00:03:45.709> it<00:03:45.769> when<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.430> end

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
it totally romanticizes it when the end

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.550 
it totally romanticizes it when the end
