00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.870
 crafts in this video I want 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.530
 teach you how to make this brush holder 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.720
 with recycled bottles very easy we go 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.789
 to use a plastic bottle 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:24.779
 recycled blue and white acrylic vinyl 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:27.929
 cutter a scissors the brushes and for 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.579
 last a rod how to make holes to 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.120
 this bottle I have already made a brand 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:35.070
 cam going down to this point which of 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.390
 this side what we are going to do is 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.390
 cut it with the cutter and the scissors 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.110
 ah 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.410
 and once it's cropped, let's go to 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.190
 bend down 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.030
 this part 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.030
 we speak well 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.820
 and then with the scissors we are going to cut 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:17.820
 leaving about 2 centimeters or more 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.820
 outstanding 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.350
 later we will take the white paint the 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.950
 we are going to paint all completely by the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.950
 The outside part 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.080
 and once it's dry 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.080
 with blue paint 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:48.350
 let's combine a little with that white 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.350
 so that we look much better 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.920
 and then once we s with 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.740
 Hot rod open three holes in 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.840
 this part 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.840
 where will we go to place the brightness 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.130
 of this world we are going to expand the a 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.130
 little bit 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.300
 i 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.670
 and then it's on top 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:24.550
 we will make a hole this side another by 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.550
 here to have from where to hang 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.750
 and finally we would be like that 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.420
 can see below in the picture 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.210
 They have the brushes and the cream pot 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.830
 It's very easy to do I hope you like it
