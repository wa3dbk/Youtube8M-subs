hey people my Clips here on YouTube are

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.360 
hey people my Clips here on YouTube are
regarding<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.170> ongoing<00:00:04.650> debate<00:00:04.799> is<00:00:05.220> an

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
regarding the ongoing debate is an

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.160 
regarding the ongoing debate is an
online<00:00:05.670> poker<00:00:05.910> rigged<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.390> controlled<00:00:06.810> in<00:00:06.990> any

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
online poker rigged a controlled in any

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.549 
online poker rigged a controlled in any
way<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.940> this<00:00:08.940> is<00:00:09.000> my<00:00:09.269> second<00:00:09.660> clip<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.290> my

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
way and this is my second clip and in my

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.530 
way and this is my second clip and in my
first<00:00:10.830> clip<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.250> strongly<00:00:11.610> suggest<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.480> is

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
first clip I strongly suggest that it is

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.480 
first clip I strongly suggest that it is
controlled<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.320> one<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.040> reasons<00:00:14.400> I

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
controlled and one of the reasons I

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.680 
controlled and one of the reasons I
believe<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.179> because<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.540> the

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
believe that is because of the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.390 
believe that is because of the
consistencies<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.560> find<00:00:16.830> when<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.010> play<00:00:17.279> on

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
consistencies I find when I play on

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.650 
consistencies I find when I play on
PokerStars<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.150> one<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.570> those

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
PokerStars and one of those

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.990 
PokerStars and one of those
consistencies<00:00:19.529> are<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.550> chip<00:00:20.789> leader

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
consistencies are the chip leader

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.840 
consistencies are the chip leader
advantage<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.560> what<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.640> chip

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
advantage and what that is is the chip

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.670 
advantage and what that is is the chip
leader<00:00:24.060> clearly<00:00:24.539> has<00:00:24.720> an<00:00:24.930> advantage<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.529> his

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
leader clearly has an advantage on his

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.189 
leader clearly has an advantage on his
tables<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:27.060> my<00:00:27.240> first<00:00:27.480> clip<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.810> brought<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.170> a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
tables in my first clip I brought you a

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.960 
tables in my first clip I brought you a
small<00:00:28.380> sample<00:00:28.769> I'm<00:00:29.070> about<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.519> do<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> same

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
small sample I'm about to do the same

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.700 
small sample I'm about to do the same
here<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.570> before<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.900> do<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.170> people<00:00:31.500> I'd

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
here but before I do that people I'd

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.560 
here but before I do that people I'd
like<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:32.009> remind<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.460> one<00:00:32.700> thing<00:00:32.940> if<00:00:33.239> you're

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
deck and a random deal from that

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.380 
deck and a random deal from that
shuffled<00:00:38.100> deck<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.579> will<00:00:38.730> not<00:00:38.879> find<00:00:39.120> any

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
shuffled deck you will not find any

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.569 
shuffled deck you will not find any
consistencies<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.440> will<00:00:40.559> find<00:00:40.800> similarities

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
consistencies you will find similarities

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.209 
consistencies you will find similarities
maybe<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.210> not<00:00:42.329> consistencies<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.950> chip

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
maybe but not consistencies the chip

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.979 
maybe but not consistencies the chip
leader<00:00:44.460> advantage<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.450> one<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.870> many

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
leader advantage is just one of many

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.160 
leader advantage is just one of many

to<00:01:09.570> fold<00:01:09.840> out<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.049> his<00:01:10.290> hand<00:01:10.500> unfortunately<00:01:11.130> it

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
to fold out of his hand unfortunately it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.760 
to fold out of his hand unfortunately it
doesn't<00:01:11.850> work<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.150> way<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.900> he<00:01:13.080> calls<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.590> but

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
doesn't work that way so he calls in but

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.440 
doesn't work that way so he calls in but
look<00:01:13.890> at<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.100> flop<00:01:14.369> people<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:15.060> set<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
and once I seen a 907 I knew I knew one

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.730 
and once I seen a 907 I knew I knew one
of<00:01:31.530> them<00:01:31.619> were<00:01:31.740> holding<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.189> tenth<00:01:33.380> once<00:01:34.380> again

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the chip leader manages to pull out the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.649 
the chip leader manages to pull out the
winning<00:01:37.770> hand<00:01:38.040> okay<00:01:38.549> although<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.390> time

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
winning hand okay although this time

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.630 
winning hand okay although this time
he's<00:01:39.930> not<00:01:40.079> alone<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.619> his<00:01:40.740> hand<00:01:40.979> he<00:01:41.189> does<00:01:41.369> split

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
he's not alone in his hand he does split

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.060 
he's not alone in his hand he does split
the<00:01:41.729> pot<00:01:41.939> with<00:01:42.150> these<00:01:42.299> uh<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:43.649> other<00:01:43.799> player

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the pot with these uh the other player

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.740 
the pot with these uh the other player
here<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.490> I'm<00:01:44.970> bounced<00:01:45.390> out<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.509> this

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
here and I'm bounced out of this

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.920 
here and I'm bounced out of this
tournament<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:47.460> another<00:01:47.880> small<00:01:48.270> example

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
tournament so just another small example

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.870 
tournament so just another small example
that<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.170> chip<00:01:49.320> leader<00:01:49.560> advantage<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.490> one

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
that is chip leader advantage just one

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.670 
that is chip leader advantage just one
of<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> many<00:01:51.299> consistencies<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.229> find<00:01:52.500> on

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
of the many consistencies I find on

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.039 
of the many consistencies I find on
stars<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.310> people<00:01:53.880> once<00:01:54.210> again<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.020> have

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
stars and people once again if you have

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.139 
stars and people once again if you have
consistency<00:01:56.009> as<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.310> will<00:01:56.579> not<00:01:56.850> have

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
consistency as you will not have

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.929 
consistency as you will not have
randomness<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.020> until<00:01:59.009> next<00:01:59.130> time<00:01:59.310> take<00:01:59.700> care

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
randomness so until next time take care

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.450 
randomness so until next time take care
bye<00:02:00.329> bye
