00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
cut it down the seams to make it one

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.930 
cut it down the seams to make it one
long<00:02:29.379> sheet<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:29.890> then<00:02:30.370> cut<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.640> little<00:02:30.819> hole

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
long sheet and then cut a little hole

long sheet and then cut a little hole
right<00:02:31.659> in<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.840> center<00:02:32.110> of<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.290> garbage<00:02:32.590> bag

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
right in the center of the garbage bag

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.369 
right in the center of the garbage bag
I'm<00:02:33.640> gonna<00:02:33.730> put<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:34.060> over<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.480> wheel<00:02:34.659> and<00:02:34.959> then

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
I'm gonna put it over the wheel and then

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.089 
I'm gonna put it over the wheel and then
pull<00:02:36.069> open<00:02:36.609> that<00:02:37.000> hole<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:37.709> you're<00:02:38.709> going<00:02:38.950> to

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
pull open that hole and you're going to

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.569 
pull open that hole and you're going to
use<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.400> tape<00:02:39.640> again<00:02:40.269> just<00:02:40.599> to<00:02:40.780> go<00:02:40.930> around

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
use that tape again just to go around

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:49.430 
use that tape again just to go around
the<00:02:42.579> bowtie<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.239> you've<00:02:43.359> already<00:02:43.599> taped<00:02:44.500> off

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
pretty much just let it dry for maybe a

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.260 
pretty much just let it dry for maybe a
half<00:04:45.319> an<00:04:45.560> hour<00:04:45.680> so<00:04:46.069> should<00:04:46.430> be<00:04:46.819> more<00:04:47.120> than

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
half an hour so should be more than

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.900 
half an hour so should be more than
enough<00:04:47.440> again<00:04:48.440> a<00:04:48.470> very<00:04:48.770> simple<00:04:49.280> thing<00:04:49.610> to<00:04:49.669> do

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
just a little bit of taping I think it

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.650 
just a little bit of taping I think it
does<00:04:53.569> add<00:04:53.780> a<00:04:53.810> nice<00:04:54.319> little<00:04:54.349> touch<00:04:54.889> to<00:04:54.919> it<00:04:55.190> and

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
does add a nice little touch to it and

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.290 
does add a nice little touch to it and
extremely<00:04:56.660> cheap<00:04:56.930> and<00:04:57.139> very<00:04:57.560> easy<00:04:57.710> to<00:04:58.069> do
