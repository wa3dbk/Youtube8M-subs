there's<00:00:39.239> two<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.540> them<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:39.780> there's<00:00:39.899> under

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
there's two of them so there's under

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.200 
there's two of them so there's under
sixty<00:00:40.440> watts<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:40.890> these<00:00:41.010> chips<00:00:41.309> there's

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
sixty watts for these chips there's

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.299 
sixty watts for these chips there's
chips<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.629> write<00:00:42.750> 130<00:00:43.320> watts<00:00:43.530> or<00:00:43.800> something

then<00:00:44.460> write<00:00:44.610> how<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.850> run<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.930> 40<00:00:46.289> Watts<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.620> lot

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
then write how to run it 40 Watts a lot

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.380 
then write how to run it 40 Watts a lot
lower<00:00:47.010> power<00:00:47.460> consumption<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.120> those<00:00:48.270> are

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
lower power consumption and those are

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.459 
lower power consumption and those are
way<00:00:48.660> more<00:00:48.690> expensive<00:00:50.239> but<00:00:51.239> again<00:00:51.600> because<00:00:52.110> I

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
way more expensive but again because I

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.959 
way more expensive but again because I
got<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.980> motherboard<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.760> only

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
learned my lesson our way back a couple

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.719 
learned my lesson our way back a couple
years<00:01:15.900> back<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.500> college<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.130> learned<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> chip

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
years back in college I learned the chip

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.890 
years back in college I learned the chip
but<00:01:18.000> not<00:01:18.150> put<00:01:18.330> enough

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
but not put enough

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.870 
but not put enough
I'm<00:01:19.619> also<00:01:19.799> make<00:01:20.130> sure<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.340> only<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
I'm also make sure that only a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.330 
I'm also make sure that only a

those<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.400> may<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.580> screwed<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.509> definitely

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
those you may be screwed so definitely

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.980 
those you may be screwed so definitely
be<00:01:28.619> careful<00:01:28.650> with<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.420> then<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.720> next

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
be careful with that then the next

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.460 
be careful with that then the next

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.760 
money board for something like this I
just<00:02:02.640> take<00:02:03.150> $800<00:02:04.050> right<00:02:04.230> there

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
just take $800 right there

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.400 
just take $800 right there
from<00:02:05.220> going<00:02:05.550> to<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.760> next<00:02:05.790> level<00:02:06.240> up<00:02:06.900> on<00:02:07.260> the

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
from going to the next level up on the

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.290 
from going to the next level up on the
trip<00:02:07.650> speed<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.550> we're<00:02:08.880> going<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.060> be<00:02:09.270> a

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
trip speed and we're going to be a

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.609 
trip speed and we're going to be a
little<00:02:09.540> bit<00:02:09.690> clogged<00:02:09.929> these<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> lot<00:02:10.290> more<00:02:10.530> than

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
little bit clogged these a lot more than

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.680 
little bit clogged these a lot more than
that<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.220> know<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.790> big<00:02:12.240> money<00:02:12.360> saver

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
that so you know it's a big money saver

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.370 
that so you know it's a big money saver
definitely<00:02:13.290> planning<00:02:13.590> for<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.770> future<00:02:13.800> here

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
definitely planning for the future here

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.620 
definitely planning for the future here
so<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.800> already<00:02:17.640> mentioned<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.090> thermal<00:02:18.450> paste

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
so I already mentioned the thermal paste

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.440 
so I already mentioned the thermal paste
and<00:02:19.290> also<00:02:19.920> make<00:02:20.070> sure<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.490> choose<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
and also make sure that you choose the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.420 
and also make sure that you choose the
right<00:02:21.630> cooling<00:02:22.230> we're<00:02:22.740> going<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.070> using

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
right cooling we're going to be using

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.490 
right cooling we're going to be using
water<00:02:23.610> cooling<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.990> what<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.470> very

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
water cooling and so what is very

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.590 
water cooling and so what is very
quickly<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.130> water<00:02:26.250> blocks<00:02:26.580> we<00:02:26.790> got<00:02:27.000> make

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
quickly the water blocks we got make

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.440 
quickly the water blocks we got make
sure<00:02:27.630> they're<00:02:27.840> specific<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.470> LGA<00:02:29.010> 1366<00:02:29.760> or

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
sure they're specific to LGA 1366 or

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.840 
sure they're specific to LGA 1366 or
whatever<00:02:30.750> form<00:02:31.500> factors<00:02:31.770> are<00:02:31.830> using<00:02:32.340> if

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
whatever form factors are using if

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.760 
whatever form factors are using if
you're<00:02:33.000> using<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.390> heatsink<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.200> fan<00:02:34.440> make

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
you're using the heatsink and a fan make

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.010 
you're using the heatsink and a fan make
sure<00:02:34.800> that's<00:02:35.070> correctly<00:02:35.610> chosen<00:02:35.850> as<00:02:36.150> well<00:02:36.360> and

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
sure that's correctly chosen as well and

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.750 
sure that's correctly chosen as well and
if<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.770> have<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.010> get<00:02:38.160> separate<00:02:38.520> brackets

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
if you have to get separate brackets

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.670 
if you have to get separate brackets
they<00:02:39.300> don't<00:02:39.480> come<00:02:39.630> for<00:02:39.780> example<00:02:39.900> another<00:02:40.380> blog

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
they don't come for example another blog

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
you know hopefully good light will make

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.790 
you know hopefully good light will make
this<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.660> be<00:02:48.750> mistake<00:02:49.140> but<00:02:49.350> make<00:02:49.500> sure<00:02:49.530> your

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
this to be mistake but make sure your

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.860 
this to be mistake but make sure your
motherboard<00:02:50.100> supports<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.240> chip<00:02:51.450> as<00:02:51.600> you<00:02:51.690> got

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
other boards are more specific and you

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.500 
other boards are more specific and you
have<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.160> go<00:03:08.280> on<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.459> website<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:08.910> check<00:03:09.150> out

alright guys just a little quick we're
putting<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.050> chips<00:03:28.260> on<00:03:28.440> where<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.650> got<00:03:28.800> one

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
putting the chips on where you got one

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.210 
putting the chips on where you got one
in<00:03:29.130> there<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:30.410> we're<00:03:31.410> putting<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.709> second<00:03:32.130> one

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
in there and we're putting a second one

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.580 
in there and we're putting a second one
in<00:03:32.390> and<00:03:33.390> just<00:03:33.690> if<00:03:33.930> you're<00:03:34.140> actually<00:03:34.380> using

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
in and just if you're actually using

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.080 
in and just if you're actually using
this<00:03:34.830> exact<00:03:35.190> same<00:03:35.340> configuration<00:03:35.580> of

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
this exact same configuration of

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.940 
this exact same configuration of
something<00:03:36.390> similar<00:03:36.630> when<00:03:37.470> you're<00:03:37.560> clad<00:03:37.799> the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
something similar when you're clad the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.890 
something similar when you're clad the
chip<00:03:38.220> down<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.790> makes<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.120> little<00:03:39.209> noise<00:03:39.360> like

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
chip down it makes a little noise like

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.110 
chip down it makes a little noise like
it's<00:03:40.080> been<00:03:40.170> pressing<00:03:40.590> down<00:03:40.769> each<00:03:40.980> other<00:03:41.190> don't

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
it's been pressing down each other don't

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.330 
it's been pressing down each other don't
freak<00:03:42.450> out<00:03:42.630> it's<00:03:43.110> supposed<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.500> kind<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.920> you

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
freak out it's supposed to kind of you

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.280 
freak out it's supposed to kind of you
know<00:03:44.370> push<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.030> into<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.480> maintenance<00:03:45.959> well

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
know push it into the maintenance well

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.870 
know push it into the maintenance well
the<00:03:46.380> context<00:03:46.830> of<00:03:46.950> connecting<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.549> can<00:03:47.730> only

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
the context of connecting you can only

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.100 
the context of connecting you can only
process<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.360> power<00:03:48.570> out<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.720> it

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
process the power out of it

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.080 
process the power out of it
so<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.709> only<00:03:49.980> mention<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.400> they're<00:03:50.670> both<00:03:50.820> in

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
so the only mention that they're both in

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.640 
so the only mention that they're both in
we're<00:03:51.480> good<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.750> go

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
we're good to go

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.509 
we're good to go
step<00:03:53.569> so<00:03:54.569> in<00:03:54.930> terms<00:03:55.170> of<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.290> chip<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:56.220> put<00:03:56.489> a

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
step so in terms of the chip you put a

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.569 
step so in terms of the chip you put a
thermal<00:03:57.090> paste<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:58.590> cover<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.129> whole<00:03:59.280> thing

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
thermal paste to cover the whole thing

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.220 
thermal paste to cover the whole thing
but<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.790> don't<00:03:59.849> want<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.180> cover<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.200> whole

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
but you don't want to cover the whole

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.990 
but you don't want to cover the whole
thing<00:04:01.349> too<00:04:01.799> much<00:04:01.980> because<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.790> got<00:04:02.939> to

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
thing too much because you got to

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.670 
thing too much because you got to
remember<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.329> the<00:04:03.629> copper<00:04:04.140> heats<00:04:04.319> is<00:04:04.470> going

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
remember that the copper heats is going

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.130 
remember that the copper heats is going
to<00:04:04.769> smash<00:04:05.640> down<00:04:05.670> on<00:04:05.970> it<00:04:06.269> basically<00:04:06.599> supporting

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
to smash down on it basically supporting

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.349 
to smash down on it basically supporting
the<00:04:07.260> thermo<00:04:07.470> caves<00:04:07.769> and<00:04:08.010> even<00:04:08.879> it<00:04:08.970> out<00:04:09.060> so<00:04:09.269> this

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
the thermo caves and even it out so this

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.960 
the thermo caves and even it out so this
is<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:09.540> good<00:04:09.750> amount<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:10.140> would<00:04:10.319> say<00:04:10.670> also<00:04:11.670> taken

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
is a good amount I would say also taken

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.910 
is a good amount I would say also taken
out<00:04:12.090> of<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.299> and<00:04:12.569> then<00:04:12.720> we're<00:04:13.620> gonna<00:04:13.739> have<00:04:13.859> to

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
out of that and then we're gonna have to

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.500 
out of that and then we're gonna have to
put<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.159> same<00:04:14.370> amount<00:04:14.400> on<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.849> other<00:04:15.030> side<00:04:15.329> as

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
put the same amount on the other side as

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.170 
put the same amount on the other side as
well<00:04:15.810> but<00:04:16.769> then<00:04:17.759> we'll<00:04:17.910> show<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.060> the

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
well but then we'll show you the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.569 
well but then we'll show you the
finished<00:04:18.600> product<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.229> water<00:04:19.979> blocks<00:04:20.250> it

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
finished product is the water blocks it

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.239 
finished product is the water blocks it
on<00:04:20.699> top<00:04:20.910> of<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.030> church
