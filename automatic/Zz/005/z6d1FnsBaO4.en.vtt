00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.910
 Valentine's Day is about love day 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.070
 that I decided to make this video to give you 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.620
 some gift ideas that can be 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.900
 do with machito is watching my video and 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.330
 he still does not know what to give his girlfriend 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.580
 Well, here are some cheap ideas 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.890
 and useful for girls who are 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.609
 watching this video and do not have a boyfriend 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.619
 they give each other the things and for the 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.109
 girls who are watching the video and who 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.659
 If they have a boyfriend then they will give 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.059
 Little things do not start with the little things anymore 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:36.789
 cheap but I loved these 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:40.239
 mirrors one I found in forever 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.680
 stone in one and the other in fine me 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.969
 let's buy them I'm always 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.710
 recording the tutorial videos of 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.109
 makeup with a white mirror that is 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.329
 horrible in my opinion to this one are 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.100
 very nice fit in the bag 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.539
 perfectly and good to make 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.449
 also makeup videos but 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.149
 that are beautiful are very face jones 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:02.469
 and this specifically has a mirror 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:04.540
 normal and the other is with increase that is 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.560
 that expands your face has very good 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.509
 quality 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.119
 let's say that the increase part is very 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.549
 useful for when we want to take the 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.140
 eyebrows or for when we analyze a 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.549
 makeup that requires a lot 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.950
 precision so here we have 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.439
 perfectly this cost me 6 dollars 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.110
 nothing more and this forever to and in one 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.000
 It is beautiful too but this one if not 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.640
 has the increase that is to say that in both 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.460
 parts is equal to the mirror and it cost me 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.520
 only two dollars as 80 cents stand 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.320
 girl and the habits after the other 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.590
 little thing that I bought that I recommend 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.500
 that are bought is the link the deficits 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.509
 in formula the matchmaker pitch that I 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.000
 they saw try for the first time in the 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.009
 videoblog that I made with iron mingot and I 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.990
 I loved it so much that I went to what 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.689
 I bought and on wall mart is where 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.789
 find less price after another 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.549
 cosmetic that I recommend that I'm 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.159
 buy is this ink for lips are 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.479
 the new inks that are colored and 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.920
 true that they are the same 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.289
 consistency the same feeling about 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.630
 lips at the same time duration 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.940
 go are identical to those of 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.590
 sant laurent the packaging of salt 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.150
 now it is not much prettier but I do not 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.430
 I care so much about packaging what 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.490
 matter of the product and in goldman the 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.550
 they find 7 where they have something seven 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.890
 and peak and there is no other little thing that 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.560
 I bought and I found them super useful 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.210
 and at the same time feixiong when I saw them 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.210
 we see what these rubber bands are 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.070
 Look how nice they look and I thought 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.410
 a fantastic idea because I always 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.390
 I walk with the rubber bands to grab my hair 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.980
 here because sometimes it 's something that 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.840
 I want to have my hair loose but after 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.330
 I get warm and I do not have to grab 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.790
 more hair then I always always go out 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.700
 with the elastic and hooked and is ugly 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.960
 and this idea seemed great to me 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.760
 because at the same time it 's a 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.860
 handle also later you can 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.630
 use to collect this hair this is 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.210
 see photo girls have them 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.850
 put in arms and then in the hair and 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.460
 I think it cost me like 4 dollars for 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.400
 there in fine other things for hair 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.910
 what I thought was spectacular is this 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.770
 I also bought it in fines and it cost me 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.660
 550 and there's nothing more or nothing less than 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.360
 a simple but the peculiarity that 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.350
 you have to bring these little things here 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.040
 kid to see if they can see it and better 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.040
 look 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.430
 and practically you wear a headband 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.310
 and then you start to roll up your hair 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.680
 and you're clutching the little things is 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.720
 that is to say that also as soon as I saw it 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.920
 I thought for makeup tutorials 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.630
 that I always have bangs on the 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.700
 medium so they can see better 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.560
 I always thinking of you 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.900
 but also for the girls that go 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.760
 to exercise or for school to 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.650
 study the park but do not fall 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.080
 eyes did not look like me what a dancer and 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.519
 very useful and also good because you can 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.610
 do these hairstyles that bring these 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.260
 girls that look at how cute they are 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.130
 blond hair look how cute was the 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.190
 hairstyle 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.230
 and here in 20 explain how to do it 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.450
 after another thing that I bought myself 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.150
 lately and I've seen him a lot 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.320
 much use in this device for 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.320
 remove facial hair
