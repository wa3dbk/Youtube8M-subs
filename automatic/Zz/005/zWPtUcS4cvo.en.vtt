00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 points thrown away tonight thank you 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 call conclusion of the evening 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.059
 certainly considering the game image 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.580
 not a to not a fantastic 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.870
 game or so you do to create 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.969
 the good options that make you 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.240
 actually this match should have 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.710
 to win 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.600
 I have most of the water 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.090
 have control over you create 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.449
 odds but the screen takes that chance off 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.789
 to make 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.130
 who was not there tonight, but from 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.500
 those options are more difficult than one 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.660
 coma and you better team it up in the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.000
 skin match as the audience force and 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.590
 he can I fall wrong and give 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.920
 her hand is wrong and that's it then 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.960
 the one a certain they always had the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.760
 box and and god alone bit too much time 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.070
 and the no yes yes yes here have richard 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.520
 and after I give them shortfall still can 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.370
 they nice view without jos sum that 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.079
 clear play by god in the fore 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.050
 decentralized films did not lie 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.180
 but you wanted to see things from him 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.129
 You can listen to everyone normally 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.549
 can also better sangha mail 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.080
 and district was not dissatisfied today 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.420
 it might also be the easy ones 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.490
 we had a lot of possession 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.990
 ahead 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.299
 you hardly gave anything away until 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.430
 just before rest and yes indeed every now and then 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.170
 I think we think we are good cause earth 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.369
 have to do by going through that second 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.049
 and then I think this is one 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.659
 match becomes the one that you find easy 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.060
 plays in the scoring may incur the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.310
 three and four now and finally it says 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.320
 now one on the scoreboard and there are 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.520
 defending two lost points 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.439
 defense mother whole 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.310
 stay focused stay 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.259
 play and 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.720
 but even then she told me the central 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.540
 get defender out get 200% off 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.670
 kill opportunities and effort 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.710
 and that happens by not yes and then 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.159
 what happens what happens what happens often 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.039
 kicking his me is it foolish 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.630
 awkward unnecessary point loss 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.289
 With all due respect from this you just 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.759
 should you not win a co2 point away 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.060
 exactly if you couldn't even do a duke 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.229
 bring like last week the get the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.240
 can leave you points while 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.280
 totally unnecessary 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.750
 where is that in that sharpness that 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.730
 compared to last week 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.230
 simple how about that is that in the team 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.170
 then you have to ask those players who 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.610
 get that chance now that they try 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.190
 I do consciously that is also clear 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.489
 now do whatever they want go ahead 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.920
 score but it is not what what what in 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.569
 there is no in the team because that is what we do with them 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.569
 chose to make in Netherlands so that is 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.849
 normally they go one and yes it has 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.010
 also with concentration screen then 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.459
 wanting to make it cost 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.670
 yes what is that quality do you want 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.670
 also ask yourself 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.350
 I do not want to ask so I am so crazy 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.840
 think everyone wants to score a goal 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.250
 but very good 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.920
 today it was often the wrong one 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.250
 make choices for causing an attack 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.780
 just doesn't end well and you can 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.670
 suffers from sharpness but I think we 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.350
 not not not on purpose not calling there 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.120
 don't just bite the teeth 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.680
 maybe that is just a bit too often 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.680
 your competition doesn't win there
