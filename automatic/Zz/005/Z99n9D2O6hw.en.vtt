00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
passengers and here comes the next one

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.680

already<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:12.410> this<00:03:13.410> one<00:03:13.620> has<00:03:13.799> step<00:03:14.040> coming<00:03:14.310> out

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.300 

which<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:18.870> looking<00:03:19.230> more<00:03:19.380> like<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.590> contrail

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
which is looking more like a contrail

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.380 
which is looking more like a contrail
but<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.830> plane<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.370> just<00:03:23.640> recorded<00:03:24.060> during

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
but to the plane I just recorded during

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.540 
but to the plane I just recorded during
this<00:03:24.510> time<00:03:24.750> didn't<00:03:25.050> have<00:03:25.350> anything<00:03:26.190> coming

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
this time didn't have anything coming

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.000 
this time didn't have anything coming
out<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.180> look<00:03:27.360> like<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.570> contrail<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:28.770> that

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
out that look like a contrail so that

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.060 
out that look like a contrail so that
right<00:03:29.310> there<00:03:29.960> indicates<00:03:30.960> that<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.710> is<00:03:31.740> not

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
right there indicates that it is not

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.460 
right there indicates that it is not
cold<00:03:32.550> enough<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:33.960> it<00:03:34.110> is<00:03:34.260> not

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
cold enough that is that it is not

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.460 
cold enough that is that it is not
freezing<00:03:34.890> temperatures<00:03:35.700> for<00:03:36.540> their<00:03:36.930> exhaust

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
freezing temperatures for their exhaust

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.830 
freezing temperatures for their exhaust
to<00:03:37.620> freeze<00:03:37.920> up<00:03:37.950> because<00:03:38.850> two<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.120> these<00:03:39.540> four

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
to freeze up because two of these four

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.230 
to freeze up because two of these four
planes<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.590> came<00:03:41.250> only<00:03:41.520> during<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:41.970> time

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
planes that came only during the time

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.920 
planes that came only during the time
since<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.600> started<00:03:42.900> reporting<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:44.040> not<00:03:44.340> have

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
since I started reporting to not have

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.770 
since I started reporting to not have
consoles<00:03:45.930> coming<00:03:46.350> out<00:03:46.470> of<00:03:46.500> them<00:03:50.330> and<00:03:51.330> I<00:03:51.540> judge

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
consoles coming out of them and I judge

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.050 
consoles coming out of them and I judge
kept<00:03:52.080> his<00:03:52.230> camera<00:03:52.560> around<00:03:52.710> because<00:03:53.190> because

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
kept his camera around because because

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.060 
kept his camera around because because
so<00:03:54.210> many<00:03:54.330> low-flying<00:03:54.870> military<00:03:55.380> planes<00:03:55.710> and

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
so many low-flying military planes and

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.280 
so many low-flying military planes and
one<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.400> them<00:03:56.550> just<00:03:56.730> came<00:03:56.970> at<00:03:57.210> thursday's<00:03:57.630> whoo

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
one of them just came at thursday's whoo

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.180 
one of them just came at thursday's whoo
whoo<00:03:59.270> whoo<00:04:00.270> noise<00:04:01.080> but<00:04:01.560> my<00:04:01.680> time<00:04:01.860> I<00:04:01.950> got<00:04:02.100> the
