00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.909 

so<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.420> see<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.690> cubic<00:00:07.049> hybrid<00:00:07.440> picking<00:00:07.799> is

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
so you see the cubic hybrid picking is

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.709 
so you see the cubic hybrid picking is
that<00:00:08.189> you're<00:00:08.340> taking<00:00:08.670> your<00:00:08.790> pick<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.150> you're

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
that you're taking your pick and you're

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.570 
that you're taking your pick and you're
playing<00:00:09.929> one<00:00:10.230> string<00:00:10.590> but<00:00:11.130> then<00:00:11.250> you're<00:00:11.400> using

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
playing one string but then you're using

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.030 
playing one string but then you're using
your<00:00:11.880> middle<00:00:11.969> finger<00:00:12.420> for<00:00:12.809> another<00:00:13.110> string<00:00:13.440> so

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
your middle finger for another string so

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.770 
your middle finger for another string so
in<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.250> case<00:00:14.519> as<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.880> can<00:00:14.910> see<00:00:15.240> I'm<00:00:15.450> using<00:00:15.480> my

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
in this case as you can see I'm using my

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.330 
in this case as you can see I'm using my
middle<00:00:16.020> finger<00:00:16.350> on<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.500> first<00:00:16.830> string<00:00:16.920> and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
middle finger on the first string and

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.609 
middle finger on the first string and
I'm<00:00:17.850> using<00:00:18.060> my<00:00:18.270> pick<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.960> third<00:00:19.260> string

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
I'm using my pick on the third string

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.599 
I'm using my pick on the third string
and<00:00:19.650> I'm<00:00:19.830> plucking<00:00:20.039> them<00:00:20.279> at<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.460> same<00:00:20.640> time

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
and I'm plucking them at the same time

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:23.779 
and I'm plucking them at the same time
okay

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
okay

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.670 
okay
so<00:00:24.210> just<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.510> get<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.660> bit<00:00:24.900> different<00:00:25.380> effect

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
so just to get a bit different effect

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.779 
so just to get a bit different effect
here<00:00:28.039> you<00:00:29.039> see<00:00:29.189> what<00:00:29.310> I'm<00:00:29.400> doing<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.670> I'm

here you see what I'm doing is I'm
barring<00:00:30.179> over<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> fifth<00:00:30.750> fret<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.520> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
barring over the fifth fret of the the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.920 
barring over the fifth fret of the the
first<00:00:32.910> three<00:00:33.030> strings<00:00:33.360> first<00:00:33.540> second<00:00:33.899> and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
first three strings first second and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.780 
first three strings first second and
third<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.380> wouldn't<00:00:34.980> need<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.280> second<00:00:35.610> string

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
third I wouldn't need the second string

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.459 
third I wouldn't need the second string
but<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.000> can't<00:00:36.239> really<00:00:36.480> skip<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.870> right<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.380> I'm

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
but I can't really skip it right so I'm

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.560 
but I can't really skip it right so I'm
gonna<00:00:37.559> press<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:37.980> all<00:00:38.160> three<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.520> those<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.510> I'm

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
gonna press on all three of those so I'm

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.270 
gonna press on all three of those so I'm
gonna<00:00:39.660> pluck<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.440> first<00:00:40.739> string<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
gonna pluck the first string and the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.420 
gonna pluck the first string and the
third<00:00:41.489> string<00:00:41.700> together<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.800> then<00:00:43.800> go<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
third string together and then go to the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.430 
third string together and then go to the
seventh<00:00:44.879> fret<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.210> my<00:00:45.360> third<00:00:45.539> finger<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
seventh fret with my third finger of the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.069 
seventh fret with my third finger of the
third<00:00:46.649> string<00:00:47.000> and<00:00:48.000> then<00:00:48.600> here<00:00:48.899> what<00:00:49.020> I'm

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
third string and then here what I'm

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.270 
third string and then here what I'm
gonna<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.379> pluck<00:00:49.559> them<00:00:49.710> again<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.129> then

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
gonna do is pluck them again but then

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.889 
gonna do is pluck them again but then
I'm<00:00:50.399> gonna<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> series<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.120> hammer-ons<00:00:51.750> and

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
I'm gonna do a series of hammer-ons and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.650 
I'm gonna do a series of hammer-ons and
pull-offs<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.640> right<00:00:56.789> there<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.030> let<00:00:57.480> that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
pull-offs so right there I let that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:06.510 
pull-offs so right there I let that
first<00:00:57.930> string<00:00:58.230> ring<00:00:58.440> out

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.980 

okay<00:01:07.520> so<00:01:07.909> if<00:01:08.000> I<00:01:08.090> take<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.450> first<00:01:08.630> string<00:01:08.899> out

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
okay so if I take the first string out

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.050 
okay so if I take the first string out
of<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:09.110> equation<00:01:09.649> it<00:01:09.740> sounds<00:01:10.009> like<00:01:10.130> this<00:01:13.030> so<00:01:14.030> I

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
of the equation it sounds like this so I

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.779 
of the equation it sounds like this so I
pick<00:01:14.479> pick<00:01:15.640> hammer-on<00:01:16.640> pull-off<00:01:18.729> using<00:01:19.729> the

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
pick pick hammer-on pull-off using the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.870 
pick pick hammer-on pull-off using the
Blues<00:01:20.000> note<00:01:20.210> there

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
Blues note there

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.149 
Blues note there
and<00:01:22.330> then<00:01:22.479> go<00:01:22.689> to<00:01:22.750> my<00:01:22.930> road<00:01:23.439> my<00:01:23.619> seventh<00:01:23.979> fret

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
and then go to my road my seventh fret

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.490 
and then go to my road my seventh fret
fourth<00:01:24.460> string<00:01:24.570> maybe<00:01:25.570> had<00:01:25.810> some<00:01:25.990> vibrato<00:01:26.229> on

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
fourth string maybe had some vibrato on

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.560 
fourth string maybe had some vibrato on
there<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:26.890> so<00:01:27.610> all<00:01:27.700> I'm<00:01:27.820> doing<00:01:27.880> right<00:01:28.150> here<00:01:28.299> is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
there and so all I'm doing right here is

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.270 
there and so all I'm doing right here is
I'm<00:01:28.720> adding<00:01:29.049> on<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.290> first<00:01:29.530> string<00:01:29.740> on<00:01:29.799> top<00:01:30.100> of

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
I'm adding on the first string on top of

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.690 
I'm adding on the first string on top of
that<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.920> nice<00:01:36.070> thing<00:01:36.220> about<00:01:36.280> that<00:01:36.460> too<00:01:36.670> is

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
that the nice thing about that too is

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.490 
that the nice thing about that too is
because<00:01:37.060> you're<00:01:37.180> hybrid<00:01:37.479> picking<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:38.320> can

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
because you're hybrid picking you can

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.180 
because you're hybrid picking you can
get<00:01:38.649> this<00:01:38.799> real<00:01:38.979> staccato<00:01:39.430> sound<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:42.070> know

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
get this real staccato sound you know

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.460 
get this real staccato sound you know
where<00:01:42.310> it's<00:01:42.430> not<00:01:42.549> just<00:01:42.729> ringing<00:01:42.940> out<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
where it's not just ringing out the

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.600 
where it's not just ringing out the
whole<00:01:44.649> time<00:01:44.860> because<00:01:45.009> every<00:01:45.250> time<00:01:45.369> you<00:01:45.490> go

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
whole time because every time you go

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.770 
whole time because every time you go
back<00:01:45.729> to<00:01:45.909> pick<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:47.170> can<00:01:47.350> stop<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.710> strings

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.670 

so<00:01:52.780> if<00:01:52.869> you<00:01:52.960> want<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.170> make<00:01:53.259> it<00:01:53.380> sound<00:01:53.530> a<00:01:53.649> bit

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
so if you want to make it sound a bit

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.719 
so if you want to make it sound a bit
different<00:01:53.799> from<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.280> other<00:01:54.399> things<00:01:54.640> you're

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
different from the other things you're

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:55.710 
different from the other things you're
doing<00:01:54.940> you<00:01:55.030> might<00:01:55.149> be<00:01:55.300> coming<00:01:55.569> off<00:01:55.690> a

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
doing you might be coming off a

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.910 
doing you might be coming off a
different<00:01:55.960> lick<00:01:56.289> like<00:01:56.500> one<00:01:56.679> of<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.830> ones

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
different lick like one of the ones

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:06.270 
different lick like one of the ones
we've<00:01:57.100> done<00:01:57.280> before

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.419 

okay<00:02:07.060> so<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.840> goal<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.289> make<00:02:09.280> sure<00:02:09.310> that

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
okay so the goal is make sure that

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.340 
okay so the goal is make sure that
you're<00:02:09.640> picking<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.780> third<00:02:10.990> string<00:02:11.230> with

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
you're picking the third string with

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.470 
you're picking the third string with
your<00:02:11.410> guitar<00:02:11.740> pick<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.160> you're<00:02:12.760> picking<00:02:13.060> the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
your guitar pick and you're picking the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.480 
your guitar pick and you're picking the
first<00:02:13.900> string<00:02:14.260> with<00:02:14.440> your<00:02:14.470> middle<00:02:14.620> finger

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
first string with your middle finger

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.580 
first string with your middle finger
when<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.420> do<00:02:16.540> this<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:16.959> have<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.140> tendency<00:02:17.410> of

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
when I do this I have a tendency of

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.230 
when I do this I have a tendency of
having<00:02:17.740> my<00:02:17.950> middle<00:02:18.190> finger<00:02:18.430> just<00:02:18.459> back<00:02:19.209> a

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
having my middle finger just back a

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.660 
having my middle finger just back a
little<00:02:19.600> bit<00:02:19.690> from<00:02:19.870> where<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.110> pick<00:02:20.290> should<00:02:20.500> be

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
little bit from where the pick should be

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.190 
little bit from where the pick should be
as<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:22.000> pick<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.300> heading<00:02:22.569> down<00:02:22.720> my<00:02:22.989> middle

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
as the pick is heading down my middle

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:35.100 
as the pick is heading down my middle
finger<00:02:23.410> is<00:02:23.440> heading<00:02:23.770> up<00:02:33.720> now<00:02:34.720> as<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:34.870> get<00:02:35.020> more

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
finger is heading up now as you get more

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.390 
finger is heading up now as you get more
comfortable<00:02:35.350> with<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.770> obviously<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.250> can

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
comfortable with it obviously you can

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.040 
comfortable with it obviously you can
hybrid<00:02:36.730> pick<00:02:36.910> in<00:02:37.030> different<00:02:37.300> places<00:02:37.480> too<00:02:37.840> if

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
hybrid pick in different places too if

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.590 
hybrid pick in different places too if
we<00:02:38.500> took<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:38.890> same<00:02:39.190> idea<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:42.269> maybe<00:02:43.269> moved

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
we took this same idea and maybe moved

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.330 
we took this same idea and maybe moved
it<00:02:43.750> up<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.410> right<00:02:44.620> here<00:02:44.890> we're<00:02:45.040> doing<00:02:45.160> the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
it up so right here we're doing the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.710 
it up so right here we're doing the
first<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.760> second<00:02:46.090> strings

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.660 

that<00:02:53.720> could<00:02:53.840> make<00:02:53.960> a<00:02:53.990> longer<00:02:54.320> combination<00:02:57.670> we

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
that could make a longer combination we

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.220 
that could make a longer combination we
talked<00:02:58.880> about<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.180> hybrid<00:02:59.540> idea<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.930> using

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
talked about the hybrid idea of using

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.950 
talked about the hybrid idea of using
all<00:03:00.410> of<00:03:00.440> these<00:03:00.680> notes

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.840 

so<00:03:05.960> as<00:03:06.110> I'm<00:03:06.290> exploring<00:03:06.800> these<00:03:07.220> licks<00:03:07.580> that<00:03:07.700> I'm

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
so as I'm exploring these licks that I'm

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.550 
so as I'm exploring these licks that I'm
playing<00:03:08.150> I'm<00:03:08.330> always<00:03:08.600> thinking<00:03:08.900> about<00:03:09.170> the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
playing I'm always thinking about the

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.290 
playing I'm always thinking about the
groups<00:03:10.040> of<00:03:10.190> three<00:03:10.460> notes<00:03:10.670> on<00:03:10.880> each<00:03:11.000> one<00:03:11.210> of

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
groups of three notes on each one of

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.510 
groups of three notes on each one of
these<00:03:11.390> strings<00:03:12.520> so<00:03:13.520> if<00:03:13.610> I<00:03:13.700> can<00:03:13.880> do<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:15.220> can<00:03:16.220> also

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
these strings so if I can do I can also

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.360 
these strings so if I can do I can also
do<00:03:18.430> C<00:03:20.290> so<00:03:21.290> I'm<00:03:21.380> hybrid<00:03:21.709> picking<00:03:21.860> both<00:03:22.160> those

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
do C so I'm hybrid picking both those

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.710 
do C so I'm hybrid picking both those
ideas<00:03:27.700> so<00:03:28.700> again<00:03:28.940> that's<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.240> fun<00:03:29.480> of<00:03:29.510> these

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
ideas so again that's the fun of these

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.000 
ideas so again that's the fun of these
licks<00:03:29.959> is<00:03:30.080> being<00:03:30.290> able<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:30.500> explore<00:03:30.950> different

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
licks is being able to explore different

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.750 
licks is being able to explore different
ideas<00:03:31.870> keep<00:03:32.870> reminding<00:03:33.260> yourself<00:03:33.580> that<00:03:34.580> as

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
ideas keep reminding yourself that as

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.670 
ideas keep reminding yourself that as
you<00:03:34.940> learn<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.330> lick<00:03:35.480> keep<00:03:35.989> expanding<00:03:36.380> your

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
you learn the lick keep expanding your

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.229 
you learn the lick keep expanding your
visual<00:03:37.100> knowledge<00:03:37.430> of<00:03:37.550> what<00:03:37.700> you're<00:03:37.790> doing<00:03:38.060> so

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
visual knowledge of what you're doing so

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.960 
visual knowledge of what you're doing so
you<00:03:38.270> can<00:03:38.510> keep<00:03:38.950> creating<00:03:39.950> new<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.550> unique

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
you can keep creating new and unique

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.060 
you can keep creating new and unique
ideas<00:03:41.540> with<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.870> with<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.290> licks<00:03:42.530> as<00:03:42.709> opposed

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
ideas with the with the licks as opposed

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.110 
ideas with the with the licks as opposed
to<00:03:43.130> just<00:03:43.310> playing<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.580> lick<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.820> same<00:03:44.000> way

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
to just playing the lick the same way

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.560 
to just playing the lick the same way
over<00:03:44.239> and<00:03:44.420> over<00:03:44.480> and<00:03:44.660> over<00:03:44.840> again<00:03:46.510> figure<00:03:47.510> out

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
over and over and over again figure out

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.620 
over and over and over again figure out
how<00:03:47.750> you<00:03:47.810> can<00:03:47.989> move<00:03:48.140> it<00:03:48.290> in<00:03:52.030> in<00:03:53.030> something<00:03:53.480> new

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
how you can move it in in something new

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.350 
how you can move it in in something new
and<00:03:53.870> unique<00:03:54.430> that<00:03:55.430> is<00:03:55.580> easy<00:03:55.760> for<00:03:55.970> you<00:03:56.060> to<00:03:56.090> see

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
and unique that is easy for you to see

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.240 
and unique that is easy for you to see
and<00:03:56.570> once<00:03:57.019> you<00:03:57.110> get<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.290> technique<00:03:57.440> down<00:03:58.070> of

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
and once you get the technique down of

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.510 
and once you get the technique down of
course<00:03:58.310> it's<00:03:58.610> easy<00:03:58.730> for<00:03:58.880> you<00:03:59.000> to<00:03:59.030> play<00:03:59.180> as<00:03:59.330> well
