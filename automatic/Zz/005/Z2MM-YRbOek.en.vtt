this<00:01:59.969> moderate<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.719> actually<00:02:01.079> works<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
this moderate this actually works on the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.859 
this moderate this actually works on the
server<00:02:02.159> as<00:02:02.430> well<00:02:02.460> without<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.060> server<00:02:03.509> happen

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
server as well without the server happen

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.359 
server as well without the server happen
to<00:02:03.990> have<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.140> mod<00:02:04.469> but<00:02:04.770> every<00:02:05.040> time<00:02:05.219> you

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
to have the mod but every time you

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.459 
to have the mod but every time you
rejoin<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.270> server<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.719> map<00:02:06.899> will<00:02:07.049> be<00:02:07.110> blank

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
rejoin the server the map will be blank
