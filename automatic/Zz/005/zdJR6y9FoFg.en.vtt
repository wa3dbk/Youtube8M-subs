to obviously to hide it there it's just

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.519 
to obviously to hide it there it's just
a<00:00:17.279> screen<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:18.330> has<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> suction<00:00:18.840> cup<00:00:19.230> right

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
a screen that has a suction cup right

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.630 
a screen that has a suction cup right

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
here that attaches to the screen and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.460 
here that attaches to the screen and
that's<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.910> way<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.180> secures<00:00:24.570> secures<00:00:25.320> it

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
that's the way it secures secures it

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.519 
that's the way it secures secures it
there

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
there

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.640 
there
the<00:00:28.529> problem<00:00:28.859> with<00:00:28.980> -<00:00:29.310> as<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:29.970> see<00:00:30.029> my<00:00:30.650> my

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the problem with - as you can see my my

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.459 
the problem with - as you can see my my
AppRadio<00:00:32.130> 3<00:00:32.610> if<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:33.600> perfectly<00:00:34.230> my

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
AppRadio 3 if it's perfectly my

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.060 
AppRadio 3 if it's perfectly my
dashboard<00:00:35.989> there's<00:00:36.989> no<00:00:37.170> edges<00:00:37.620> or<00:00:37.770> anything

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
dashboard there's no edges or anything

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.200 
dashboard there's no edges or anything
coming<00:00:38.280> out<00:00:38.520> right<00:00:38.969> here<00:00:39.379> so<00:00:40.399> the<00:00:41.399> suction<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
coming out right here so the suction the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.010 
coming out right here so the suction the
suction<00:00:42.600> cup<00:00:42.780> doesn't<00:00:43.379> reach<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.190> screen

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
suction cup doesn't reach the screen

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.119 
suction cup doesn't reach the screen
there's<00:00:46.020> no<00:00:46.170> way<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.530> distinction

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
there's no way this distinction

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.799 
there's no way this distinction
interfere<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.960> a<00:00:48.960> suction<00:00:49.739> cup<00:00:50.039> way<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:53.809> there

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
interfere and a suction cup way so there

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.660 
interfere and a suction cup way so there
are<00:00:54.870> some<00:00:54.989> options<00:00:55.610> where<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.670> can<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:58.670> put

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
are some options where you can just put

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.049 
are some options where you can just put
some<00:00:59.850> hinges<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.510> here<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.469> hang<00:01:01.800> it

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
some hinges in here on here and hang it

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.310 
some hinges in here on here and hang it
but<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.359> don't<00:01:03.420> like<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.690> idea

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
but I don't like that idea

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.490 
but I don't like that idea
so<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.850> ended<00:01:06.299> up<00:01:06.450> putting<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.869> little<00:01:07.290> bit<00:01:07.380> of

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
so I ended up putting a little bit of

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.210 
so I ended up putting a little bit of
velcro<00:01:07.680> here<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:09.080> here<00:01:10.080> as<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.560> see<00:01:10.770> I

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
velcro here and here as you can see I

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.420 
velcro here and here as you can see I
mean<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.060> not<00:01:12.180> perfect<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:13.070> it<00:01:14.070> does<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
mean it's not perfect but it does the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.480 
mean it's not perfect but it does the
job<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.530> I'm<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.040> right<00:01:17.189> now<00:01:17.369> I'm

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
job so I'm going to do it right now I'm

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.570 
job so I'm going to do it right now I'm
going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> put<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:17.970> right<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:19.460> as<00:01:20.460> you

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
going to put it right here and as you

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.990 
going to put it right here and as you
can<00:01:20.700> see<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.810> hangs<00:01:22.020> there<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:23.000> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
can see it just hangs there and and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.060 
can see it just hangs there and and
that's<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> purpose<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.290> thing

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.740 

this<00:01:29.070> thing<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.610> looks<00:01:30.000> looks<00:01:30.509> pretty

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
this thing is it looks looks pretty

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.370 
this thing is it looks looks pretty
solid<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.320> mean<00:01:32.450> these<00:01:33.450> are<00:01:33.659> not<00:01:33.720> balanced<00:01:34.229> at

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
solid I mean these are not balanced at

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.440 
solid I mean these are not balanced at
all<00:01:34.409> they<00:01:35.070> don't<00:01:35.250> come<00:01:35.400> out<00:01:35.549> or<00:01:35.790> anything<00:01:36.030> so

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
all they don't come out or anything so

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.950 
all they don't come out or anything so
there's<00:01:36.600> no<00:01:37.009> risk<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.570> thinking<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.720> they're

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
there's no risk of thinking that they're

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.950 
there's no risk of thinking that they're
going<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.170> come<00:01:40.350> off<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:41.360> my<00:01:42.360> only<00:01:42.630> complaint

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
going to come off and my only complaint

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.870 
going to come off and my only complaint
is<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.189> know<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.549> doesn't

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
is that you know that it doesn't

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.010
