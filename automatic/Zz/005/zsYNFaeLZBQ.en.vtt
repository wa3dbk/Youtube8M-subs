00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.290 

okay<00:00:00.930> part<00:00:01.110> three<00:00:01.380> we're<00:00:01.650> getting<00:00:01.829> real<00:00:02.010> close

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:02.300 
okay part three we're getting real close

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.820 
okay part three we're getting real close
since<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.449> last<00:00:03.600> installment<00:00:03.990> I<00:00:04.319> have<00:00:04.500> built

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
since the last installment I have built

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.860 
since the last installment I have built
a<00:00:04.980> chest<00:00:05.279> plate<00:00:05.430> for<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.819> suit<00:00:06.029> added<00:00:06.660> some

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
a chest plate for the suit added some

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.379 
a chest plate for the suit added some
random<00:00:07.230> lights<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.770> wired<00:00:08.639> up<00:00:08.940> the

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
random lights and wired up the

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.120 
random lights and wired up the
electronics<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.320> they're<00:00:10.500> actually<00:00:10.620> attached

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
electronics so they're actually attached

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.970 
electronics so they're actually attached
to<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.460> suit<00:00:11.759> as<00:00:11.969> opposed<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.929> just<00:00:13.170> floating

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
to the suit as opposed to just floating

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.790 
to the suit as opposed to just floating
off<00:00:14.160> on<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.460> side<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:14.880> my<00:00:15.030> floor<00:00:15.269> somewhere

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
off on the side on my floor somewhere

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.820 
off on the side on my floor somewhere
this<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.640> current<00:00:18.170> configuration<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.710> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
this is the current configuration of the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:31.179 
this is the current configuration of the
suit<00:00:20.039> Oh<00:00:20.279> God<00:00:27.410> okay<00:00:28.410> now<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:28.710> heavy

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.350 

here's<00:00:32.029> what<00:00:32.239> I<00:00:32.270> have<00:00:32.329> so<00:00:32.719> far<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.530> chestplate

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
here's what I have so far the chestplate

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.360 
here's what I have so far the chestplate
was<00:00:35.360> originally<00:00:35.809> meant<00:00:36.020> to<00:00:36.079> be<00:00:36.170> one<00:00:36.559> unbroken

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
was originally meant to be one unbroken

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.460 
was originally meant to be one unbroken
piece<00:00:37.790> of<00:00:37.940> melon<00:00:38.090> but<00:00:38.570> I<00:00:38.600> ran<00:00:39.050> out<00:00:39.199> of<00:00:39.230> sheet

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
piece of melon but I ran out of sheet

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.530 
piece of melon but I ran out of sheet
metal<00:00:39.710> so<00:00:40.370> it's<00:00:40.579> a<00:00:40.640> bunch<00:00:40.820> of<00:00:40.940> scraps<00:00:41.239> that<00:00:41.390> I

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
metal so it's a bunch of scraps that I

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.020 
metal so it's a bunch of scraps that I
cut<00:00:41.809> apart<00:00:42.110> in<00:00:42.350> a<00:00:42.440> table<00:00:42.769> saw<00:00:42.920> into<00:00:43.309> rectangles

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
cut apart in a table saw into rectangles

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.890 
cut apart in a table saw into rectangles
and<00:00:44.120> triangles<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:46.390> welded<00:00:47.390> together<00:00:47.540> really

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
and triangles and welded together really

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.579 
and triangles and welded together really
badly

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
badly

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.270 
badly
I<00:00:49.300> sort<00:00:50.300> of<00:00:50.329> traced<00:00:50.720> bits<00:00:51.260> of<00:00:51.620> my<00:00:51.890> template

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
I sort of traced bits of my template

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.710 
I sort of traced bits of my template
that<00:00:52.339> I<00:00:52.489> printed<00:00:52.820> out<00:00:52.909> a<00:00:52.970> really<00:00:53.300> large<00:00:53.480> sheet

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
that I printed out a really large sheet

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.290 
that I printed out a really large sheet
of<00:00:53.809> paper<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.230> make<00:00:54.470> this<00:00:54.670> then<00:00:55.670> drill<00:00:56.180> the

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
of paper to make this then drill the

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.790 
of paper to make this then drill the
bunch<00:00:56.449> of<00:00:56.570> holes<00:00:56.750> in<00:00:56.930> it<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.140> screwed<00:00:57.649> these

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
bunch of holes in it and screwed these

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.439 
bunch of holes in it and screwed these
strap<00:00:58.100> holders<00:00:58.489> in<00:00:58.670> these<00:00:59.030> are<00:00:59.180> 3d<00:00:59.420> printed

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
strap holders in these are 3d printed

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.860 
strap holders in these are 3d printed
just<00:01:00.019> like<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.290> ones<00:01:00.470> on<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:01.460> arm<00:01:01.720> put<00:01:02.720> a

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
just like the ones on the arm put a

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.800 
just like the ones on the arm put a
strap<00:01:03.290> here<00:01:03.320> so<00:01:04.250> that's<00:01:04.519> about<00:01:04.820> around<00:01:05.540> your

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
strap here so that's about around your

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.390 
strap here so that's about around your
waist<00:01:06.049> and<00:01:06.439> then<00:01:07.280> these<00:01:07.400> two<00:01:07.729> just<00:01:09.189> have<00:01:10.189> these

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
waist and then these two just have these

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.160 
waist and then these two just have these
clips<00:01:10.700> which<00:01:10.970> are<00:01:11.060> also<00:01:11.210> 3d<00:01:11.570> printed<00:01:11.900> which<00:01:12.080> i

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
clips which are also 3d printed which i

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.080 
clips which are also 3d printed which i
think<00:01:12.229> is<00:01:12.409> really<00:01:12.680> cool<00:01:12.890> these<00:01:13.430> came<00:01:13.610> over<00:01:13.820> 3d

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
think is really cool these came over 3d

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.429 
think is really cool these came over 3d
printer<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:14.900> you<00:01:14.990> can<00:01:15.110> open<00:01:15.470> these<00:01:15.650> up<00:01:15.710> and

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
printer so you can open these up and

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.200 
printer so you can open these up and
turn<00:01:18.439> these<00:01:18.680> to<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:18.979> side<00:01:19.189> and<00:01:19.580> then<00:01:20.030> it's<00:01:20.150> a

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
turn these to the side and then it's a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.810 
turn these to the side and then it's a
little<00:01:20.390> easier<00:01:20.659> to<00:01:20.720> get<00:01:20.869> in<00:01:21.049> over<00:01:21.369> here<00:01:22.369> so

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
little easier to get in over here so

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.870 
little easier to get in over here so
push<00:01:23.780> led<00:01:24.290> I<00:01:24.560> had<00:01:24.979> a<00:01:25.009> second<00:01:25.369> one<00:01:25.490> for<00:01:25.729> this

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
push led I had a second one for this

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.850 
push led I had a second one for this
side<00:01:26.060> but<00:01:26.360> it<00:01:26.540> fell<00:01:26.810> off<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.590> I'm<00:01:27.680> still

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
side but it fell off so I'm still

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.840 
side but it fell off so I'm still
looking<00:01:28.100> for<00:01:28.189> another<00:01:28.250> one<00:01:28.549> they<00:01:28.670> don't

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
looking for another one they don't

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.219 
looking for another one they don't
actually<00:01:28.970> serve<00:01:29.210> a<00:01:29.240> purpose<00:01:29.509> I<00:01:29.810> just<00:01:30.049> think

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
actually serve a purpose I just think

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.499 
actually serve a purpose I just think
they<00:01:30.290> look<00:01:30.320> really<00:01:30.650> cool<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:30.979> then<00:01:31.850> these<00:01:32.090> are

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
they look really cool and then these are

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.840 
they look really cool and then these are
what<00:01:32.659> holds<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:33.200> chest<00:01:33.470> plate<00:01:33.619> to<00:01:34.280> the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
what holds the chest plate to the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.940 
what holds the chest plate to the
shoulder<00:01:35.299> it's<00:01:35.960> hard<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.289> tell<00:01:36.499> but<00:01:36.679> there's<00:01:36.890> a

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
shoulder it's hard to tell but there's a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.039 
shoulder it's hard to tell but there's a
layer<00:01:37.159> of<00:01:37.369> clear<00:01:37.609> stuff<00:01:37.909> over<00:01:38.479> top<00:01:38.659> of<00:01:38.689> here

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
layer of clear stuff over top of here

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.709 
layer of clear stuff over top of here
that's<00:01:39.350> bondo<00:01:39.859> it's<00:01:40.159> fiberglass<00:01:40.539> keeps<00:01:41.539> it

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
that's bondo it's fiberglass keeps it

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.359 
that's bondo it's fiberglass keeps it
from<00:01:41.899> popping<00:01:42.200> apart<00:01:42.649> because<00:01:42.829> really<00:01:43.130> it's

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
from popping apart because really it's

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.489 
from popping apart because really it's
just<00:01:43.429> a<00:01:43.670> 3d<00:01:43.999> printed<00:01:44.390> washer<00:01:45.020> with<00:01:45.170> a<00:01:45.200> 3d

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:45.499 
just a 3d printed washer with a 3d

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:47.649 
just a 3d printed washer with a 3d
printed<00:01:45.829> cylinder<00:01:46.249> here<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:46.639> then<00:01:47.479> on<00:01:47.569> the

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
printed cylinder here and then on the

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.090 
printed cylinder here and then on the
back<00:01:47.810> here<00:01:48.020> I've<00:01:48.139> started<00:01:48.409> wiring<00:01:48.859> everything

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
back here I've started wiring everything

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.660 
back here I've started wiring everything
up<00:01:49.420> here's<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.630> Arduino<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.560> does<00:01:52.159> not<00:01:52.340> have

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
up here's the Arduino it does not have

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.849 
up here's the Arduino it does not have
the<00:01:52.939> censor<00:01:53.299> shield<00:01:53.569> that<00:01:53.719> it<00:01:53.840> had<00:01:53.990> in<00:01:54.259> part

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
the censor shield that it had in part

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:55.959 
the censor shield that it had in part
one<00:01:55.039> where<00:01:55.249> I<00:01:55.280> was<00:01:55.399> demonstrating<00:01:55.909> the

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
one where I was demonstrating the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.330 
one where I was demonstrating the
electronics<00:01:56.450> that's<00:01:56.659> because<00:01:56.990> I<00:01:57.229> don't<00:01:58.189> know

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
electronics that's because I don't know

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.800 
electronics that's because I don't know
I<00:01:58.369> get<00:01:58.670> broke<00:01:58.909> at<00:01:59.090> some<00:01:59.240> point<00:01:59.450> I<00:01:59.479> spent<00:01:59.719> like

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
I get broke at some point I spent like

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.059 
I get broke at some point I spent like
an<00:01:59.899> hour<00:01:59.990> trying<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.469> figure<00:02:00.679> out<00:02:00.740> why<00:02:01.009> this

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
an hour trying to figure out why this

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.289 
an hour trying to figure out why this
thing<00:02:01.399> wasn't<00:02:01.579> working<00:02:01.969> and<00:02:02.090> there<00:02:02.209> was

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
thing wasn't working and there was

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.690 
thing wasn't working and there was
something<00:02:02.659> wrong<00:02:03.079> with<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.159> censor<00:02:04.459> shield

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
something wrong with the censor shield

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.010 
something wrong with the censor shield
it<00:02:04.819> kept<00:02:04.969> making<00:02:05.359> this<00:02:05.840> fuse<00:02:06.229> overheat<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:08.020> I'm

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
it kept making this fuse overheat so I'm

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.719 
it kept making this fuse overheat so I'm
going<00:02:09.319> to<00:02:09.410> have<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.649> wire<00:02:09.830> all<00:02:10.069> these<00:02:10.369> sensor

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
going to have to wire all these sensor

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.860 
going to have to wire all these sensor
cables<00:02:11.090> which<00:02:11.390> are<00:02:11.569> connected<00:02:12.160> down<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.400> arm

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
cables which are connected down the arm

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.100 
cables which are connected down the arm
to<00:02:16.780> these<00:02:17.780> buttons<00:02:19.510> those<00:02:20.510> cables<00:02:20.990> are<00:02:21.080> going

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
to these buttons those cables are going

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.730 
to these buttons those cables are going
to<00:02:21.260> be<00:02:21.350> connected<00:02:21.770> here<00:02:22.010> this<00:02:22.730> battery<00:02:23.740> the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
to be connected here this battery the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.140 
to be connected here this battery the
way<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:24.950> turn<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.340> whole<00:02:25.459> suit<00:02:25.700> on<00:02:25.819> is<00:02:26.030> you

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
way you turn the whole suit on is you

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.850 
way you turn the whole suit on is you
plug<00:02:26.360> this<00:02:26.600> into<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.959> Arduino<00:02:27.440> so<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:27.770> the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
plug this into the Arduino so that the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.140 
plug this into the Arduino so that the
code<00:02:28.040> is<00:02:28.069> running<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:28.670> when<00:02:28.790> you<00:02:28.880> press<00:02:29.030> the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
code is running so when you press the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.210 
code is running so when you press the
button<00:02:29.180> something<00:02:29.690> actually<00:02:29.959> happens<00:02:30.260> these

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
button something actually happens these

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.120 
button something actually happens these
relays<00:02:31.760> are<00:02:32.150> attached<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.319> my<00:02:33.500> 12-volt

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
relays are attached to my 12-volt

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.809 
relays are attached to my 12-volt
battery<00:02:34.459> here<00:02:35.709> fun<00:02:36.709> fact<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.250> bought<00:02:37.610> the

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
battery here fun fact I bought the

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.250 
battery here fun fact I bought the
battery<00:02:38.120> from<00:02:38.300> a<00:02:38.390> battery<00:02:38.690> store<00:02:38.959> while

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
battery from a battery store while

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.650 
battery from a battery store while
wearing<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.650> exosuit<00:02:40.130> because<00:02:40.490> it<00:02:40.730> takes<00:02:41.450> so

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
wearing the exosuit because it takes so

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.060 
wearing the exosuit because it takes so
much<00:02:41.810> effort<00:02:42.110> to<00:02:42.200> take<00:02:42.320> it<00:02:42.440> off<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.680> just<00:02:42.710> didn't

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
much effort to take it off I just didn't

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.260 
much effort to take it off I just didn't
want<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.250> bother<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:43.700> had<00:02:43.790> my<00:02:43.880> friend<00:02:44.000> drive

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
want to bother so I had my friend drive

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.740 
want to bother so I had my friend drive
me<00:02:44.390> there

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
me there

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.350 
me there
so<00:02:45.650> that's<00:02:45.800> connected<00:02:46.220> up<00:02:46.340> here<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:46.820> then

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
so that's connected up here and then

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.150 
so that's connected up here and then
this<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:48.700> attached<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.060> piston<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.160> will

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
this is attached to the piston and will

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.640 
this is attached to the piston and will
be<00:02:52.430> fed<00:02:53.300> into<00:02:53.330> these<00:02:53.720> relays<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.440> then

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
be fed into these relays and then

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.920 
be fed into these relays and then
hopefully<00:02:54.950> that<00:02:55.910> should<00:02:56.240> make<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.600> piston

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
hopefully that should make the piston

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.870 
hopefully that should make the piston
move<00:02:57.110> when<00:02:57.680> you<00:02:57.770> press<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.070> buttons<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.610> then

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
move when you press the buttons and then

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.450 
move when you press the buttons and then
I'm<00:02:59.000> done<00:02:59.350> so<00:03:00.350> I've<00:03:00.410> got<00:03:00.590> Eileen<00:03:00.890> again<00:03:01.190> help

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
I'm done so I've got Eileen again help

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:15.619 
I'm done so I've got Eileen again help
me<00:03:01.580> put<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:01.940> suit<00:03:02.150> back<00:03:02.180> on

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.080 

here<00:03:16.629> it<00:03:16.720> is<00:03:16.780> now<00:03:16.989> with<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.260> chest<00:03:17.590> plate<00:03:18.090> what

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
here it is now with the chest plate what

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.460 
here it is now with the chest plate what
I<00:03:19.120> still<00:03:19.360> have<00:03:19.480> left<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.720> do<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:20.260> need<00:03:20.440> to

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
I still have left to do is I need to

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.800 
I still have left to do is I need to
attach<00:03:20.890> this<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.790> strap<00:03:22.150> because<00:03:22.629> it

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
attach this to the strap because it

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.680 
attach this to the strap because it
moves<00:03:23.080> sideways<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:24.420> really<00:03:25.420> if<00:03:25.510> that

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
moves sideways and really if that

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.900 
moves sideways and really if that
doesn't<00:03:26.050> change<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.470> function<00:03:26.920> but<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.670> looks

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
doesn't change the function but it looks

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.309 
doesn't change the function but it looks
silly<00:03:28.150> when<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.540> starts<00:03:28.810> moving<00:03:28.959> over

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
silly when it starts moving over

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.150 
silly when it starts moving over
sideways<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:29.920> I<00:03:29.980> need<00:03:30.099> to<00:03:30.190> fix<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:31.140> here<00:03:32.160> in

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
sideways so I need to fix that here in

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.250 
sideways so I need to fix that here in
this<00:03:33.310> hand<00:03:33.610> are<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.390> buttons<00:03:34.720> that<00:03:34.870> I'm<00:03:35.080> going

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
this hand are the buttons that I'm going

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.490 
this hand are the buttons that I'm going
to<00:03:35.319> screw<00:03:35.800> on<00:03:35.830> somewhere<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.819> attach<00:03:37.180> as<00:03:38.170> of

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
to screw on somewhere to attach as of

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.009 
to screw on somewhere to attach as of
now<00:03:38.650> they<00:03:39.040> do<00:03:39.099> not<00:03:39.280> work<00:03:39.700> because<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.660> wiring

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
now they do not work because the wiring

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.650 
now they do not work because the wiring
is<00:03:41.140> not<00:03:41.410> quite<00:03:41.890> finished<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.519> then<00:03:43.209> finally

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
is not quite finished and then finally

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.780 
is not quite finished and then finally
I'm<00:03:44.410> going<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.739> need<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:45.040> build<00:03:45.190> another<00:03:45.519> arm

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
I'm going to need to build another arm

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.000 
I'm going to need to build another arm
over<00:03:46.120> here<00:03:46.330> I<00:03:46.540> think<00:03:47.080> next<00:03:47.349> weekend<00:03:47.799> I'm<00:03:47.890> going

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
over here I think next weekend I'm going

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.289 
over here I think next weekend I'm going
to<00:03:48.069> have<00:03:48.160> another<00:03:48.340> video<00:03:48.519> out<00:03:48.700> where<00:03:49.209> I'm

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
to have another video out where I'm

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:50.880 
to have another video out where I'm
going<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.599> finish<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:50.110> wiring<00:03:50.290> I'm<00:03:50.709> actually

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
going to finish the wiring I'm actually

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.920 
going to finish the wiring I'm actually
going<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.190> do<00:03:51.340> some<00:03:51.610> tests<00:03:52.030> with<00:03:52.299> this<00:03:52.480> arm<00:03:52.720> see

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
going to do some tests with this arm see

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.209 
going to do some tests with this arm see
how<00:03:53.049> much<00:03:53.200> I<00:03:53.319> can<00:03:53.380> lift<00:03:53.670> so<00:03:54.670> be<00:03:54.910> there
