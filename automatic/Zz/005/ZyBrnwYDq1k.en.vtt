00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.600

 hi my name is alexander and today u 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.489
 us again reef from the lithium reef series 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.489
 acoustic 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.400
 4 pressed on the second fret in the right hand 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:17.610
 volume of the nail part of the index 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:20.220
 fingers then string 5 and 4 1 2 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.160
 a blow to a strictly blow to the strings I did 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.000
 edge of the palm here this part is better 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.260
 so that all the strings and also still beat 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:40.730
 the ray of the index finger, too 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:42.910
 built another 1 hit no further 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.910
 by 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.750
 this is a bit further me 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.490
 salt 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.530
 I am without me 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.960
 hit and at the end of the phrase do not play 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.340
 mom 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.900
 my if we press the fifth in the third fret 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.970
 range strings and fifth to fourth 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.970
 fret also beat offspring 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.869
 The first phrase is: 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.240
 let's play one more time 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.450
 this can be played twice in a row 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.270
 then we come to the string below and here 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.270
 play the same thing but once 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.260
 and rotate the first phrase 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.170
 bottom too we speak one time further 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.300
 climb the string 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.020
 above we press the fifth string here 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.020
 we play too once 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.820
 we pass now to the third string 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.030
 try playing fourth third too 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.030
 once 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.370
 back to 1 phrase 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:36.030
 come back to this pressed and 6 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:39.750
 so open from the very beginning on 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:45.200
 5 and 4 we play the phrase twice then on 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:50.670
 4 3 1 1 further on again 5 4 1 1 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:53.870
 further on 6 5 1 times on 4 3 1 1 on 5 4 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.340
 and once at the end on May 6 once again 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.829
 so today we learned to play more 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.780
 one riff from lithium acoustics reef series 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.220
 I'm sure everything works out but if 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.200
 suddenly something is failing necessarily 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.160
 write in the comments I will answer and 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.109
 I will try to help 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.780
