00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.599
 hello I'm jürgens 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.360
 from the knipex product management team and 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.600
 I want you now the knipex 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.010
 Circlip sang program a little bit 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.010
 the classic program 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.900
 circlip sang at pécs is out 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.480
 a highly elastic chrome vanadium 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.020
 steel forged as a whole and the 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.369
 working tip is then precise 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.470
 palmed 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.690
 according to the different assembly 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.720
 situations there are these numbers with 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.739
 a straight top there are too 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.780
 with a 45 degree angled tip 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.300
 for better accessibility and for 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.730
 especially close fitting situations exist 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.030
 It also costs 90 degrees 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.250
 Angled tip so you under 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.920
 obstacles to the security 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.590
 Ringer gets the circlip 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.530
 Sang for the installation of fuses 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.869
 rules on waves have an opening 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.789
 feather which supports the exact 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.630
 positioning the tips in the 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:11.770
 drill holes of the retaining ring it 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.960
 Circlip sang for mounting 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.390
 from securing rings in holes 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.680
 need this support because of their 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.840
 not another design and now show 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.060
 I give them a demo 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.540
 the advantage of different tips 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.030
 to form 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.369
 I have such a small demo part there 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.740
 are secured by circlip 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.140
 and if they have room to do this 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.710
 to get a circlip is one 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.720
 straight circlip pliers the optimal 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.240
 tool so you can use this 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.400
 Circlip easily reach there 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.540
 Take out and install 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.869
 but if any other component in the 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.180
 Do not straighten it and you do not go straight 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.700
 this circlip then approaches 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.040
 is it a curved one right? 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.530
 circlip pliers to use with 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.439
 the one under an obstacle through 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.920
 can grab and over the edge of the 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.799
 housing the circlip 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.760
 can assemble and disassemble if now 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:18.070
 However, the security ring deeper 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.950
 lies as the copy of what they are down in 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.379
 the small hole is then helps me 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.260
 These circlips no longer say 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.520
 because I due to the limited 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.710
 folded tip length there 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.560
 no longer come if I have one 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.290
 straight circlip pliers for this 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.000
 then use my montage makes mine 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.860
 hand here mighty shadow and I can 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.660
 no longer see where I mean 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.970
 top position your have great 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.450
 difficulties the tips right in 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.990
 this circlip to the position too 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.040
 bring 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:53.230
 then it is good a 45 degrees 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.500
 to use angled pliers 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.170
 because that has the advantage that I have one 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.930
 good sight on the tips so that 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.210
 I sure the ring deep in the hole 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.960
 can grab can disassemble 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.490
 or the other way around 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.490
 in addition to the normal security struggle 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.110
 positioned on the wave in a note 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.020
 there will also be such ones themselves 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.100
 by pure gripping force on the wave 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.110
 you have to keep calling them 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.330
 significantly gripping rings and here 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.920
 can be seen in two examples for 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.340
 the same diameter that the grip 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.870
 rings are much more stable and therefore 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.060
 also pliers for the assembly and 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.580
 disassembly need the much more stable ones 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.640
 Tips also have such numbers 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.480
 Knee packs the so-called gripping wind 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.520
 Sang these have the same size 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.310
 the pliers a much stronger 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.130
 lace it allows even such thick 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.760
 assemble and dismantle rings 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.990
 and that the tip takes damage 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.390
 within the classic knipex 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.580
 For lock ring his program 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.470
 So we both up for circlip 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.170
 waves as well as insurances in 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:06.040
 holes each three different 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:09.190
 series with straight at 45 degrees or around 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.950
 90 ° bent tips depending on the place 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.700
 situation selected during assembly 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.280
 can be 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.109
 there are five within each series 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.359
 different pointed sizes for 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.080
 securing rings of 2 mm diameter 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.660
 up to 140 mm diameter and thus stands 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.820
 for all conceivable assembly 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.190
 situation in this diameter range 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.190
 always a suitable pliers available
