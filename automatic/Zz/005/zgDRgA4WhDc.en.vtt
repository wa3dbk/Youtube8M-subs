00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
sure it would just be good to indicate

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.360 
sure it would just be good to indicate
because<00:04:02.450> basher<00:04:03.019> one<00:04:03.170> round<00:04:03.530> one<00:04:03.830> round<00:04:04.010> one

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
because basher one round one round one

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.220 
because basher one round one round one
with<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.580> melons<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.150> I<00:04:05.750> was<00:04:05.930> hoping<00:04:06.170> that

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
with the melons and I was hoping that

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.050 
with the melons and I was hoping that
boat<00:04:06.500> it<00:04:06.650> would<00:04:06.769> win<00:04:06.980> win<00:04:07.459> round<00:04:07.670> two<00:04:07.790> so<00:04:08.000> we

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
boat it would win win round two so we

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.340 
boat it would win win round two so we
can<00:04:08.209> go<00:04:08.300> on<00:04:08.390> to<00:04:08.420> round<00:04:08.690> three<00:04:08.870> and<00:04:08.900> have<00:04:09.110> it<00:04:09.230> be

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
can go on to round three and have it be

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.650 
can go on to round three and have it be
all<00:04:09.590> epic<00:04:09.980> and<00:04:10.100> cheese<00:04:10.250> but<00:04:10.519> I<00:04:10.730> guess<00:04:11.299> is<00:04:11.450> this
