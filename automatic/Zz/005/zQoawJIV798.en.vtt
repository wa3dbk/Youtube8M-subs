you for being an active member of the
Ipsy<00:01:48.780> community<00:01:51.259> that's<00:01:52.259> awkward<00:01:52.530> because<00:01:53.009> I

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
Ipsy community that's awkward because I

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.249 
Ipsy community that's awkward because I
haven't<00:01:53.430> really<00:01:53.759> done<00:01:53.939> anything<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.899> Ipsy

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
website but I think it's because it says

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.899 
website but I think it's because it says
because<00:01:58.530> we<00:01:58.680> appreciate<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.310> content<00:01:59.850> you
