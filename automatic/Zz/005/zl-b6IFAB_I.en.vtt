00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.260
 I 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.230
 Welcome with you flex of and this rubric 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.419
 express setup for xvm mod answers 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.509
 on specific issues that decide for 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.789
 a couple of minutes in update 602 was 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.609
 added a couple more novelties in the hangar 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.220
 In this video I will talk about two useful 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.990
 trivialities first clearly 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.540
 will demonstrate well in the second half 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.570
 show where you can include them or 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.489
 the option was turned off when 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.850
 which you turn on automatically 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.649
 the previous crew returns to the tank 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.660
 quite useful if you often ride 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.050
 different machines and use straight 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.789
 the technique here is what it looks like for 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.949
 clarity, I chose the Soviet lungs 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.730
 tanks and pre one planted on them 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.820
 same crew 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.489
 And now in turn I will switch 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.829
 between tanks as soon as you click on 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.710
 a car without a crew that's automatically 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.220
 previous tankers like him 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.259
 they say a trifle but very nice 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.810
 new addition to the tips when 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:17.280
 hover on tank for artillery 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.280
 displayed firing range 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.960
 besides tanks with machine guns also 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.000
 have limited scope then 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.490
 have their shells fly further predetermined 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.780
 distances in the tips you can also 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.780
 explore this moment 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.620
 in order to turn on or when 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.450
 needing to disable these options will open 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.490
 finger file xr find this block and if 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.170
 here is ru 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.230
 automatic transfer is enabled and if 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.000
 falls off the switch for 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:55.040
 tips of the range of art and 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.060
 machine guns is here and in the config 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.470
 repulse tanks 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.320
 auto return setting 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:06.200
 previous crew rendered separately and 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:09.340
 is here today thanks for all 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.340
 attention and see you soon
