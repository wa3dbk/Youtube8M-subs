00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.430
 20 minutes is now betrayed 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.459
 and now keep Copenhagen 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.459
 that worked, too 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.099
 PwC it works 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.839
 But I can not guarantee if it works but works 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.140
 in court 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.800
 but Paul 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.510
 thanks to intervene 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.600
 on 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.600
 "If you want, you can start the game 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.320
 possible changes 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.240
 I am with me 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.460
 Tangermann to feel 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.050
 Barbara to give orders 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.460
 would like to recommend 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.950
 the q-cells by no means 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.950
 let it in for more than ten minutes 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.220
 always 20 minutes waiting time 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.310
 withheld 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.310
 the protests in egypt 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.820
 let the failure 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.430
 The fan could either break or should be able to 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.240
 overheat 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.630
 and Benny does not keep up the wait could give old electricity or gas 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.060
 Consoles are easy to go out can not tackle 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.329
 I can see it differently, I think the console is not covered 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.680
 We always have to sponsor 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.660
 Bundesliga

 looking for an investor in the Worst Dressed Lists 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.460
 the game does not cost anything 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.350
 and 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.350
 the culprit to find her here i can say what to show 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:15.309
 but it could also be over 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.389
 sometimes in the study 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.929
