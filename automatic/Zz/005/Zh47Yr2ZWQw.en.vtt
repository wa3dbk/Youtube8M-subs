 to have this bridge light hernile in 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.260
 work in the meantime let's dream 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.540
 with something else you might dream about 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.049
 American sports car but put a 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.420
 Mustang a different award version I will 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.029
 cut on this car vinícius trapani 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.590
 from eureka imports to start looking 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.529
 only the visual does not look at the difference of 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.740
 for shorts and sneakers is that a 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.990
 journalism and another here is a guy who is 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.600
 businessman owner of importer not 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.640

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.860
 two styles got bia more with the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.809
 strange and it looks like I am 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.870
 we have clients from all segments 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.719
 né then depends on the taste but really 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.219
 these more put Americans 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.110
 combine more with a stronger face 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.260
 more informal if you prefer to use the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.250
 blood in a plain or 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.050
 at work 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.000
 They look at blood, I think it 's 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.609
 any form is not is a script 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.620
 there is always a sensation 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.559
 I said 'do not just do it. 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.060
 It all went well so far this car is 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.990
 Here is here and Santa Catarina as 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.520
 time 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.260
 How was the import of that car? 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.610
 that direct import is now one of the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.860
 better ways for those who want to have a 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.659
 exclusive channel otherwise the best way is to 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.210
 a perfect and denilson is this model that 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.580
 we imported the phase in two months is 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.979

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.549
 commemorative edition it is the 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.890
 premium as you well said 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.799
 so it has all worked interior 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.210
 in leather and detail in led has a has 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.250
 a very nice peculiarity of this 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.259
 version and it also has a 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.689

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.280

 to know a little more about work is that 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.040

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.520
 we have a branch there in curitiba

 and also have operational bases 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.530
 both in san francisco 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.019
 new york then our customers 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.000
 they also have advice from a 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.519
 capillary sales network with 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.019
 representatives in Brazil then 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.400
 anywhere in the world. 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.440
 customer is going to have a 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.690
 very close and 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.400
 different is the staff Andrew Shore 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.620
 customer wants a car through 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.360
 direct import as a rule pays 50% 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.310
 before 50 kilos when the car is 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.410
 back then you're looking for a lot of security because 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.060
 're growing so much work you have 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.709
 five years because you can pass 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.500
 This message of good security to 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.870
 import and individuals is called 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.480
 direct import she is taking body 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.549
 is increasingly known by 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.590
 consumers for us is very good was 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.030
 what does it matter if it differs because 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.670
 she has been in the market for five years 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.319
 today it is one of the three largest importers 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.790
 Then there's a Brazilian volume. 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.640
 very large operational 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.890
 we guarantee the operation she is insured 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.750
 end to end so we aimed to design a 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.950
 business from the time it matters to 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.140
 client only has a job really 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.090
 choose the car you want 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.069
 then all the black grid and pay 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.889
 exactly all other procedures 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.049
 customs permits and legal right 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.269
 time that matters is taken care of and delivered 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.950
 in our client's house there is no 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.750
 minimum amount for this operation with the 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.340
 party of any value that has a 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.560
 car show is possible to do 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.079
 look to justify the costs 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.870
 that they usually do 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.420
 differ while in fact car goes there 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.269
 out of 23 thousand dollars that are 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.940
 camaro mustang entry versions 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.950
 challenge and your cars to 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.200
 from that it is worth importing 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.019
 they will reach from 120 thousand 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.030
 here in Brazil what is a cost is 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.970
 really too low is not a car 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.889
 differentiated from sinéad a car becomes 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.870
 in fact not a course this 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.920
 investment is to bring a car cause 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.780
 this prompt delivery is worth much more 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.910
 brazil is certainly not a car of this 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.549
 a market value of at least 180 thousand 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.889
 real or car that imports 120 thousand 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.290
 You will be able to rotate the two years with him without 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:15.930
 have no depreciation depression or 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.599
 still see it running a year and still have a 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.750
 the operational side there of import 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.750
 sale 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.349
 so another interesting thing is 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.240
 make the comparison is is import 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:37.610
 direct the cost of import operation 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.080
 direct relation to cars are already 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.849
 sold from Brazil has several models 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.770
 the boys the brazil will work 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:44.659
 official importation and which is more 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.729
 cheap by direct import with the 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.780
 Perfect, we can care 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.060
 any brand is not 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.099
 any version including the models are 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.659
 marketed in brazil the difference 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.969
 really the value we can 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.409
 import with a difference of 20 and 50 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:59.569
 per cent of the values ​​are 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:01.099
 commercialized in brazil this difference 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.650
 is due to some tax exemptions 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.210
 inherent in this direct import for 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.659
 person and also costs 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.909
 operating margin is the company's 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:12.770
 providing service or any other 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:14.000

 savings of 20 to 50% last 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.569
 We did not move the record yet. 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.939

 classic cars we also import are 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.900
