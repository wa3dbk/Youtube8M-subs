but not how to do it so what I embarked
on<00:01:52.530> over<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> next<00:01:52.979> probably<00:01:53.640> 10<00:01:54.180> years<00:01:54.660> was

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
on over the next probably 10 years was

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.850 
on over the next probably 10 years was
this<00:01:56.370> process<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:57.030> experimentation<00:01:57.800> where<00:01:58.800> I

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
this process of experimentation where I

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.710 
this process of experimentation where I
tried<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.340> figure<00:01:59.940> out<00:02:00.120> the<00:02:00.300> difference

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
tried to figure out the difference

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.360 
tried to figure out the difference
between<00:02:00.810> people<00:02:01.380> who<00:02:01.470> love<00:02:01.680> themselves<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
between people who love themselves and

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.740 
between people who love themselves and
people<00:02:02.490> who<00:02:02.700> don't<00:02:02.970> really<00:02:03.090> love<00:02:03.330> themselves

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
people who don't really love themselves

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.590 
people who don't really love themselves
and<00:02:04.710> discern<00:02:05.340> what<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.880> exactly<00:02:06.120> that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
and discern what it is exactly that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.840 
and discern what it is exactly that
people<00:02:07.140> are<00:02:07.260> tangibly<00:02:07.830> doing<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.670> love

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
people are tangibly doing that love

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.540 
people are tangibly doing that love
themselves

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
themselves

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.330 
themselves
that<00:02:09.940> adds<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:10.870> attitude<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.860> self-love

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
that adds to that attitude of self-love

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.970 
that adds to that attitude of self-love
so<00:02:13.330> from<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.840> have<00:02:14.050> created<00:02:14.260> an<00:02:14.620> actual

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
so from that I have created an actual

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.490 
so from that I have created an actual
toolkit<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.640> practical<00:02:16.540> techniques<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.350> you

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
toolkit of practical techniques that you

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.190 
toolkit of practical techniques that you
can<00:02:17.710> use<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.820> get<00:02:18.940> from<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.240> space<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.690> sulfate

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
can use to get from a space of sulfate

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.270 
can use to get from a space of sulfate
to<00:02:20.950> self-love<00:02:21.870> in<00:02:22.870> my<00:02:23.710> opinion<00:02:24.160> the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
to self-love in my opinion the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.700 
to self-love in my opinion the
information<00:02:24.970> that's<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:26.200> particular

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
information that's in this particular

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.340 
information that's in this particular
toolkit<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.580> cutting<00:02:27.820> edge<00:02:28.060> information

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
toolkit is the cutting edge information

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.880 
toolkit is the cutting edge information
as<00:02:29.350> it<00:02:29.560> applies<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:29.920> self-love<00:02:31.470> now<00:02:32.470> for

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
as it applies to self-love now for

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.240 
as it applies to self-love now for
example<00:02:33.430> many<00:02:34.210> people<00:02:34.540> are<00:02:34.660> familiar<00:02:34.840> with

example many people are familiar with

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.710 
example many people are familiar with
affirmations<00:02:36.250> it's<00:02:37.150> kind<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.540> no-brainer

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
affirmations it's kind of a no-brainer

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.020 
affirmations it's kind of a no-brainer
that<00:02:38.140> if<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.500> don't<00:02:38.680> love<00:02:38.860> yourself<00:02:39.030> you

present<00:02:44.740> in<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.070> book<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.580> idea<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.120> if

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
present in this book is the idea that if

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.720
