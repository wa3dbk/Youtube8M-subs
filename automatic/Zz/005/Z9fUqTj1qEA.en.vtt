00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.160
 welcome to detection service 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.270
 metal today we are in this stream I 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.100
 it has cost a new to get here 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.620
 but the truth is that it looks good 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.870
 there is a gold mine in that mountain there 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.780
 where the past is supposed though not 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.370
 I find it similar to the room 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.440
 here 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.170
 it does not look bad the subject I'm going to finish 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.120
 a little to kick from a 41 counter and 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.120
 the ignition is worth seeing what comes out 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.360
 look i'm going to take material from d 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.030
 in front of this rock that would be where it 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.310
 I would deposit in the meters 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.430
 the heavy particles and the gold with 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.590
 I'm taking material from here the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.880
 true that this river has never come nor 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.540
 I know of anyone who came here to take 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.250
 gold but good you have to try 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.340
 Well look at the first punt 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.860
 or some black sand and something some 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.860
 points of color but 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.540
 nothing too exciting the truth 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.330
 the approval of deepening a little 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.340
 more in another area 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.410
 and see if we get some curious nugget 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.080
 some domina I'm trying to take out 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.770
 now it is for that of this little 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.390
 drop that water here in this crack 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.010
 that removing material from here this shovel 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.010
 it is not appropriate for this but good 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.130
 also here is a place where I think that 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.170
 you can deposit the gold let's say 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.170
 There is more luck than the previous one 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.260
 let's wash this to see what happens 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.430
 Market Stall 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.739
 and good 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.920
 look look at two golden points fix what 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.920
 you see 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.580
 two points of incredible gold I found gold 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.580
 here 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.030
 flippant 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.319
 and you will see there are two points I will throw 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.319
 water above to increase a little 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.350
 amazing 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.350
 and some black sand too 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.350
 Well, I have to go back here, I'm going to 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.400
 be with a couple of bad batteries to 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.340
 person with the most but had to go back 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.400
 here one day that left a little more 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.810
 prepared because he came from shoes and everything 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.810
 I'm not going to look for today 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.550
 we found something more 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.590
 Well, I'm going to leave what I was 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.040
 darkening in the end I've only had that 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.570
 blade that I have taught you of gold I have 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.330
 taken a sample samples of here is 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.340
 a hole here a little improvised I've 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.820
 also taken samples from here of this 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.670
 fallen tree 'of the roots 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.290
 many of one of those screams that's why 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.600
 is where I got the gold mine that you 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.310
 I have taught 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.980
 and well the truth is that I do not know anything else 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.430
 I've done fifteen or ten or fifteen 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.080
 punts 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.330
 and has not appeared more than those little 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.680
 two samples of gold that I taught you to 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.150
 see your next day to come I have something 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.150
 more luck see you 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.120
 the subject of the photo 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:10.169
 what I have done has been to create this sheet 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.850
 of excel with all the names of use of 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.190
 youtube that you have participated in 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:17.200
 draw you see the requirements of it 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:20.380
 in total you are 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.390
 232 users 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.460
 look for jump I'm going to use this 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.200
 website that is called at the point 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.180
 hipo is responsible for generating numbers 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.380
 random then I will say that I 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:36.450
 generate a random number in 1 to 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.450
 232 that is the number of users 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:42.729
 send him 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:42.729
 the number that comes out of this form 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.960
 thank you very much for making the 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:49.960
 draw 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.010
 the number 29 that corresponds to 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.580
 daniel pay by daniel fey is the winner 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.140
 I will try to get in touch with 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.880
 the project and in case it does not 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.129
 I would answer then I would go down here 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.189

00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:25.459
 there will be more and we'll see each other in the next 

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:25.459
 episode 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.360
