00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.400 
Nick what do you think how do they feel
for<00:00:39.879> me<00:00:39.970> the<00:00:40.149> hawk<00:00:40.360> was<00:00:40.540> always<00:00:40.809> one<00:00:41.260> of<00:00:41.290> my

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
for me the hawk was always one of my

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.590 
for me the hawk was always one of my
favorite<00:00:41.829> boards<00:00:41.980> a<00:00:42.280> freeride<00:00:42.910> blasting

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
favorite boards a freeride blasting

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.990 
favorite boards a freeride blasting
around<00:00:43.690> it<00:00:43.989> is<00:00:44.140> obviously<00:00:44.530> a<00:00:44.590> great<00:00:45.280> product

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
around it is obviously a great product

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.479 
around it is obviously a great product
this<00:00:46.269> year's<00:00:46.510> bought<00:00:46.750> that<00:00:47.650> I<00:00:47.680> find<00:00:48.040> them<00:00:48.159> the

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
this year's bought that I find them the

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.100 
this year's bought that I find them the
improvements<00:00:49.059> means<00:00:49.300> obviously<00:00:49.720> he<00:00:49.809> feels<00:00:49.839> a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
improvements means obviously he feels a

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.560 
improvements means obviously he feels a
little<00:00:50.199> bit<00:00:50.409> faster<00:00:50.860> but<00:00:51.790> mostly<00:00:52.239> most

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
little bit faster but mostly most

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.240 
little bit faster but mostly most
importantly<00:00:53.170> it<00:00:53.350> was<00:00:53.409> already<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:53.710> fastball

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
importantly it was already a fastball

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.250 
importantly it was already a fastball
but<00:00:54.430> it's<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:54.670> control<00:00:55.089> and<00:00:55.329> the<00:00:55.600> ease<00:00:55.870> that<00:00:55.899> I

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
but it's the control and the ease that I

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.350 
but it's the control and the ease that I
can<00:00:56.559> go<00:00:56.739> at<00:00:56.920> that<00:00:57.040> speed<00:00:57.370> out<00:00:57.519> I'm<00:00:57.940> not<00:00:58.149> hanging

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
can go at that speed out I'm not hanging

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.000 
can go at that speed out I'm not hanging
on<00:00:58.600> anymore<00:00:58.899> I'm<00:00:59.290> not<00:00:59.320> sort<00:00:59.649> of<00:00:59.680> gritting<00:00:59.979> my

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
on anymore I'm not sort of gritting my

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.890 
on anymore I'm not sort of gritting my
teeth<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.370> little<00:01:00.489> bit<00:01:00.640> I<00:01:00.939> am<00:01:01.269> going<00:01:01.540> flat<00:01:01.869> out

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
teeth a little bit I am going flat out

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.929 
teeth a little bit I am going flat out
blasting<00:01:02.860> past<00:01:03.100> people<00:01:03.489> but<00:01:03.610> at<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:03.729> same

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:03.939 
blasting past people but at the same

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.570 
blasting past people but at the same
time<00:01:04.210> I'm<00:01:04.540> fairly<00:01:04.869> comfortable<00:01:05.439> so<00:01:06.310> I<00:01:06.340> think

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
time I'm fairly comfortable so I think

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.980 
time I'm fairly comfortable so I think
for<00:01:06.759> me<00:01:06.909> that's<00:01:07.090> probably<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.750> biggest

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
for me that's probably the biggest

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.630 
for me that's probably the biggest
difference<00:01:08.290> of<00:01:08.619> because<00:01:08.890> improvements<00:01:09.460> we've

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
difference of because improvements we've

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.850 
difference of because improvements we've
already<00:01:09.820> got<00:01:10.150> great<00:01:10.780> jiving<00:01:11.320> you<00:01:11.439> can<00:01:11.619> do<00:01:11.710> up

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
already got great jiving you can do up

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.249 
already got great jiving you can do up
white<00:01:12.070> job<00:01:12.369> you<00:01:12.610> can<00:01:12.759> do<00:01:12.850> lay<00:01:13.060> down<00:01:13.270> jives<00:01:13.630> you

recognize when you look at the board

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.120 
recognize when you look at the board
there's<00:01:28.930> a<00:01:28.990> couple<00:01:29.229> of<00:01:29.350> things<00:01:29.590> that<00:01:29.680> we<00:01:29.920> did

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.239 
there's a couple of things that we did
to<00:01:30.340> it<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.909> get<00:01:31.119> that<00:01:31.390> additional<00:01:31.900> console<00:01:32.679> we

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
to it to get that additional console we

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:34.770 
to it to get that additional console we
actually<00:01:33.579> didn't<00:01:33.880> really<00:01:34.030> touch<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.329> bottom

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
actually didn't really touch the bottom

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.149 
actually didn't really touch the bottom
shape<00:01:35.020> because<00:01:35.380> as<00:01:35.530> you<00:01:35.649> mentioned<00:01:35.979> it's<00:01:36.100> been

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
shape because as you mentioned it's been

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.429 
shape because as you mentioned it's been
a<00:01:36.280> really<00:01:36.609> quick<00:01:36.850> board<00:01:37.179> really<00:01:37.780> performance

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
a really quick board really performance

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.260 
a really quick board really performance
and<00:01:38.649> fast<00:01:38.890> so<00:01:39.069> we'd<00:01:39.219> like<00:01:39.399> to<00:01:39.640> keep<00:01:39.850> that

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
and fast so we'd like to keep that

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.630 
and fast so we'd like to keep that
performance<00:01:41.259> so<00:01:41.920> we<00:01:42.039> didn't<00:01:42.310> touch<00:01:42.429> the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
performance so we didn't touch the

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.399 
performance so we didn't touch the
bottom<00:01:42.880> shape<00:01:43.090> that<00:01:43.299> much<00:01:43.509> but<00:01:44.049> what<00:01:44.229> you'll

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
bottom shape that much but what you'll

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.440 
bottom shape that much but what you'll
recognize<00:01:45.009> this<00:01:45.219> you<00:01:45.340> have<00:01:45.429> the<00:01:45.579> sort<00:01:46.299> of<00:01:46.329> the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
recognize this you have the sort of the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.539 
recognize this you have the sort of the
recess<00:01:46.899> in<00:01:47.079> the<00:01:47.109> deck<00:01:47.380> area<00:01:47.740> that<00:01:48.039> we<00:01:48.159> also<00:01:48.340> use

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
recess in the deck area that we also use

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.760 
recess in the deck area that we also use
on<00:01:48.880> our<00:01:48.999> Falcon<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:49.689> Ray<00:01:49.899> arranged<00:01:50.229> this

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
on our Falcon and Ray arranged this

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.379 
on our Falcon and Ray arranged this
gives<00:01:51.039> you<00:01:51.159> an<00:01:51.219> additional<00:01:51.429> control<00:01:52.149> and<00:01:52.329> I

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:52.389 
gives you an additional control and I

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:53.879 
gives you an additional control and I
wasn't<00:01:52.749> really<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.960> big<00:01:53.109> believer<00:01:53.560> in<00:01:53.619> this<00:01:53.710> in

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:53.889 
wasn't really a big believer in this in

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:55.919 
wasn't really a big believer in this in
the<00:01:53.950> stuff<00:01:54.219> until<00:01:54.520> I<00:01:54.789> tried<00:01:55.119> it<00:01:55.149> and<00:01:55.450> as

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
the stuff until I tried it and as

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.389 
the stuff until I tried it and as
they're<00:01:56.109> walking<00:01:56.289> it<00:01:56.590> actually<00:01:56.979> makes<00:01:57.249> a

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
they're walking it actually makes a

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.879 
they're walking it actually makes a
difference<00:01:57.819> it's<00:01:58.420> not<00:01:58.630> as<00:01:58.780> deep<00:01:59.079> or<00:01:59.319> radical

00:01:59.879 --> 00:01:59.889 
difference it's not as deep or radical

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:01.859 
difference it's not as deep or radical
as<00:02:00.069> we<00:02:00.219> see<00:02:00.429> it<00:02:00.490> on<00:02:00.609> our<00:02:00.729> Falcon<00:02:01.090> range<00:02:01.420> but

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
as we see it on our Falcon range but

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.660 
as we see it on our Falcon range but
it's<00:02:02.049> deep<00:02:02.229> enough<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.770> give<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.039> this<00:02:03.189> extra

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
it's deep enough to give you this extra

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.179 
it's deep enough to give you this extra
bit<00:02:04.060> of<00:02:04.090> control<00:02:04.659> in<00:02:04.899> addition<00:02:05.709> to<00:02:05.829> that<00:02:05.979> we

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
bit of control in addition to that we

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.130 
bit of control in addition to that we
move<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.549> pin<00:02:06.759> box<00:02:06.909> a<00:02:07.119> little<00:02:07.240> bit<00:02:07.450> also<00:02:08.020> the

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
move the pin box a little bit also the

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.510 
move the pin box a little bit also the
direction<00:02:08.440> which<00:02:08.770> gives<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.100> more<00:02:09.280> control

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
direction which gives you more control

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.170 
direction which gives you more control
and<00:02:10.260> we<00:02:11.260> worked<00:02:11.500> on<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.800> rail<00:02:11.950> same<00:02:12.280> slide<00:02:12.580> so

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
and we worked on the rail same slide so

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.270 
and we worked on the rail same slide so
all<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.480> these<00:02:13.660> little<00:02:13.900> changes<00:02:14.500> refinement

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
all of these little changes refinement

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.640 
all of these little changes refinement
that<00:02:15.310> we<00:02:15.490> can<00:02:15.730> really<00:02:15.940> control<00:02:16.209> by<00:02:17.200> doing<00:02:17.500> all

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
that we can really control by doing all

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.190 
that we can really control by doing all
our<00:02:17.680> designs<00:02:18.160> on<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.459> computer<00:02:19.030> make<00:02:19.990> these

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
our designs on the computer make these

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.220 
our designs on the computer make these
shapes<00:02:20.410> work<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.700> better<00:02:21.880> way<00:02:22.150> for<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.930> next

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
shapes work in a better way for the next

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.440 
shapes work in a better way for the next
year
