00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello welcome to the kitchen for all 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.940
 Now that the heat is coming with the 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.069
 veranito how to make refreshing 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.690
 strawberry powders the ingredients that 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.820
 we are going to need these the following 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.130
 the first thing we need to do 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.440
 our people is a mold for pores 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.630
 you can find it in any bazaar 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.250
 your city and if you do not find it 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.050
 I will leave a link below in the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.650
 description so you can buy it via 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.050
 on-line 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.330
 then the ingredients are 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.449
 these in my case and with the amounts 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.570
 that fits in my mold for poles we're going to 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:37.840
 make two pops of syrup and milk and for 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:41.280
 we're going to need 150 milliliters of 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.410
 milk and 30 milliliters of strawberry syrup 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.250
 and we will also make two poles with a 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.410
 strawberry syrup and water and we will need 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.290
 150 milliliters of water and 30 milliliters 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.530
 of strawberry syrup first let's do 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.530
 the preparation that carries water we put the 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.430
 water in a bowl and we add the 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.430
 scirocco strawberry 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.420
 once you already have added 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.510
 syrup with the help of a whisk 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.009
 we are going to mix it well 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.110
 once we have it mixed 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.110
 we can move to put in our mold 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.930
 with the help of a utensil like 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.770
 filling 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.770
 mold 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:42.130
 and we're going to leave half a centimeter of this 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.250
 so always fill it completely and already 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.070
 we put the stick we are going to do what 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.070
 same with this and now we will do the same 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.160
 with the milk we add the syrup of 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.160
 Strawberry 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.800
 and we mix well 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.850
 once we have the milk syrup 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.450
 mixed let's put it also in 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.450
 our mold 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.630
 just like before let's leave half 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.630
 centimeter 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.530
 and we put the stick and go to 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.390
 do the same with this that we have left and 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.970
 once we have it ready we are going to 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.620
 put in the freezer about 12 hours already 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.410
 12 hours have passed and we have taken 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.870
 our freezer color now with 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.780
 the hot water from the tap we will go 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.830
 giving him by these sides to make it more 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.830
 easy to take them out 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.260
 and already but we have to take out we do or if 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.310
 it's like that 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.310
 with when you want 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.140
 do not 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.640
 I think I can not choose between one of 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.530
