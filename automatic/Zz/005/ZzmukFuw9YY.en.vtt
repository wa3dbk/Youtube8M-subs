00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
about how to initialize the helicopters

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.240 
about how to initialize the helicopters
and<00:00:06.470> doing<00:00:07.470> some<00:00:07.649> control<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.160> the

and doing some control of the
helicopters<00:00:08.760> with<00:00:09.360> no<00:00:09.540> radios<00:00:10.250> right<00:00:11.250> now<00:00:11.400> all

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
helicopters with no radios right now all

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.030 
helicopters with no radios right now all
the<00:00:11.730> batteries<00:00:11.910> are<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.330> their<00:00:12.509> all<00:00:13.040> the

the batteries are in their all the
values<00:00:14.309> are<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.639> radios<00:00:14.969> everything's

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
values are in the radios everything's

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.420 
values are in the radios everything's
already<00:00:15.960> tested<00:00:16.699> everything<00:00:17.699> works<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:23.250> the

already tested everything works and the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.810 
already tested everything works and the
batteries<00:00:23.760> are<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.240> helicopters<00:00:24.810> already

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
batteries are in the helicopters already

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.310 
batteries are in the helicopters already
the<00:00:26.820> little<00:00:27.150> sorry<00:00:27.330> close<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.050> lock

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
the little sorry close and lock

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.810 
the little sorry close and lock
initializing<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> helicopter<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.460> little

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
initializing the helicopter is a little

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.150 
initializing the helicopter is a little
tricky<00:00:33.059> part<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.140> make<00:00:34.380> sure<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:35.010> follow

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
tricky part so make sure that you follow
