00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.840
 drive them too 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.840
 what 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.800
 make 3 piece turnover 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.330
 according to my observation 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.849
 this does not change the strength 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:31.770
 insert the resulting loop 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:37.410
 all and delay as usual do not forget 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.410
 wet the knot neatly delayed 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:50.700
 all node is ready 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:55.230
 just not naturally cut off like this 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.230
 practical light simple knot 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.600
 Well, let's start a double clinch 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:18.009
 insert of course the gun 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:20.590
 call again 2 1 spoon thick 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:24.520
 visibility took 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.520
 Suslova here is much easier 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:35.229
 here we have a double loop 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:40.240
 fix it with your fingers inconvenience and 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.240
 we wrap 35 times as in a simple clinch 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:52.060
 motorin insert the end of the cord 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:02:01.069
 double loop set and quietly 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:04.090
 tighten we turned node node 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.090
 double clinch 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:14.829
 excess Crop Crop 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.470
 we deliver in narrow 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.100
 The optimum speed of 5 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.760
 do keep your fingers 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.760
 to form a loop with the whole business 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.250
 turn but i will do three so how to rope 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:46.420
 it will be difficult to tighten the left way 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:50.110
 the resulting loop is the end of the fishing line 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.290
 we got this design and 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.790
 end of the line and skip another loop 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:05.230
 I hope that everything is formed 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:15.330
 seen and gently tighten do not forget 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:15.330
 wet the knot with walls we cut off the excess 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:28.629
 Here we have improved clinch 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.109
 if you still will be fingers of wicker 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.629
 cords 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:37.900
 especially for slippery ones I recommend 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:40.049
 melt the tip as in the double clinch 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.230
 as i showed the tip melt 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:47.109
 the ball is formed naturally its like 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:52.230
 won't let knots crawl and untie him 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.230
 only what percentage does he strengthen the knot
