00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
info I hoped that I would be a little

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.290 
info I hoped that I would be a little
better<00:00:10.620> at<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.130> game<00:00:11.250> by<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.610> time<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:11.910> showed

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
better at this game by the time I showed

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.759 
better at this game by the time I showed
it<00:00:12.420> off<00:00:12.509> for<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.840> but<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.080> put<00:00:13.320> another<00:00:13.500> half

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
it off for you but I put another half

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.189 
it off for you but I put another half
hour<00:00:13.920> into<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:15.030> just<00:00:15.330> think<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.929> this

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
hour into it and I just think that this

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.500 
hour into it and I just think that this
is<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.800> don't<00:00:17.460> know<00:00:17.699> if<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.060> my<00:00:18.270> lack<00:00:18.480> of

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
is it I don't know if it's my lack of

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.320 
is it I don't know if it's my lack of
coordination<00:00:18.960> or<00:00:19.740> if<00:00:20.430> there<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:21.000> just

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
coordination or if there is just

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.640 
coordination or if there is just
something<00:00:21.510> about<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.930> game<00:00:22.140> that's<00:00:22.320> hard<00:00:22.560> to

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
something about the game that's hard to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.590 
something about the game that's hard to
control<00:00:22.980> but<00:00:23.699> basically<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.570> a

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
control but basically it is a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.230 
control but basically it is a
first-person<00:00:25.050> racer<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.920> inhabit<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.970> body

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
first-person racer you inhabit this body

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.000 
first-person racer you inhabit this body
you<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.779> look<00:00:27.960> at<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.109> from<00:00:28.199> third<00:00:28.500> person<00:00:28.890> but

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
you can look at it from third person but

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.460 
you can look at it from third person but
it's<00:00:29.099> even<00:00:29.220> more<00:00:29.340> confusing<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:31.199> point

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
it's even more confusing and the point

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.110 
it's even more confusing and the point
of<00:00:31.560> most<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.040> game<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.489> just<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.850> pick<00:00:33.000> up

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
of most of the game is just to pick up

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.360 
of most of the game is just to pick up
these<00:00:33.270> spheres<00:00:33.780> by<00:00:34.530> jumping<00:00:34.980> from<00:00:35.010> platform

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
these spheres by jumping from platform

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.150 
these spheres by jumping from platform
to<00:00:35.670> platform<00:00:36.200> most<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.440> time<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.920> pretty

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
to platform most the time it's pretty

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.110 
to platform most the time it's pretty
easy<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.700> then<00:00:38.820> every<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.180> often<00:00:39.440> boy<00:00:41.120> haha

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
easy and then every so often boy haha

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.590 
easy and then every so often boy haha
okay<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.350> should<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:43.649> been<00:00:43.710> hard<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:45.030> all<00:00:45.090> I

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
okay that should have been hard at all I

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.529 
okay that should have been hard at all I
just<00:00:45.899> suck<00:00:46.550> most<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.700> time<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.090> not<00:00:48.300> that

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
just suck most of the time it's not that

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.869 
just suck most of the time it's not that
bad<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:48.809> then<00:00:49.200> every<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.590> often<00:00:49.739> uh<00:00:50.070> you'll

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
bad but then every so often uh you'll

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.150 
bad but then every so often uh you'll
just<00:00:51.059> run<00:00:51.239> into<00:00:51.570> some<00:00:51.840> area<00:00:52.320> where<00:00:52.649> you'll<00:00:53.070> be

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
just run into some area where you'll be

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.799 
just run into some area where you'll be
completely<00:00:53.730> lost<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.360> won't<00:00:54.539> know<00:00:54.660> where

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
sometimes I had to remap some of the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.590 
sometimes I had to remap some of the
keys<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.129> order<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:05.580> them<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.700> make<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.180> hit

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
keys in order for them to make it hit

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.420 
keys in order for them to make it hit
work<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:07.080> my<00:01:07.290> hands<00:01:07.619> which<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.220> weird

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
work with my hands which is weird

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.060 
work with my hands which is weird
because<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:09.030> big<00:01:09.299> hands<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:11.040> a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
because I have big hands so I have a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.280 
because I have big hands so I have a
feeling<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.490> other<00:01:12.210> people<00:01:12.780> playing<00:01:13.170> this

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
feeling that other people playing this

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.270 
feeling that other people playing this
game<00:01:13.470> we're<00:01:13.590> going<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:13.890> even<00:01:14.159> more

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
game we're going to have even more

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.090 
game we're going to have even more
problems<00:01:14.909> than<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.439> but<00:01:16.439> most<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
problems than I do but most of the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.980 
problems than I do but most of the
movement<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.729> controlled<00:01:18.119> through<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.509> arrow

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
movement is controlled through the arrow

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.850 
movement is controlled through the arrow
keys<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.830> normal<00:01:20.189> WASD<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.150> your<00:01:22.080> mouse<00:01:22.380> your

mouse does all your jumping to which is

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.140 
mouse does all your jumping to which is

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
also kind of unusual and hard to get

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.020 
also kind of unusual and hard to get
used<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.509> damn<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.979> best<00:01:29.250> part<00:01:29.579> about<00:01:29.729> the

used to damn it the best part about the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.999 
used to damn it the best part about the
jumping<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:31.070> this<00:01:32.150> I'm<00:01:33.150> I'm<00:01:33.600> wall<00:01:34.229> jumping<00:01:34.799> I'm
