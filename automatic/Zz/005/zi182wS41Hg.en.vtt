00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
using the cut list as a guide we measure

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.100 
using the cut list as a guide we measure
and<00:01:20.380> mark<00:01:20.619> each<00:01:20.860> piece<00:01:21.220> of<00:01:21.400> wood<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.840> just

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
and mark each piece of wood we just

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.380 
and mark each piece of wood we just
measure<00:01:23.410> and<00:01:23.800> Mark<00:01:24.550> these<00:01:24.700> one<00:01:24.970> at<00:01:25.090> a<00:01:25.180> time

alright<00:01:25.750> now<00:01:25.900> take<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.200> speed<00:01:26.470> square<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:26.860> it

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
alright now take the speed square to it

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.120 
alright now take the speed square to it
draws<00:01:27.430> a<00:01:27.460> nice<00:01:27.729> straight<00:01:28.060> line<00:01:28.090> across<00:01:28.509> there

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
frames which could be thought of as the

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.580 
frames which could be thought of as the
front<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.429> back<00:01:48.700> of<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.970> playset<00:01:49.509> we<00:01:50.259> snap
