00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.070
 is very good with kids that 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.230
 is and if we are in week 4 of 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.539
 who wants to be a millionaire in jeta 5 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.170
 online we finally come back after this 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.369
 stop that yes holy week yes 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.769
 exams and so we come back with the 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.500
 lobbies since it's something that they have to 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.179
 Take your time and such and good how 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.129
 participate because many ask me 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.860
 by twitter but I leave everything pretty 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.449
 clear or that I think in each video 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.610
 so how do you participate? 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.760
 leave your idea of ps3 only ps3 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.610
 because I do not have a pirate xbox you have to 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.830
 follow me on twitter since on twitter 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.140
 I say when will it be to lobby 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.019
 exactly because it is surely the 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.059
 Sunday afternoon as is usually every 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.799
 lobby but now not skip 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.180
 because I do not want to leave a fixed time and 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.500
 that you are waiting for me and with the pineapple 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.870
 lit like many people 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.910
 and then do not appear or something happens to me and 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.310
 I want to leave all the last 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.620
 moment I have clarified then if I 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.300
 you follow twitter by diego in an hour 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.790
 or so that I give you time make the 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.110
 play that if you have a bad connection that 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.290
 boot had to carry ya 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.000
 perfectly and give you time for 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.619
 example you are the street you see it that 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.310
 it's time to get home and for that 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.290
 so I'll say it with time and only 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.960
 can enter 15 people that's the thing 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.910
 of the series that is the fastest I do not 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.880
 I will do neither fans nor the one who gives more 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:38.000
 you like what you want but now 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.759
 I say if we do not reach a figure of 250 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.890
 Ã¡lex 300 you will say they are a lot but 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.780
 is that we are almost 6000 in the channel and 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.600
 Many of you ask me lobbies then if not 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.030
 I see that there is support because it will be the last 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.130
 girlfriend of the channel since it is with the 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.289
 baneos and such and they are 15 euros what 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.110
 costs each code since when connecting the 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.090
 menu it is very likely to lock in 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.030
 then yes I think there is not much 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.740
 I support because it will be last I saw it so if 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.750
 you share the video so that we arrive 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.509
 surely then 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.390
 well I would appreciate it very much and also 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.600
 been a lot of support in bestial plan in 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.700
 plan 500 likes because I would even do 23 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.730
 lobbies next week so 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.430
 it depends on you and that you have to 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.130
 put your idea of ps3 the description 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.000
 follow me on twitter laical video and good 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.790
 and be subscribed clearly so what 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.220
 said I hope you like that there is more 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.470
 lobbies in the channel but that gives a lot 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.220
 support there are favorites to subscribe if not 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.220
 you are and goodbye
