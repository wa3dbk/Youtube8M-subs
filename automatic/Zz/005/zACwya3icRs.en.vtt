the<00:00:36.469> main<00:00:38.120> assembly<00:00:40.309> it<00:00:41.309> doesn't<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:42.890> safety

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the main assembly it doesn't have safety

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.069 
the main assembly it doesn't have safety
I<00:00:44.010> haven't<00:00:44.460> made<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> safety<00:00:45.270> assembly<00:00:45.750> yet

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
I haven't made a safety assembly yet

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.720 
I haven't made a safety assembly yet
because<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.340> didn't<00:00:48.329> feel<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.539> it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
there's the this is a tangent site that

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.679 
there's the this is a tangent site that
you<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:12.530> raise<00:01:13.760> up<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.970> down<00:01:15.090> depend<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
you can raise up and down depend on the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.840 
you can raise up and down depend on the
depending<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.460> range<00:01:17.670> you're

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
depending on the the range you're

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.030 
depending on the the range you're
shooting<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.170> front<00:01:19.380> sight<00:01:20.000> and

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
shooting it and the front sight and

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.070 
shooting it and the front sight and
everything<00:01:23.040> works<00:01:23.310> exactly<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.960> real

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
everything works exactly like the real

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.480 
everything works exactly like the real
thing<00:01:25.580> you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.729> open<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> vault<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:28.490> blows

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
thing you can open the vault and blows

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.280 
thing you can open the vault and blows
it<00:01:29.630> cocks<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.810> fine<00:01:31.020> pin<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:32.689> just<00:01:33.689> pull<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
it cocks a fine pin and just pull the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.149 
it cocks a fine pin and just pull the
trigger<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:36.200> find<00:01:37.200> some<00:01:37.350> strikes<00:01:40.130> you<00:01:41.130> can

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
trigger and find some strikes you can

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.950 
trigger and find some strikes you can
disassemble<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> real

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
disassemble this just like the real

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.450 
disassemble this just like the real
thing<00:01:43.579> this<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.000> bolt<00:01:46.880> lock

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
thing this is the bolt lock

00:01:49.460 --> 00:02:03.070 
thing this is the bolt lock
and<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.800> ejector<00:01:52.750> just<00:01:59.980> open<00:02:00.980> this<00:02:01.870> I'm<00:02:02.870> Dan

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
and the ejector just open this I'm Dan

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.940 
and the ejector just open this I'm Dan
you<00:02:03.670> you<00:02:04.670> can<00:02:05.140> cock<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.260> open<00:02:06.590> a<00:02:06.620> little<00:02:06.650> bit

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
you you can cock it open a little bit

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.320 
you you can cock it open a little bit
and<00:02:07.130> then<00:02:07.250> slightly<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.149> bolt<00:02:08.330> slides<00:02:08.600> out

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
and then slightly the bolt slides out

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.530 
and then slightly the bolt slides out
you<00:02:11.330> can<00:02:11.480> further<00:02:11.660> take<00:02:11.810> this<00:02:12.050> down<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:13.540> it's

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
you can further take this down and it's

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.770 
you can further take this down and it's
just<00:02:15.070> basically<00:02:16.070> a<00:02:16.430> simple<00:02:16.910> pen<00:02:17.209> component

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
just basically a simple pen component

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.920 
just basically a simple pen component
paper<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.320> um<00:02:18.970> random<00:02:19.970> spring<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:20.720> found

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
paper and um random spring that I found

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.970 
paper and um random spring that I found
outside<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:22.780> should<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:23.930> usually<00:02:24.830> make

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
outside I should I usually make

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.260 
outside I should I usually make
everything<00:02:26.050> out<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.370> paper<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.820> whatever's

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
everything out of paper and whatever's

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.210 
everything out of paper and whatever's
laying<00:02:29.450> around<00:02:29.660> like<00:02:30.020> screws<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:30.980> found

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
laying around like screws that I found

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.670 
laying around like screws that I found
in<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.370> garage<00:02:32.140> yeah<00:02:33.400> um<00:02:35.050> I'm<00:02:36.050> pretty<00:02:36.470> sure

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
in the garage yeah um I'm pretty sure

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.740 
in the garage yeah um I'm pretty sure
many<00:02:36.920> of<00:02:37.100> you<00:02:37.250> were<00:02:37.400> wondering<00:02:37.610> like<00:02:38.180> how

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
many of you were wondering like how

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.840 
many of you were wondering like how
could<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.170> get<00:02:39.350> papers<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:39.830> be<00:02:39.860> papers<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.820> be

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
could you get papers to be papers to be

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.449 
could you get papers to be papers to be
hard<00:02:41.150> like<00:02:41.600> super<00:02:42.560> hard<00:02:43.239> I<00:02:45.100> basically<00:02:46.100> use

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
hard like super hard I basically use

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.550 
hard like super hard I basically use
just<00:02:46.820> Elmer's<00:02:47.570> glue<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:49.600> just<00:02:50.600> layer<00:02:51.320> paper

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
just Elmer's glue and just layer paper

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.190 
just Elmer's glue and just layer paper
upon<00:02:52.070> another<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.760> let<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:53.720> dry<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:53.959> gets

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
upon another and let it dry and gets

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.990 
upon another and let it dry and gets
really<00:02:54.590> hard<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.070> if<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.430> want<00:02:55.670> an<00:02:55.790> even

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
really hard and if you want an even

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.270 
really hard and if you want an even
harder<00:02:56.239> you<00:02:56.510> can<00:02:56.630> use<00:02:56.810> super<00:02:57.049> glue<00:02:57.280> those

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
harder you can use super glue those

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.890 
harder you can use super glue those
things<00:02:58.519> work<00:02:58.850> great<00:02:59.150> especially<00:02:59.540> when<00:02:59.780> you're

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
things work great especially when you're

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.090 
things work great especially when you're
making<00:03:00.110> small<00:03:00.260> stuff<00:03:00.650> like<00:03:01.390> like<00:03:02.390> cartridges

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
making small stuff like like cartridges

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.710 
making small stuff like like cartridges
like<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.250> written<00:03:04.519> parts<00:03:06.580> these<00:03:07.580> are

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
like the written parts these are

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.630 
like the written parts these are
reusable<00:03:08.720> cartridges<00:03:09.350> also<00:03:10.250> made<00:03:10.400> out<00:03:10.519> of

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
reusable cartridges also made out of

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.900 
reusable cartridges also made out of
paper<00:03:11.110> it's<00:03:12.110> pretty<00:03:13.100> much<00:03:13.220> like<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.430> real<00:03:13.580> thing

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
paper it's pretty much like a real thing

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.130 
paper it's pretty much like a real thing
you<00:03:14.570> can<00:03:14.750> insert<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:16.280> take<00:03:16.850> out<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.030> primer<00:03:17.810> so

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
you can insert and take out a primer so

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.890 
you can insert and take out a primer so
I<00:03:19.040> don't<00:03:19.820> have<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.030> make<00:03:20.239> it<00:03:20.390> every<00:03:20.600> single

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
I don't have to make it every single

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.960 
I don't have to make it every single
time<00:03:21.049> I<00:03:21.290> shoot<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.739> I<00:03:21.950> can<00:03:22.280> just<00:03:22.459> pop<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.790> thing

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
time I shoot it I can just pop the thing

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.000 
time I shoot it I can just pop the thing
pop<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.510> fireman<00:03:23.870> out<00:03:23.959> and<00:03:24.200> insert<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.590> new<00:03:24.799> one

pop the fireman out and insert a new one
pour<00:03:25.370> powder<00:03:25.549> and<00:03:26.060> then<00:03:26.180> it's<00:03:27.019> good<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.290> go

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
pour powder and then it's good to go

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.050 
pour powder and then it's good to go
the<00:03:28.100> bullets<00:03:28.430> are<00:03:28.700> just<00:03:28.850> colored<00:03:29.840> pencils

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
the bullets are just colored pencils

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.050 
the bullets are just colored pencils
painted<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.950> it's<00:03:34.220> got<00:03:34.400> little<00:03:34.549> wings<00:03:34.820> in<00:03:34.970> the

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
painted and it's got little wings in the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.460 
painted and it's got little wings in the
back<00:03:35.209> because<00:03:35.470> for<00:03:36.470> an<00:03:37.130> escape<00:03:37.850> ability<00:03:38.470> and

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
back because for an escape ability and

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.120 
back because for an escape ability and
since<00:03:39.860> this<00:03:40.340> rifle<00:03:40.640> doesn't<00:03:41.120> have<00:03:41.299> a<00:03:41.329> rifling

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
since this rifle doesn't have a rifling

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.590 
since this rifle doesn't have a rifling
because<00:03:43.130> at<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.730> time<00:03:43.880> when<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.120> made<00:03:44.329> this<00:03:44.450> I

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
because at the time when I made this I

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.509 
because at the time when I made this I
didn't<00:03:44.810> know<00:03:45.110> how<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:45.320> put<00:03:45.739> rifling<00:03:46.040> in<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.340> but

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
didn't know how to put rifling in it but

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.310 
didn't know how to put rifling in it but
now<00:03:46.850> I<00:03:46.880> figured<00:03:47.239> it<00:03:47.329> out<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:47.690> next<00:03:47.989> one's<00:03:48.200> gonna

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
now I figured it out so next one's gonna

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.039 
now I figured it out so next one's gonna
be<00:03:49.000> ultra<00:03:50.320> accurate<00:03:52.329> pretty<00:03:53.329> much<00:03:53.480> this<00:03:53.780> thing

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
be ultra accurate pretty much this thing

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.750 
be ultra accurate pretty much this thing
is<00:03:54.079> pretty<00:03:54.320> much<00:03:54.410> like<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.620> musket

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
is pretty much like a musket

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.039 
is pretty much like a musket
we<00:03:55.879> accept<00:03:56.810> just<00:03:56.959> faster<00:03:57.409> loading<00:03:57.970> like<00:03:59.049> I'm

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
we accept just faster loading like I'm

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.140 
we accept just faster loading like I'm
not<00:04:00.290> gonna<00:04:00.470> shoot<00:04:00.860> it<00:04:01.400> here<00:04:01.790> but<00:04:01.970> I'll<00:04:02.060> just

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
not gonna shoot it here but I'll just
