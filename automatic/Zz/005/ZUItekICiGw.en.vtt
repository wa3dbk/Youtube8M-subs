the the timer okay you can see that now
let's<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.730> see<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.660> did<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.379> did<00:00:49.620> it

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
let's just see what this did that did it

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.459 
let's just see what this did that did it
in<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.190> think<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:51.120> was<00:00:51.590> ran<00:00:52.590> about<00:00:54.110> 12<00:00:55.110> minutes

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
in I think it was ran about 12 minutes

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.500 
in I think it was ran about 12 minutes
something<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.699> twelve<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.449> half

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
something like that twelve and a half

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.920 
something like that twelve and a half
minutes<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.140> think<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.469> was<00:01:02.510> too<00:01:03.510> almost

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
minutes I think it was too almost

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.960 
minutes I think it was too almost
boiling<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.619> rolling<00:01:05.159> boil<00:01:05.369> was<00:01:05.580> something

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
boiling a rolling boil was something

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.469 
boiling a rolling boil was something
like<00:01:06.119> thirteen<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.900> half<00:01:06.930> minutes<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:09.360> I'm

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
like thirteen and a half minutes so I'm

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.899 
like thirteen and a half minutes so I'm
just<00:01:09.659> curious<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.260> see<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:11.400> do<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.760> on

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
just curious to see what I can do it on

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.679 
just curious to see what I can do it on
mine<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.360> thought<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.869> was<00:01:12.990> about<00:01:13.080> 210<00:01:14.479> I'm<00:01:15.479> just

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
boring but it's purely for comparison

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.870 
boring but it's purely for comparison

here that's the setup it's just got you
know<00:02:12.530> coupler<00:02:13.580> bits<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.730> stick<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.239> stick<00:02:15.510> in

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
know coupler bits a stick and a stick in

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.710 
know coupler bits a stick and a stick in
it<00:02:16.970> that's<00:02:17.970> it

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
okay so you know the setup I'm gonna go

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.940 
okay so you know the setup I'm gonna go
back<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:25.070> it<00:02:25.160> leaves<00:02:25.310> me<00:02:25.460> hands-free<00:02:29.620> this<00:02:30.620> I

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
back so it leaves me hands-free this I

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.830 
back so it leaves me hands-free this I
can<00:02:31.400> see<00:02:31.730> what<00:02:31.880> I'm<00:02:31.970> doing<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:36.190> let's<00:02:37.190> see<00:02:37.840> see

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
can see what I'm doing and let's see see

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:56.620 
can see what I'm doing and let's see see
ya<00:02:39.020> we<00:02:39.260> go<00:02:39.410> with<00:02:39.620> that

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.000 

slightly<00:02:57.630> windier<00:02:58.080> today<00:02:58.380> than<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.650> was<00:02:58.680> last

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
slightly windier today than it was last

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.950 
slightly windier today than it was last
night<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.120> don't<00:03:03.360> know<00:03:03.420> when<00:03:03.570> that's<00:03:03.780> going

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
night so I don't know when that's going

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.010 
night so I don't know when that's going
to<00:03:04.080> affect<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.590> time<00:03:05.210> I'll<00:03:06.210> make<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:06.930> then

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
to affect the time I'll make it and then

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:19.350 
to affect the time I'll make it and then
a<00:03:07.080> slower<00:03:07.440> but<00:03:07.680> we'll<00:03:07.860> safe

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.460 

two<00:03:20.360> minutes<00:03:20.720> so<00:03:21.500> far<00:03:21.530> two<00:03:21.920> minutes<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:23.470> 40

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
two minutes so far two minutes and 40

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:44.770 
two minutes so far two minutes and 40
seconds<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:26.630> catchin

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.440 

like<00:03:45.380> I<00:03:45.410> said<00:03:45.590> this<00:03:45.830> is<00:03:46.010> going<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.430> probably<00:03:47.150> be

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
like I said this is going to probably be

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:56.710 
like I said this is going to probably be
a<00:03:47.630> boring<00:03:47.960> video<00:03:54.970> but<00:03:55.970> I<00:03:56.000> thought<00:03:56.210> I'll<00:03:56.390> put<00:03:56.420> my

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
a boring video but I thought I'll put my

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.200 
a boring video but I thought I'll put my
money<00:03:56.840> where<00:03:56.990> my<00:03:57.230> mouth<00:03:57.260> is<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:57.680> just<00:03:57.980> see<00:03:58.210> if

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
money where my mouth is and just see if

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:14.880 
money where my mouth is and just see if
I<00:03:59.360> can<00:03:59.390> treat<00:03:59.720> this<00:03:59.930> time

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.819 

the<00:04:15.430> water<00:04:15.640> was<00:04:16.030> cold<00:04:16.540> by<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:16.900> way<00:04:17.140> I<00:04:17.350> never

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
the water was cold by the way I never

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.050 
the water was cold by the way I never
thought<00:04:18.010> I<00:04:18.220> should<00:04:18.370> have<00:04:18.430> checked<00:04:18.640> probably

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
thought I should have checked probably

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.810 
thought I should have checked probably
prove<00:04:19.780> that<00:04:19.989> and<00:04:20.200> shown<00:04:20.410> you<00:04:20.560> but<00:04:20.709> I've<00:04:21.579> never

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
prove that and shown you but I've never

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.080 
prove that and shown you but I've never
thought<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.240> do<00:04:22.390> that<00:04:23.340> but<00:04:24.340> it<00:04:24.430> was<00:04:24.550> cold<00:04:24.850> water

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
thought to do that but it was cold water

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.730 
thought to do that but it was cold water
I<00:04:25.270> can<00:04:25.450> assure<00:04:25.540> you<00:04:25.750> I<00:04:26.400> certainly<00:04:27.400> won't<00:04:28.740> cheat

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
I can assure you I certainly won't cheat

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.530 
I can assure you I certainly won't cheat
myself<00:04:30.160> but<00:04:30.370> hang<00:04:30.730> on

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.270

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
that can't be boiling already surely to

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:44.670 
that can't be boiling already surely to
God<00:04:37.290> where's<00:04:38.290> my<00:04:38.410> thing<00:04:38.470> quick<00:04:43.080> nice<00:04:44.080> no<00:04:44.530> it's

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
not boiling yet Atlas making noises

00:04:46.960 --> 00:05:32.180 
not boiling yet Atlas making noises
there's<00:04:47.710> been<00:04:47.950> four<00:04:48.190> minutes

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.330

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.110 

I<00:05:47.979> think<00:05:48.979> when<00:05:49.070> I<00:05:49.100> stopped<00:05:49.520> the<00:05:49.610> watch<00:05:49.759> last

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.590 
I think when I stopped the watch last
night<00:05:50.419> on<00:05:51.169> the<00:05:51.410> stove<00:05:51.680> tech<00:05:52.389> raucous<00:05:53.389> though

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.300 
I think it's about five minutes I've
stopped<00:06:16.100> it<00:06:16.449> five<00:06:17.449> minutes<00:06:18.250> and<00:06:19.250> 27<00:06:19.940> seconds

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310
