00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.000 
that's the little ghetto city of
Winterhold<00:00:20.810> so<00:00:21.810> what<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.619> do<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.980> just

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
Winterhold so what you do is you just

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.490 
Winterhold so what you do is you just
run<00:00:23.670> up<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.000> stairs<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.840> would<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:25.170> someone

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
run up the stairs that would be someone

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.830 
run up the stairs that would be someone
standing<00:00:25.949> here<00:00:26.220> dark<00:00:27.060> shirt<00:00:27.390> like<00:00:27.630> yeah<00:00:27.810> I

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
standing here dark shirt like yeah I

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.599 
standing here dark shirt like yeah I
would<00:00:28.019> like<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.320> enter<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:29.039> doesn't<00:00:29.400> and

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
would like to enter it doesn't and

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.640 
would like to enter it doesn't and
unlike<00:00:30.390> what<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.660> do<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.109> shoot<00:00:31.410> over

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
unlike what you do is you shoot over

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.729 
unlike what you do is you shoot over
here<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:33.030> think<00:00:33.390> what<00:00:33.630> she<00:00:33.809> asks<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.530> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
here and I think what she asks you to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.860 
here and I think what she asks you to
shoot<00:00:34.950> over<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:35.489> depends<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.059> what<00:00:36.719> you

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
shoot over here depends on what you

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.049 
shoot over here depends on what you
