00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
there's no behind-the-scenes there's

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.750 
there's no behind-the-scenes there's
nothing<00:06:47.680> of<00:06:47.800> the<00:06:47.920> sort<00:06:48.100> which<00:06:48.370> I<00:06:48.460> really

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:48.760 
nothing of the sort which I really

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.430 
nothing of the sort which I really
thought<00:06:48.940> Funimation<00:06:49.630> would<00:06:49.870> do<00:06:50.080> I<00:06:50.110> mean

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
thought Funimation would do I mean

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.070 
thought Funimation would do I mean
Dragon<00:06:51.160> Ball<00:06:51.280> Z<00:06:51.460> Kai<00:06:51.700> part<00:06:52.090> 4<00:06:52.360> they<00:06:52.690> had<00:06:52.840> some

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
Dragon Ball Z Kai part 4 they had some

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.960 
Dragon Ball Z Kai part 4 they had some
little<00:06:53.260> a<00:06:53.410> behind<00:06:53.680> scene<00:06:53.890> extras<00:06:54.220> on<00:06:54.340> that<00:06:54.550> and

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
little a behind scene extras on that and

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.060 
little a behind scene extras on that and
I<00:06:55.060> really<00:06:55.300> think<00:06:55.510> that<00:06:55.630> if<00:06:55.990> you<00:06:56.320> have<00:06:56.530> an<00:06:56.680> anime

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.070 
I really think that if you have an anime

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.460 
I really think that if you have an anime
that<00:06:57.580> is<00:06:57.790> already<00:06:58.150> released<00:06:58.360> fully<00:06:59.050> in<00:06:59.260> one

00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.470 
that is already released fully in one

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:00.840 
that is already released fully in one
format<00:06:59.890> and<00:07:00.130> if<00:07:00.340> you're<00:07:00.520> going<00:07:00.670> to<00:07:00.760> do<00:07:00.820> a

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:00.850 
format and if you're going to do a

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.490 
format and if you're going to do a
rerelease<00:07:01.390> on<00:07:01.630> blu-ray<00:07:01.870> you<00:07:02.140> might<00:07:02.320> as<00:07:02.470> well

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
rerelease on blu-ray you might as well

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.010 
rerelease on blu-ray you might as well
