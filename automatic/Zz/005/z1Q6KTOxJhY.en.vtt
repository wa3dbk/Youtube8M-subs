hey guys so part of the disheveled look
I'm<00:00:41.450> off<00:00:41.630> to<00:00:41.810> bed<00:00:41.900> and<00:00:42.500> also<00:00:43.100> ignore<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:43.970> noise

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
I'm off to bed and also ignore the noise

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.880 
I'm off to bed and also ignore the noise
and<00:00:45.050> it's<00:00:45.380> like<00:00:45.620> fan<00:00:46.100> that<00:00:46.520> I<00:00:46.550> own

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.589 
up at work can you imagine sit in that
spam<00:02:55.709> or<00:02:55.830> financing<00:02:56.340> love<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.910> then<00:02:57.330> I<00:02:57.360> can

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
spam or financing love and then I can

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.869 
spam or financing love and then I can
never<00:02:57.810> be<00:02:58.019> bothered<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.440> put<00:02:58.650> them<00:02:58.800> back<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.190> so

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
never be bothered to put them back in so

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.059 
never be bothered to put them back in so
this<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.450> my<00:03:00.780> hair<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.140> shrinks<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.680> lot<00:03:01.890> it

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
this is my hair it shrinks a lot it

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.400 
this is my hair it shrinks a lot it
shrinks<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.580> whole<00:03:02.940> lot<00:03:06.019> but<00:03:07.019> you<00:03:07.230> can

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
shrinks a whole lot but you can

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.949 
shrinks a whole lot but you can
definitely<00:03:07.709> see<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.519> difference<00:03:08.730> I've<00:03:09.720> got

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
definitely see the difference I've got

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.350 
definitely see the difference I've got
some<00:03:10.170> condition<00:03:10.680> conditioner<00:03:11.550> so<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:11.880> took<00:03:12.030> up

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
some condition conditioner so I took up

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.130 
some condition conditioner so I took up
to<00:03:12.569> breathe<00:03:13.130> right<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:15.120> think<00:03:15.150> let's<00:03:15.780> let's

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
to breathe right and I think let's let's

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.990 
to breathe right and I think let's let's
look<00:03:16.260> at<00:03:16.440> this<00:03:16.650> one<00:03:16.709> here<00:03:16.950> because<00:03:17.550> it<00:03:17.670> really

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
look at this one here because it really

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.839 
look at this one here because it really
demonstrates<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:20.040> difference<00:03:20.549> in<00:03:20.700> my

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
demonstrates the difference in my

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.699 
demonstrates the difference in my
texture<00:03:21.330> so<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.630> can<00:03:21.840> see<00:03:21.989> how<00:03:22.019> thick<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.650> is

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
texture so you can see how thick it is

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.699 
texture so you can see how thick it is
and<00:03:23.150> then<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.299> kind<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.660> like<00:03:24.900> tapers<00:03:25.530> out

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
and then it kind of like tapers out

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.039 
and then it kind of like tapers out
tables<00:03:26.489> out<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:26.790> mean<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.180> still<00:03:27.720> some

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
tables out I mean this is still some

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.430 
tables out I mean this is still some
braids<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:28.680> it's<00:03:29.340> not<00:03:29.760> too<00:03:30.239> it's<00:03:30.690> not<00:03:30.900> too<00:03:31.170> bad

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
braids so it's not too it's not too bad

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.479 
braids so it's not too it's not too bad
but<00:03:32.209> let's<00:03:33.209> look<00:03:33.329> at<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.569> other<00:03:33.599> one<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:35.340> I've

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
but let's look at the other one so I've

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.550 
but let's look at the other one so I've
got<00:03:35.700> some<00:03:36.239> conditioner<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.079> like<00:03:37.200> i<00:03:37.260> said<00:03:37.530> i

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
got some conditioner in it like i said i

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.740 
got some conditioner in it like i said i
was<00:03:37.799> just<00:03:37.920> playing<00:03:38.160> with<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.640> i<00:03:38.670> took<00:03:38.970> these

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
was just playing with it i took these

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.030 
was just playing with it i took these
pieces<00:03:40.049> out<00:03:40.349> and<00:03:40.590> i<00:03:40.709> was<00:03:40.890> just<00:03:41.390> curious<00:03:43.040> so

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
pieces out and i was just curious so

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.830 
pieces out and i was just curious so
just<00:03:44.340> taking<00:03:44.519> out<00:03:44.700> some<00:03:45.269> hair

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
just taking out some hair

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.399 
just taking out some hair
so<00:03:48.640> this<00:03:49.640> is<00:03:49.909> a<00:03:49.939> lot<00:03:50.239> better<00:03:50.450> you<00:03:50.689> can<00:03:51.019> see<00:03:51.230> the

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
so this is a lot better you can see the

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:52.929 
so this is a lot better you can see the
fact<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.769> my<00:03:51.950> hair<00:03:52.159> is<00:03:52.189> actually<00:03:52.430> being

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:52.939 
fact that my hair is actually being

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.600 
fact that my hair is actually being
trimmed<00:03:53.239> here<00:03:53.709> but<00:03:54.709> okay<00:03:54.980> here<00:03:55.189> we<00:03:55.310> go

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.240 

it's<00:03:58.180> kind<00:03:58.840> it's<00:03:59.260> thicker<00:03:59.650> and<00:04:00.040> curlier

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
it's kind it's thicker and curlier

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.510 
it's kind it's thicker and curlier
towards<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.600> roots<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.380> then<00:04:03.070> you<00:04:03.190> get<00:04:03.370> the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
towards the roots and then you get the

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.070 
towards the roots and then you get the
ends<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.210> then<00:04:04.450> they<00:04:04.660> look<00:04:04.840> like<00:04:05.050> that<00:04:05.520> and

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
ends and then they look like that and

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.810 
ends and then they look like that and
it's<00:04:08.080> really<00:04:08.380> not<00:04:08.650> as<00:04:08.830> bad<00:04:08.860> as<00:04:09.130> you<00:04:09.430> used<00:04:09.730> to

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
it's really not as bad as you used to

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.880 
it's really not as bad as you used to
because<00:04:10.300> if<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.660> look<00:04:10.810> at<00:04:10.960> this<00:04:11.320> it<00:04:11.590> still

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
because if you look at this it still

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.580 
because if you look at this it still
curls<00:04:12.190> up<00:04:12.460> but<00:04:13.450> compared<00:04:13.930> to<00:04:13.990> my<00:04:14.260> rates

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
curls up but compared to my rates

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.099 
curls up but compared to my rates
there's<00:04:15.460> a<00:04:15.580> massive<00:04:15.910> massive<00:04:16.660> massive

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
there's a massive massive massive

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.270 
there's a massive massive massive
difference<00:04:17.530> I<00:04:18.720> know<00:04:19.720> that<00:04:20.109> ultimately<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:21.130> am

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
difference I know that ultimately I am

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.420 
difference I know that ultimately I am
going<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.180> have<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.540> cut<00:04:22.870> off<00:04:23.140> about<00:04:24.960> that<00:04:25.960> much

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
going to have to cut off about that much

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.100 
going to have to cut off about that much
but<00:04:27.430> there's<00:04:27.700> no<00:04:27.880> ending<00:04:28.360> that<00:04:28.540> now<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:28.960> do

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
but there's no ending that now and do

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.050 
but there's no ending that now and do
this<00:04:29.350> thing<00:04:29.410> work<00:04:29.860> just<00:04:30.160> don't<00:04:30.520> trim<00:04:30.820> my

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
this thing work just don't trim my

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.150 
this thing work just don't trim my
heather<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.720> Talia<00:04:32.080> I've<00:04:32.260> got<00:04:32.470> another<00:04:32.770> split

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
heather and Talia I've got another split

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.350 
heather and Talia I've got another split
ends<00:04:33.460> it's<00:04:33.610> not<00:04:33.730> something<00:04:34.090> that<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:34.270> would

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
ends it's not something that I would

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.110 
ends it's not something that I would
recommend<00:04:34.810> for<00:04:35.169> anyone<00:04:35.590> but<00:04:36.550> it's<00:04:36.730> just<00:04:36.940> like
