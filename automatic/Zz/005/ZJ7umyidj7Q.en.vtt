00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
might find pretty cool I thought it was

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.730 
might find pretty cool I thought it was
pretty<00:00:10.110> awesome<00:00:10.969> and<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.349> in<00:00:13.349> knowing<00:00:13.710> that

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
pretty awesome and that in knowing that

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.410 
pretty awesome and that in knowing that

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
snapshots or anything like that I'm just

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.620 
snapshots or anything like that I'm just
using<00:00:22.519> one<00:00:23.519> point<00:00:23.820> two<00:00:24.000> point<00:00:24.180> five<00:00:24.390> at<00:00:24.570> the

using one point two point five at the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.870 
using one point two point five at the
moment<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.080> I'm<00:00:25.199> still<00:00:25.439> not<00:00:26.160> even<00:00:26.490> using<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
moment so I'm still not even using the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.550 
moment so I'm still not even using the
pressure<00:00:27.090> plates<00:00:27.359> at<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.689> moment<00:00:28.050> I'm<00:00:28.500> not

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
pressure plates at the moment I'm not

pressure plate some trip wires so yet

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.260 
pressure plate some trip wires so yet
there's<00:00:31.980> no<00:00:32.099> tree<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.489> think<00:00:32.820> if<00:00:32.969> there's<00:00:33.149> no

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
there's no tree I think if there's no

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.160 
there's no tree I think if there's no
pressure<00:00:33.510> plates

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
pressure plates

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.819 
pressure plates
there's<00:00:34.680> no<00:00:35.840> proximity<00:00:36.840> detectors<00:00:37.290> as<00:00:37.500> far<00:00:37.710> as

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
there's no proximity detectors as far as

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.860 
there's no proximity detectors as far as
like<00:00:38.010> animals<00:00:38.430> or<00:00:38.730> there's<00:00:39.390> no<00:00:39.480> while<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:39.840> a

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
like animals or there's no while it's a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.930 
like animals or there's no while it's a
redstone<00:00:40.170> or<00:00:40.410> any<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.760> is

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
redstone or any of that and this is

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.760 
redstone or any of that and this is
something<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.809> don't<00:00:43.140> know<00:00:43.379> if<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:43.620> been

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
something that I don't know if it's been

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.799 
something that I don't know if it's been
done<00:00:43.920> before<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.180> see<00:00:45.329> here<00:00:45.600> there's

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
done before as you can see here there's

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.100 
done before as you can see here there's
a<00:00:45.870> number<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.460> colors<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.789> as<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.030> step<00:00:48.329> onto

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
a number of colors and as you step onto

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.240 
a number of colors and as you step onto
them<00:00:49.320> they<00:00:50.510> quite<00:00:51.510> slowly<00:00:52.010> turn<00:00:53.010> into

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
them they quite slowly turn into

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.250 
them they quite slowly turn into
something<00:00:53.489> else<00:00:53.610> right<00:00:54.360> now<00:00:54.420> I'm<00:00:54.690> doing<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
something else right now I'm doing the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.990 
something else right now I'm doing the
combination<00:00:55.800> which<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.039> blue<00:00:56.370> yellow<00:00:59.359> purple

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
combination which is blue yellow purple

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.100 
combination which is blue yellow purple
get<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.120> wait<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> second<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.899> don't

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
get it wait a second just so I don't

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.929 
get it wait a second just so I don't
accidentally<00:01:04.470> press<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> wrong<00:01:05.040> ones<00:01:05.280> your

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
wife the thing the wife wrote to UM to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.969 
wife the thing the wife wrote to UM to
trigger<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.689> such<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.500> doesn't<00:01:10.830> make

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
trigger and such so that it doesn't make

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.210 
trigger and such so that it doesn't make
a<00:01:11.060> accidently<00:01:12.060> press<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> wrong<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:13.220> it's

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
just a way that it's made it's also in

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.740 
just a way that it's made it's also in
peaceful<00:01:16.560> mode<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:16.979> there's<00:01:17.490> no<00:01:17.750> animals

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
peaceful mode so there's no animals

anything more for ideas red come over

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:42.890 
anything more for ideas red come over
there<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:33.140> men<00:01:34.729> green

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.620 

and<00:01:43.900> that's<00:01:44.050> it<00:01:46.350> pretty<00:01:47.350> awesome<00:01:47.530> I<00:01:47.950> thought

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
and that's it pretty awesome I thought

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.140 
and that's it pretty awesome I thought
now<00:01:49.630> how<00:01:50.020> did<00:01:50.200> I<00:01:50.290> do<00:01:50.350> it<00:01:50.700> stick<00:01:51.700> around<00:01:51.850> and

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
now how did I do it stick around and

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
now how did I do it stick around and
find<00:01:52.420> out<00:01:56.550> how<00:01:57.550> cool<00:01:57.790> is<00:01:58.000> that<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.360> basics<00:01:58.930> of

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
find out how cool is that the basics of

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.130 
find out how cool is that the basics of
how<00:01:59.440> it<00:01:59.710> works<00:01:59.980> is<00:02:00.630> initially<00:02:01.630> we<00:02:01.660> had<00:02:01.960> two

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
how it works is initially we had two

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.030 
how it works is initially we had two
primary<00:02:02.650> if<00:02:02.710> you<00:02:02.830> recall<00:02:03.160> and<00:02:03.420> that's<00:02:05.040> through

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
primary if you recall and that's through

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.120 
primary if you recall and that's through
a<00:02:06.070> bottle<00:02:06.520> of<00:02:06.550> enchanting<00:02:07.120> now<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.830> great

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
a bottle of enchanting now the great

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.560 
a bottle of enchanting now the great
thing<00:02:09.310> about<00:02:09.369> experience<00:02:09.970> orbs<00:02:10.179> as<00:02:10.300> you<00:02:10.450> can

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
thing about experience orbs as you can

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.960 
thing about experience orbs as you can
see<00:02:10.750> is<00:02:10.899> they<00:02:11.170> they<00:02:11.980> are<00:02:12.130> able<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.430> move<00:02:12.670> fast

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
see is they they are able to move fast

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.360 
see is they they are able to move fast
on<00:02:13.270> ice<00:02:13.590> which<00:02:14.590> allows<00:02:14.860> us<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.100> be<00:02:15.190> able<00:02:15.250> to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
on ice which allows us to be able to

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.570 
on ice which allows us to be able to
move<00:02:15.490> around<00:02:15.700> with<00:02:16.000> them<00:02:16.180> quicker<00:02:17.430> but<00:02:18.430> also

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
move around with them quicker but also

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.890 
move around with them quicker but also
they<00:02:18.880> are<00:02:18.910> able<00:02:19.630> to<00:02:19.660> knock<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.080> pressure<00:02:20.350> plate

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
they are able to knock a pressure plate

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.490 
they are able to knock a pressure plate
so<00:02:22.900> as<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.320> walk<00:02:23.590> backwards<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:26.310> forwards<00:02:28.500> this

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
so as I walk backwards and forwards this

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.860 
so as I walk backwards and forwards this
orb<00:02:29.800> is<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.220> knocking<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.880> thing<00:02:31.090> it's<00:02:31.690> quite

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
orb is is knocking the thing it's quite

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.780 
orb is is knocking the thing it's quite
easy<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.260> if<00:02:32.680> you're<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:32.890> mapmaker<00:02:33.130> place<00:02:33.760> a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
easy to if you're a mapmaker place a

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.330 
easy to if you're a mapmaker place a
bottle<00:02:34.180> of<00:02:34.240> enchanting<00:02:34.720> somewhere<00:02:35.160> out<00:02:36.160> of

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
bottle of enchanting somewhere out of

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.720 
bottle of enchanting somewhere out of
reach<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.970> make<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.080> knock<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.800> trap<00:02:39.550> or

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
reach and make it knock a trap or

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.210 
reach and make it knock a trap or
something<00:02:40.090> it's<00:02:40.690> also<00:02:40.840> possible<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.380> have<00:02:41.560> a

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
something it's also possible to have a

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.590 
something it's also possible to have a
set<00:02:44.310> place<00:02:45.310> places<00:02:45.760> where<00:02:46.090> they<00:02:46.180> have<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.420> walk

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
set place places where they have to walk

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.440 
set place places where they have to walk
so<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:47.260> mean<00:02:48.010> I'm<00:02:48.220> one<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:49.030> make<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.209> lot<00:02:49.420> of

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
so I mean I'm one to make a lot of

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.060 
so I mean I'm one to make a lot of
minefields<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.230> such<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:50.890> this<00:02:51.010> is

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
minefields and such and and this is

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.070 
minefields and such and and this is
something<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:52.180> would<00:02:52.300> actually<00:02:52.360> be<00:02:52.840> able<00:02:52.959> to

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
something that would actually be able to

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.930 
something that would actually be able to
trigger<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:53.440> minefield<00:02:53.920> sort<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.400> situation

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
trigger a minefield sort of a situation

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.140 
trigger a minefield sort of a situation
where<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:55.870> have<00:02:56.050> pressure<00:02:56.380> plates<00:02:57.150> around

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
where you have pressure plates around

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.540 
where you have pressure plates around
and<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.660> person<00:02:58.959> has<00:02:59.080> to<00:02:59.110> walk<00:02:59.550> carefully

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
and the person has to walk carefully

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.390 
and the person has to walk carefully
along<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:01.930> very<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.500> red<00:03:02.709> stoning<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.160> very

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
along it so very the red stoning is very

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.100 
along it so very the red stoning is very
light<00:03:03.670> like<00:03:04.120> pretty<00:03:04.540> much<00:03:04.570> all<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:04.780> have<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.080> a

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
light like pretty much all I have is a

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.949 
light like pretty much all I have is a
wire<00:03:05.440> border<00:03:06.370> through<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.580> wall<00:03:06.730> wire<00:03:07.570> coming

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
wire border through the wall wire coming

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.979 
wire border through the wall wire coming
through<00:03:08.200> there<00:03:08.410> which<00:03:09.010> hits<00:03:09.570> torch<00:03:10.570> which

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
through there which hits torch which

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.220 
through there which hits torch which
it's<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.290> torch<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:12.010> lights<00:03:12.940> that<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:14.080> can

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
it's a torch and lights that and you can

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.120 
it's a torch and lights that and you can
also<00:03:14.350> lead<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.920> off<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:16.989> lock<00:03:17.470> mechanism

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
also lead that off to a lock mechanism

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.000 
also lead that off to a lock mechanism
like<00:03:18.340> what<00:03:18.519> I<00:03:18.549> had<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:20.140> I'll<00:03:20.260> show<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.620> that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
like what I had and I'll show you that

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.660 
like what I had and I'll show you that
let's<00:03:21.280> go<00:03:21.430> back<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.940> we're<00:03:22.750> back<00:03:22.900> inside<00:03:23.670> and

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
let's go back to we're back inside and

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.060 
let's go back to we're back inside and
falling<00:03:25.239> down<00:03:25.360> already<00:03:25.570> this<00:03:26.380> is<00:03:26.560> where<00:03:26.799> our

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
falling down already this is where our

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.390 
falling down already this is where our
other<00:03:27.940> system<00:03:28.360> is<00:03:28.510> in<00:03:28.600> place<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.350> we<00:03:30.160> still

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
other system is in place and we still

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.520 
other system is in place and we still
have<00:03:30.519> this<00:03:30.640> in<00:03:30.820> here<00:03:31.450> I<00:03:31.570> haven't<00:03:31.840> primed<00:03:32.140> it<00:03:32.350> so

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
have this in here I haven't primed it so

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.940 
have this in here I haven't primed it so
we<00:03:32.709> won't<00:03:32.950> get<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.459> things<00:03:34.590> coming<00:03:35.590> through

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
we won't get the things coming through

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.250 
we won't get the things coming through
but<00:03:36.580> let<00:03:36.760> me<00:03:36.850> show<00:03:37.060> you<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.600> basics<00:03:38.080> of<00:03:38.200> how

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
but let me show you the basics of how

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.240 
but let me show you the basics of how
this<00:03:38.470> works<00:03:38.739> so<00:03:40.260> with<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.500> initial<00:03:42.010> trigger

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
this works so with the initial trigger

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.060 
this works so with the initial trigger
which<00:03:42.519> is<00:03:42.549> coming<00:03:42.970> through<00:03:43.150> there<00:03:43.390> I<00:03:44.350> sent<00:03:44.860> out

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
which is coming through there I sent out

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.280 
which is coming through there I sent out
four<00:03:45.730> shots<00:03:46.090> with<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.480> thing<00:03:46.660> just<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.019> that

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
four shots with the thing just so that

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.530 
four shots with the thing just so that
was<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.470> heap<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:47.799> them<00:03:47.950> coming<00:03:48.160> through

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
was a heap of them coming through

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.570 
was a heap of them coming through
possibly<00:03:50.230> would<00:03:50.680> probably<00:03:51.040> still<00:03:51.250> work<00:03:51.400> with

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
possibly would probably still work with

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.490 
possibly would probably still work with
just<00:03:51.790> one<00:03:51.940> I<00:03:52.180> just<00:03:52.210> wanted<00:03:52.570> to<00:03:52.720> see<00:03:52.900> how<00:03:53.020> fast<00:03:53.260> I

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
just one I just wanted to see how fast I

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.460 
just one I just wanted to see how fast I
was<00:03:53.530> working<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:55.150> as<00:03:55.300> you<00:03:55.480> saw<00:03:55.690> with<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.050> demo

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
was working and as you saw with the demo

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.440 
was working and as you saw with the demo
outside<00:03:56.920> it<00:03:57.160> works<00:03:57.340> just<00:03:57.610> fine<00:03:57.730> on<00:03:58.180> its<00:03:58.330> own

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
outside it works just fine on its own

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.350 
outside it works just fine on its own
now<00:03:59.050> each<00:03:59.320> one<00:03:59.530> of<00:03:59.590> these<00:03:59.970> sends<00:04:00.970> out<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.120> signal

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
now each one of these sends out a signal

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.930 
now each one of these sends out a signal
when<00:04:01.900> so<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.350> pressure<00:04:02.560> plate<00:04:02.800> is<00:04:02.920> here<00:04:03.190> it

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
when so the pressure plate is here it

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.580 
when so the pressure plate is here it
sends<00:04:04.210> a<00:04:04.300> signal<00:04:04.540> here<00:04:04.870> which<00:04:05.020> disables<00:04:05.320> that

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
sends a signal here which disables that

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.210 
sends a signal here which disables that
torch<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.930> here<00:04:08.170> is<00:04:08.200> CNB<00:04:08.710> minecraft

some<00:04:10.140> combination<00:04:11.140> lock<00:04:11.320> I'll<00:04:11.470> leave<00:04:11.650> a<00:04:11.680> link

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
some combination lock I'll leave a link

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.520 
some combination lock I'll leave a link
to<00:04:11.980> that<00:04:12.160> it's<00:04:12.790> based<00:04:13.570> off<00:04:13.750> kids<00:04:14.020> anyway

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
to that it's based off kids anyway

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.270 
to that it's based off kids anyway
and<00:04:14.820> so<00:04:15.820> I<00:04:16.239> have<00:04:16.989> five<00:04:17.350> or<00:04:17.709> five<00:04:18.010> years<00:04:18.220> I

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
and so I have five or five years I

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.650 
and so I have five or five years I
haven't<00:04:18.430> color<00:04:18.640> code<00:04:18.850> so<00:04:18.970> I<00:04:19.030> remember<00:04:19.359> always

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
haven't color code so I remember always

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.890 
haven't color code so I remember always
which<00:04:20.100> order<00:04:21.100> they're<00:04:21.280> in<00:04:21.310> but<00:04:22.210> basically<00:04:22.690> it

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
which order they're in but basically it

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.960 
which order they're in but basically it
works<00:04:23.080> such<00:04:23.470> that<00:04:24.900> if<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:26.080> was<00:04:26.290> to<00:04:26.490> as<00:04:27.490> you<00:04:27.850> can

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
works such that if I was to as you can

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.360 
works such that if I was to as you can
see<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.630> all<00:04:28.810> of<00:04:28.870> them<00:04:29.170> but<00:04:29.380> this<00:04:29.590> one<00:04:29.800> have<00:04:30.340> a

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
see that all of them but this one have a

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.040 
see that all of them but this one have a
torch<00:04:30.700> and<00:04:31.030> then<00:04:31.180> all<00:04:31.360> of<00:04:31.390> them<00:04:31.540> but<00:04:31.690> this<00:04:31.840> one

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
torch and then all of them but this one

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.500 
torch and then all of them but this one
have<00:04:32.170> a<00:04:32.200> torch<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.850> ones<00:04:34.030> that<00:04:34.180> don't<00:04:34.300> have<00:04:34.480> a

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
have a torch the ones that don't have a

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.170 
have a torch the ones that don't have a
torturer<00:04:34.960> that<00:04:35.110> are<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.380> ones<00:04:35.620> that<00:04:35.980> are<00:04:36.940> in

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
torturer that are the ones that are in

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.640 
torturer that are the ones that are in
the<00:04:37.300> combination<00:04:37.810> so<00:04:37.960> after<00:04:38.260> you<00:04:38.320> press<00:04:38.530> this

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
the combination so after you press this

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.140 
the combination so after you press this
one<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:40.240> which<00:04:40.870> is<00:04:41.020> blue<00:04:41.580> this<00:04:42.580> torch<00:04:43.060> will

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
one it which is blue this torch will

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.550 
one it which is blue this torch will
turn<00:04:43.450> on<00:04:44.280> after<00:04:45.280> this<00:04:45.370> torch<00:04:45.640> is<00:04:45.790> turned<00:04:46.030> on

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
turn on after this torch is turned on

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.050 
turn on after this torch is turned on
this<00:04:47.560> light<00:04:48.010> this<00:04:48.310> here<00:04:48.550> will<00:04:48.669> turn<00:04:48.820> on<00:04:48.970> which

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
this light this here will turn on which

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.000 
this light this here will turn on which
will<00:04:49.270> allow<00:04:49.480> this<00:04:49.720> one<00:04:49.900> to<00:04:50.020> turn<00:04:50.140> on<00:04:50.320> so<00:04:50.890> when

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
will allow this one to turn on so when

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.080 
will allow this one to turn on so when
you<00:04:51.160> press<00:04:51.430> yellow<00:04:52.240> which<00:04:52.570> is<00:04:52.950> here<00:04:53.950> this<00:04:54.880> one

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
you press yellow which is here this one

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.200 
you press yellow which is here this one
is<00:04:55.210> able<00:04:55.480> to<00:04:55.690> then<00:04:56.110> enable<00:04:56.730> able<00:04:57.730> to<00:04:57.820> enable

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
is able to then enable able to enable

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.400 
is able to then enable able to enable
and<00:04:58.540> I'm<00:04:58.840> good<00:04:59.080> at<00:04:59.140> rhyming<00:04:59.610> and<00:05:01.050> yes<00:05:02.050> I<00:05:02.260> want

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
and I'm good at rhyming and yes I want

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.280 
and I'm good at rhyming and yes I want
to<00:05:02.440> so<00:05:02.650> forth<00:05:02.860> it's<00:05:03.040> not<00:05:03.250> overly<00:05:03.790> difficult

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
to so forth it's not overly difficult

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.450 
to so forth it's not overly difficult
but<00:05:05.290> one<00:05:05.410> thing<00:05:05.650> that<00:05:05.680> I<00:05:05.830> had<00:05:05.979> to<00:05:06.100> take<00:05:06.250> into

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
but one thing that I had to take into

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.830 
but one thing that I had to take into
account<00:05:06.520> with<00:05:07.000> this<00:05:07.560> was<00:05:09.150> that<00:05:10.150> mic<00:05:10.510> signal

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
account with this was that mic signal

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.510 
account with this was that mic signal
that<00:05:11.140> was<00:05:11.200> coming<00:05:11.440> through<00:05:11.680> from<00:05:11.860> my<00:05:12.040> arsenal

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
that was coming through from my arsenal

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.880 
that was coming through from my arsenal
at<00:05:12.610> you<00:05:12.760> right<00:05:12.940> was<00:05:13.540> a<00:05:13.570> constant<00:05:13.990> signal<00:05:14.200> so

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
at you right was a constant signal so

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.350 
at you right was a constant signal so
this<00:05:15.010> here<00:05:15.340> is<00:05:15.520> a<00:05:17.100> I<00:05:18.100> don't<00:05:18.910> remember<00:05:19.030> the

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
this here is a I don't remember the

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.320 
this here is a I don't remember the
exact<00:05:19.780> name<00:05:20.140> for<00:05:20.530> it<00:05:20.650> but<00:05:21.580> pretty<00:05:21.850> much<00:05:21.970> it

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
exact name for it but pretty much it

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.550 
exact name for it but pretty much it
allows<00:05:22.540> you<00:05:22.720> to<00:05:22.870> use<00:05:24.870> levers<00:05:25.870> or<00:05:26.050> constant

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
allows you to use levers or constant

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.990 
allows you to use levers or constant
outputs<00:05:26.919> as<00:05:27.100> a<00:05:27.790> as<00:05:28.570> a<00:05:29.560> variable<00:05:30.100> signal<00:05:30.520> so

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
outputs as a as a variable signal so

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.890 
outputs as a as a variable signal so
when<00:05:31.570> I<00:05:31.600> like<00:05:32.380> this<00:05:32.560> here<00:05:32.919> this<00:05:33.040> torch<00:05:33.340> here<00:05:33.900> is

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
when I like this here this torch here is

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.310 
when I like this here this torch here is
for<00:05:35.320> when<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:36.700> signal<00:05:37.060> is<00:05:37.300> off<00:05:37.660> so<00:05:38.110> this

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
for when the the signal is off so this

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.159 
for when the the signal is off so this
is<00:05:38.500> both<00:05:38.979> of<00:05:39.130> these<00:05:39.220> lead<00:05:39.520> out<00:05:39.810> this<00:05:40.810> one's<00:05:41.020> for

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
is both of these lead out this one's for

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.600 
is both of these lead out this one's for
when<00:05:41.260> the<00:05:41.350> signals<00:05:41.680> off<00:05:41.830> this<00:05:42.130> is<00:05:42.310> for<00:05:42.520> when

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
when the signals off this is for when

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.180 
when the signals off this is for when
the<00:05:42.669> signals<00:05:43.120> on<00:05:43.440> so<00:05:44.440> it<00:05:44.500> alternates<00:05:44.919> so<00:05:45.070> it's

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
the signals on so it alternates so it's

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.570 
the signals on so it alternates so it's
almost<00:05:45.310> like<00:05:45.580> having<00:05:46.740> two<00:05:47.740> y's<00:05:47.979> I'm<00:05:48.340> not

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
almost like having two y's I'm not

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.610 
almost like having two y's I'm not
trying<00:05:48.820> to<00:05:48.880> get<00:05:49.000> too<00:05:49.540> too<00:05:50.020> crazy<00:05:50.229> into<00:05:50.530> this

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
trying to get too too crazy into this

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.010 
trying to get too too crazy into this
why<00:05:51.610> is<00:05:51.669> going<00:05:52.090> the<00:05:52.240> back<00:05:52.390> of<00:05:52.540> both<00:05:52.690> of<00:05:52.870> these

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
why is going the back of both of these

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.110 
why is going the back of both of these
and<00:05:53.410> wires<00:05:54.070> coming<00:05:54.340> out<00:05:54.490> of<00:05:54.550> those<00:05:54.669> so<00:05:54.910> when

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
and wires coming out of those so when

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.159 
and wires coming out of those so when
the<00:05:55.810> system<00:05:56.020> is<00:05:56.290> off<00:05:56.700> this<00:05:57.700> one<00:05:58.000> will<00:05:58.690> stay<00:05:58.960> on

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
the system is off this one will stay on

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:00.839 
the system is off this one will stay on
and<00:05:59.380> this<00:05:59.470> one<00:05:59.680> will<00:05:59.860> be<00:05:59.890> off

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:00.849 
and this one will be off

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:02.489 
and this one will be off
system<00:06:01.270> is<00:06:01.360> on<00:06:01.539> I<00:06:01.569> just<00:06:01.899> want<00:06:02.020> to<00:06:02.080> be<00:06:02.169> off<00:06:02.319> and

00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:02.499 
system is on I just want to be off and

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:05.459 
system is on I just want to be off and
that<00:06:02.589> want<00:06:02.709> to<00:06:02.770> be<00:06:02.830> on<00:06:03.149> so<00:06:04.149> this<00:06:04.990> will<00:06:05.139> send<00:06:05.319> out

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.469 
that want to be on so this will send out

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:11.609 
that want to be on so this will send out
a<00:06:05.499> pulse<00:06:06.719> when<00:06:07.719> for<00:06:08.050> example<00:06:09.899> that's<00:06:10.899> off<00:06:11.169> as

00:06:11.609 --> 00:06:11.619 
a pulse when for example that's off as

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:18.659 
a pulse when for example that's off as
you<00:06:11.889> can<00:06:12.039> see<00:06:12.219> and<00:06:13.499> likewise<00:06:14.499> when<00:06:15.099> this<00:06:15.309> is<00:06:17.669> it

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
you can see and likewise when this is it

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:19.859 
you can see and likewise when this is it
sends<00:06:18.969> out<00:06:19.029> a<00:06:19.089> pulse<00:06:19.149> whether<00:06:19.539> it's<00:06:19.719> a

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:19.869 
sends out a pulse whether it's a

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:25.859 
sends out a pulse whether it's a
constant<00:06:20.529> signal<00:06:20.679> or<00:06:20.919> a<00:06:20.949> pulse<00:06:21.779> C<00:06:23.939> so<00:06:24.939> yeah

00:06:25.859 --> 00:06:25.869 
constant signal or a pulse C so yeah

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:29.309 
constant signal or a pulse C so yeah
that's<00:06:26.110> the<00:06:26.259> basics<00:06:26.619> of<00:06:26.740> how<00:06:26.889> it<00:06:27.009> works<00:06:28.319> and

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:29.319 
that's the basics of how it works and

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:32.279 
that's the basics of how it works and
yeah<00:06:30.249> so<00:06:30.999> you<00:06:31.300> know<00:06:31.389> I<00:06:31.419> thought<00:06:31.809> I<00:06:32.020> hope<00:06:32.169> you

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.289 
yeah so you know I thought I hope you

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:34.409 
yeah so you know I thought I hope you
can<00:06:32.439> find<00:06:32.619> this<00:06:32.770> useful<00:06:32.979> if<00:06:33.309> you<00:06:33.429> can<00:06:33.519> use<00:06:34.269> this

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
can find this useful if you can use this

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:36.629 
can find this useful if you can use this
in<00:06:34.599> your<00:06:34.629> your<00:06:35.559> maps<00:06:35.830> and<00:06:36.039> whatever<00:06:36.279> I'll<00:06:36.490> get

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 
in your your maps and whatever I'll get

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.059 
in your your maps and whatever I'll get
back<00:06:36.789> to<00:06:36.819> my<00:06:37.059> map<00:06:37.300> pretty<00:06:37.449> soon<00:06:37.749> I<00:06:37.869> just<00:06:38.069> was

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:39.069 
back to my map pretty soon I just was
