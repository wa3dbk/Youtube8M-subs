I spent the next few years studying
these<00:02:08.310> books<00:02:09.170> collecting<00:02:10.170> what<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.349> thought

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
these books collecting what I thought

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.220

Juston<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.880> we<00:02:15.000> make<00:02:15.210> drawings<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.990> the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
Juston that we make drawings of the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.490 
Juston that we make drawings of the
design<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.710> help<00:02:16.860> us<00:02:17.100> understand<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.910> I

decided<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.709> take<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:19.920> one<00:02:20.190> step<00:02:20.220> farther<00:02:20.760> and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
decided to take it one step farther and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.970 
decided to take it one step farther and
build<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.480> scale<00:02:21.750> model<00:02:22.020> of<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.440> third<00:02:22.709> temple
