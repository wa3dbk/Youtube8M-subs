the Mazda incandescent lamp which was

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.730 
the Mazda incandescent lamp which was
the<00:00:25.760> tungsten<00:00:26.210> filament<00:00:26.660> lamp<00:00:28.900> basically<00:00:29.900> the

the tungsten filament lamp basically the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.180 
the tungsten filament lamp basically the
mazda<00:00:31.190> lamp<00:00:31.430> preceded<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:33.350> carbon<00:00:33.800> filament

lamp<00:00:34.340> it<00:00:34.640> came<00:00:34.820> afterwards<00:00:35.390> oh<00:00:35.660> it<00:00:36.530> was<00:00:36.680> a

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
lamp it came afterwards oh it was a

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.740 
lamp it came afterwards oh it was a
development<00:00:37.400> in<00:00:37.520> lighting<00:00:37.910> they<00:00:38.420> were<00:00:38.570> about

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
development in lighting they were about

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.569 
development in lighting they were about
three<00:00:38.810> times<00:00:39.320> more<00:00:39.710> efficient<00:00:40.250> than<00:00:40.430> the

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
three times more efficient than the

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.720 
three times more efficient than the
standard<00:00:41.000> carbon<00:00:41.420> lamp<00:00:41.630> and<00:00:42.310> they<00:00:43.310> were<00:00:43.370> in

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
standard carbon lamp and they were in

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.240 
standard carbon lamp and they were in
their<00:00:44.149> day<00:00:44.329> quite<00:00:44.660> quite<00:00:45.140> what<00:00:45.890> you'll<00:00:46.040> call

tungsten lamps GE made were made with

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.160 
tungsten lamps GE made were made with
sintered<00:00:52.850> tungsten<00:00:53.329> they<00:00:53.450> took<00:00:53.630> tungsten

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
sintered tungsten they took tungsten

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.190 
sintered tungsten they took tungsten
powder<00:00:54.350> they<00:00:55.070> put<00:00:55.280> it<00:00:55.399> in<00:00:55.489> a<00:00:55.550> little<00:00:55.880> mold<00:00:56.149> in<00:00:56.540> a

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
powder they put it in a little mold in a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.139 
powder they put it in a little mold in a
horseshoe<00:00:57.530> shape<00:00:57.950> and<00:00:58.219> they<00:00:58.670> would<00:00:58.820> heat<00:00:59.000> it

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
horseshoe shape and they would heat it

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.850 
horseshoe shape and they would heat it
in<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.270> furnace<00:00:59.719> to<00:00:59.750> fuse<00:01:00.140> it<00:01:00.350> together

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
in a furnace to fuse it together

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.970 
in a furnace to fuse it together
Center<00:01:01.579> it<00:01:01.670> together<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.899> make<00:01:03.079> kind<00:01:03.710> of<00:01:03.890> a

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
Center it together to make kind of a

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.770 
Center it together to make kind of a
type<00:01:04.189> of<00:01:04.369> wire<00:01:04.609> with<00:01:04.879> it<00:01:05.030> which<00:01:05.449> would<00:01:05.630> make

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
type of wire with it which would make

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.690 
type of wire with it which would make
the<00:01:05.929> filament<00:01:06.409> then<00:01:06.950> they<00:01:07.069> would<00:01:07.219> take<00:01:07.369> four

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
the filament then they would take four

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.669 
the filament then they would take four
of<00:01:07.729> these<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.329> put<00:01:08.600> it<00:01:08.719> in<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:08.929> ball<00:01:09.139> bond<00:01:09.439> on

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:09.679 
of these and put it in the ball bond on

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:12.879 
of these and put it in the ball bond on
supports<00:01:10.539> separate<00:01:11.539> and<00:01:11.689> all<00:01:12.200> four<00:01:12.679> of<00:01:12.709> these

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:12.889 
supports separate and all four of these

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:15.370 
supports separate and all four of these
filaments<00:01:13.819> will<00:01:14.119> be<00:01:14.240> in<00:01:14.389> series<00:01:14.869> in<00:01:15.049> the<00:01:15.170> bulb

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
filaments will be in series in the bulb

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.599 
filaments will be in series in the bulb
be<00:01:15.889> equal<00:01:16.189> to<00:01:16.310> voltage<00:01:16.880> 120<00:01:17.749> 110<00:01:18.560> 120<00:01:19.159> volts

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
be equal to voltage 120 110 120 volts

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.029 
be equal to voltage 120 110 120 volts
and<00:01:20.020> of<00:01:21.020> course<00:01:21.289> that<00:01:21.439> would<00:01:21.529> make<00:01:21.709> a<00:01:21.740> tungsten

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
and of course that would make a tungsten

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.459 
and of course that would make a tungsten
filament<00:01:22.279> lamp<00:01:22.729> but<00:01:23.149> the<00:01:23.240> problem<00:01:23.659> was<00:01:23.810> they

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
filament lamp but the problem was they

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.469 
filament lamp but the problem was they
were<00:01:24.590> fragile<00:01:24.859> if<00:01:25.279> you<00:01:25.639> laid<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.029> bulb<00:01:26.240> on<00:01:26.420> its

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
were fragile if you laid the bulb on its

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.599 
were fragile if you laid the bulb on its
side<00:01:26.959> when<00:01:27.259> it<00:01:27.409> was<00:01:27.529> in<00:01:27.649> the<00:01:27.679> box<00:01:27.950> just<00:01:28.219> on<00:01:28.579> a

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
side when it was in the box just on a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.339 
side when it was in the box just on a
table<00:01:29.029> you<00:01:29.119> could<00:01:29.270> break<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.569> filament<00:01:30.020> you

00:01:30.339 --> 00:01:30.349 
table you could break the filament you

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:31.510 
table you could break the filament you
could<00:01:30.499> break<00:01:30.679> the<00:01:30.859> filament<00:01:31.310> when<00:01:31.399> you're

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
could break the filament when you're

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.999 
could break the filament when you're
screwing<00:01:31.939> them<00:01:32.029> into<00:01:32.240> a<00:01:32.270> socket<00:01:32.630> so<00:01:33.380> there<00:01:33.889> are

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
screwing them into a socket so there are

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.589 
screwing them into a socket so there are
three<00:01:34.189> times<00:01:34.399> more<00:01:34.579> efficient<00:01:35.149> than<00:01:35.270> a<00:01:35.359> carbon

00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:35.599 
three times more efficient than a carbon

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:38.319 
three times more efficient than a carbon
lamp<00:01:35.959> but<00:01:36.560> fragile<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.789> that<00:01:37.939> was<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.090> big

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
lamp but fragile so that was a big

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.019 
lamp but fragile so that was a big
problem<00:01:38.929> so<00:01:39.649> around<00:01:40.549> 1906<00:01:41.329> 1907<00:01:42.819> William<00:01:43.819> V

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:48.889 
started to work with ductile tungsten in

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:51.730 
started to work with ductile tungsten in
other<00:01:49.009> words<00:01:49.249> a<00:01:49.310> drawn<00:01:49.810> tungsten<00:01:50.810> wire<00:01:51.020> that

other words a drawn tungsten wire that
he<00:01:52.189> could<00:01:52.340> take<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.639> tungsten<00:01:53.209> and<00:01:53.359> make<00:01:53.599> it

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:53.779 
he could take the tungsten and make it

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:55.809 
he could take the tungsten and make it
into<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.020> flexible<00:01:54.349> wire<00:01:54.829> just<00:01:55.159> like<00:01:55.249> copper

you know normally like you would a
carbon<00:02:12.040> lamp<00:02:12.310> without<00:02:12.580> fear<00:02:12.849> of<00:02:12.880> breakage<00:02:13.420> so

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
carbon lamp without fear of breakage so

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.580 
carbon lamp without fear of breakage so
he<00:02:15.550> came<00:02:15.760> up<00:02:15.819> with<00:02:16.239> with<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.870> first<00:02:17.110> ductile

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
he came up with with the first ductile

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.260 
he came up with with the first ductile
tungsten<00:02:17.800> lamp<00:02:18.400> around<00:02:20.130> 1907<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:22.030> was<00:02:22.090> an

there's so much better and the engineers
that<00:03:17.200> GE<00:03:17.470> didn't<00:03:18.340> even<00:03:18.609> think<00:03:19.030> for<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.390> second

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
that GE didn't even think for a second

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.780 
that GE didn't even think for a second
they<00:03:20.109> said<00:03:20.320> yeah<00:03:20.590> it's<00:03:20.890> a<00:03:20.980> great<00:03:21.190> name<00:03:21.489> we're

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
going to use it so by mid 1909 GE had

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.340 
going to use it so by mid 1909 GE had
started<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.530> mark<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.980> lamps<00:03:27.370> Mazda<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.350> they

you<00:03:48.880> know<00:03:49.000> they<00:03:49.180> weren't<00:03:49.420> as<00:03:49.540> popular<00:03:50.079> because

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
you know they weren't as popular because

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.349 
you know they weren't as popular because
the<00:03:50.500> mazda<00:03:50.950> lamp<00:03:51.130> was<00:03:51.310> so<00:03:51.489> superior

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
the mazda lamp was so superior

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:58.559 
the mazda lamp was so superior
so<00:03:53.220> by<00:03:54.660> 1910<00:03:55.660> late<00:03:55.959> 1909<00:03:56.799> early<00:03:57.100> 1910<00:03:57.819> they

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
so by 1910 late 1909 early 1910 they

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.190 
so by 1910 late 1909 early 1910 they
came<00:03:58.840> up<00:03:59.079> with<00:03:59.340> the<00:04:00.340> standard<00:04:01.200> ductile

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
came up with the standard ductile

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.590 
came up with the standard ductile

Mazda lamp was pretty well the lamp to

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.420 
Mazda lamp was pretty well the lamp to
have<00:05:28.640> from<00:05:29.120> 1910<00:05:29.870> on<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.470> people<00:05:31.280> were

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
have from 1910 on and people were

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.430 
have from 1910 on and people were
already<00:05:31.850> starting<00:05:32.270> to<00:05:32.480> phase<00:05:32.780> them<00:05:33.020> out<00:05:33.200> and

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
already starting to phase them out and

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.620 
already starting to phase them out and
you<00:05:33.980> know<00:05:34.070> phase<00:05:34.340> out<00:05:34.550> the<00:05:34.700> carbon<00:05:35.090> lamps<00:05:35.450> and

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
you know phase out the carbon lamps and

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.730 
you know phase out the carbon lamps and
go<00:05:35.870> to<00:05:36.590> these<00:05:36.740> Mazda<00:05:37.370> lamps<00:05:37.760> by<00:05:38.150> around<00:05:38.740> 1913

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
go to these Mazda lamps by around 1913

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.580 
go to these Mazda lamps by around 1913
and<00:05:40.330> these<00:05:41.330> lamps<00:05:41.630> were<00:05:41.870> made<00:05:42.020> all<00:05:42.260> the<00:05:42.350> way<00:05:42.470> up

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
and these lamps were made all the way up

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.580 
and these lamps were made all the way up
until<00:05:43.090> 1919<00:05:44.090> when<00:05:44.810> they<00:05:44.930> did<00:05:45.110> away<00:05:45.230> with<00:05:45.320> the

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
until 1919 when they did away with the

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.140 
until 1919 when they did away with the
exhaust<00:05:45.919> tip<00:05:46.190> on<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:46.520> end<00:05:46.640> and<00:05:46.820> made<00:05:47.000> them

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
exhaust tip on the end and made them

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.750 
exhaust tip on the end and made them
tipless<00:05:47.630> and<00:05:47.900> then<00:05:48.650> of<00:05:48.950> course<00:05:48.980> they<00:05:49.370> went<00:05:49.610> to

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
tipless and then of course they went to

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.880 
tipless and then of course they went to
newer<00:05:49.940> designs<00:05:50.419> after<00:05:50.840> that<00:05:50.990> which<00:05:51.169> I'll<00:05:51.560> talk

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
newer designs after that which I'll talk

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.560 
newer designs after that which I'll talk
about<00:05:51.950> later<00:05:52.300> but<00:05:53.300> uh

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
about later but uh

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.230 
about later but uh
the<00:05:54.169> Mazda<00:05:54.620> lamp<00:05:54.860> was<00:05:55.070> probably<00:05:55.490> one<00:05:55.880> of<00:05:55.910> the

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
the Mazda lamp was probably one of the

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.240 
the Mazda lamp was probably one of the
most<00:05:56.540> important<00:05:57.200> developments<00:05:57.860> in<00:05:57.980> lighting

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
most important developments in lighting

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.730 
most important developments in lighting
ever<00:05:58.640> in<00:05:59.000> history<00:05:59.600> because<00:06:00.020> even<00:06:00.440> today's

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
ever in history because even today's

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.980 
ever in history because even today's
fluorescent<00:06:01.430> lamps<00:06:01.730> use<00:06:01.910> tungsten<00:06:02.240> wire<00:06:02.690> and

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
fluorescent lamps use tungsten wire and

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.290 
fluorescent lamps use tungsten wire and
a<00:06:03.050> mercury<00:06:03.890> vapour<00:06:03.980> sodium<00:06:04.760> lamps<00:06:05.060> they<00:06:05.150> all

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
a mercury vapour sodium lamps they all

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.840 
a mercury vapour sodium lamps they all
use<00:06:05.480> tungsten<00:06:06.050> wire<00:06:06.260> wasn't<00:06:07.010> for<00:06:07.310> a<00:06:07.340> william<00:06:07.640> d

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
use tungsten wire wasn't for a william d

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.810 
use tungsten wire wasn't for a william d
college<00:06:08.390> to<00:06:08.930> develop<00:06:09.110> ductile<00:06:09.800> tungsten<00:06:10.010> we

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
college to develop ductile tungsten we

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.640 
college to develop ductile tungsten we
would<00:06:11.030> never<00:06:11.270> have<00:06:11.390> the<00:06:11.810> light<00:06:11.990> sources<00:06:12.380> we

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
would never have the light sources we

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.650 
would never have the light sources we
have<00:06:12.680> today<00:06:13.250> so<00:06:13.490> really<00:06:14.210> it's<00:06:14.330> probably<00:06:14.450> the

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
have today so really it's probably the

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.500 
have today so really it's probably the
most<00:06:14.810> historically<00:06:15.410> important<00:06:16.070> lamp<00:06:16.700> maybe

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
most historically important lamp maybe

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.540 
most historically important lamp maybe
even<00:06:17.780> more<00:06:17.990> so<00:06:18.050> than<00:06:18.260> Edison's<00:06:18.830> carbon<00:06:19.280> lamp

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
even more so than Edison's carbon lamp

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.580 
even more so than Edison's carbon lamp
in<00:06:19.669> a<00:06:19.730> way<00:06:19.880> because<00:06:20.870> of<00:06:20.990> what<00:06:21.020> it<00:06:21.290> did<00:06:21.560> for

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
in a way because of what it did for

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.540 
in a way because of what it did for
modern<00:06:22.220> technology<00:06:23.080> it's<00:06:24.220> quite<00:06:25.220> a<00:06:25.250> wonderful

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
modern technology it's quite a wonderful

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.600 
modern technology it's quite a wonderful
development<00:06:26.090> and<00:06:26.600> you<00:06:27.590> know<00:06:27.710> they<00:06:28.160> they<00:06:28.550> were

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
development and you know they they were

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.909 
development and you know they they were
just<00:06:29.180> a<00:06:29.300> great<00:06:29.480> product<00:06:29.840> William<00:06:30.350> de<00:06:30.560> quallege

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
just a great product William de quallege

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:32.050 
just a great product William de quallege
was<00:06:31.100> an<00:06:31.220> amazing<00:06:31.700> man

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
was an amazing man

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.940 
was an amazing man
and<00:06:32.270> they<00:06:32.900> developed<00:06:33.350> a<00:06:33.440> lot<00:06:33.620> of<00:06:33.650> great

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
and they developed a lot of great

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.380 
and they developed a lot of great
products<00:06:34.960> as<00:06:35.960> far<00:06:36.650> as<00:06:36.800> the<00:06:37.280> mazda<00:06:37.730> legacy<00:06:38.180> goes

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
products as far as the mazda legacy goes

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.840 
products as far as the mazda legacy goes
it<00:06:38.630> continues<00:06:39.200> on<00:06:39.440> there's<00:06:40.010> a<00:06:40.070> lot<00:06:40.310> more<00:06:40.580> about

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850 
it continues on there's a lot more about

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.820 
it continues on there's a lot more about
it<00:06:41.090> because<00:06:41.210> mazda<00:06:41.780> was<00:06:41.810> around<00:06:42.200> up<00:06:42.410> until<00:06:42.740> the

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
it because mazda was around up until the

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.210 
it because mazda was around up until the
late<00:06:43.010> 40s<00:06:43.880> just<00:06:44.660> after<00:06:44.960> World<00:06:45.200> War<00:06:45.290> two<00:06:45.560> that's

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
late 40s just after World War two that's

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.610 
late 40s just after World War two that's
when<00:06:46.460> they<00:06:46.580> dropped<00:06:46.850> the<00:06:47.000> Mazda<00:06:47.420> name<00:06:47.630> so<00:06:48.320> I'll

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620 
when they dropped the Mazda name so I'll

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.610 
when they dropped the Mazda name so I'll
probably<00:06:48.950> be<00:06:49.390> doing<00:06:50.390> more<00:06:50.870> on<00:06:51.200> the<00:06:51.410> Mazda

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
probably be doing more on the Mazda

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.500 
probably be doing more on the Mazda
lamps<00:06:52.310> later<00:06:52.640> because<00:06:53.090> there's<00:06:53.240> a<00:06:53.300> lot<00:06:53.420> of

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.510 
lamps later because there's a lot of

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.200 
lamps later because there's a lot of
progression<00:06:53.870> in<00:06:54.200> their<00:06:54.680> development<00:06:55.250> also

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
progression in their development also

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.600 
progression in their development also
fluorescent<00:06:57.080> lamps<00:06:57.380> used<00:06:57.650> the<00:06:57.830> Mazda<00:06:58.250> name<00:06:58.430> in

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
fluorescent lamps used the Mazda name in

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.320 
fluorescent lamps used the Mazda name in
the<00:06:58.700> early<00:06:58.940> days<00:06:59.150> so<00:07:00.110> this<00:07:00.970> pretty<00:07:01.970> much

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330 
the early days so this pretty much

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.070 
the early days so this pretty much
concludes<00:07:03.250> the<00:07:04.250> early<00:07:04.790> part<00:07:05.450> of<00:07:05.570> the<00:07:05.660> of<00:07:05.840> the

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 
concludes the early part of the of the

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.840 
concludes the early part of the of the
Mazda<00:07:06.640> saga

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:07.850 
Mazda saga

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.860
