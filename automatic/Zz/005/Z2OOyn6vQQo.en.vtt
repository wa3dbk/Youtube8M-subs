00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
ready to be patient I'm actually an

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
impatient person but I was ready to be

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.160 
impatient person but I was ready to be
patient<00:00:48.300> with<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> whole<00:00:48.960> progression

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
of the videos and everything and I think

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.799 
of the videos and everything and I think
because<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.770> didn't<00:00:53.160> expect<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:54.030> get<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.690> many

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
because I didn't expect to get so many
