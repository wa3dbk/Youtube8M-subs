your<00:00:38.380> trim<00:00:39.380> tool<00:00:39.650> your<00:00:40.390> switch<00:00:41.390> I<00:00:42.010> think<00:00:43.010> that

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
your trim tool your switch I think that

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.180 
your trim tool your switch I think that
here's<00:00:43.730> that<00:00:43.880> red<00:00:44.150> thing<00:00:44.740> you<00:00:45.740> can<00:00:45.860> see<00:00:46.010> how<00:00:46.130> it

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
here's that red thing you can see how it

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.490 
here's that red thing you can see how it
moves<00:00:46.310> up<00:00:46.550> and<00:00:46.640> down<00:00:47.020> you<00:00:48.020> have<00:00:48.110> to<00:00:48.140> push<00:00:48.320> it<00:00:48.350> up

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
moves up and down you have to push it up

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.290 
moves up and down you have to push it up
to<00:00:48.680> remove<00:00:48.950> it<00:00:49.810> then<00:00:50.810> you<00:00:51.080> have<00:00:51.920> to<00:00:52.250> pull<00:00:53.120> this

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
to remove it then you have to pull this

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.140 
to remove it then you have to pull this
panel<00:00:53.690> out<00:00:53.780> right<00:00:54.080> here<00:00:54.640> there's<00:00:55.640> two<00:00:55.850> clips

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
panel out right here there's two clips

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.680 
panel out right here there's two clips
one<00:00:56.420> here<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.250> one<00:00:58.250> here<00:00:58.330> the<00:00:59.330> best<00:00:59.510> way<00:00:59.600> to

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
one here and one here the best way to

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.810 
one here and one here the best way to
get<00:00:59.930> this<00:01:00.230> out<00:01:00.470> is<00:01:00.770> to<00:01:00.830> put<00:01:01.160> your<00:01:01.250> hands<00:01:01.640> on

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
get this out is to put your hands on

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.310 
get this out is to put your hands on
either<00:01:02.060> side<00:01:02.420> of<00:01:02.450> it<00:01:02.660> and<00:01:02.840> just<00:01:02.990> pull<00:01:03.170> straight

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
either side of it and just pull straight

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.599 
either side of it and just pull straight
out<00:01:04.180> start<00:01:05.180> at<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.360> top<00:01:06.250> there's<00:01:07.250> two<00:01:07.399> pins

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:07.609 
out start at the top there's two pins

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:11.200 
out start at the top there's two pins
down<00:01:07.820> here<00:01:08.119> as<00:01:08.240> well<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:10.939> reason<00:01:11.149> you

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
down here as well and the reason you

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.310 
down here as well and the reason you
have<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.359> start<00:01:11.539> from<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:11.750> top<00:01:11.929> is<00:01:12.109> because

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
have to start from the top is because

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.319 
have to start from the top is because
this<00:01:12.469> overlaps<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:13.579> has<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:13.820> be<00:01:13.850> pivoted

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
this overlaps and has to be pivoted

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:22.510 
this overlaps and has to be pivoted
backwards<00:01:20.409> since<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:21.590> panel<00:01:21.920> is<00:01:22.070> all<00:01:22.310> one

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
backwards since the panel is all one

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.459 
backwards since the panel is all one
piece<00:01:22.759> from<00:01:22.969> here<00:01:23.179> to<00:01:23.299> here<00:01:23.509> you<00:01:23.719> have<00:01:24.350> to

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
piece from here to here you have to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.380 
piece from here to here you have to
remove<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:25.009> screw<00:01:25.189> here<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.350> a<00:01:27.350> screw<00:01:27.649> here<00:01:28.390> to

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
remove a screw here and a screw here to

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.870 
remove a screw here and a screw here to
remove<00:01:29.689> your<00:01:30.289> upper<00:01:30.530> dash<00:01:30.710> panel<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.759> then

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
remove your upper dash panel and then

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.840 
remove your upper dash panel and then
again<00:01:32.409> it's<00:01:33.409> just<00:01:33.560> pulling<00:01:34.219> out<00:01:36.549> pieces<00:01:37.549> until

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
again it's just pulling out pieces until

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.340 
again it's just pulling out pieces until
you<00:01:37.999> get<00:01:38.179> it<00:01:38.329> your<00:01:39.170> string<00:01:39.409> all<00:01:39.649> the<00:01:39.740> way<00:01:39.829> down

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:02:00.570 

see<00:01:45.100> it's<00:01:45.310> kind<00:01:45.490> of<00:01:45.520> difficult<00:01:59.010> and<00:02:00.010> it's<00:02:00.159> you

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
see it's kind of difficult and it's you

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.330 
see it's kind of difficult and it's you
have<00:02:00.700> another<00:02:00.940> screw<00:02:01.270> right<00:02:01.450> here<00:02:02.340> behind

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
have another screw right here behind

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:40.940 
have another screw right here behind
your<00:02:05.070> switches<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.310> another<00:02:06.400> 9/16

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.830 

and<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.930> generally<00:02:43.930> complete<00:02:44.380> your<00:02:44.650> removal<00:02:45.520> I

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
and I generally complete your removal I

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.930 
and I generally complete your removal I
have<00:02:46.840> some<00:02:47.110> wires<00:02:47.350> back<00:02:47.710> here<00:02:47.740> you<00:02:48.670> want<00:02:48.880> to

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
have some wires back here you want to

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.370 
have some wires back here you want to
disconnect<00:02:51.870> probably<00:02:52.870> have<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.080> similar

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
disconnect probably have the similar

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.820 
disconnect probably have the similar
clips<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:55.690> once<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:55.960> pull<00:02:56.140> those<00:02:56.290> out

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
clips so once you pull those out

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.820 
clips so once you pull those out
you'll<00:02:57.340> be<00:02:57.430> squared<00:02:57.730> away
