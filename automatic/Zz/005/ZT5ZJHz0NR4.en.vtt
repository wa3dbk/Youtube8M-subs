and<00:00:43.460> here's<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.670> 3ds<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:47.840> now<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:48.989> important

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
and here's the 3ds so now it's important

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.450 
and here's the 3ds so now it's important
to<00:00:49.350> note<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.770> doesn't<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.399> doesn't

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
to note that it doesn't it doesn't

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.670 
to note that it doesn't it doesn't
really<00:00:50.760> clip<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.390> sort<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.690> slides

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
really clip on it sort of just slides

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.729 
really clip on it sort of just slides
into<00:00:53.129> place<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.420> push<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.739> directly

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
into place you just push it directly

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.709 
into place you just push it directly
onto<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.640> that's<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.879> few<00:00:57.059> foam<00:00:57.239> pads<00:00:57.539> on

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
onto it and that's a few foam pads on

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.970 
onto it and that's a few foam pads on
the<00:00:57.809> inside<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.199> sort<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.440> hold<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.859> place

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the inside that sort of hold it in place

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.429 
the inside that sort of hold it in place
and<00:01:02.420> there<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.480> go<00:01:03.629> as<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.229> see<00:01:04.379> I'm

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
and there we go as you can see I'm

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.929 
and there we go as you can see I'm
playing<00:01:04.500> resident<00:01:04.890> evil<00:01:05.189> revelations<00:01:05.339> with

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
playing resident evil revelations with

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.710 
playing resident evil revelations with
it<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.260> at<00:01:07.260> first<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.799> thought<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.400> being<00:01:09.299> sort

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
it and at first I thought it being sort

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.080 
it and at first I thought it being sort
of<00:01:09.750> offside<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.549> would<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
of offside like that would be a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.399 
of offside like that would be a
hindrance<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.720> would<00:01:12.810> really<00:01:12.960> get<00:01:13.110> used<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
hindrance you would really get used to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.530 
hindrance you would really get used to
it<00:01:13.500> but<00:01:13.760> after<00:01:14.760> playing<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.150> probably<00:01:15.420> about

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
it but after playing for probably about

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.109 
it but after playing for probably about
half<00:01:15.780> an<00:01:15.930> hour<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.710> completely<00:01:17.040> forget<00:01:17.400> that

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
half an hour you completely forget that

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.600 
half an hour you completely forget that
this<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.619> sticking<00:01:19.619> right<00:01:19.890> out<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.189> side<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
this is sticking right out the side and

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.240 
this is sticking right out the side and
it's<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.090> lot<00:01:21.659> easier<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.320> play<00:01:22.530> using<00:01:23.009> this

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
it's a lot easier to play using this

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.359 
it's a lot easier to play using this
then<00:01:24.150> using<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.590> stationary<00:01:26.040> movements

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
then using just the stationary movements

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.810 
then using just the stationary movements
with<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.380> I'd<00:01:28.680> highly<00:01:29.280> recommend<00:01:29.310> it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
with this one so I'd highly recommend it

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.640 
with this one so I'd highly recommend it
the<00:01:30.299> battery<00:01:30.630> apparently<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.229> last<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.619> I

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
the battery apparently can last for I

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.179 
the battery apparently can last for I
think<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.509> 420<00:01:33.509> full<00:01:34.290> charges<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.860> 3ds

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
think it's 420 full charges of the 3ds

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.679 
think it's 420 full charges of the 3ds
system<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.909> doesn't<00:01:36.119> really<00:01:36.180> seem<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.570> be

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
system so it doesn't really seem to be

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.480 
system so it doesn't really seem to be
it's<00:01:37.500> not<00:01:37.560> ever<00:01:37.799> really<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.369> an

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
it's not ever really going to be an

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.160 
it's not ever really going to be an
issue<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.900> only<00:01:40.079> problems<00:01:40.439> i<00:01:40.560> noticed<00:01:41.220> are

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
issue the only problems i noticed are

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.620 
issue the only problems i noticed are
with<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> back<00:01:43.500> buttons<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.820> L<00:01:44.939> button<00:01:45.149> still

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
with the back buttons the L button still

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.210 
with the back buttons the L button still
the<00:01:45.930> number<00:01:46.049> one<00:01:46.200> they've<00:01:46.560> replaced<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.070> one

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the number one they've replaced this one

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.039 
the number one they've replaced this one
on<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.430> side<00:01:47.579> here<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.479> find<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.750> kind<00:01:48.960> of

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
on the side here and I find it kind of

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.810 
on the side here and I find it kind of
hard<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.290> press<00:01:49.500> into<00:01:49.710> but<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.310> just

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
hard to press into but it's just

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.190 
hard to press into but it's just
something<00:01:51.329> you'd<00:01:51.450> probably<00:01:51.630> get<00:01:51.869> used<00:01:52.079> to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
something you'd probably get used to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.280 
something you'd probably get used to
after<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.500> while<00:01:52.909> also<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> plus<00:01:54.600> sides<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
after a while also on the plus sides the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.380 
after a while also on the plus sides the
3ds<00:01:55.619> console<00:01:55.950> which<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.640> found<00:01:56.790> incredibly

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
3ds console which I found incredibly

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.910 
3ds console which I found incredibly
uncomfortable<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:58.110> hold<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.560> first<00:01:58.770> place

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
uncomfortable to hold in the first place

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.480 
uncomfortable to hold in the first place
I'd<00:01:59.670> cramp<00:01:59.969> up<00:02:00.090> after<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> while<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.920> lot<00:02:02.310> more

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
I'd cramp up after a while is a lot more

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.120 
I'd cramp up after a while is a lot more
comfortable<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:03.030> hold<00:02:03.200> but<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.649> lose<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.890> lot

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
comfortable to hold but you lose a lot

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.280 
comfortable to hold but you lose a lot
of<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.280> portability<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:06.780> probably<00:02:06.960> one

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
of the portability so it's probably one

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.180 
of the portability so it's probably one
of<00:02:07.320> those<00:02:07.439> attachments<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.950> use<00:02:08.160> for

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
of those attachments that use for

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.790 
of those attachments that use for
playing<00:02:08.789> my<00:02:08.879> 3ds<00:02:09.179> at<00:02:09.390> home<00:02:09.599> but<00:02:10.410> when<00:02:10.619> I'm<00:02:10.709> on

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
playing my 3ds at home but when I'm on

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.690 
playing my 3ds at home but when I'm on
the<00:02:10.890> go<00:02:11.069> I

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
the go I

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.510 
the go I
probably<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.420> leave<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.870> at<00:02:12.989> home<00:02:13.160> so<00:02:14.160> thanks

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
probably just leave it at home so thanks

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.330
