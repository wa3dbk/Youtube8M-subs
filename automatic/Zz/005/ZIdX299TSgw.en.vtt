original half-life that downloaded and
installed<00:00:47.200> in<00:00:47.620> about<00:00:47.800> 10<00:00:48.070> minutes<00:00:48.309> which<00:00:48.550> is

that's all so I'll just go in fact I'll

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.870 
that's all so I'll just go in fact I'll

slow down the speed drastically

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.270 
slow down the speed drastically
that<00:02:11.450> might<00:02:11.690> help<00:02:12.550> if<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:13.760> go<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.210> new<00:02:14.840> game

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
that might help if I go to a new game

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.080 
that might help if I go to a new game
easy<00:02:16.360> play

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.750 

so<00:02:41.790> as<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:41.970> can<00:02:42.090> see<00:02:42.300> that

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.990 

that's<00:02:46.420> some<00:02:46.569> strange<00:02:46.930> things

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.930 

um<00:02:50.890> when<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:52.010> settles<00:02:52.250> down<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:52.820> actually

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
um when it settles down it actually

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.230 
um when it settles down it actually
looks<00:02:53.480> okay<00:02:54.220> looks<00:02:55.220> like<00:02:55.340> it's<00:02:55.610> running<00:02:55.790> okay

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
looks okay looks like it's running okay

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.800 
looks okay looks like it's running okay
slow<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:58.280> frame<00:02:58.520> rate<00:02:58.730> is<00:02:58.880> quite<00:02:59.000> loud<00:02:59.300> all

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
slow the frame rate is quite loud all

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.770 
slow the frame rate is quite loud all
the<00:02:59.990> same

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.100 

it's<00:03:04.260> pretty<00:03:04.470> dark<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:05.330> in<00:03:06.330> order<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.630> do

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
it's pretty dark and in order to do

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.830 
it's pretty dark and in order to do
anything

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.630 

there<00:03:11.379> you<00:03:11.470> go<00:03:11.620> as<00:03:11.769> soon<00:03:11.950> as<00:03:12.069> the<00:03:12.160> room<00:03:12.310> fills

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
there you go as soon as the room fills

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.390 
there you go as soon as the room fills
out<00:03:12.819> the<00:03:12.849> stuff<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.480> keeps<00:03:13.629> doing<00:03:13.840> this

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
out the stuff and it keeps doing this

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.840 
out the stuff and it keeps doing this
jiggly<00:03:15.400> thing

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.180 

so<00:03:19.510> it<00:03:19.600> sort<00:03:19.750> of<00:03:19.810> works<00:03:20.050> but<00:03:20.650> not<00:03:20.920> very<00:03:21.040> well

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
so it sort of works but not very well

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.000 
so it sort of works but not very well
and<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:22.570> need<00:03:22.810> this<00:03:22.960> keyboard<00:03:23.440> here<00:03:23.740> because

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
and I need this keyboard here because

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.830 
and I need this keyboard here because
it's<00:03:24.160> got<00:03:24.310> an<00:03:24.370> escape<00:03:24.550> bar<00:03:24.940> lets<00:03:25.210> me<00:03:25.420> get<00:03:25.690> out

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
it's got an escape bar lets me get out

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.340 
it's got an escape bar lets me get out
of<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.020> game<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.880> installs<00:03:31.330> it<00:03:31.570> runs<00:03:31.810> not

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
of the game so it installs it runs not

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.900 
of the game so it installs it runs not
very<00:03:32.560> well<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:32.980> mean<00:03:33.430> it's<00:03:33.550> basically<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.970> fail

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
very well I mean it's basically a fail

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.440 
very well I mean it's basically a fail
don't<00:03:36.910> know<00:03:37.000> what<00:03:37.150> can<00:03:37.750> be<00:03:37.930> done<00:03:38.140> about<00:03:38.200> that

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
don't know what can be done about that

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.400 
don't know what can be done about that
but<00:03:42.390> certainly<00:03:43.390> if<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:43.930> doesn't<00:03:44.260> run<00:03:44.380> very

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
but certainly if that doesn't run very

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.530 
but certainly if that doesn't run very
well<00:03:44.590> source<00:03:45.280> is<00:03:45.490> definitely<00:03:46.030> not<00:03:46.150> going<00:03:46.420> to

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
well source is definitely not going to

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.850 
well source is definitely not going to
run<00:03:46.830> so<00:03:47.830> I'm<00:03:47.950> afraid<00:03:48.190> that's<00:03:48.490> that's<00:03:49.240> a<00:03:49.360> no-go

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
run so I'm afraid that's that's a no-go

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.200 
run so I'm afraid that's that's a no-go
steam<00:03:50.860> is<00:03:51.040> a<00:03:51.070> no-go<00:03:51.400> on<00:03:51.430> this<00:03:51.730> unless<00:03:52.030> there

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
steam is a no-go on this unless there

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.440 
steam is a no-go on this unless there
are<00:03:52.240> games<00:03:52.570> you<00:03:52.780> know<00:03:52.900> RTS<00:03:53.410> games<00:03:54.300> so<00:03:55.300> the

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
are games you know RTS games so the

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.260 
are games you know RTS games so the
older<00:03:55.720> things<00:03:55.870> like<00:03:56.820> command<00:03:57.820> and<00:03:57.970> conquer

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
older things like command and conquer

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.020 
older things like command and conquer
and<00:03:58.480> red<00:03:59.080> alert<00:03:59.320> style<00:03:59.860> games<00:04:00.130> probably<00:04:00.700> work

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
and red alert style games probably work

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.380 
and red alert style games probably work
klein<00:04:01.600> on<00:04:01.780> this<00:04:02.100> but<00:04:03.100> anything<00:04:03.700> brand<00:04:04.240> new<00:04:04.360> in

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
klein on this but anything brand new in

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.240 
klein on this but anything brand new in
3d<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.140> just<00:04:05.500> not<00:04:05.650> going<00:04:05.770> to<00:04:05.830> work<00:04:05.920> you're

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
3d is just not going to work you're

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.150

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.630 
a tablet to run that sort of thing
something<00:04:11.530> with<00:04:11.650> better<00:04:11.830> graphics<00:04:12.070> i<00:04:12.490> know

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
something with better graphics i know

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.780 
something with better graphics i know
the<00:04:12.760> next<00:04:12.910> version<00:04:13.210> of<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.660> atom<00:04:14.080> chip<00:04:14.370> set<00:04:15.370> is

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
the next version of the atom chip set is

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.310 
the next version of the atom chip set is
going<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.239> have<00:04:16.390> a<00:04:16.420> much<00:04:16.959> more<00:04:17.110> powerful

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
going to have a much more powerful

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.160 
going to have a much more powerful
graphics<00:04:17.590> but<00:04:18.549> even<00:04:18.790> then<00:04:19.120> it's<00:04:19.360> not<00:04:19.480> really

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
graphics but even then it's not really

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.820 
graphics but even then it's not really
made<00:04:20.799> for<00:04:20.830> 3d<00:04:21.280> gaming<00:04:22.020> ok<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.230> hope<00:04:23.320> that<00:04:23.500> helps
