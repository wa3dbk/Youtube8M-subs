you can still run the bottom like i said
earlier<00:03:52.450> and

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
earlier and

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.970 
earlier and
you<00:03:53.970> know<00:03:54.090> that's<00:03:54.780> all<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:54.990> can<00:03:55.080> ask<00:03:55.200> for<00:03:55.350> two

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
you know that's all you can ask for two

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.130 
you know that's all you can ask for two
lanes<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.340> race<00:03:56.490> on<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:56.880> obviously<00:03:57.360> was<00:03:57.780> Kevin

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
lanes to race on and obviously was Kevin

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.110 
lanes to race on and obviously was Kevin

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
coming from the back up to maybe I think

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.700 
coming from the back up to maybe I think
it<00:04:00.210> was<00:04:00.330> in<00:04:00.510> hand<00:04:00.750> that<00:04:00.960> proves<00:04:01.500> that<00:04:01.560> you

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
it was in hand that proves that you

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.560 
it was in hand that proves that you
could<00:04:01.860> pass<00:04:02.010> on<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:02.580> uh<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:03.240> was<00:04:03.360> really

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
could pass on and so uh it was really

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.480 
could pass on and so uh it was really
neat<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:03.930> hopefully<00:04:04.800> get<00:04:04.920> something<00:04:05.220> someone

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
neat and hopefully get something someone

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.790 
neat and hopefully get something someone
to<00:04:05.580> set<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:05.910> on<00:04:06.000> yeah<00:04:06.990> I<00:04:07.020> know<00:04:07.170> that<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.560> can't

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
may have made the bottom keep up a

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.770 
may have made the bottom keep up a
little<00:04:26.700> bit<00:04:26.820> so<00:04:26.940> if<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.090> made<00:04:27.240> a<00:04:27.270> mistake<00:04:27.390> the

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
stayed down there and I could feel it

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.590 
stayed down there and I could feel it
starting<00:06:43.550> to<00:06:43.610> get<00:06:43.699> slower<00:06:44.000> and<00:06:44.150> slower<00:06:44.300> and

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 
slid up in front of me on the cushion

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.240 
slid up in front of me on the cushion
and<00:07:05.900> then<00:07:05.990> I<00:07:06.110> diamond<00:07:06.470> down<00:07:06.680> back<00:07:06.919> underneath

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.250 
and then I diamond down back underneath

and then I diamond down back underneath
America<00:07:07.759> and<00:07:08.120> then<00:07:08.240> I<00:07:08.419> i<00:07:08.960> ran<00:07:09.410> the<00:07:09.440> bottom<00:07:09.889> and

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:09.979 
America and then I i ran the bottom and

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:12.040 
America and then I i ran the bottom and
one<00:07:10.099> and<00:07:10.310> two<00:07:10.490> so<00:07:11.360> I<00:07:11.389> figured<00:07:11.660> he<00:07:11.750> was<00:07:11.870> going<00:07:11.990> to

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
one and two so I figured he was going to

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.689 
one and two so I figured he was going to
come<00:07:12.229> back<00:07:12.349> at<00:07:12.530> me<00:07:12.650> again<00:07:12.710> and<00:07:13.070> we<00:07:13.370> got<00:07:13.520> through

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:13.699 
come back at me again and we got through

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:14.860 
come back at me again and we got through
one<00:07:13.849> or<00:07:13.880> two<00:07:14.060> pretty<00:07:14.300> good<00:07:14.479> and<00:07:14.599> then<00:07:14.690> I<00:07:14.780> went

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:14.870 
one or two pretty good and then I went

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.210 
one or two pretty good and then I went
back<00:07:14.990> to<00:07:15.110> the<00:07:15.320> top<00:07:15.500> and<00:07:15.680> never<00:07:15.860> saw<00:07:16.070> him<00:07:16.160> again

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:16.220 
back to the top and never saw him again

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.529 
back to the top and never saw him again
so<00:07:17.260> yeah<00:07:18.260> it's<00:07:18.680> a<00:07:18.889> one<00:07:19.760> of<00:07:19.849> those<00:07:19.970> one<00:07:20.419> of<00:07:20.449> those

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:20.539
