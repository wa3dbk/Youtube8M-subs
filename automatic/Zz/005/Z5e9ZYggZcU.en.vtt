00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.260
 well, for a return than the labor market 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.010
 the doctoral degree 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.749
 Rheinfelden 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:11.749
 there you can have caught in the act 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.820
 be for years 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.079
 with him at the eloquent harder 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.349
 constantly on AX 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:31.179
 Mainburg 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.179
 also a sale to the ball and that was right 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.870
 the work becomes 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.640
 by the way, who 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.260
 does not remember the player Kliman once so serene yes almost 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.059
 phlegmatic act against it today hardly stone house approx 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.930
 with the envisaged way how one has thus again with the Berliners 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.650
 athletic success set 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.180
 at home in the olympic stadium Hertha even moved up 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.630
 Niggli one returned but also the fans back 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.630
 of the people Stemer 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.320
 For the OFC it has been marketed exactly as it wants soon 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.960
 the integrated module becomes the user of the portal Merkels and Westerwelle 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.670
 great 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.060
 Thank goodness Herbert I finally have some welcome Berlin coach 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.280
 together and one of the Russians to advise a second round ad5-10 lives 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.170
 he has the young Tiger Woods Bayreuth Jung Jung himself is not one who is there 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.210
 the playful means are missing means Elfriede possible rosary or even 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.530
 We want to use the climate in our games 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.820
 However, the Hertha had the same following one to zero for 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.820
 80 minutes were played as an attack of the all-white ones 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.130
 Wattenscheider 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.450
 from the new era for Borussia one dares 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.360
 By the way, already the fourth of this season 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.890
 so intercepted as an attack and used for fast counterattack 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.979
 the great goal 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.209
 a soloist is Haithabu's first-rate performer 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.609
 they see that here again and a little slower 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.629
 stupid who set his season's number six 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:30.169
 the huge joy on the ranks and above all with the Hofer players 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.689
 but they forgot about the exuberant jubilation 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:39.569
 rapid impetus of the Ruhrpottler and the even faster equalization goal by 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.139
 Harald Küper 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:42.509
 all as I said 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.509
 still in the 18 min 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:51.879
 But what really distinguishes this harder of the vintage 84 was 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:52.599
 straightway 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.040
 she does not allow herself any setbacks from this work 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.519
 The attacks of the hosts Olten impress incessantly and often could only 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.389
 stopped playing with Paul 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.119
 Captain Tinnefeld even goes for that brutality 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:10.439
 Liv Ullmann Sky's subsequent free-kick ended up curious 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.809
 Detours in the net 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:13.010
 the 2 2 1 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.009
 already 180 seconds 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:16.699
 after the 8th 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:20.569
 and in the slowed repetition from another point of view, they only realize 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.190
 too good 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.320
 that to the chairman Gilles Simon 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.320
 a real frustration 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.519
 and the climate protection and the players so nothing 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.459
 the coach about his style of work 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.089
 it is so outdated today by citizens as now out of the long 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:40.189
 Business out 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:44.209
 I identify with the crew trying to buddy somewhere 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:44.879
 his 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.400
 which of course with a similar percent of species can be that one me 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.180
 I'm careful about that 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.029
 and the boys 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:55.179
 we do not know who actually knows to take them if through a trauma and then 

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:59.109
 Consense went reasonably Center won with media measures 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:03.599
 what has built something like crap in the opinion of the three ten thousand has that 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.230
 also the man in black 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.159
 as he is in the second 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.159
 the Berliners do not do justice 

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:14.550
 the first ones have Wattenscheid the antiaircraft go Tiger 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.550
 the legs of old Stöhr do not target the ball 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:21.549
 Referee Nils Neuhaus in the next again Saxony 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.169
 had not seen anything 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.110
 we see better here 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.050
 and behold, there is another thing that learns that scorer Bitburg 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.409
 Wellemeyer ago 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.569
 our slowed version occupied 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.569
 it was not a swallow of Dr 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.430
 the Wattenscheider quite complacent and especially dangerous playing 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.580
 also had their chances of counteraction among themselves was every accomplished that 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.990
 Leather to substitute Wulff Meier 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.370
 Kübler's header 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.370
 Harder goalkeeper Köpke and children grew up 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.699
 Kübler score scorer he had already scored a goal I've 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.610
 the staid May, however, had been empty until then 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.849
 Lima AFP the Berlin here still inactive but should still nation 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.370
 but in turn the 88 min 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.509
 Werner Steger again Alba Wattenscheid's number seven 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:14.339
 There will be here again 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:18.080
 and again by free kick that was prepared three to one 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.879
 stupid is him to a sensational Hack Trick and now 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.470
 finally was Dieter Meier 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.370
 on the line 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.800
 very casual with left 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.889
 be 6 to 2 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.249
 but who hardness the sixth success in the sixth home game for the third 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:35.300
 Table space what a coach does not want there yet 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.370
 Ajax is unfortunately back in top form is so great that already proved what then 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.069
 Value for the team can certainly be where life compliments 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:46.690
 which has not played six weeks, that is obviously no less 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.930
 and by the failure of Würzburg was like in the case of the election I am 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.360
 he must have done his job properly, of course, has more 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.740
 Who achieves condition weaknesses at the time, but that's all 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.120
 Normally, in the end, I wish the injured one all soon recovered 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.120
 will really give everyone the right places 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:07.699
 and I believe that we were at the end 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.639
 whether the mystical 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.830
 could be 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.169
 MSV Duisburg South FC St Pauli 13 1 Stuttgarter Kickers Strangios with this 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:17.589
 press one to zero 

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:21.359
 SC Freiburg beats blue-white 90 Berlin too 1 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.430
 FC 08 Homburg Schleck info for Bürstadt 3 to 1 Hertha BSC as seen 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.580
 Wattenscheid 09 is replacing three to one under against Oberhausen 1zu1 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.479
 they could also see Hannover 96 Strey to 3 against Alemannia Aachen photo 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:39.910
 Merck Cologne puts Kickers Offenbach Zwo to 1 Darmstadt 98 beats Union 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.520
 Solingen 4 to 2 of Nora Navas look forward and Hessen Kassel slip SSV Ulm 46 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.719
 with already to 1 

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:50.860
 Leader Hannover 96 with one point ahead of the points 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.069
 Alemannia Aachen Hertha BSC Berlin and Wattenscheid now can 

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:59.929
 and if we go further down we have to go slowly but surely 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.210
 Nord representatives look for FC St Pauli and as he is penultimate with seven to 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.550
 17 points but if the table image also look down there 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.940
 everything is close together from a preliminary decision or similar 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:15.949
 certainly not the credit
