 the year 2011 you will receive the furniture 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.369
 then we'll go to furniture 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:59.490

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.599
 furniture of the series and y so for that 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.610
 it is already ben snow in your 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.679
 antre my animal crossing and that you 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.539
 do falletti 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.220
 so as if he is successful he you 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.890
 will send a piece of furniture by mail 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.420
 and when I give it two successful 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.819
 must have a 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.680
 a perfect snowman to have 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.599
 so the same we can see a Yeti 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.890
 perfect you have to find a snow mold 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.080
 and roll until she 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.690
 can not be more vain to be 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.060
 larger calculation and then I find 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.660
 another ball or second so for in 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.780
 to do a little bit more 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.430
 small for that 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.400
 so that it is not the same 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.650
 as big as the body and rolled it 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.450
 above 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.219
 so the yeti should be born it is not 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.609
 wonderful cause the first time you 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:52.889
 can start again and if it is perfect 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:58.139
 so he will offer you an object to celine 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:03:00.629
 and there is you will receive it by mail 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.790
 so that's for the getty type furniture 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.079

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.359

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.659

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.909
 a store held by the two sheep that 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.680

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:52.620
 store that replaces the volume we
