00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
more relaxed because I don't have to

sitting position in my standing position
which<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.710> think<00:00:25.920> helps<00:00:26.160> an<00:00:26.279> awful<00:00:26.580> lot<00:00:26.840> here's

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
which I think helps an awful lot here's

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.419 
which I think helps an awful lot here's
another<00:00:28.109> thing<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.470> straps<00:00:28.740> allow<00:00:29.010> me<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.279> do

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
another thing that straps allow me to do

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.669 
another thing that straps allow me to do
they<00:00:30.060> allow<00:00:30.269> me<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.449> control<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.019> angle<00:00:31.500> of

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
they allow me to control the angle of

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.220 
they allow me to control the angle of
the<00:00:32.399> guitar<00:00:32.759> relative<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.329> my<00:00:33.450> body<00:00:33.660> this

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the guitar relative to my body this

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.720 
the guitar relative to my body this
allows<00:00:34.500> me<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.680> flare<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.190> neck<00:00:35.399> out<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> little

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
allows me to flare the neck out a little

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.760 
allows me to flare the neck out a little
bit<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.149> reach<00:00:36.390> forward<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.110> neck<00:00:37.290> which

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
bit and reach forward to the neck which

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.229 
bit and reach forward to the neck which
feels<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> little<00:00:38.370> bit<00:00:38.460> more<00:00:38.610> comfortable<00:00:38.969> to

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
feels a little bit more comfortable to

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.479 
feels a little bit more comfortable to
me<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:40.350> also<00:00:40.559> solves<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.040> problem<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.399> what

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
me this also solves the problem of what

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.830 
me this also solves the problem of what
to<00:00:41.520> do<00:00:41.700> with<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> right<00:00:42.149> hand<00:00:42.180> because<00:00:42.690> it

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
to do with the right hand because it

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.479 
to do with the right hand because it
makes<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.200> reach<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.590> little<00:00:43.860> bit<00:00:44.010> less<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
makes the reach a little bit less on the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.750 
makes the reach a little bit less on the
right<00:00:44.670> hand<00:00:44.910> which<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.360> also<00:00:45.690> very<00:00:45.870> relaxing

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
right hand which is also very relaxing

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.160 
right hand which is also very relaxing
when<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.850> comes<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> left<00:00:48.450> hand<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.930> tend<00:00:49.140> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
when it comes to the left hand I tend to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.869 
when it comes to the left hand I tend to
play<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> basic<00:00:50.039> classical<00:00:50.610> style

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
play with a basic classical style

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.020 
play with a basic classical style
technique<00:00:51.360> where<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.840> keep<00:00:52.170> my<00:00:52.230> left<00:00:52.530> hand

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
technique where I keep my left hand

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.910 
technique where I keep my left hand
finger<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.120> fairly<00:00:54.480> parallel<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> frets<00:00:55.590> I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
finger is fairly parallel to the frets I

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.099 
finger is fairly parallel to the frets I
use<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> natural<00:00:57.000> curve<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.420> fingertip<00:00:57.960> I

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
use a natural curve of the fingertip I

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.830 
use a natural curve of the fingertip I
don't<00:00:58.350> extend<00:00:58.800> too<00:00:58.980> much<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.460> don't<00:01:00.390> curl<00:01:00.570> too

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
don't extend too much I don't curl too

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.139 
don't extend too much I don't curl too
much<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.260> always<00:01:01.890> play<00:01:02.160> up<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> tips<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
much I always play up on the tips of the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.410 
much I always play up on the tips of the
fingers<00:01:04.400> let<00:01:05.400> me<00:01:05.489> make<00:01:05.640> an<00:01:05.760> important<00:01:06.210> point

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
fingers let me make an important point

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.649 
fingers let me make an important point
about<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.869> left<00:01:07.110> hand<00:01:07.439> thumb<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.570> think<00:01:09.570> it's

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
about the left hand thumb I think it's

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.510 
about the left hand thumb I think it's
very<00:01:09.840> important<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> left<00:01:10.860> hand<00:01:11.189> thumb

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
very important that the left hand thumb

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.250 
very important that the left hand thumb
should<00:01:12.060> always<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.689> state<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:13.049> motion

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
should always be in a state of motion

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.480 
should always be in a state of motion
you<00:01:13.920> should<00:01:14.159> keep<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.610> moving<00:01:16.189> in<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.310> nice

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you should keep it moving in a nice

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.429 
you should keep it moving in a nice
flowing<00:01:17.820> way<00:01:18.119> if<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.540> lock<00:01:18.780> your<00:01:18.960> thumb<00:01:19.229> down

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
flowing way if you lock your thumb down

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.960 
flowing way if you lock your thumb down
you<00:01:19.590> force<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.040> arm<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.430> fingers<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.790> do

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
you force the arm and fingers to do

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.910 
you force the arm and fingers to do
uncomfortable<00:01:21.630> things<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.409> move<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.799> other

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
uncomfortable things to move to other

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.300 
uncomfortable things to move to other
strings<00:01:23.780> now<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:25.049> not<00:01:25.259> necessarily<00:01:26.040> wrong

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
strings now it's not necessarily wrong

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.980 
strings now it's not necessarily wrong
to<00:01:26.700> put<00:01:26.880> your<00:01:27.000> thumb<00:01:27.240> over<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.509> top<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
to put your thumb over the top of the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.050 
to put your thumb over the top of the
fingerboard<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.799> you're<00:01:29.100> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.490> bluesy

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
fingerboard if you're going to do bluesy

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.880 
fingerboard if you're going to do bluesy
type<00:01:30.270> bends<00:01:30.630> which<00:01:30.869> require<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.470> technique

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
type bends which require that technique

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.469 
type bends which require that technique
because<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.220> does<00:01:32.460> allow<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.970> rotate<00:01:33.119> your

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
because it does allow you to rotate your

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.170 
because it does allow you to rotate your
wrist

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 

so<00:01:39.810> if<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.020> use<00:01:40.230> this<00:01:40.440> technique<00:01:40.620> of<00:01:41.010> putting

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
so if you use this technique of putting

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.470 
so if you use this technique of putting
your<00:01:41.340> thumb<00:01:41.460> over<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> fingerboard<00:01:42.090> for

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
your thumb over the fingerboard for
