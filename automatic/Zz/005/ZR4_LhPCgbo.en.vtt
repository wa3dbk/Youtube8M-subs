lucky if we get two of those back is as

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.740 
lucky if we get two of those back is as
adults<00:00:29.100> and<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.850> this<00:00:29.910> incredible<00:00:30.420> struggle

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
adults and it's this incredible struggle

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:39.369 
adults and it's this incredible struggle
between<00:00:31.080> life<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.770> death<00:00:31.860> every<00:00:32.430> single<00:00:32.759> day

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.799 

every<00:00:40.379> four<00:00:40.710> years<00:00:40.739> these<00:00:41.670> amazing<00:00:42.359> animals

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
every four years these amazing animals

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.779 
every four years these amazing animals
have<00:00:43.379> returned<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.920> their<00:00:44.100> birthplace<00:00:44.280> many

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
have returned to their birthplace many

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.610 
have returned to their birthplace many
cases<00:00:45.149> within<00:00:45.359> meters<00:00:45.780> where<00:00:46.050> they<00:00:46.199> were<00:00:46.260> born

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
cases within meters where they were born

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.369 
cases within meters where they were born
but<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.579> know<00:00:47.699> it's<00:00:48.570> sort<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.929> end<00:00:49.109> in<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
but you know it's sort of the end in the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.410 
but you know it's sort of the end in the
beginning<00:00:49.799> all<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.190> same<00:00:50.429> time

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
beginning all the same time

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.930 
beginning all the same time
the<00:00:51.690> death<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> salmon<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.339> the<00:00:53.489> birth<00:00:53.729> of

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the death of the salmon is the birth of

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.060 
the death of the salmon is the birth of
the<00:00:54.059> child<00:00:54.299> and<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.750> birth<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> child<00:00:55.500> you

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the child and the birth of the child you

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.889 
the child and the birth of the child you
know<00:00:56.189> is<00:00:56.399> dependent<00:00:57.089> upon<00:00:57.119> the<00:00:57.329> death<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
know is dependent upon the death of the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.630 
know is dependent upon the death of the
adult<00:00:58.260> before<00:00:58.439> them<00:00:58.799> they<00:00:58.920> never<00:00:59.100> meet

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
adult before them they never meet

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.639 
adult before them they never meet
they<00:00:59.699> never<00:01:00.570> connect<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.350> many<00:01:01.530> other

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
they never connect like so many other

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.649 
they never connect like so many other
animals<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.299> that<00:01:03.539> when

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
animals do and so I think that when

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.119 
animals do and so I think that when
people<00:01:03.689> come<00:01:04.170> here<00:01:04.439> they<00:01:04.589> come<00:01:04.799> here<00:01:05.070> to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
people come here they come here to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.130 
people come here they come here to
witness<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.360> moment<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.899> transition

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
witness that that moment of transition

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.230 
witness that that moment of transition
and<00:01:07.679> it's<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.159> very<00:01:08.340> powerful<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.970> poignant

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and it's a very powerful and poignant

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.550 
and it's a very powerful and poignant
story<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.780> people<00:01:10.580> it's<00:01:11.580> really<00:01:12.259> you<00:01:13.259> know<00:01:13.380> it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
story for people it's really you know it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.139 
story for people it's really you know it
sounds<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.009> cliche<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:14.610> really<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.119> a

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
sounds like a cliche but really is a

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.200 
sounds like a cliche but really is a
miracle<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.720> they<00:01:15.960> make<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.380> and

miracle that they make it and
four<00:01:19.200> out<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.710> four<00:01:20.040> thousand<00:01:20.610> or<00:01:20.730> something

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
four out of four thousand or something

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.030 
four out of four thousand or something
actually<00:01:21.270> make<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.900> back<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.410> pretty

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
actually make it back is pretty

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.870 
actually make it back is pretty
spectacular

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.830 

when<00:01:29.880> they<00:01:29.970> go<00:01:30.120> out<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> ocean<00:01:30.510> they<00:01:30.720> go<00:01:30.750> a

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
when they go out to the ocean they go a

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.110 
when they go out to the ocean they go a
long<00:01:31.140> ways<00:01:31.410> these<00:01:31.650> fish<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.130> are<00:01:32.250> spawned<00:01:32.880> up

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
long ways these fish that are spawned up

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.700 
long ways these fish that are spawned up
and<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.570> know<00:01:33.630> near<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.080> near<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.380> Rocky

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
and you know near the near the Rocky

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.760 
and you know near the near the Rocky
Mountains<00:01:35.220> up<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.820> upper<00:01:36.510> Fraser<00:01:36.780> will<00:01:37.590> go

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
Mountains up in the upper Fraser will go

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.969 
Mountains up in the upper Fraser will go
you<00:01:38.700> know<00:01:38.820> several<00:01:39.750> hundred<00:01:39.869> kilometers<00:01:40.650> over

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
you know several hundred kilometers over

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.650 
you know several hundred kilometers over
a<00:01:41.400> thousand<00:01:41.820> kilometers<00:01:42.210> out<00:01:42.330> to<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.510> mouth

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
a thousand kilometers out to the mouth

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.350 
a thousand kilometers out to the mouth
of<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.900> Fraser<00:01:43.170> then<00:01:43.890> up<00:01:44.040> along<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.520> coast<00:01:44.550> up

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
of the Fraser then up along the coast up

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.180 
of the Fraser then up along the coast up
into<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.900> Gulf<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.290> Alaska<00:01:46.410> so<00:01:47.040> they're

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
into the Gulf of Alaska so they're

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.219 
into the Gulf of Alaska so they're
traveling<00:01:47.610> several<00:01:48.060> thousand<00:01:48.479> kilometers<00:01:48.510> in

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
traveling several thousand kilometers in

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.550 
traveling several thousand kilometers in
their<00:01:49.590> lives<00:01:49.800> and<00:01:50.610> then<00:01:50.759> they<00:01:50.880> come<00:01:51.060> back<00:01:51.090> and

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
their lives and then they come back and

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:59.840 
their lives and then they come back and
so<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:53.070> it's<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.520> massive<00:01:54.149> migration<00:01:58.850> every

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
so it's a it's a massive migration every

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.120 
so it's a it's a massive migration every
four<00:02:00.119> years<00:02:00.390> there's<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.750> massive

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
four years there's this massive

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.020 
four years there's this massive
population<00:02:02.130> here<00:02:02.340> which<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.580> what<00:02:02.759> we're<00:02:02.910> in

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
population here which is what we're in

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.600 
population here which is what we're in
now<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.840> then<00:02:04.110> there's<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.350> shadow<00:02:05.070> year<00:02:05.460> about

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
now and then there's a shadow year about

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.460 
now and then there's a shadow year about
half<00:02:05.820> as<00:02:06.060> many<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.479> called<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.960> sub<00:02:07.229> dominant

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
half as many is called a sub dominant

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.499 
half as many is called a sub dominant
run<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.130> there's<00:02:08.550> two<00:02:08.790> years<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.239> really

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
run and there's two years of really

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.030 
run and there's two years of really
relative<00:02:09.959> quiet<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.619> generally<00:02:10.979> speaking

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
relative quiet but generally speaking

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.640 
relative quiet but generally speaking
it's<00:02:11.459> evolved<00:02:11.970> beyond<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:12.360> four<00:02:12.630> year<00:02:12.810> cycle

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.740 

so<00:02:16.650> 2009<00:02:17.580> we've<00:02:18.150> got<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.360> lot<00:02:18.570> of<00:02:18.600> attention

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
so 2009 we've got a lot of attention

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.620 
so 2009 we've got a lot of attention
because<00:02:19.500> we<00:02:19.709> had<00:02:19.950> unexpectedly<00:02:20.730> low<00:02:21.150> returns

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
because we had unexpectedly low returns

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.229 
because we had unexpectedly low returns
the<00:02:22.290> total<00:02:22.320> run<00:02:22.769> size<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.340> year<00:02:23.670> was<00:02:23.970> about

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
the total run size that year was about

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.660 
the total run size that year was about
1.5<00:02:24.750> million<00:02:25.200> sockeye<00:02:25.860> coming<00:02:26.250> back<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.549> the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
1.5 million sockeye coming back to the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.630 
1.5 million sockeye coming back to the
Fraser<00:02:27.290> four<00:02:28.290> years<00:02:28.470> previous<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.250> we

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
Fraser four years previous to that we

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.729 
Fraser four years previous to that we
had<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.209> order<00:02:30.420> seven<00:02:30.870> million<00:02:31.049> so<00:02:31.560> that

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
had in the order seven million so that

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.250 
had in the order seven million so that
was<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.920> significant<00:02:32.580> decline<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.330> raised

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
was a significant decline and raised

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.940 
was a significant decline and raised
concerns<00:02:35.570> where<00:02:36.570> we're<00:02:36.750> at<00:02:36.840> today<00:02:37.049> obviously

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
concerns where we're at today obviously

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.180 
concerns where we're at today obviously
looking<00:02:38.880> at<00:02:39.030> about<00:02:39.209> nineteen<00:02:39.810> point<00:02:40.290> six<00:02:40.680> or

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
looking at about nineteen point six or

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.580 
looking at about nineteen point six or
nineteen<00:02:41.580> point<00:02:41.820> eight<00:02:41.970> million<00:02:42.350> coming<00:02:43.350> back

nineteen point eight million coming back

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.759 
nineteen point eight million coming back
to<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.890> Fraser<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.750> I<00:02:45.750> would<00:02:46.350> say<00:02:46.530> things

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
to the Fraser and I would say things

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.590 
to the Fraser and I would say things
perhaps<00:02:47.430> looking<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.150> little<00:02:48.239> better<00:02:48.510> for

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
perhaps looking a little better for

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.050 
perhaps looking a little better for
placer<00:02:49.170> sockeye<00:02:49.620> than<00:02:49.799> people<00:02:50.160> feared<00:02:50.580> back

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
placer sockeye than people feared back

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.509 
placer sockeye than people feared back
in<00:02:51.299> 2009<00:02:54.560> their<00:02:55.560> mother<00:02:55.769> we<00:02:56.040> used<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.310> see

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
in 2009 their mother we used to see

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.360 
in 2009 their mother we used to see
returns<00:02:57.269> like<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:58.019> a<00:02:58.080> regular<00:02:58.620> basis

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
returns like this on a regular basis

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.250 
returns like this on a regular basis
over<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.970> hundred<00:03:00.269> years<00:03:00.420> ago<00:03:00.510> one<00:03:00.959> thing<00:03:01.140> that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
over a hundred years ago one thing that

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.069 
over a hundred years ago one thing that
we<00:03:01.350> do<00:03:01.500> know<00:03:01.530> about<00:03:01.650> Fraser<00:03:02.100> Sakai's<00:03:02.640> they're

we do know about Fraser Sakai's they're

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.509 
we do know about Fraser Sakai's they're

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.210

we have this abundant planet that we all

we have this abundant planet that we all

unique that has come together from so

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.540 
unique that has come together from so
many<00:03:46.330> thousands<00:03:47.050> of<00:03:47.080> potential<00:03:47.550> disastrous

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
to care for it we have a responsibility

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.880 
to care for it we have a responsibility

teaches us and I think when we do that
then<00:04:02.260> we<00:04:02.410> become<00:04:02.830> part<00:04:03.069> of<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.220> planet<00:04:03.640> we

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
then we become part of the planet we

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.209 
then we become part of the planet we
manage
