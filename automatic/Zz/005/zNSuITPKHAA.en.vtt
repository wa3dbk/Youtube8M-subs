do is throw the slag grenade so the slag
grenade<00:03:49.139> can<00:03:49.380> get<00:03:49.650> effect<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.700> then<00:03:51.239> me<00:03:51.450> and

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
grenade can get effect and then me and

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.690 
grenade can get effect and then me and
my<00:03:51.690> buddy<00:03:51.900> we<00:03:52.200> both<00:03:52.440> throw<00:03:52.650> kunai<00:03:53.190> zat<00:03:53.459> him

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
my buddy we both throw kunai zat him

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.759 
my buddy we both throw kunai zat him
this<00:03:54.120> gives<00:03:54.389> him<00:03:54.600> more<00:03:54.840> chance<00:03:55.260> of<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.500> slag

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
this gives him more chance of a slag

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.020 
this gives him more chance of a slag
damage<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:57.239> then<00:03:57.450> our<00:03:58.370> baby<00:03:59.370> makers<00:03:59.730> will<00:03:59.880> do<00:04:00.000> a

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
damage so then our baby makers will do a

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.900 
damage so then our baby makers will do a
lot<00:04:00.239> more<00:04:00.269> damage<00:04:00.600> and<00:04:01.430> right<00:04:02.430> here<00:04:02.609> you<00:04:02.760> can

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
lot more damage and right here you can

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.020 
lot more damage and right here you can
see<00:04:03.680> Heath<00:04:04.680> goes<00:04:04.920> into<00:04:05.160> stealth<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.579> stole<00:04:05.910> my

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
see Heath goes into stealth I stole my

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.870 
see Heath goes into stealth I stole my
slag<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.720> we<00:04:07.470> both<00:04:07.650> throw<00:04:07.829> our<00:04:08.010> cognize<00:04:08.430> and

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
slag and we both throw our cognize and

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.520 
slag and we both throw our cognize and
we<00:04:09.120> just<00:04:09.329> start<00:04:09.540> unloading<00:04:10.019> on<00:04:10.170> him<00:04:10.350> with<00:04:10.500> our

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
we just start unloading on him with our

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.820 
we just start unloading on him with our
baby<00:04:10.680> makers<00:04:11.250> we<00:04:11.459> bought

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
baby makers we bought

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.250 
baby makers we bought
had<00:04:11.950> them<00:04:12.190> and<00:04:13.090> as<00:04:13.210> you<00:04:13.300> can<00:04:13.420> see<00:04:13.450> his<00:04:13.840> coaches

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
had them and as you can see his coaches

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.039 
had them and as you can see his coaches
went<00:04:14.290> down<00:04:14.590> pretty<00:04:14.950> fast<00:04:15.450> extremely<00:04:16.450> strange

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
went down pretty fast extremely strange

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.070 
went down pretty fast extremely strange
but<00:04:17.620> now<00:04:17.739> his<00:04:17.890> robots<00:04:18.280> spawn<00:04:18.549> in<00:04:18.760> and<00:04:18.940> we<00:04:19.900> both

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.490 
but now his robots spawn in and we both
died<00:04:20.410> because<00:04:21.220> of<00:04:21.400> his<00:04:21.610> Nova<00:04:21.970> blast

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
died because of his Nova blast

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.480 
died because of his Nova blast
unfortunately<00:04:23.500> neither<00:04:23.680> of<00:04:23.890> us<00:04:24.010> had<00:04:24.190> enough

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
unfortunately neither of us had enough

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.900 
unfortunately neither of us had enough
health<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:25.450> survive<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.380> first<00:04:26.650> blast<00:04:27.010> but

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
health to survive that first blast but

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.760 
health to survive that first blast but
what<00:04:28.060> I<00:04:28.090> did<00:04:28.330> when<00:04:28.570> I<00:04:28.630> was<00:04:28.720> in<00:04:29.020> this<00:04:29.470> little

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
what I did when I was in this little

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.590 
what I did when I was in this little
last<00:04:29.980> stand<00:04:30.310> I<00:04:30.520> just<00:04:30.910> kept<00:04:31.090> throwing<00:04:31.180> my<00:04:31.420> gun

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
last stand I just kept throwing my gun

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.540 
last stand I just kept throwing my gun
at<00:04:31.750> him<00:04:31.960> and<00:04:32.110> eventually<00:04:32.590> it<00:04:33.190> ended<00:04:33.490> up

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
at him and eventually it ended up

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.260 
at him and eventually it ended up
killing<00:04:33.760> him<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.530> there<00:04:35.530> you<00:04:35.620> go<00:04:35.940> he<00:04:36.940> just

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
killing him and there you go he just

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.480 
killing him and there you go he just
died<00:04:37.510> all<00:04:38.050> you<00:04:38.230> have<00:04:38.350> to<00:04:38.470> do<00:04:38.620> left<00:04:38.890> kill<00:04:39.370> the

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
rest of his little garbage robots and

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.940 
rest of his little garbage robots and
then<00:04:42.760> we<00:04:42.970> can<00:04:43.240> check<00:04:44.200> out<00:04:44.350> all<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:44.590> loot<00:04:44.800> we

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
then we can check out all the loot we

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.840 
then we can check out all the loot we
got<00:04:45.130> I<00:04:45.900> think<00:04:46.900> I<00:04:47.170> end<00:04:47.320> up<00:04:47.380> getting<00:04:47.710> down<00:04:47.920> but

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
got I think I end up getting down but

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.250 
got I think I end up getting down but
it's<00:04:49.030> not<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:49.210> big<00:04:49.420> deal<00:04:49.450> because<00:04:49.810> you<00:04:50.110> can<00:04:50.230> just

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
it's not a big deal because you can just

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.100 
it's not a big deal because you can just
walk<00:04:50.620> back<00:04:50.890> in<00:04:51.100> there<00:04:51.280> and<00:04:51.820> kill<00:04:52.090> them<00:04:52.270> without

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
walk back in there and kill them without

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.070 
walk back in there and kill them without
a<00:04:53.290> problem<00:04:54.000> but<00:04:55.000> after<00:04:55.150> we<00:04:55.360> get<00:04:55.510> that<00:04:55.750> we<00:04:55.930> just

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
a problem but after we get that we just

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.020 
a problem but after we get that we just
go<00:04:56.260> ahead<00:04:56.350> and<00:04:56.470> check<00:04:56.710> out<00:04:56.890> all<00:04:56.920> our<00:04:57.040> loot<00:04:57.370> it's

crystals and then then again the seraphs

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.810 
crystals and then then again the seraphs
crystals<00:05:25.840> aren't<00:05:26.050> even<00:05:26.200> that<00:05:26.290> good<00:05:26.530> either
