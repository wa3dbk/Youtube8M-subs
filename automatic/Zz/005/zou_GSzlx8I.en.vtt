00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.370 
studio engineers will begin to ask you
what<00:01:47.340> equipment<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.909> use<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.450> one<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
what equipment you use and one of the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.010 
what equipment you use and one of the
things<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:50.280> they<00:01:50.720> generally<00:01:51.720> speaking

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
things that they generally speaking

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.770 
things that they generally speaking
again<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> general<00:01:53.030> general<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.630> know

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
again this is a general general you know

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.530 
again this is a general general you know
broad<00:01:55.380> generalization<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.909> most<00:01:57.210> studio

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
broad generalization is that most studio

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.130 
broad generalization is that most studio
engineers<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.560> not<00:01:58.890> or<00:01:59.219> do<00:01:59.520> not<00:01:59.670> do<00:02:00.420> not<00:02:00.450> accept

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
engineers do not or do not do not accept

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.810 
engineers do not or do not do not accept
work<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.829> recorded<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.490> USB

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
work that is recorded on a USB

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.910 
work that is recorded on a USB
microphone<00:02:03.149> now<00:02:04.020> people<00:02:04.560> more<00:02:04.710> qualified

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
microphone now people more qualified

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.069 
microphone now people more qualified
than<00:02:05.729> myself<00:02:05.969> could<00:02:06.479> go<00:02:06.570> into<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.810> great

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
than myself could go into a great

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.529 
than myself could go into a great
explanation<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.829> why<00:02:07.979> frankly<00:02:08.819> for<00:02:09.300> me

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
explanation of why frankly for me

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.690 
explanation of why frankly for me
I<00:02:09.569> don't<00:02:09.929> care<00:02:10.140> why<00:02:10.319> all<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:11.160> care<00:02:11.430> about<00:02:11.459> is

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
I don't care why all I care about is

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.550 
I don't care why all I care about is
what<00:02:12.060> my<00:02:12.239> clients<00:02:12.959> want

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
what my clients want

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.970 
what my clients want
because<00:02:14.040> from<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.940> marketing<00:02:15.390> mindset

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
because from a marketing mindset

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.400 
because from a marketing mindset
perception<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.160> reality<00:02:17.600> so<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.959> know<00:02:19.290> we

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
perception is reality so you know we

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.710 
perception is reality so you know we
could<00:02:19.560> sit<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:19.980> argue<00:02:20.100> as<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.580> whether<00:02:20.940> USB<00:02:21.510> is

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
could sit and argue as to whether USB is

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.890 
could sit and argue as to whether USB is
as<00:02:21.930> good<00:02:22.170> or<00:02:22.230> better<00:02:22.680> than<00:02:23.459> having<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.480> large

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
as good or better than having a large

as good or better than having a large

like<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.080> here<00:02:28.350> but<00:02:28.620> really<00:02:28.860> that's<00:02:29.010> not

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
like this here but really that's not

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.890 
like this here but really that's not
even<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.459> issue<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.880> issue<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.270> what<00:02:30.780> do

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
even the issue the issue is what do

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.440 
even the issue the issue is what do
clients<00:02:31.319> one<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:32.640> being<00:02:32.850> said<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.090> lot<00:02:33.360> of

clients one that being said a lot of
clients<00:02:33.660> don't<00:02:34.620> know<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.890> difference<00:02:35.280> and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
clients don't know the difference and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.910 
clients don't know the difference and
our<00:02:35.760> will<00:02:36.000> gladly<00:02:36.270> accept<00:02:36.750> audio<00:02:37.200> recorded<00:02:37.800> on

our will gladly accept audio recorded on
a<00:02:37.950> USB<00:02:38.310> microphone<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.660> not<00:02:39.780> to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
a USB microphone and this is not to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.380 
a USB microphone and this is not to
disparage<00:02:40.620> USB<00:02:41.040> microphones<00:02:41.580> because<00:02:41.819> the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
disparage USB microphones because the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.850 
disparage USB microphones because the
technology<00:02:42.989> is<00:02:43.020> certainly<00:02:43.200> getting<00:02:43.500> better

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
technology is certainly getting better

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.370 
technology is certainly getting better
and<00:02:44.069> I've<00:02:44.940> heard<00:02:45.180> some<00:02:45.390> very<00:02:45.420> fine<00:02:45.870> audio

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
and I've heard some very fine audio

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.890 
and I've heard some very fine audio
being<00:02:46.620> recorded<00:02:47.190> through<00:02:47.880> USB<00:02:48.209> microphones

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
being recorded through USB microphones

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.780 
being recorded through USB microphones
but<00:02:49.140> what<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.320> am<00:02:49.500> Telling<00:02:49.890> You<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.459> from<00:02:50.700> a

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
but what I am Telling You is that from a

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.310 
but what I am Telling You is that from a
marketing<00:02:50.970> standpoint<00:02:51.450> we<00:02:51.959> don't<00:02:52.110> want<00:02:52.230> to

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
marketing standpoint we don't want to

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.920 
marketing standpoint we don't want to
create<00:02:52.500> any<00:02:52.800> barriers<00:02:53.459> we<00:02:54.090> want<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.510> have<00:02:54.690> no

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
create any barriers we want to have no

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.920 
create any barriers we want to have no
resistance<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:56.130> client<00:02:56.519> hiring<00:02:57.510> us<00:02:57.690> or

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
resistance and a client hiring us or

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.500 
resistance and a client hiring us or
considering<00:02:58.620> us<00:02:58.739> for<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> job<00:02:59.220> so<00:02:59.360> again<00:03:00.360> my

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
considering us for a job so again my

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.170 
considering us for a job so again my
recommendation<00:03:01.280> outside<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.430> auditions<00:03:03.000> and

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
recommendation outside of auditions and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.270 
recommendation outside of auditions and
I<00:03:03.239> think<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.660> think<00:03:03.900> USB<00:03:04.319> microphones<00:03:04.890> for<00:03:05.160> an

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
I think I think USB microphones for an

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.660 
I think I think USB microphones for an
audition<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.850> fine<00:03:06.810> but<00:03:07.530> ultimately<00:03:07.980> when<00:03:08.550> you

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
audition is fine but ultimately when you

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.390 
audition is fine but ultimately when you
market<00:03:09.030> yourself<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:09.900> outside

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
market yourself to that outside

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.620 
market yourself to that outside
multimedia<00:03:11.400> production<00:03:11.790> studio<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.390> they

multimedia production studio and they
say<00:03:12.959> or<00:03:13.260> ask<00:03:13.440> you<00:03:13.680> what<00:03:14.010> equipment<00:03:14.550> you<00:03:14.640> use
