00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
so give you very good flavor you also

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.740 
so give you very good flavor you also
need<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.860> sprinkle<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.640> air<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.510> powder

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
need to sprinkle the air and in powder

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.840 
need to sprinkle the air and in powder
later<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.199> want<00:00:55.320> put<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.710> already<00:00:56.010> again<00:00:56.280> get

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
later you want put it already again get

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.549 
later you want put it already again get
burning<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.559> heat<00:01:00.260> takes<00:01:01.260> about<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
burning so that is heat takes about a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:21.389 
burning so that is heat takes about a
minute<00:01:04.700> then

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.219 

the<00:01:21.820> principle<00:01:22.270> is<00:01:22.359> that<00:01:22.390> you'll<00:01:22.719> keep<00:01:22.990> the

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
the principle is that you'll keep the

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.810 
the principle is that you'll keep the
oil<00:01:23.609> hot<00:01:24.609> very<00:01:25.090> hot<00:01:25.329> and<00:01:25.630> then<00:01:26.429> this<00:01:27.429> kind<00:01:27.640> of

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
oil hot very hot and then this kind of

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.209 
oil hot very hot and then this kind of
very<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.420> leafy<00:01:28.869> vegetable<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.500> put<00:01:29.950> it<00:01:30.069> in

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
very the leafy vegetable you put it in

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:34.080 
very the leafy vegetable you put it in
you<00:01:30.520> very<00:01:31.420> quickly<00:01:31.929> sir<00:01:32.289> fry<00:01:32.619> so<00:01:33.219> be<00:01:33.579> cooking

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
you very quickly sir fry so be cooking

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.649 
you very quickly sir fry so be cooking
very<00:01:34.329> short<00:01:34.689> time<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.229> it<00:01:36.039> gets<00:01:36.340> your<00:01:36.659> return

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
very short time and it gets your return

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:54.959 
very short time and it gets your return
loaded<00:01:38.110> by<00:01:38.289> the<00:01:38.319> museum<00:01:39.009> for<00:01:39.789> the

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:58.610 

so<00:01:55.149> you'll

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.330 

even<00:01:59.620> who<00:01:59.800> our<00:01:59.950> bill<00:02:00.220> also<00:02:00.490> as<00:02:01.890> all<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.130> leaves

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
even who our bill also as all the leaves

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.450 
even who our bill also as all the leaves
change<00:02:03.670> color<00:02:04.000> pick<00:02:04.870> them<00:02:05.020> out<00:02:05.110> right<00:02:05.260> away

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
change color pick them out right away

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.770 
change color pick them out right away
don't<00:02:06.460> wait<00:02:06.670> too<00:02:06.850> long<00:02:06.880> didn't<00:02:07.330> overcook

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
don't wait too long didn't overcook

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.940 
don't wait too long didn't overcook
we'll<00:02:08.680> be<00:02:09.330> turning<00:02:10.330> them

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.920 

if<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.070> cook<00:02:15.310> smaller<00:02:15.790> portions<00:02:16.420> we<00:02:16.720> don't

if you cook smaller portions we don't

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.830 
if you cook smaller portions we don't
need<00:02:17.050> an<00:02:17.200> okay<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.640> shorter<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.150> sprinkle

you could let the oil get even hotter

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.540 
you could let the oil get even hotter
but<00:02:40.540> that<00:02:40.750> was<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:40.990> little<00:02:41.410> messy<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.070> I<00:02:42.340> don't

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
bother to do that yeah

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.699
