so<00:00:11.459> today<00:00:11.760> we're<00:00:11.879> going<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.059> look<00:00:12.150> at<00:00:12.360> motion

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260 
so today we're going to look at motion

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.700 
so today we're going to look at motion
tweening<00:00:13.529> in<00:00:13.920> cs4<00:00:15.139> which<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.320> different<00:00:16.529> to

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
tweening in cs4 which is different to

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.910 
tweening in cs4 which is different to
the<00:00:17.039> way<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.189> would<00:00:17.400> do<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.880> cs3<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.920> flush

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the way you would do it in cs3 and flush

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.700 
the way you would do it in cs3 and flush
8<00:00:20.279> because<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.419> is<00:00:21.539> now<00:00:21.689> called<00:00:21.990> classic

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
8 because that is now called classic

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.460 
8 because that is now called classic
tweening<00:00:23.009> and<00:00:23.480> if<00:00:24.480> you're<00:00:24.749> used<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.140> doing<00:00:25.289> it

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
tweening and if you're used to doing it

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.890 
tweening and if you're used to doing it
that<00:00:25.529> way<00:00:25.679> the<00:00:26.249> new<00:00:26.550> way<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.150> motion<00:00:27.689> tweening

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
that way the new way of motion tweening

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.800 
that way the new way of motion tweening
can<00:00:28.259> be<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> bit<00:00:28.710> confusing<00:00:28.739> at<00:00:29.339> first<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:29.880> it's

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
can be a bit confusing at first but it's

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.970 
can be a bit confusing at first but it's
it's<00:00:31.169> fairly<00:00:31.739> similarly<00:00:33.050> so<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:34.800> two

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
it's fairly similarly so we have two

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.130 
it's fairly similarly so we have two
balls<00:00:35.220> on<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.489> stage<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.450> top<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:36.960> going

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
balls on the stage the top one is going

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.750 
balls on the stage the top one is going
to<00:00:37.200> be<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.500> classic<00:00:37.740> tween<00:00:38.130> so<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.400> can<00:00:38.550> show<00:00:38.700> you

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
to be a classic tween so we can show you

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.010 
to be a classic tween so we can show you
how<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.000> would<00:00:39.240> do<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.630> if<00:00:39.810> you're<00:00:39.900> not

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
how we would do that if you're not

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.170 
how we would do that if you're not
familiar<00:00:40.170> with<00:00:40.560> it<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.400> bottom<00:00:41.850> red<00:00:42.030> one

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
familiar with it and the bottom red one

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.460 
familiar with it and the bottom red one
is<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.630> one<00:00:42.810> of<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> new<00:00:43.260> motion

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
is going to be one of the new motion

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.730 
is going to be one of the new motion
tweens<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:45.170> obviously<00:00:46.170> with<00:00:46.380> the<00:00:46.440> classic

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
tweens so obviously with the classic

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.920 
tweens so obviously with the classic
tween<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.130> need<00:00:47.490> to<00:00:47.670> select<00:00:48.420> your<00:00:48.540> ship<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
tween you need to select your ship and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.490 
tween you need to select your ship and
convert<00:00:49.290> it<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.500> symbol<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:51.140> now<00:00:52.140> I'm<00:00:52.410> just

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
convert it to a symbol and now I'm just

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.900 
convert it to a symbol and now I'm just
going<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> friend<00:00:53.190> 50<00:00:53.400> I<00:00:53.580> want<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.850> to

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
going to go to friend 50 I want this to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.120 
going to go to friend 50 I want this to
be<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.090> 50<00:00:54.420> frame<00:00:54.630> animation<00:00:55.170> I'm<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.040> to

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
be a 50 frame animation I'm going to

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.930 
be a 50 frame animation I'm going to
press<00:00:56.280> f6<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.300> insert<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> keyframe<00:00:58.370> and<00:00:59.370> now<00:00:59.580> or

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
press f6 to insert a keyframe and now or

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.130 
press f6 to insert a keyframe and now or
you<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.330> just<00:01:00.420> right-click<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.840> frame

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
you can just right-click the frame

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.620 
you can just right-click the frame
select<00:01:01.620> insert<00:01:01.890> keyframe<00:01:02.450> now<00:01:03.450> I'm<00:01:03.540> just

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
select insert keyframe now I'm just

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.270 
select insert keyframe now I'm just
going<00:01:03.810> to<00:01:03.840> drag<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.259> ball<00:01:04.530> across<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> stage

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
going to drag this ball across the stage

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.270 
going to drag this ball across the stage
and<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.329> way<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.509> would<00:01:06.659> complete<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.860> motion

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and the way you would complete a motion

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.250 
and the way you would complete a motion
tween<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.670> flash<00:01:09.000> cs3<00:01:09.360> our<00:01:09.720> old<00:01:09.870> days<00:01:10.020> you

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
tween in flash cs3 our old days you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.230 
tween in flash cs3 our old days you
would<00:01:10.290> select<00:01:10.560> create<00:01:10.890> motion<00:01:11.130> tween<00:01:11.490> but

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
would select create motion tween but

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.060 
would select create motion tween but
obviously<00:01:12.780> now<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.200> called<00:01:13.409> create<00:01:13.680> classic

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
obviously now it's called create classic

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.030 
obviously now it's called create classic
doing<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.430> now<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.270> our<00:01:15.800> motion<00:01:16.800> tween

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
doing and now we have our motion tween

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.630 
doing and now we have our motion tween
or<00:01:17.220> classically<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:20.100> way<00:01:20.220> we<00:01:20.340> will<00:01:20.460> do

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
or classically so the way we will do

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.320 
or classically so the way we will do
this<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.170> cs4<00:01:22.220> it's<00:01:23.220> not<00:01:23.430> entirely<00:01:23.790> different

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
this in cs4 it's not entirely different

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.770 
this in cs4 it's not entirely different
but<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:25.380> routine<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> little<00:01:26.250> different<00:01:26.550> so

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
but the routine is a little different so

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.300 
but the routine is a little different so
I'm<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.140> select<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.500> again<00:01:28.920> like

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
I'm just going to select this again like

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.060 
I'm just going to select this again like
we<00:01:29.400> did<00:01:29.430> with<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.290> classic<00:01:31.290> tween<00:01:31.560> I'm<00:01:31.800> going

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
we did with the classic tween I'm going

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.219 
we did with the classic tween I'm going
to<00:01:32.130> convert<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:32.790> movie<00:01:33.420> clip<00:01:33.510> I'm<00:01:33.870> then

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
to convert it to a movie clip I'm then

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.410 
to convert it to a movie clip I'm then
going<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.440> go<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.680> frame<00:01:35.159> 50<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.970> then<00:01:36.210> just

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
going to go to frame 50 and then just

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.420 
going to go to frame 50 and then just
insert<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> frame<00:01:37.409> instead<00:01:37.830> of<00:01:37.979> inserting<00:01:38.220> a

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
insert a frame instead of inserting a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.780 
insert a frame instead of inserting a
keyframe<00:01:39.560> now<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.620> can<00:01:41.040> right-click<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
keyframe now we can right-click the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.090 
keyframe now we can right-click the
frame<00:01:42.240> span<00:01:42.570> anyway<00:01:42.960> in-between<00:01:43.380> frames<00:01:43.680> one

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
frame span anyway in-between frames one

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.070 
frame span anyway in-between frames one
and<00:01:44.310> fifty<00:01:44.640> i'm<00:01:45.120> going<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.330> select<00:01:45.690> create

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
and fifty i'm going to select create

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.990 
and fifty i'm going to select create
emotion<00:01:46.530> join<00:01:46.770> already<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.700> see<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
emotion join already you can see a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.969 
emotion join already you can see a
difference<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:48.869> timeline<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.799> by<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
difference in the timeline just by the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.880 
difference in the timeline just by the
colors<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:51.150> first<00:01:51.420> let's<00:01:51.659> finish<00:01:52.619> this

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
colors but first let's finish this

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.520 
colors but first let's finish this
animation<00:01:53.250> before<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.760> take<00:01:53.940> a<00:01:53.970> look<00:01:54.150> at<00:01:54.299> that

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
animation before we take a look at that

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.840 
animation before we take a look at that
so<00:01:55.530> i'm<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:55.650> going<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> select<00:01:56.070> friend<00:01:56.400> 50r

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
so i'm just going to select friend 50r

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.940 
so i'm just going to select friend 50r
i'm<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.810> drag<00:01:58.080> this<00:01:58.320> ball<00:01:58.590> over

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
i'm just going to drag this ball over

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.370 
i'm just going to drag this ball over
too

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
too

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.399 
too
this<00:01:59.860> side<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.820> now<00:02:01.030> that<00:02:01.450> animation<00:02:01.810> is<00:02:02.110> also

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
this side and now that animation is also

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.289 
this side and now that animation is also
complete<00:02:02.829> you<00:02:03.369> can<00:02:03.399> probably<00:02:03.700> see<00:02:03.880> already

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
complete you can probably see already

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.749 
complete you can probably see already
there's<00:02:04.600> some<00:02:04.930> differences<00:02:05.469> here<00:02:05.530> in<00:02:05.920> the

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
there's some differences here in the

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.339 
there's some differences here in the
timeline<00:02:07.030> we<00:02:07.390> don't<00:02:07.570> get<00:02:07.689> this<00:02:07.810> arrow<00:02:08.050> going

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
timeline we don't get this arrow going

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.240 
timeline we don't get this arrow going
across<00:02:08.560> here<00:02:08.800> anymore<00:02:09.220> which<00:02:09.660> signifies<00:02:10.660> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
across here anymore which signifies the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.009 
across here anymore which signifies the
classic<00:02:12.250> tween<00:02:12.430> we<00:02:13.269> just<00:02:13.450> get<00:02:13.569> this<00:02:13.750> kind<00:02:13.900> of

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
classic tween we just get this kind of

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.270 
classic tween we just get this kind of
light<00:02:14.620> blue<00:02:15.120> turquoise<00:02:16.120> color<00:02:16.739> for<00:02:17.739> a<00:02:17.769> new

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
light blue turquoise color for a new

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.550 
light blue turquoise color for a new
motion<00:02:18.459> tween<00:02:18.819> also<00:02:19.690> on<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.900> stage<00:02:20.140> here<00:02:20.410> you

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
motion tween also on the stage here you

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.000 
motion tween also on the stage here you
can<00:02:20.739> see<00:02:20.980> this<00:02:21.819> motion<00:02:22.330> path<00:02:22.540> here<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:23.010> think

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
can see this motion path here I think

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.830 
can see this motion path here I think
each<00:02:24.250> one<00:02:24.310> of<00:02:24.550> these<00:02:24.730> dots<00:02:25.090> represents<00:02:25.780> a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
each one of these dots represents a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.259 
each one of these dots represents a
frame<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.400> also<00:02:27.400> as<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.610> see<00:02:27.819> here<00:02:28.060> when<00:02:28.239> I

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
frame and also as you see here when I

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.710 
frame and also as you see here when I
hover<00:02:28.510> over<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:29.019> with<00:02:29.920> my<00:02:30.069> selection<00:02:30.610> tool<00:02:30.720> it

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
hover over it with my selection tool it

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.030 
hover over it with my selection tool it
gives<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.200> ability<00:02:32.349> to<00:02:32.890> manipulate<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:34.030> path

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
gives the ability to manipulate the path

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.949 
gives the ability to manipulate the path
you<00:02:36.040> can<00:02:36.160> also<00:02:36.280> extend<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.849> by<00:02:37.030> adjusting<00:02:37.480> this

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
you can also extend it by adjusting this

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.610 
you can also extend it by adjusting this
end<00:02:38.610> point<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:40.540> let's<00:02:40.900> try<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.319> let's<00:02:41.560> just

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
end point so let's try that let's just

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.410 
end point so let's try that let's just
click<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.130> drag<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.880> can<00:02:43.060> pull<00:02:43.269> this

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
click and drag and you can pull this

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.930 
click and drag and you can pull this
whole<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.989> lot<00:02:44.380> up<00:02:44.680> this<00:02:45.280> whole<00:02:45.489> animation

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
whole a lot up this whole animation

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.289 
whole a lot up this whole animation
around<00:02:47.370> obviously<00:02:48.370> all<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:48.880> need<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.120> do<00:02:49.269> is

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
around obviously all you need to do is

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.550 
around obviously all you need to do is
just<00:02:51.360> scrub<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.510> timeline<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.290> get<00:02:53.440> this

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
just scrub the timeline and you get this

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.350 
just scrub the timeline and you get this
animation<00:02:53.950> change<00:02:54.400> without<00:02:54.790> actually<00:02:55.269> having

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
animation change without actually having

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.589 
animation change without actually having
to<00:02:55.540> adjust<00:02:55.720> anything<00:02:56.170> in<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.470> timeline<00:02:57.599> so

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
to adjust anything in the timeline so

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.940 
to adjust anything in the timeline so
that's<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.900> really<00:02:59.200> handy<00:02:59.470> thing<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.709> be<00:02:59.890> able

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
that's a really handy thing to be able

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.530 
that's a really handy thing to be able
to<00:03:00.099> do<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:01.060> can<00:03:01.209> also<00:03:01.329> extend<00:03:02.489> animations

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
to do you can also extend animations

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.720 
to do you can also extend animations
motion<00:03:04.540> tween<00:03:04.810> new<00:03:04.989> motion<00:03:05.200> tweens<00:03:05.650> in<00:03:05.950> CS<00:03:06.459> far

motion tween new motion tweens in CS far
as<00:03:07.239> you<00:03:07.359> can<00:03:07.510> see<00:03:07.720> here<00:03:07.959> when<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:08.500> hover<00:03:08.680> over

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
as you can see here when I hover over

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.610 
as you can see here when I hover over
the<00:03:09.069> end<00:03:09.220> frame<00:03:10.000> here<00:03:10.269> it<00:03:11.109> just<00:03:11.140> lets<00:03:11.530> you

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
the end frame here it just lets you

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.199 
the end frame here it just lets you
click<00:03:11.859> and<00:03:12.069> drag<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.760> can<00:03:12.910> just<00:03:13.060> bring

click and drag and you can just bring

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.030 
click and drag and you can just bring
that<00:03:13.359> out<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.630> whichever<00:03:13.870> frame<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.319> want<00:03:14.500> and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
that out to whichever frame you want and

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.160 
that out to whichever frame you want and
it's<00:03:15.160> going<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.370> keep<00:03:15.609> it<00:03:15.790> exactly<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.930> same

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
it's going to keep it exactly the same

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.349 
it's going to keep it exactly the same
and<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:18.190> can<00:03:18.340> see<00:03:18.489> there's<00:03:18.700> more<00:03:18.910> dots<00:03:19.150> here

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
and you can see there's more dots here

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.960 
and you can see there's more dots here
because<00:03:19.630> we've<00:03:19.750> got<00:03:19.870> my<00:03:19.989> friends<00:03:20.519> so<00:03:21.519> I'm<00:03:21.549> just

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
because we've got my friends so I'm just

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.360 
because we've got my friends so I'm just
going<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.180> do<00:03:22.420> that<00:03:22.630> it's<00:03:23.350> not<00:03:23.560> it's<00:03:24.220> not

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
going to do that it's not it's not

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.699 
going to do that it's not it's not
entirely<00:03:24.850> different<00:03:25.389> but<00:03:25.750> obviously<00:03:26.319> the<00:03:26.530> way

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
entirely different but obviously the way

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.069 
entirely different but obviously the way
did<00:03:27.310> you<00:03:27.459> go<00:03:27.489> about<00:03:27.760> creating<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.690> with

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
did you go about creating it and with

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.860 
did you go about creating it and with
this<00:03:29.260> motion<00:03:29.680> path<00:03:29.889> here<00:03:30.880> it<00:03:31.090> can<00:03:31.480> be<00:03:31.510> a<00:03:31.660> bit

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
this motion path here it can be a bit

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.900 
this motion path here it can be a bit
confusing<00:03:32.160> but<00:03:33.160> it's<00:03:33.430> always<00:03:33.700> good<00:03:33.880> to

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
confusing but it's always good to

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.509 
confusing but it's always good to
experiment<00:03:34.600> with<00:03:34.660> these<00:03:35.200> new<00:03:35.560> motion<00:03:36.130> tweens

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
experiment with these new motion tweens

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.490 
experiment with these new motion tweens
so<00:03:36.819> I<00:03:36.850> encourage<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.389> to<00:03:37.480> do<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:37.750> thanks<00:03:38.380> for

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
so I encourage you to do so thanks for
