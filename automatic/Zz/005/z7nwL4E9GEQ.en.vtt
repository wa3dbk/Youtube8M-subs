00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.700
 we'll start with a great recipe 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.559
 simple clean with three ingredients there 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.789
 you see it there is quinoa curry 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.219
 and raisins 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.039
 simply we start by putting 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.610
 a little bit of flake kinois in 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.460
 a saucepan 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.570
 we add a little water about two 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.340
 times more water than Kinshasa 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.899
 at least we put the pan on low heat 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.059
 for only a few minutes 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.250
 and then our quinoa is ready it is 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.700
 put in a bowl with curry and 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.380
 little Reims 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.909
 Raisins can be added to 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.710
 beginning of the recipe with the quinoa in 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.939
 the pan like that hear well 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.070
 rehydrate property would be 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.259
 modified or can be added to the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.590
 end with the curry ben it's you who 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.900
 see 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.430
 and the result obtained but I tell you 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.650
 it is super good there is a little bit 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.320
 sweet it always looks like a recipe 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.299
 salty with curry all this and more 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.880
 it's not a real lucky cereal no 1 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.079
 it's a fake cereal quinoa 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.060
 is not a glue it's not 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.659
 breadmakers you can eat it's 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.420
 cooked vegetable 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.490
 great after this simple recipe and very 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.880
 I also propose rolls of 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.590
 spring 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.750
 we can prepare them with leaves 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.280
 of rice or nori congress 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.320
 hydrate and then on the table we place 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.479
 full of small vermicelli ingredients 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.700
 rice grated carrot grated beetroot 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.960
 grated zucchini possibly 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.030
 soy sprouts or tofu 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.189
 be careful with soy because it's 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.969
 an endocrine disruptor so the 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.439
 less often possible 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.390
 we can also put on the table a bowl 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.549
 of cheetah that is rehydrating 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.550
 salad spinach chard 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.490
 coriander from there 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.990
 of course the lawyer and each of them 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.480
 like all that on his plate and get 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.730
 Regale I find it very user-friendly 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.290
 fresh when I sleep for the recipe 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.020
 next I used as an indication 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.250
 a lack of 360 g 1 pepper of 320 g 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.310
 small zucchini weighing in 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.870
 all 4160 grams and 5 to 10 g 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.460
 chives and with its four 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.380
 ingredients I'm leaving a sauce and the 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.030
 zucchini spaghetti in another 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.220
 video I had prepared a sauce for 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.900
 salad with mango and red pepper 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.940
 and in that one I use both 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.220
 third of red pepper and mango 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.020
 whole I mix together on the one hand 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.790
 and then on the other hand I'm doing 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.410
 zucchini spaghetti with my three 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.300
 small zucchini with a small size 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.460
 pencil the rest of the zucchini which did 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.780
 could not be turned into spaghetti I 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.240
 put it in the blender to make the 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.490
 sauce this sauce and very fragrant one 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.930
 the shower on our spaghetti we added 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.640
 diced peppers and chives 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.680
 and voila 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.570

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.510

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.590
 meal with two ingredients strawberry banana 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.570
 we finally start to find strawberries 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.640
 in the market so I thought too 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.750
 banana strawberry for bananas you 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.940

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.390
 others are not too ready but that 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.980
 pass again I place the strawberries at 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.959
 blender background with leaves 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.220
 it's like chlorophyll and bananas 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.930
 on top of that they are a little 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.989
 little less juicy or 1000 his mix and 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.880
 my good appetite for me that's 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.880
 really a good meal it's not a 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.350
 desert his meals for those who have a 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.140
 dehydrator we can make crackers 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.930
 super simple very quickly dried with 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.840
 flax seeds from the curry squash 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.140
 dill is good it crackles under the 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.580
 tooth 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.900

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.550
 share that I like to do it from 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.040
 from time to time but most of the time 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.989
 I make bowls of fruit then the 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.270
 fruits of the season the fruits that are 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.400
 affordable for me what I want 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.070
 on the moment for most of the time 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.110
 find bananas in winter I use 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.510
 a lot of tropical fruits and was 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.760
 I use a lot of local fruits that 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.550
 can resist the papaya or so to 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.470
 diamond 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:12.810
 only figs a raspberry coulis 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.190
 well yes the ripe mango or 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.350
 passion fruit goes nothing but the name 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.790
 he is very evocative and I challenge 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.680
 whoever to resist my sauce 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.810
 chocolate that is not cocoa-based 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.760
 by the way but carob-based 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.080
 bowls of fruit reigns pure pleasure of 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.460
 eyes 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.720
 the ripe hollow fruits they still have 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.460
 all their colors and it gives 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.470
 so hungry now I find that 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.270
