00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
games and figure out if it's worth it

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.319

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
doesn't matter to me if a game is good

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.420 
doesn't matter to me if a game is good
or<00:03:07.390> not<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.780> will<00:03:08.109> still<00:03:08.409> play<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.890> if<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.159> lot<00:03:09.310> of

or not I will still play it if a lot of
people<00:03:09.519> play<00:03:09.849> it<00:03:10.000> if<00:03:10.120> there's<00:03:10.299> a<00:03:10.359> community

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
people play it if there's a community

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.509 
people play it if there's a community
around<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.319> so<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:11.739> just<00:03:11.799> wanted<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.250> throw<00:03:12.459> that

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
around it so I just wanted to throw that

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.759 
around it so I just wanted to throw that
part<00:03:12.940> out<00:03:13.060> but<00:03:13.420> anyway<00:03:14.319> back<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.590> what<00:03:14.650> I'll

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
part out but anyway back to what I'll

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.170 
part out but anyway back to what I'll
saying<00:03:14.950> about<00:03:15.069> brink<00:03:15.370> so<00:03:15.549> I<00:03:15.609> decided<00:03:15.879> go<00:03:16.000> pick

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
saying about brink so I decided go pick

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.580 
saying about brink so I decided go pick
up<00:03:16.239> break<00:03:16.480> today<00:03:16.750> I've<00:03:17.169> already<00:03:17.319> played<00:03:17.500> a

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
up break today I've already played a

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.069 
up break today I've already played a
couple<00:03:17.769> of<00:03:17.919> games<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:19.090> know<00:03:19.419> I<00:03:19.450> don't<00:03:19.690> have<00:03:19.840> a

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
couple of games you know I don't have a

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.349 
couple of games you know I don't have a
solid<00:03:20.560> impression<00:03:21.370> on<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.669> besides<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.209> fact

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
solid impression on it besides the fact

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.759 
solid impression on it besides the fact
that<00:03:23.250> there<00:03:24.250> are<00:03:24.280> some<00:03:24.669> lag<00:03:24.970> type<00:03:25.540> issues<00:03:25.810> so

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
that there are some lag type issues so

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.470 
that there are some lag type issues so
moving<00:03:27.130> around<00:03:27.340> type<00:03:27.760> issues<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.269> think

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
moving around type issues and I think

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.110 
moving around type issues and I think
the<00:03:28.540> other<00:03:28.629> infrastructure<00:03:29.319> is<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:30.430> Steve

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
the other infrastructure is is Steve

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.809 
the other infrastructure is is Steve
Schwinn<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.720> its<00:03:31.840> aid<00:03:32.579> infrastructure<00:03:33.579> type

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
Schwinn to its aid infrastructure type

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.180 
Schwinn to its aid infrastructure type
deals<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.419> those<00:03:34.599> are<00:03:34.720> things<00:03:34.870> are<00:03:35.470> not<00:03:35.709> sorry

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
deals so those are things are not sorry

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.180 
deals so those are things are not sorry
not<00:03:36.760> infringe<00:03:37.590> infrastructure<00:03:38.590> type<00:03:38.859> deal

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
games that I

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.629 
games that I
played<00:04:26.169> or<00:04:26.470> maybe<00:04:26.710> I<00:04:26.830> just<00:04:26.919> agree<00:04:27.340> with<00:04:27.370> them

a<00:04:31.210> 7.9<00:04:31.690> is<00:04:32.610> going<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.669> be<00:04:33.729> an<00:04:33.820> amazing<00:04:34.000> game<00:04:34.330> but

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
a 7.9 is going to be an amazing game but
