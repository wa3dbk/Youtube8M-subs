00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.360
 hello, I'm anna de pasteles the Moreliana and 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.220
 today I leave you this video recipe let's go 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.510
 with the ingredients 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.030
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:18.590
 for our cake for baby shower 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.260
 we are going to need what is a liter and 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.930
 half of milk because I have two 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.289
 jellies that are 1 milk with flavor 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.760
 Break the other strawberry flavor 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.700
 and right now I only have 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.730
 what about three cups of milk that are 24 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.860
 ounces of milk since jellies are 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.750
 to prepare in a liter of milk 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.820
 and I will remove what is being 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.329
 a cup 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.540
 a cup or glass of milk to make 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:56.340
 the firmer consistency here I have 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.340
 chantilly raspberry flavor 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.160
 I'm going to leave them in the little box 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.680
 information the link as I prepare it and 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:12.350
 there I have a bread 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:15.760
 of measure 15 by 7 is a mold 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.000
 small 15 x 7 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.030
 15 round and 7 high and I'm going to 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.550
 need another mold cited larger 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.830
 d 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.830
 20 centimeters by 7 high 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.830
 centimeters 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.039
 and here I have some cutters is a foot and 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.829
 a little hand but you can do it 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.539
 with cutters and without or without cutters 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.310
 as you like, let's go with the 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.600
 preparation that I'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.440
 cut 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.170
 the bread in two parts 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.200
 to put the filling in the channel and 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.310
 I have a pastel gel also with the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.800
 collaboration united in the fight and there I 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.640
 They asked me to explain a little 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.980
 more mold we have to grease I 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.170
 sometimes I use butter butter 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.380
 vegetable and here on this occasion I'm going to 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.910
 use edible oil 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.069
 then I put a little bit the 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.480
 napkin 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.480
 a paper napkin 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.830
 and I'll start putting it here 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.650
 trying to make everything look good 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.360
 oiled 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.980
 so that the time we're going to 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.980
 unmold our jellies 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.700
 we are not sticking here is time and 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.230
 that my milk is very hot is when 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.380
 I add gelatin 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.540
 and already when the gelatin of this 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.740
 colder than hot is when we go 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.780
 to add to the greased mold is now the 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.480
 moment I'm going to put the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.010
 first layer 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.750
 of gelatin 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.610
 I'm going to take him to refrigerate 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.610
 roughly the dimensions of a 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.340
 and I'm going to take it to refrigerate and 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.069
 When he gives it to me I'm going to take it out 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.609
 keep her working 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.730
 On the other hand, I start preparing the 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:17.549
 strawberry flavor gelatin but you can 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.520
 use any flavor gelatin 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.130
 that you want 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.130
 it's not just about being 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.150
 playing with the pastry with the 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.670
 flavors and since I've latina is 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.890
 firmer there do not need it 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.940
 it was semi gelled we are going to use 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.450
 the cutters 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.450
 Y 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.060
 with the figures that we want and 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.209
 we are going to fill in later 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.390
 and also the gelatin has to be 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.959
 Warmer should not be hot for 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.760
 that does not ruin the gelatin that 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.010
 we have from there cut 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.110
 already when we finish putting the 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.939
 gelatin we will take you to refrigerate 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.540
 when the semi-frozen gelatin is 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:10.970
 Well, it's time to put the bread 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.240
 put the filling if they are going to 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.370
 put stuffing 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.610
 also if they do not have the cutters there 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.260
 it is necessary that they do it with design 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.720
 truth, nothing else that I taught them with 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.290
 this technique since I have been asked for more 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.190
 ideas 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.870
 jellies for baby shower when I 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.760
 I was giving the ingredients no longer 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.190
 he was saying they could put him 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.790
 some stuffing but then I looked at my 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:41.810
 refrigerator and I had and this fruit 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.480
 then it is another idea to fill it 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.540
 with fruit is optional I tell you these are 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:51.350
 videos with complete recipes and video 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.750
 tips and since we finished placing the 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.720
 cake or bread inside the jelly 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.820
 then we add a little jelly 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.860
 and we're going to take it to refrigerate the 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.380
 we will be taking care that this semi 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.170
 gelada for 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.380
 later add the other 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.480
 gelatin and we take it to refrigerate 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.490
 let's take care that this one was pulling me 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.790
 so do not forget that 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.920
 small detail and now it's time then 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.500
 good to add the other part of the 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.780
 jello equal if you do not want to make it 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.290
 two colors with a single color that 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.200
 make or with a single flavor is perfect 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.700
 pastel gel or surprise cake like 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:36.210
 you want to call 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.880
 the approximate time between layer and layer 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.650
 that the gelatin is semi gelled and that 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.840
 you have to add gelatin layers 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.910
 are between 10 and 15 minutes if it is 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.250
 they're going to take it to the freezer and they're going to 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.980
 leave in the refrigerator is a little 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.660
 more everything is a matter of which you therefore 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.810
 Now as I say and grab 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.000
 like the morning what are we 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.180
 doing 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.880
 this is not difficult, it's super easy and 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.010
 apart, if we do it in two colors 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.760
 or two flavors can be sweet rather than 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.680
 one color or one flavor and good 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.930
 now is the time we're going to 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.300
 unmold our cake that our 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.520
 jello surprise and well then I would 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.400
 I send a strong greeting to my dear mother 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.969
 that no video is lost from those that 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.849

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:40.470

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.570
 the decoration also the hands and the 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.550
 little feet that we had 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:47.520
 we cut them well so we can use them 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.160
 for decoration and looks prettier 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.920
 our pastel gel and good now is the 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.440
 moment when I give birth to my daughter 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:07:00.020
