00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.110
 very good kids today I bring you a 

00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:04.790
 video tutorial of how we can 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.560
 solve the problem that has 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.410
 currently movistar with user 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.570
 playstation 4 as you can see me 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.670
 it was impossible to connect with me 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.500
 playstation 4 a playstation network 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.480
 this series of errors as you can see in 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.789
 screen and we will solve it now 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.919
 in a good moment the first thing that 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.599
 we have to do is enter our 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.269
 router not from the people portal 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:30.109
 but from our pc for this we have 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:32.689
 to have the key worth password 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.059
 our router for it to access 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.340
 there we have the option of either 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.710
 Alexandria I do not recommend it for me 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.440
 because unlink if we change the number 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.750
 seriously the password or 'bad and link of 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.980
 portal to alexandria then there is another 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.079
 way to try to figure out the key 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.149
 of the router, not for that, what is it 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.949
 we have to do we have to write 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.829
 in for example in your browser this 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.400
 that will be here 192 points 168 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.280
 point 1.1 password 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.810
 hey it I'll put it very big 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.500
 you have to put it in your browser 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.440
 you put it right and you give it to 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.940
 hunter and you will see this that you see here 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.100
 and here right now you do not have to do 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.120
 nothing you have to press here button 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.950
 right see source code of the page 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.140
 it's good to see source code of the page and 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.060
 now we have what 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.400
 see here is where you see pd w admin this 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.350
 that I am here is your key to 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.240
 user is your username 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.729
 on behalf of user 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.860

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.720

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.670

 I have it covered but that is yours 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.770
 key of movistar is worth of your 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.720
 reuters once introduced and good and 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.550
 we are in our router very well 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.560
 fantastic now we have to do the 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.289
 next step we have to go to nat 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.600
 As you can see here, ok, we're going to 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:03.440
 nothing and inside enap as you can see 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.450
 here we are at more than mz host and 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.170
 we have to put here the ip of our 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.200
 console 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.920

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.530
 playstation 4 in settings and look at the 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.900
 network area to know your ip a 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.660
 Once you know it, if you put here, it's worth 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.489

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.340
