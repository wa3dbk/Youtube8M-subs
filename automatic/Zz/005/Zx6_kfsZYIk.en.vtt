as<00:01:20.659> teaching<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.229> what<00:01:21.320> I've<00:01:21.409> ultimately

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
as teaching and what I've ultimately

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.410 
as teaching and what I've ultimately
decided<00:01:22.250> is<00:01:22.369> that<00:01:22.399> chemistry's<00:01:23.149> for

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
decided is that chemistry's for

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.209 
decided is that chemistry's for
crackheads<00:01:23.929> and<00:01:24.140> mathletes<00:01:25.130> and

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
crackheads and mathletes and

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:26.950 
crackheads and mathletes and
multiplication<00:01:25.909> and<00:01:26.060> multiplication<00:01:26.780> with

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
had in high school had that same effect

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.440 
had in high school had that same effect
on<00:01:51.890> me<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.280> changed<00:01:52.490> my<00:01:52.640> life<00:01:52.969> and<00:01:53.210> what<00:01:53.420> I
