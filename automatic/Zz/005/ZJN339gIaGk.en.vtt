their website as you can see this is
basically<00:00:24.750> four<00:00:25.080> different<00:00:25.680> models<00:00:26.189> that

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
basically four different models that

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.599 
basically four different models that
show<00:00:27.210> what's<00:00:27.480> happening<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.349> Gulf<00:00:28.920> up

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
show what's happening in the Gulf up

show what's happening in the Gulf up
through<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.630> forecast<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:32.719> around<00:00:33.719> May<00:00:34.050> twelfth

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
through a forecast of around May twelfth

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.940 
through a forecast of around May twelfth
which<00:00:35.370> obviously<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.000> future<00:00:36.239> from<00:00:36.540> today

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
which obviously is a future from today

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.270 
which obviously is a future from today
you<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.129> see<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:40.250> Mississippi<00:00:41.250> River

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
you can see that the Mississippi River

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.690 
you can see that the Mississippi River
when<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.450> has<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> huge<00:00:43.559> outflow<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:43.980> causing

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
when it has a huge outflow is causing

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.819 
when it has a huge outflow is causing
some<00:00:45.000> unintended<00:00:45.809> consequences<00:00:46.469> over<00:00:46.680> here

push the water be slick further in that
area<00:00:54.110> we<00:00:55.110> still<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.469> our<00:00:55.500> loop<00:00:55.800> current

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
getting called the loop current but also

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.510 
getting called the loop current but also
you<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.350> what's<00:01:07.530> happening<00:01:07.890> here<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.340> have

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
you see what's happening here we have

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.270 
you see what's happening here we have
this<00:01:09.299> area<00:01:09.600> starting<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> move<00:01:10.260> around<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.979> or

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
this area starting to move around and or

this area starting to move around and or
this<00:01:11.460> area<00:01:11.729> moving<00:01:11.939> out<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.390> way<00:01:12.600> which<00:01:12.900> once

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
this area moving out this way which once

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.249 
this area moving out this way which once
again<00:01:13.470> could<00:01:13.950> get<00:01:14.430> over<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.259> Panama

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
again could get over it to the Panama

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.980 
again could get over it to the Panama

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
City Destin Cape San Blas area or even

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.310 
City Destin Cape San Blas area or even
along<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> west<00:01:19.560> coast<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:20.040> Florida<00:01:21.320> let's

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
along the west coast of Florida let's

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.539 
along the west coast of Florida let's
look<00:01:22.439> at<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> couple<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.920> others<00:01:23.130> here's<00:01:23.340> one

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
look at a couple of others here's one

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.280 
look at a couple of others here's one
that<00:01:23.729> shows<00:01:24.439> wind<00:01:26.090> patterns<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.420> how<00:01:28.229> that

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
that shows wind patterns and how that

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.460 
that shows wind patterns and how that
might<00:01:28.680> impact<00:01:28.939> the<00:01:29.939> surface<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.479> well<00:01:30.689> so

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
might impact the surface as well so

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.580 
might impact the surface as well so
let's<00:01:31.710> good<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.070> animation<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:33.090> and

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
let's good with this animation here and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.690 
let's good with this animation here and
what's<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> end<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.860> said<00:01:35.040> Mississippi<00:01:35.490> came

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
what's the end you said Mississippi came

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.850 
what's the end you said Mississippi came
out<00:01:35.900> notice<00:01:36.900> how<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.020> winds<00:01:37.409> are<00:01:37.470> starting<00:01:37.680> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
out notice how the winds are starting to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.310 
out notice how the winds are starting to
company<00:01:38.250> east

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
company east

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.730 
company east
and<00:01:41.070> then<00:01:41.760> the<00:01:41.940> southeast<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.200> they're<00:01:43.650> going

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
and then the southeast and they're going

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.760 
and then the southeast and they're going
to<00:01:43.830> tend<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> want<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.340> push<00:01:44.960> this<00:01:45.960> mass<00:01:46.320> up<00:01:46.650> in

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
to tend to want to push this mass up in

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.650 
to tend to want to push this mass up in
this<00:01:46.890> direction<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:48.120> outflow<00:01:48.420> from<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
this direction the outflow from the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.750 
this direction the outflow from the
Mississippi<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.290> also<00:01:49.590> working<00:01:49.830> with<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.580> as

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
Mississippi is also working with that as

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.250 
Mississippi is also working with that as
well<00:01:50.790> helping<00:01:51.270> kind<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.540> push<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.870> towards

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
well helping kind of push it towards

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.240 
well helping kind of push it towards
Alabama<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.160> Florida<00:01:53.190> coast<00:01:54.000> lines<00:01:55.250> dolphin

island<00:01:56.369> which<00:01:56.910> is<00:01:56.940> right<00:01:57.240> here<00:01:57.270> has<00:01:57.900> seen<00:01:58.170> some

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
island which is right here has seen some

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.190 
island which is right here has seen some
tar<00:01:58.590> balls<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.970> we're<00:02:00.180> obviously<00:02:00.869> concerned

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
tar balls so we're obviously concerned

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.560 
tar balls so we're obviously concerned
about<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.300> patterns<00:02:06.300> as<00:02:06.450> we

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
about that and with the patterns as we

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.300 
about that and with the patterns as we
move<00:02:06.810> towards<00:02:07.110> summer<00:02:07.350> tending<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.950> be<00:02:08.039> more

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
move towards summer tending to be more

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.999 
move towards summer tending to be more
from<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.209> south<00:02:09.450> that's<00:02:09.810> certainly<00:02:10.709> not<00:02:10.860> to

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
from the south that's certainly not to

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.550 
from the south that's certainly not to
be<00:02:11.130> very<00:02:11.340> good<00:02:11.580> for<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:13.020> whole<00:02:13.170> coastline

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
be very good for the whole coastline

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.680 
be very good for the whole coastline
there<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.220> as<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.910> continues<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.390> spread

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
there and as this continues to spread

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.670 
there and as this continues to spread
outward<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.830> east<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.020> west<00:02:19.140> it's

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
outward to the east and to the west it's

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.580 
outward to the east and to the west it's
just<00:02:19.860> kind<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.100> make<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:21.290> flattened<00:02:22.290> out<00:02:22.380> we

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
just kind of make it flattened out we

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.390 
just kind of make it flattened out we
believe<00:02:22.890> as<00:02:23.040> well<00:02:24.080> okay<00:02:25.080> next<00:02:25.830> one<00:02:26.010> here<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.370> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
believe as well okay next one here is a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.810 
believe as well okay next one here is a
similar<00:02:26.880> one<00:02:27.290> from<00:02:28.290> one<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> four<00:02:29.520> panes

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
similar one from one of the four panes

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.080 
similar one from one of the four panes
we<00:02:30.000> saw<00:02:30.209> earlier<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.470> just<00:02:31.680> shows<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.250> the

balls<00:02:41.040> on<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.459> island<00:02:41.850> here<00:02:42.150> we<00:02:42.540> can<00:02:42.690> expect

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
balls on the island here we can expect

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.660 
balls on the island here we can expect
that<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.290> hit<00:02:43.560> off<00:02:43.769> shore<00:02:44.010> as<00:02:44.220> orange<00:02:44.430> beach

that to hit off shore as orange beach

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.750 
that to hit off shore as orange beach
soon<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:46.010> looking<00:02:47.010> at<00:02:47.130> this<00:02:47.220> distance<00:02:47.459> we're

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
soon and looking at this distance we're

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.120 
soon and looking at this distance we're
dealing<00:02:48.000> with<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.810> same<00:02:49.019> thing<00:02:49.320> with<00:02:50.100> the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
dealing with and the same thing with the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.970 
dealing with and the same thing with the
currents<00:02:51.000> as<00:02:51.930> they<00:02:52.200> come<00:02:52.350> into<00:02:52.470> play<00:02:52.709> we'll

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
currents as they come into play we'll

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.830 
currents as they come into play we'll
start<00:02:53.670> working<00:02:53.790> their<00:02:54.030> way<00:02:54.060> all<00:02:54.330> along<00:02:54.510> this

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
start working their way all along this

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.370 
start working their way all along this
area<00:02:55.170> here<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:56.610> believe<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.630> as<00:02:57.930> time<00:02:58.140> goes

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
area here and I believe it as time goes

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.490 
area here and I believe it as time goes
on<00:02:59.090> it's<00:03:00.090> going<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.329> obviously<00:03:00.450> work<00:03:01.200> its<00:03:01.380> way

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
on it's going to obviously work its way

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.590 
on it's going to obviously work its way
this<00:03:01.709> way<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.340> get<00:03:03.090> caught<00:03:03.239> up<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.480> loop

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
this way and get caught up in the loop

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.380 
this way and get caught up in the loop
current<00:03:03.959> also<00:03:04.110> i'm<00:03:05.070> not<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.340> scientist<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:05.970> this

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
current also i'm not a scientist so this

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.449 
current also i'm not a scientist so this
is<00:03:06.540> all<00:03:06.660> just<00:03:06.930> empirical<00:03:07.860> knowledge<00:03:07.890> about

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
is all just empirical knowledge about

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.300 
is all just empirical knowledge about
what<00:03:08.700> i<00:03:08.910> do<00:03:09.060> know<00:03:09.269> about<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.600> gulf<00:03:10.070> as<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.250> can

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
what i do know about the gulf as you can

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.400 
what i do know about the gulf as you can
see<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:11.549> is<00:03:11.700> starting<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.030> move<00:03:12.180> much<00:03:13.140> more

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
see this is starting to move much more

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.050 
see this is starting to move much more
dramatically<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.220> area<00:03:14.519> last<00:03:14.670> time<00:03:14.880> we<00:03:14.940> did

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
dramatically this area last time we did

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.910 
dramatically this area last time we did
an<00:03:15.120> update<00:03:15.269> it<00:03:15.510> was<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.660> Miss<00:03:15.959> about<00:03:16.380> here<00:03:16.590> now

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
an update it was a Miss about here now

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.550 
an update it was a Miss about here now
it's<00:03:17.100> way<00:03:17.370> over<00:03:17.670> here<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.750> we<00:03:18.959> can<00:03:19.049> expect<00:03:19.380> this

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
it's way over here so we can expect this

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.340 
it's way over here so we can expect this
to<00:03:19.829> impact<00:03:20.730> all<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:20.910> Louisiana<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.840> probably

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
to impact all of Louisiana and probably

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.990 
to impact all of Louisiana and probably
get<00:03:22.470> into<00:03:22.590> Florida<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.220> some<00:03:23.549> point<00:03:23.790> become

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
get into Florida and some point become

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.520 
get into Florida and some point become
an<00:03:24.090> international<00:03:24.630> event<00:03:24.720> by<00:03:25.079> getting<00:03:25.410> into

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
an international event by getting into

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.039 
an international event by getting into
Mexico<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.790> we're<00:03:27.570> getting<00:03:27.780> into<00:03:27.900> loop

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
Mexico and we're getting into loop

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:28.630 
Mexico and we're getting into loop
current

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
current

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.190 
current
getting<00:03:28.970> into<00:03:29.120> Gulf<00:03:29.300> Stream<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.750> moving<00:03:30.050> up

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
getting into Gulf Stream and moving up

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.699 
getting into Gulf Stream and moving up
hitting<00:03:30.890> even<00:03:31.250> Canada<00:03:32.060> or<00:03:32.120> even<00:03:32.390> Europe<00:03:33.170> so

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
hitting even Canada or even Europe so

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.130 
hitting even Canada or even Europe so
this<00:03:34.370> thing<00:03:35.180> just<00:03:35.330> really<00:03:35.540> have<00:03:35.750> any<00:03:35.900> end<00:03:36.050> in

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
this thing just really have any end in

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.449 
this thing just really have any end in
sight<00:03:38.200> another<00:03:39.200> variation<00:03:39.770> showing<00:03:40.370> the

sight another variation showing the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
currents and just a different

forecasting computer model that shows

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.210 
forecasting computer model that shows

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
what may or may not happen but they all

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.400 
what may or may not happen but they all
pretty<00:03:49.700> much<00:03:49.850> agreeing<00:03:50.480> that<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:50.750> continues

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
pretty much agreeing that it continues

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.160 
pretty much agreeing that it continues
to<00:03:51.500> move<00:03:51.620> out<00:03:51.830> this<00:03:52.040> way<00:03:52.250> is<00:03:52.900> drifting<00:03:53.900> in<00:03:54.020> this

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
to move out this way is drifting in this

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.470 
to move out this way is drifting in this
direction<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:54.800> off<00:03:55.340> to<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:55.640> west<00:03:55.940> also<00:03:58.480> so

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
direction and off to the west also so

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:07.060 
direction and off to the west also so
let's<00:04:00.170> see<00:04:00.500> one<00:04:00.950> more<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:02.230> this<00:04:03.230> one<00:04:06.070> was

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
let's see one more and this one was

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.040 
let's see one more and this one was
again<00:04:07.310> showing<00:04:07.550> you<00:04:07.760> all<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.000> currents<00:04:08.480> that

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
again showing you all the currents that

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.340 
again showing you all the currents that
are<00:04:09.110> out<00:04:09.290> in<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.650> sea<00:04:09.860> and<00:04:11.200> see<00:04:12.200> what's

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
are out in the sea and see what's

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.660 
are out in the sea and see what's
happening<00:04:12.680> here<00:04:12.739> you<00:04:12.980> get<00:04:13.070> this<00:04:13.160> current<00:04:13.519> here

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
happening here you get this current here

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.780 
happening here you get this current here
just<00:04:13.850> kind<00:04:14.000> of<00:04:14.030> voting<00:04:14.540> back<00:04:14.810> on<00:04:15.050> itself<00:04:15.790> but

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
just kind of voting back on itself but

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.250 
just kind of voting back on itself but
potentially<00:04:16.940> if<00:04:17.359> it<00:04:17.480> follows<00:04:17.810> it<00:04:17.900> back<00:04:18.049> enough

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
potentially if it follows it back enough

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.810 
potentially if it follows it back enough
over<00:04:18.410> here<00:04:18.680> who<00:04:19.070> knows<00:04:19.250> it<00:04:19.400> could<00:04:19.430> get<00:04:19.640> caught

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
over here who knows it could get caught

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.670 
over here who knows it could get caught
up<00:04:19.970> in<00:04:20.090> this<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.480> move<00:04:20.600> right<00:04:20.660> over<00:04:20.900> here<00:04:21.410> and

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
up in this and move right over here and
