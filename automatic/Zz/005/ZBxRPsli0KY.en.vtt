00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:15.210
 hello in this video I will explain 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:19.290
 how to get a chestnut hair 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.950
 dark half light I'll summarize it to 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:27.530
 all three in the same video because it's 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:30.210
 easy enough to associate 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.210
 if we are going to apply it on a hair 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.130
 natural and in a hair that is never 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.610
 has applied a dye with water of 20 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.200
 volumes before 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.020
 that does not have any chemical change in the 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.900
 structure of hair color 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:52.340
 the dye can be applied perfectly 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.140
 with oxidant of 10 volumes is worth as 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.290
 if it was a bath of color that is going 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.230
 with the washings then we would apply if 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:05.720
 the dye are 60 grams for example then 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:08.090
 120 oxidizer 10 volumes 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.310
 if you have doubts about oxidants 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.020
 discoloration the scale of tones and others 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.990
 notice that there are more videos where I go to 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.090
 explaining everything well in case they are left 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.000
 some question is how to manufacture the oxidant 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.550
 or when I talk about coloring or power 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.370
 or the tone scale 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.470
 with chestnuts in principle does not have 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.680
 that there should be no problem 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.800
 if we apply it on natural hair if 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.330
 are hairs that even before it has been made 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.330
 some chemical reaction work 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.740
 I repeat again watch videos where 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.380
 explained what the chemical reaction the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.140
 chemical reaction for example when it 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.369
 mix the dye with water of 20 volumes 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:56.000
 and change the stem structure of 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.590
 color of the hair shaft is worth and for 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.679
 example the color bath is a change 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.240
 physical does not change the structure within 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:07.549
 of the stem as such but rather because 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.340
 it goes with the washings then you go back to 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.940
 have the previous tones 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.280
 not exactly the same but very similar 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.170
 for example if you have a chestnut 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.099
 clear and you put a bath of color 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.410
 dark brown with the washes or is it 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.420
 question of a month and a half or two months 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.730
 how much more or less will you have 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.190
 a light chestnut is worth it because it has not 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.220
 produced a chemical change within the 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.290
 capillary stem 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.790
 It's worth the dark chestnut in hair 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.790
 natural in principle there is no 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.250
 problem I advise always apply your 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.550
 hands of color so is punished less the 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.530
 Hair is worth as long as it is 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.010
 can to get the color that one 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.770
 wants the eyes if for example you have a 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.400
 black color because of the hair has 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.830
 been dyed before, because already and if 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.950
 you're going to have to apply it oxidant 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:09.320
 of 20 volumes perhaps in the first 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:13.300
 change is not a dark brown for 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:16.370
 example or medium will throw you more to morello 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.380
 but already in the second third application 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.830
 and you will get a dark brown chestnut 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.290
 medium and so you want a light brown and 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.890
 you would have it to color- dyed hair 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.880
 black will be a little more difficult and 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.580
 I do not advise discoloration because if 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.590
 You see the video in which I speak and 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.680
 explained how is the discoloration you will see 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.730
 The whole process can give you reflections 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.830
 reds not very wanted and for me I 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.250
 it seems silly to discolor a hair 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.980
 black to apply a light brown is 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.800
 preferable to apply a dark brown 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.870
 first the next month apply a 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.700
 medium brown and the other half apply 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.240
 a light chestnut and you have the hair 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.800
 perfect 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.200
 It is valid if you are going to apply or top of a 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.360
 dark ruby ​​of a light blonde without 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.340
 problems until you can apply it equally 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.860
 that if it was a bathroom of color 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.750
 you need to put the oxidant 20 volumes 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.900
 known before 10 volumes has to 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.940
 perfectly cover and risk with the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.390
 what you can find is if you go to 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.850
 apply it on top of a red if before you 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.510
 you have applied some red tint and you have 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:33.990
 red mahogany deep reds very 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.530
 very vibrant garish be careful 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.870
 because you can get reddish highlights 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.230
 ok then you would have to first make a 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.980
 soft discoloration remove is to blur 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.720
 sorry until those traces of red and then 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.810
 apply the chestnut so that it is 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.540
 perfect otherwise this tone is a 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.330
 natural tone and there is no more problem and in 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.370
 principle would not have to have problems 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.720
 and if you have gray hair 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.080
 remember that there is a video with some 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.759
 tricks where cover the faces well by 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.160
 if you have these hard gray hairs 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:12.660
 rebels it costs to cover 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.730
 I hope but the explained well and everything and 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.410
 if it was easy to understand 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.410
 and until another video
