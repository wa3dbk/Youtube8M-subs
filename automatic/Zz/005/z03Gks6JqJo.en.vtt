00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.650
 a moment of asking for time to stop the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.500
 ball and look to the future 19 years 1 meter 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.279
 88 and base of sea quilmes del plata 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.950
 with a huge future today we talk with 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.670
 lou cabildos to elvas that basically 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.760
 started on my dad's part that was the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.539
 that in a way inspired me so that 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:33.539
 I started at 4 years old, I started playing 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.829
 in sea of ​​silver I liked it a lot 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.399
 be with the ball was all the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.550
 time until one day my grandmother who is 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.519
 very from quilmes sent me told me 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.940
 so that he would bring me well so I 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.890
 I went to and started my whole career in that 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.590
 club 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.510
 already kid looks more good but contame 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.980
 what aspects of your game are you 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.040
 trying to improve 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.510
 and now I would be trying to have 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.850
 a little more responsibility than 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.860
 I had before then I'm thinking about 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.320
 be a holder 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.070
 have a regularity because now I have 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.400
 many ups and downs and then if it occurs in 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.910
 in a few years I'll be able to go to europe which is 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.180
 my goal was always power in europe 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.200
 in a good club and then if the dream comes true 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.280
 to get to the nba of 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 it would be a pride and when the film 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.200
 combined is in weak motion 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:46.080
 and tell me what is your first memory with 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:48.330
 the nba and today it reminds me of some party 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.220
 of new choir of manu ginóbili the debut 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.180
 of manu ginóbili against the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.810
 lakers what goes in is a pair of double and 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.590
 he likes us we are more than happy ok 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.930
 ok now let's go with the players 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.390
 what are your favorites before I had 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.670
 as an idol to derrick rose I do not say that 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.730
 now it is not, but they appeared 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.800
 many bases that made me doubt 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.220
 I identify a lot with your 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.760
 I really like the hoop 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.790
 and that physically is tremendous 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.010
 irving and russell wesbrook that are the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.370
 what else do I identify myself in the position of 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.000
 Based'm not I'm terrible but took 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.980
 pretty advantage with him with the physicists 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.060
 some say you have little things 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.060
 ezker and on the court 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:44.090
 Now that is tremendous but I do not 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.010
 I identify a lot with the wigs all 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.460
 ok with the bulls but I'm also 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:54.640
 fan of san antonio san antonio 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:57.790
 a tremendous team the part we have 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.950
 by hand there is the time for all 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.400
 argentina is proud of everything he did 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.590
 I'm not going to remember, but if 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.020
 after chicago bulls 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.730
 I think the San Antonio Spurs are in 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.730
 my second option
