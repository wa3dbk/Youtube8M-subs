teen<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:12.870> today's<00:00:13.110> video<00:00:13.290> we're<00:00:13.469> working<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.799> a

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
teen in today's video we're working on a

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.760 
teen in today's video we're working on a
redstone<00:00:14.219> block<00:00:14.610> based<00:00:14.820> but<00:00:15.360> switch<00:00:15.660> BAM<00:00:16.080> I'm

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
redstone block based but switch BAM I'm

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.500 
redstone block based but switch BAM I'm
servicing<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.250> fairly<00:00:17.520> small<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.300> not<00:00:18.449> very

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
servicing is fairly small and not very

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.510 
servicing is fairly small and not very
complicated<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.410> make<00:00:19.529> now<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.160> we<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
complicated to make now that we have the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.029 
complicated to make now that we have the
glorious<00:00:20.730> redstone<00:00:21.600> block<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.740> actually

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
glorious redstone block this is actually

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.830 
glorious redstone block this is actually
a<00:00:23.100> bud<00:00:23.640> switch<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.060> I've<00:00:24.180> known<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.420> quite<00:00:24.660> a

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
a bud switch that I've known for quite a

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.269 
a bud switch that I've known for quite a
while<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.109> don't<00:00:25.529> know<00:00:25.619> exactly<00:00:25.980> where<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.250> came

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
while I don't know exactly where it came

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.509 
while I don't know exactly where it came
from<00:00:26.490> definitely<00:00:27.480> was<00:00:27.599> not<00:00:27.630> for<00:00:28.050> me<00:00:28.199> though

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
from definitely was not for me though

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.589 
from definitely was not for me though
but<00:00:29.519> i'm<00:00:29.640> here<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.849> show<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.330> guys<00:00:30.449> so

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
but i'm here to show it to you guys so

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.400 
but i'm here to show it to you guys so
this<00:00:30.750> thing<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.900> pretty<00:00:31.439> tiny<00:00:31.859> ah<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
this thing is pretty tiny ah the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.690 
this thing is pretty tiny ah the
basically<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.590> piston<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> text<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
basically the piston of the text the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.459 
basically the piston of the text the
block<00:00:35.940> update<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.510> sticky<00:00:36.960> piston<00:00:37.290> here

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
block update is the sticky piston here

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.740 
block update is the sticky piston here
from<00:00:38.280> any<00:00:38.430> side<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:39.000> here<00:00:39.450> down<00:00:40.050> here<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:42.660> i'm

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
from any side up here down here and i'm

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.220 
from any side up here down here and i'm
here<00:00:44.120> over<00:00:45.120> here<00:00:45.239> I'll<00:00:45.510> face<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.719> other<00:00:45.870> side

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
here over here I'll face the other side

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.319 
here over here I'll face the other side
are<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.070> other<00:00:47.190> piston<00:00:47.579> not<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:47.879> much<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.270> you

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
are the other piston not so much so you

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.240 
are the other piston not so much so you
know<00:00:48.510> keep<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.110> mind<00:00:49.260> ah<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.100> is

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
know keep that in mind ah so this is

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.770 
know keep that in mind ah so this is
kind<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.579> flush<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.120> wall<00:00:51.210> or<00:00:51.420> some

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
kind of like flush with the wall or some

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.900 
kind of like flush with the wall or some
stuff<00:00:52.489> wow<00:00:53.489> that's<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:53.940> use<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:55.910> there

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
stuff wow that's we use it for it there

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.229 
stuff wow that's we use it for it there
we<00:00:57.000> go<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.960> output<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.500> outputs<00:00:58.920> work

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
we go so the output of the outputs work

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.340 
we go so the output of the outputs work
basically<00:01:00.239> if<00:01:00.359> you're<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.570> going<00:01:01.140> straight

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
basically if you're you going straight

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.380 
basically if you're you going straight
off<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.649> redsnow<00:01:02.160> block<00:01:02.489> here<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.969> does<00:01:03.149> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
off the redsnow block here it does a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.359 
off the redsnow block here it does a
haptic<00:01:04.019> pulse<00:01:05.210> like<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.470> actually<00:01:08.189> no

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
haptic pulse like this so actually no

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.399 
haptic pulse like this so actually no
not<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.270> repeater<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.140> repeater

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
not with the repeater the repeater

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.140 
not with the repeater the repeater
actually<00:01:10.710> limits<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.220> unless<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.030> on

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
actually limits it unless you have it on

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.050 
actually limits it unless you have it on
no<00:01:12.600> additional<00:01:12.869> tix<00:01:13.460> if<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.790> one

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
no additional tix if it's on the one

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.380 
no additional tix if it's on the one
tick<00:01:15.590> then<00:01:16.590> yep<00:01:16.880> right<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.270> example

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
tick then yep right here for example

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.300 
tick then yep right here for example
let's<00:01:18.689> say<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.229> your<00:01:19.439> block<00:01:19.650> as<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.189> can

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
let's say this is your block as you can

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.649 
let's say this is your block as you can
tell<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.850> have<00:01:21.479> tick<00:01:21.689> drops<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.369> there<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:23.460> go

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
tell have have tick drops in there we go

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.789 
tell have have tick drops in there we go
if<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.750> want<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.990> regulate<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.470> output<00:01:25.500> from

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
if you want to regulate the output from

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.310 
if you want to regulate the output from
here<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:26.310> put<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> repeater<00:01:26.759> two<00:01:27.659> ticks<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
here just put a repeater two ticks and

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.469 
here just put a repeater two ticks and
for<00:01:29.130> example<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.060> know<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.329> would

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
for example this is you know you would

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.649 
for example this is you know you would
use<00:01:31.610> their<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.790> show<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.240> doesn't<00:01:33.360> drop

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
use their to show you it doesn't drop

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.440 
use their to show you it doesn't drop
the<00:01:33.810> block<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.070> actually<00:01:35.250> also<00:01:35.610> take<00:01:36.210> and

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the block you can actually also take and

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.090 
the block you can actually also take and
see<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.869> not<00:01:36.990> tiny<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.590> there<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:37.920> go

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
see this is not tiny it is there you go

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.929 
see this is not tiny it is there you go
tutorial<00:01:38.369> over<00:01:38.820> um<00:01:40.369> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.520> take<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> output

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
tutorial over um you can take the output

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.060 
tutorial over um you can take the output
from<00:01:42.619> here<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.759> tell

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
from here as you can tell

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.130 
from here as you can tell
at<00:01:46.340> this<00:01:46.580> point<00:01:46.790> I<00:01:47.060> it's<00:01:47.330> not<00:01:47.480> a<00:01:47.510> haptic<00:01:47.930> pulse

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
at this point I it's not a haptic pulse

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.990 
at this point I it's not a haptic pulse
it<00:01:48.320> just<00:01:48.530> does<00:01:48.920> regular<00:01:49.280> polls<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:49.640> can<00:01:49.820> take

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
it just does regular polls you can take

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.350 
it just does regular polls you can take
it<00:01:50.150> from<00:01:50.180> here<00:01:51.610> like<00:01:52.610> that<00:01:53.350> okay<00:01:54.400> and<00:01:55.400> I<00:01:56.090> mean

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
it from here like that okay and I mean

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.790 
it from here like that okay and I mean
that<00:01:56.420> you<00:01:56.540> know<00:01:56.720> several<00:01:57.020> other<00:01:57.290> places<00:01:57.440> guys

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
that you know several other places guys

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.880 
that you know several other places guys
I<00:01:57.830> guess<00:01:58.340> in<00:01:58.580> theory<00:01:59.000> over<00:01:59.390> here<00:02:02.830> on<00:02:03.830> a

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
I guess in theory over here on a

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.230 
I guess in theory over here on a
transparent<00:02:04.640> block<00:02:04.729> you<00:02:04.880> wouldn't<00:02:05.119> do<00:02:05.210> that

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
transparent block you wouldn't do that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.590 
transparent block you wouldn't do that
oh<00:02:05.570> and<00:02:05.840> do<00:02:05.900> that<00:02:06.050> but<00:02:06.229> I<00:02:06.259> guess<00:02:06.470> over<00:02:07.100> here

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
oh and do that but I guess over here

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.699 
oh and do that but I guess over here
actually<00:02:08.600> at<00:02:08.690> all<00:02:08.810> times<00:02:09.080> except<00:02:09.500> for<00:02:09.649> the

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
actually at all times except for the

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.590 
actually at all times except for the
fact<00:02:09.860> that<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.220> ruts<00:02:10.399> an<00:02:10.550> area<00:02:10.910> for<00:02:11.209> example

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
fact that the ruts an area for example

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.360 
fact that the ruts an area for example
here<00:02:11.630> would<00:02:11.870> also<00:02:12.020> be<00:02:12.260> good<00:02:14.650> yeah<00:02:15.650> i<00:02:15.920> think

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
here would also be good yeah i think

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.010 
here would also be good yeah i think
there's<00:02:16.610> various<00:02:17.030> places<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.690> can<00:02:17.810> cover

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
there's various places and you can cover

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.300 
there's various places and you can cover
around<00:02:18.260> or<00:02:18.650> whatever<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.070> know<00:02:19.100> I'm

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
around or whatever you know I'm

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.740 
around or whatever you know I'm
complicating<00:02:19.910> this<00:02:20.000> just<00:02:20.239> for<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.450> sake<00:02:20.630> of

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
complicating this just for the sake of

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.090 
complicating this just for the sake of
complicating<00:02:21.500> how<00:02:21.620> do<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:21.800> build<00:02:21.920> it

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
complicating how do you build it

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.460 
complicating how do you build it
basically<00:02:22.910> a<00:02:23.030> redstone<00:02:23.600> actually<00:02:24.200> know<00:02:24.320> a

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
basically a redstone actually know a

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.380 
basically a redstone actually know a
normal<00:02:24.739> block<00:02:25.100> there<00:02:25.370> as<00:02:25.820> long<00:02:25.910> as<00:02:26.150> it's<00:02:26.300> a

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
normal block there as long as it's a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.210 
normal block there as long as it's a
solid<00:02:26.570> block<00:02:26.840> not<00:02:27.110> transparent<00:02:27.530> red<00:02:27.950> stone

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
solid block not transparent red stone

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.610 
solid block not transparent red stone
does<00:02:28.400> here<00:02:28.610> redstone<00:02:29.120> torch<00:02:29.390> here<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:30.260> need<00:02:30.470> a

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
does here redstone torch here you need a

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.940 
does here redstone torch here you need a
normal<00:02:31.220> PS<00:02:31.550> thin<00:02:32.770> right<00:02:33.770> over<00:02:33.950> here<00:02:34.390> this<00:02:35.390> one

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
normal PS thin right over here this one

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.290 
normal PS thin right over here this one
you<00:02:36.950> need<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.190> have<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:37.400> first<00:02:37.970> okay

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
you need to have that first okay

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.560 
you need to have that first okay
basically<00:02:39.230> first<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.830> then<00:02:40.430> we<00:02:41.390> need<00:02:41.510> to

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
basically first and then we need to

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.680 
basically first and then we need to
stick<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.840> pissed<00:02:42.080> in<00:02:42.200> there<00:02:43.420> let's<00:02:44.420> put<00:02:44.660> a

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
stick you pissed in there let's put a

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.500 
stick you pissed in there let's put a
solid<00:02:45.019> block<00:02:45.140> there<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.880> then<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.209> rest<00:02:47.330> on

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
solid block there and then the rest on

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.110 
solid block there and then the rest on
block<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.920> that's<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:51.549> so<00:02:52.549> mean<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:52.970> could

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
block and that's it so mean this could

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.960 
block and that's it so mean this could
be<00:02:53.239> a<00:02:53.269> used<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:54.110> know<00:02:54.200> four<00:02:54.380> doors<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.980> whole

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
be a used to you know four doors a whole

be a used to you know four doors a whole
bunch<00:02:56.150> of<00:02:56.299> stuff<00:02:56.360> I<00:02:57.190> mean<00:02:58.190> clearly<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.670> know

bunch of stuff I mean clearly you know
how<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.090> use<00:02:59.120> but<00:02:59.360> switches<00:02:59.750> by<00:02:59.870> now<00:03:00.049> I'm<00:03:00.200> sure
