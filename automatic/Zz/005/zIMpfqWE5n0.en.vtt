00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.789
 on 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.610
 hallelujah guys cuckoo certain 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.760
 western hacker enthusiast delving into 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.730
 The game files found information and traces from 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.699
 the next addition to the bill is 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.749
 Supplement has files code name 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.030
 low 

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:38.309
 and also keeps yourself to write off new ones 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.789
 cars that are not yet in the game but 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.949
 they are in the gta series 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:46.949
 noteworthy is also the fact that past affairs 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.589
 son who recently released files 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.640
 also has its code name a 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.999
 exactly 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.729
 lax is short for laksheri 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:59.339
 and I think it makes some sense because 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:02.039
 that all these planes are expensive helicopters 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.500
 cars are so expensive 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.229
 that quietly fit into the concept 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.259
 luxury and so you can hold such 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.560
 same analogy with the code name low 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.500
 well it is easy to guess it is lowrider 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.680
 why did I decide so together with you 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.070
 take a look at the list of new cars and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.670
 Immediately we notice that they are all from the class. 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.090
 budget classic cars of the 80s 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.090
 years 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.670
 which were actually used for 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.820
 laurel money as for 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.490
 directly to the cars themselves 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.240
 have already visited a series of gta in its different 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.840
 parts 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.590
 for example , the faction 2 machine was already in gta 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.380
 four 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.630
 also she was in gta san andreas in 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.829
 as a wheelbarrow gang ballas 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:57.030
 minivan called moonbeam too us 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.609
 well known izgotov 4 and san andreas here you 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.340
 interesting fact about this car in 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:05.490
 San Andreas was associated with her mission in 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.979
 which group of fishing riders rested on 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.789
 the beach and this car represented 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.090
 such a mobile audio system 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.849
 a coincidence I donâ€™t think 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.980
 list, we find a clean version 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.959
 water detect slim in the third series and 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.810
 other old cars that are very 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.269
 quoted in the theme of lowriders quite 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.879
 it is likely that new cars will be 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.819
 to be a normal restyling 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:38.239
 Here's an example for you with the jester machine 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.230
 there is a regular jester machine and there is a jester 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.019
 with stickers 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.420
 that's the whole difference and generally similar 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:48.620
 freebie we can watch pretty often 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.959
 in gta 5 well, for example, when different machines 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.060
 the class have exactly the same 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.639
 engine sound that basically for 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.340
 me personally is just not letting go 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:00.230
 oh freebie what i want to say i want 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.959
 say what we can expect 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.840
 completely different from what will be 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.090
 just new cars with stickers to 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.450
 the fact that the game will add a full 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.439
 new gameplay element for example 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.629
 hydraulics 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:17.479
 well and subsequent competitions in 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.879
 multiplayer so let's say sports 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:22.669
 I do not know how to say the pump 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.459
 your life in the best group in recent 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:28.430
 two thousand years of character pumping in 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.359
 gta online is my personal group in which 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.389
 I do pumping for all consoles 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:38.079
 the link will be in the description under this video 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.079
 I love everybody for now
