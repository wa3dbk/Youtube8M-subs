00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 from the moment the steering wheel is 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.309
 displayed on the screen is that the system 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.519
 is able to drive then how he 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.110
 leads on another campaign 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.350
 simply because he knew how to measure the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.480
 road and those to follow 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.270
 the hd webcam spots the white lines 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.890
 the signposting and the signs 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.230
 speed to allow drivers 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.150
 not to touch the olive wheel 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.650
 picard work for five years on the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.480
 advice we take a picture with the help of 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.969
 the camera that is attached to this windshield 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.370
 the photo is immediately analyzed by 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.800
 the pc that makes a lot of 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.079
 calculations to be able to transmit then 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.540
 to the device that is under the steering wheel a 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.579
 steering wheel movement that will match 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.820
 the rectification necessary for 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.820
 drive 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.600
 when frames per second are analyzed 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.880
 by the software his glasses announces the 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.530
 calculation it will have taken many 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.540
 studies on the behavior of 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.970
 motorists to translate the 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.470
 information in algorithms resulted 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.250
 Olivier is less stressed today 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.250
 when it is convenient 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.350
 there is not this this anguish of evil 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.750
 drive to make a mistake and he 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.280
 there is a lot less fatigue especially the 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.050
 driver still has to stay 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.490
 vigilant 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.670
 I do not think a car can 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:26.370
 to lead without human supervision 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.370
 without them without the slightest danger 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.350
 because we're not there yet 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.890
 there is still a long way to go 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.840
 go before road safety 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.350
 closely follows this new system of 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.630
 conduct 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.540
 joseph of the father we even tried this 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.520
 prototype it is preventive and at the same 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.600
 time they and curative especially because 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.039
 that this is the only system that you 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.840
 bring back in your voice and that avoids you 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.880
 to get out of the way and eventually 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.530
 a case of falling asleep for others 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.850
 reasons for losing control of going 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.340
 hit vehicles that are in front 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.360
 and make deaths this prototype starts 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.909
 to talk about him 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.920
 several industrialists and engineers are 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.810
 interested because the automatic driving 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.810
 it may be the car of tomorrow
