00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:14.370
 so today we are on the sorting 4.25 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.279
 evolution so and the flagship of the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.420
 sorting site picks up and so that is a 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.640
 novelty 2014 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.500
 it's a model that has existed since 2006 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.109
 with us which is a trimaran of 7 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.510
 70 meters folding and very powerful 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.550
 and so this year we have it fully 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.500
 restyled so with new floats 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.239
 and new fires are since 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.090
 For a long time we have already used 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.829
 carbon in the appendices ie 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.040
 in the rudders in the drifts and 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.530
 so here we have a putra cross design 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.610
 very modern and so they sink 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.770
 connecting arms are constructed 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.730
 fully vacuum epoxy carbon 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.730
 in infusion 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.160
 we have a boat that goes up to 15 9 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:09.270
 years at the speed alive even a small 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.470
 little more so we can easily we are 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.900
 almost always above 10 knots 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.880
 between 10 and 15 knots therefore that a 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.860
 little wind and of course you can 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.630
 hope for top speeds a little 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.910
 little beyond 20 hours so sorting 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.190
 4.25 evolution so at a very large 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.950
 that had double in the front not a very 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.390
 large double berth at the front and 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.910
 two single berths that make 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.160
 also office of square we have a 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.840
 clever little swivel table that 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.910
 allows to eat but also serves as 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.280
 chart table and which settles in the 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.750
 cockpit a small removable kitchen area 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.500
 to leave all the space when we have 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.060
 no need 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.830
 we are equipped as standard so in 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.250
 electricity with led lights 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.840
 in short a standard equipment quite 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.880
 interesting for the small cruise 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.170
 coastal so it's a boat that 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.700
 is for everyone this is what 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.229
 is interesting it's a boat that is 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.050
 very easy to use although they 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.479
 perform well so it's for 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.840
 a small family it's for 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.160
 young people who want to have fun 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.160
 here we do not have a typical profile in 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.330
 our clientele we have just if I think 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.560
 that we have a common point that promises a 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.709
 customer of people who are all very 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.709
 friendly
