another 50 years from now there'll be

another 50 years from now there'll be
another<00:01:03.219> 3<00:01:03.519> billion<00:01:03.730> mouths<00:01:04.150> to<00:01:04.629> feed

another 3 billion mouths to feed

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.620 
another 3 billion mouths to feed
and<00:01:05.340> if<00:01:06.340> farming<00:01:06.700> isn't<00:01:06.790> working<00:01:07.180> now<00:01:07.210> you<00:01:07.390> can

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
and if farming isn't working now you can

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.970 
and if farming isn't working now you can
imagine<00:01:07.810> what<00:01:08.170> it's<00:01:08.290> not<00:01:08.440> going<00:01:08.620> to<00:01:08.710> be<00:01:08.830> like

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
imagine what it's not going to be like

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.110 
imagine what it's not going to be like
in<00:01:09.190> 50<00:01:09.520> years<00:01:09.640> from<00:01:09.880> now

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
in 50 years from now

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.860 
in 50 years from now
so<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.740> problem<00:01:12.070> in<00:01:12.159> my<00:01:12.310> view<00:01:12.340> would<00:01:13.030> be<00:01:13.090> maybe

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
so the problem in my view would be maybe

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:14.910 
so the problem in my view would be maybe
five<00:01:14.200> stories<00:01:14.500> tall

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.660

that's<00:01:15.730> a<00:01:15.990> prototypical<00:01:16.990> version<00:01:17.620> it<00:01:18.460> would

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
that's a prototypical version it would

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.030 
that's a prototypical version it would
be<00:01:18.880> in<00:01:19.240> my<00:01:19.450> view<00:01:19.690> also<00:01:19.900> totally<00:01:20.680> transparent

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
be in my view also totally transparent

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.430 
be in my view also totally transparent

possibly get and those five floors would

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.420
