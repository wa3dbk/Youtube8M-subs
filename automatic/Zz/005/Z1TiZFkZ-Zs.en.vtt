trying<00:01:10.500> our<00:01:10.619> best<00:01:10.650> yet<00:01:11.159> third<00:01:11.970> down<00:01:12.270> now<00:01:12.600> that

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
trying our best yet third down now that

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.160 
trying our best yet third down now that
seconds<00:01:13.320> out<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.439> reach<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:14.130> know<00:01:14.280> that

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
seconds out of reach we know that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.980 
seconds out of reach we know that
relegation<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.259> very<00:01:16.470> very<00:01:16.680> scary<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
relegation is very very scary and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.810 
relegation is very very scary and
basically<00:01:18.990> we'd<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.740> play<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.189> long<00:01:20.490> time

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
basically we'd have to play a long time

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.179 
basically we'd have to play a long time
because<00:01:21.060> if<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:21.869> get<00:01:22.439> relevant<00:01:22.710> for<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
because if we get relevant for the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.800 
because if we get relevant for the
possibility<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.880> being<00:01:24.060> relegated<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.720> have

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
possibility of being relegated we have

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.719 
possibility of being relegated we have
to<00:01:24.900> play<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:25.770> next<00:01:26.100> few<00:01:26.250> months<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.580> toe

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
to play for next few months and toe

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.580 
to play for next few months and toe
relegation<00:01:27.360> comes<00:01:27.600> because<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:28.259> don't<00:01:28.439> want

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
relegation comes because we don't want

the very least we have to get playoffs
get<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> world's<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:37.049> really<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.350> to

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
get the world's so we really have to

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.620 
get the world's so we really have to
step<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.920> up<00:01:38.009> because<00:01:38.250> these<00:01:38.700> last<00:01:39.329> few<00:01:39.479> games

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
step it up because these last few games

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.080 
step it up because these last few games
matter<00:01:39.960> way<00:01:40.350> way<00:01:40.530> more<00:01:40.560> now<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.939> just

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
matter way way more now and we just

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.510 
matter way way more now and we just
don't<00:01:42.240> want<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> bad<00:01:42.720> spot<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.520> get

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
don't want to be in a bad spot and get

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.520 
don't want to be in a bad spot and get
possibly<00:01:44.759> relegated<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:46.020> how<00:01:46.170> much<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.500> that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
possibly relegated and how much is that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.690 
possibly relegated and how much is that
third<00:01:46.890> place<00:01:47.130> weighing<00:01:47.399> on<00:01:47.549> your<00:01:47.640> mind

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
third place weighing on your mind

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.160 
third place weighing on your mind
besides<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.420> because<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.810> guys<00:01:48.930> get

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
besides that because if you guys get

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.840 
besides that because if you guys get
third<00:01:49.439> your<00:01:49.770> by<00:01:49.920> means<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.369> don't<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.640> to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
third your by means you don't have to

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.120 
third your by means you don't have to
face<00:01:51.030> cloud<00:01:51.329> nine<00:01:51.600> until<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.380> finals<00:01:52.770> or<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
face cloud nine until the finals or the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.830 
face cloud nine until the finals or the
semis<00:01:53.490> rather<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.060> they've<00:01:54.390> kind<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.720> had

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
semis rather and they've kind of had

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.899 
semis rather and they've kind of had
your<00:01:55.020> number<00:01:55.140> I'll<00:01:55.409> split<00:01:55.680> yeah<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.790> we

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
your number I'll split yeah so we

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.969 
your number I'll split yeah so we
haven't<00:01:57.149> done<00:01:57.210> really<00:01:57.509> well<00:01:57.659> against<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.290> cloud

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
haven't done really well against a cloud

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.370 
haven't done really well against a cloud
nine<00:01:59.299> so<00:02:00.299> we<00:02:00.869> prefer<00:02:01.259> third<00:02:01.619> or<00:02:01.890> six<00:02:02.130> right<00:02:02.369> now

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
nine so we prefer third or six right now

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.240 
nine so we prefer third or six right now
like<00:02:04.380> right<00:02:04.500> now<00:02:04.560> we're<00:02:04.770> not<00:02:04.799> doing<00:02:05.070> getting

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
like right now we're not doing getting

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.029 
like right now we're not doing getting
against<00:02:05.490> EOG<00:02:05.790> either<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.770> they'll<00:02:07.770> probably

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
against EOG either so they'll probably

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.010 
against EOG either so they'll probably
be<00:02:08.250> either<00:02:08.459> for<00:02:08.849> for<00:02:09.119> third<00:02:09.360> depending<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:09.899> how

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
be either for for third depending on how

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.210 
be either for for third depending on how
things<00:02:10.259> turn<00:02:10.500> out<00:02:10.619> next<00:02:10.920> few<00:02:11.039> days<00:02:11.190> so

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
things turn out next few days so

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.280 
things turn out next few days so
obviously<00:02:12.150> want<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.420> avoid<00:02:12.540> facing<00:02:12.780> them<00:02:13.050> so

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
obviously want to avoid facing them so

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.940 
obviously want to avoid facing them so
if<00:02:13.349> we're<00:02:13.500> in<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.650> third

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
if we're in the third

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.400 
if we're in the third
place<00:02:14.099> area<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:14.520> get<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.670> pace<00:02:14.849> Balkan<00:02:15.360> which<00:02:16.230> we

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
place area we get a pace Balkan which we

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.780 
place area we get a pace Balkan which we
have<00:02:16.500> done<00:02:16.620> slightly<00:02:16.920> better<00:02:17.190> than<00:02:17.340> cloud

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
have done slightly better than cloud

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.890 
have done slightly better than cloud
nine<00:02:17.970> because<00:02:18.090> we<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.330> don't<00:02:18.480> think<00:02:18.750> we've

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
nine because we I don't think we've

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.780 
nine because we I don't think we've
being<00:02:19.080> one<00:02:19.290> against<00:02:19.590> cloud<00:02:19.769> nine<00:02:19.980> yet<00:02:20.190> here's

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
being one against cloud nine yet here's

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.540 
being one against cloud nine yet here's
hoping<00:02:20.910> we<00:02:21.150> can<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.690> week<00:02:21.930> but<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:23.250> yeah
