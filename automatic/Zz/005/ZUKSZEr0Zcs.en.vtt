two<00:01:33.270> lady<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:33.689> hard<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.990> argue<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.500> how

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
two lady it's hard to argue just how

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.069 
two lady it's hard to argue just how
light<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:34.979> compact<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.600> it

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
light and compact this can is and it

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.080 
light and compact this can is and it
does<00:01:37.229> work<00:01:37.590> quite<00:01:37.860> well<00:01:38.369> which<00:01:38.640> you'll<00:01:38.820> see<00:01:38.880> in

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
does work quite well which you'll see in

a minute the maintenance of the apex

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.359 
a minute the maintenance of the apex
micro<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.270> quite<00:01:42.659> simple<00:01:43.049> you're<00:01:44.040> not<00:01:44.189> going

micro is quite simple you're not going

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.760 
micro is quite simple you're not going

carbon won't solidify to the tube and as
you<00:02:03.960> see<00:02:04.140> here<00:02:04.380> I'm<00:02:04.619> illustrating<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.729> how

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
you see here I'm illustrating just how

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.660 
you see here I'm illustrating just how
easy<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.990> use<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> standard<00:02:07.979> ar-15<00:02:08.399> type

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
easy it is to use a standard ar-15 type

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.440 
easy it is to use a standard ar-15 type

build-up and that's about all you need
to<00:02:17.370> do<00:02:17.549> this<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:18.269> obviously<00:02:18.599> not<00:02:18.780> safe<00:02:19.080> for

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
to do this is obviously not safe for
