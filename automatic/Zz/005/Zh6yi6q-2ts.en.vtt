00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
of a medicare-for-all system I'm a favor

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:49.970 
of a medicare-for-all system I'm a favor
of

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
of

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.860 
of
single-payer<00:02:50.400> system<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:51.150> not<00:02:51.300> my<00:02:51.450> favorite

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
single-payer system so not my favorite

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.289 
single-payer system so not my favorite
that<00:02:52.379> you<00:02:52.709> know<00:02:52.830> system<00:02:53.640> but<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.239> better

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
that you know system but it's better

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.910 
that you know system but it's better
than<00:02:54.480> nothing<00:02:54.720> spin<00:02:55.349> what<00:02:55.560> we<00:02:55.650> have<00:02:55.799> before

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
than nothing spin what we have before

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.089 
than nothing spin what we have before
and<00:02:56.430> again<00:02:56.909> it<00:02:57.030> cuts<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.690> deficit<00:02:58.319> because<00:02:58.799> if

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
and again it cuts the deficit because if

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.440 
and again it cuts the deficit because if
people<00:02:59.220> have<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.730> pay<00:02:59.879> for<00:02:59.940> out<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.299> their<00:03:00.420> own
