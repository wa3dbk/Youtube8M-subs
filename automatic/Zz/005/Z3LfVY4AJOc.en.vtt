that's what we call one-to-one

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.469 
that's what we call one-to-one
correspondence<00:02:03.890> so<00:02:04.819> for<00:02:05.030> example<00:02:05.090> you're

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
correspondence so for example you're

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.990 
correspondence so for example you're
going<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.659> go<00:02:05.750> one<00:02:06.369> two<00:02:07.369> you're<00:02:07.670> going<00:02:07.789> to<00:02:07.850> make

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
going to go one two you're going to make

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.759 
going to go one two you're going to make
sure<00:02:08.269> that<00:02:08.539> your<00:02:08.690> child<00:02:08.989> is<00:02:09.229> doing<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.619> this
