think<00:03:11.700> Amy<00:03:11.909> would<00:03:12.000> be<00:03:12.209> all<00:03:12.299> right<00:03:12.510> if<00:03:12.569> this<00:03:12.900> was

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
think Amy would be all right if this was

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.849 
think Amy would be all right if this was
about<00:03:13.319> as<00:03:13.560> fierce<00:03:13.920> as<00:03:14.099> he<00:03:14.250> could<00:03:14.400> bite<00:03:15.859> that

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
about as fierce as he could bite that

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.409 
about as fierce as he could bite that
bite<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.370> he<00:03:17.519> hits<00:03:17.700> her<00:03:17.819> with<00:03:17.849> on<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.269> show

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419

articulation<00:03:59.010> all<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.579> way<00:03:59.669> through<00:03:59.849> here

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
articulation all the way through here

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.309 
articulation all the way through here
you<00:04:00.120> can<00:04:00.269> move<00:04:00.389> legs<00:04:00.660> but<00:04:00.900> then<00:04:01.019> I'll<00:04:01.139> fall

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
you can move legs but then I'll fall

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.559 
you can move legs but then I'll fall
over<00:04:01.349> so<00:04:01.799> you<00:04:02.430> know<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.639> head<00:04:02.849> you<00:04:03.030> know

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
over so you know the head you know

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.300 
over so you know the head you know
because<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.109> gimmick<00:04:04.440> there's<00:04:05.190> no

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
because of the gimmick there's no

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.860 
because of the gimmick there's no
articulation<00:04:05.790> on<00:04:06.030> him<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:06.299> he's<00:04:06.449> pretty<00:04:06.629> much

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
just a you know pretty pretty standard

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.599 
just a you know pretty pretty standard
type<00:04:10.620> of<00:04:10.829> figure<00:04:11.010> you're<00:04:11.250> just<00:04:11.400> going<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.579> have

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
type of figure you're just going to have

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.750 
type of figure you're just going to have
him<00:04:11.879> you<00:04:12.209> know<00:04:12.299> kind<00:04:12.569> of<00:04:12.629> standing<00:04:13.019> there

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
him you know kind of standing there

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.729 
him you know kind of standing there
almost<00:04:14.760> like<00:04:14.849> a<00:04:14.910> statue<00:04:15.599> sort<00:04:16.139> of<00:04:16.289> but<00:04:16.620> he<00:04:16.709> does

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739

have the action and the arm articulation
so<00:04:19.320> here's<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.590> figure<00:04:19.949> he<00:04:20.039> just<00:04:20.250> needs<00:04:20.489> the

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
so here's a figure he just needs the

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.890 
so here's a figure he just needs the
type<00:04:20.789> of<00:04:20.820> figure<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.449> you're<00:04:21.570> just<00:04:21.659> going<00:04:21.840> to

like he couldn't stand well enough for

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.200 
like he couldn't stand well enough for

every time you move the knob you just

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.270 
every time you move the knob you just
fall<00:05:48.479> right<00:05:48.510> over<00:05:48.720> maybe<00:05:49.590> that's<00:05:49.919> what<00:05:50.100> was

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280
