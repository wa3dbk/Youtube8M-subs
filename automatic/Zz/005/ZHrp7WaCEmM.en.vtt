00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.519 
action siphon fed airbrush the term dual
action<00:00:27.960> may<00:00:28.829> be<00:00:28.860> confusing<00:00:29.520> for<00:00:29.640> some<00:00:29.939> folks

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
action may be confusing for some folks

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.460 
action may be confusing for some folks
what<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.560> basically<00:00:31.980> means<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
what that basically means is that the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.040 
what that basically means is that the
airbrush<00:00:34.470> performs<00:00:35.160> two<00:00:35.610> functions<00:00:36.050> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
airbrush performs two functions the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.700 
airbrush performs two functions the
first<00:00:37.470> being<00:00:38.839> pressing<00:00:39.839> in<00:00:40.080> on<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.440> trigger

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
first being pressing in on the trigger

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.270 
first being pressing in on the trigger
here<00:00:41.180> to<00:00:42.180> release<00:00:42.540> air<00:00:42.900> that<00:00:43.830> comes<00:00:44.010> through

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
here to release air that comes through

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.009 
here to release air that comes through
the<00:00:44.400> air<00:00:44.430> hose<00:00:44.879> which<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.360> attached<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.839> the

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
the air hose which is attached to the

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.060 
the air hose which is attached to the
bottom<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.420> first<00:00:48.720> action<00:00:49.170> pressing<00:00:49.890> in

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
bottom so the first action pressing in

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.700 
bottom so the first action pressing in
releases<00:00:50.549> the<00:00:50.729> air<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.570> second<00:00:52.049> would<00:00:52.559> be<00:00:52.589> to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
releases the air the second would be to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.149 
releases the air the second would be to
pull<00:00:53.129> back<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.729> the<00:00:54.420> trigger<00:00:54.559> that<00:00:55.559> releases

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
attached so that dual action down for

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.230 
attached so that dual action down for
paint<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:06.990> back<00:01:07.380> for<00:01:07.830> I'm<00:01:08.340> sorry<00:01:08.670> down<00:01:09.000> for

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
air back for paint it really becomes one

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.690 
air back for paint it really becomes one
motion<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.740> further<00:01:14.010> forward<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
motion and the further forward the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.030 
motion and the further forward the
trigger<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.240> lighter<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.320> mist<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.770> paint

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
trigger is the lighter the mist of paint

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.640 
trigger is the lighter the mist of paint
the<00:01:17.820> further<00:01:18.150> back<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.840> heavier<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> spray

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the further back the heavier the spray

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.210 
the further back the heavier the spray
of<00:01:19.680> paint<00:01:20.960> that<00:01:21.960> that's<00:01:22.200> very<00:01:22.530> similar<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.040> a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
of paint that that's very similar to a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.770 
of paint that that's very similar to a
single<00:01:23.640> action<00:01:23.820> airbrush<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> only

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
single action airbrush the only

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.660 
single action airbrush the only
difference<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.410> that<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.950> single<00:01:26.490> action

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
difference is that on a single action

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.580 
difference is that on a single action
airbrush<00:01:27.180> both<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.780> those<00:01:27.900> functions<00:01:28.140> are

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
airbrush both of those functions are

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.640 
airbrush both of those functions are
done<00:01:29.130> simultaneously<00:01:30.120> so<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.660> single<00:01:31.530> action

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
done simultaneously so a single action

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.830 
done simultaneously so a single action
airbrush<00:01:32.100> would<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.730> have<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> press<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.690> of

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
airbrush would just have the press in of

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.630 
airbrush would just have the press in of
the<00:01:33.960> trigger<00:01:34.230> and<00:01:34.440> that<00:01:34.500> would<00:01:35.190> that<00:01:35.430> would

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
the trigger and that would that would

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.990 
the trigger and that would that would
mix<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> air<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.650> paint<00:01:38.340> simultaneously

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
mix the air and the paint simultaneously

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.140 
mix the air and the paint simultaneously
the<00:01:42.000> dual<00:01:42.240> action<00:01:42.480> airbrush<00:01:43.250> like<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.490> or

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
the dual action airbrush like the or

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.820 
the dual action airbrush like the or
double<00:01:45.479> action<00:01:45.720> airbrush<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.440> single

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
double action airbrush like the single

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.170 
double action airbrush like the single
action<00:01:47.870> really<00:01:48.870> has<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.470> some<00:01:50.060> very<00:01:51.060> basic

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
action really has just some very basic

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.760 
action really has just some very basic
parts<00:01:52.050> and<00:01:52.979> both<00:01:53.880> types<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.570> air<00:01:54.720> brushes<00:01:55.110> have

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
parts and both types of air brushes have

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.770 
parts and both types of air brushes have
the<00:01:55.950> basic<00:01:56.280> parts<00:01:56.610> I've<00:01:57.270> already<00:01:57.600> mentioned

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
the basic parts I've already mentioned

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.719 
the basic parts I've already mentioned

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
that adjust just how far back that

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.869 
that adjust just how far back that
needle<00:02:34.519> sits<00:02:35.519> from<00:02:35.849> this<00:02:36.030> hole<00:02:37.280> as<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.340> pull

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
needle sits from this hole as you pull

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.820 
needle sits from this hole as you pull
back<00:02:39.090> on<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.390> trigger<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:39.959> see<00:02:40.349> that<00:02:40.620> the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
back on the trigger you can see that the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.619 
back on the trigger you can see that the
needle<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.310> actually<00:02:41.489> moving<00:02:42.150> with<00:02:42.390> the

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
needle is actually moving with the

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.600 
needle is actually moving with the
trigger<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.140> what<00:02:43.920> that's<00:02:44.099> doing<00:02:44.340> is

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
trigger and what that's doing is

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.970 
trigger and what that's doing is
basically<00:02:44.849> opening<00:02:45.599> up<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.349> nozzle<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
basically opening up the nozzle the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.490 
basically opening up the nozzle the
further<00:02:47.220> back<00:02:47.459> I<00:02:47.700> pull<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.900> needles<00:02:49.200> further

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
further back I pull the needles further

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.229 
further back I pull the needles further
from<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.920> hole<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.489> there's<00:02:50.670> more<00:02:50.849> space

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
from the hole and so there's more space

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.920 
from the hole and so there's more space
for<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.660> paint<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.110> come<00:02:52.290> out<00:02:52.519> as<00:02:53.519> you<00:02:54.239> move

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
for that paint to come out as you move

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.720 
for that paint to come out as you move
the<00:02:55.110> needle<00:02:55.380> forward<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:56.220> hole<00:02:56.489> gets

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
the needle forward that hole gets

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.000 
the needle forward that hole gets
blocked<00:02:57.000> up<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.569> so<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.959> amount<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.739> paint

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
blocked up and so the amount of paint

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.580 
blocked up and so the amount of paint
coming<00:02:59.250> out<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.640> airbrush<00:03:00.030> decreases

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.259 

that's<00:03:04.590> about<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.069> for<00:03:05.250> air<00:03:05.400> brushes<00:03:05.849> just

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
that's about it for air brushes just

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.410 
that's about it for air brushes just
