00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.089
 perfect then we are the second we say 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.309
 part of the video 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.440
 I will make them a little forward on Saturday because 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.990
 then the room needs to make itself 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.109
 cigarette is therefore removed as 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.090
 meanwhile you will find month on some 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.840
 extra connector then we have nothing 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.949
 put the motherboard by i put back i 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:30.140
 two connectors of the two antennas 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:33.660
 higher we are now connecting the part 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.620
 precisely the jacks below that manage 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.050
 the camera and the headphone jack 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.100
 I recommend you put the stickers back on 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.690
 just as they were in a way that nothing 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.360
 I practically keep the jack 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.520
 always put so this was put 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.629
 so with the adhesive then other object 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.960
 camera shutter 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:07.979
 let's put back the seals we say 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:13.040
 original with glue and if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:20.009
 there was also a longer sticker here 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:26.100
 practically here in support of everything 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:31.280
 indeed there was then a sticker here 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.990
 here that kept these unkempt men 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.990
 and then a little longer adhesive 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:46.050
 typical that covered these two these 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.610
 connectors so 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:54.510
 ok then we have practically nothing 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.580
 properly put back we say these 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:01.160
 regulators we can safely 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:06.360
 also connect the connector to in 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:12.140
 the high camera is the external one 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.140
 attention to insert it gently 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.970
 also waiting for the typical click of the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.970
 connector that is well inserted 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.880
 that's why it gives so much from the side 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.880
 satisfaction this click feel it 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.150
 here is where his mistake was 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.030
 beautiful at the marina which are many 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.769
 little bits that are there but something 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.750
 they serve if this definitely serves for 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.930
 keep crushed against the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.590
 connector because I do n't go away 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.560
 because if not, if this should go away 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.530
 connector at a time when precisely the 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.680
 our handsome customer wants to take a picture e 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.299
 no longer has the chance 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.570
 we say discontent in us surely 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:09.329
 inguaiati because everything must be rescheduled 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.579
 then let's see where we are we see this 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.820
 the battery that we really have with 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:19.790
 difficulty disassembled because it has a nice one 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:22.440
 nice visual double-sided tape that kept it 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:27.260
 let's remember how it was 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.549
 surely it was we say level of here 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.400
 centered precisely in the space between 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:36.350
 the other is some free hands 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.150
 still the stickers to stick well 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:43.019
 surely this was in the space that 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.960
 remains free here for which we say 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:49.190
 first insert its connector 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:54.680
 that's how it centers and then 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:04:00.750
 let's say let's go back with some 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:04.410
 that double-sided adhesive which was the stock that 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:09.300
 has remained then in the meantime le 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:12.510
 antennine we already had beautiful ms 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.600
 to this then the adhesive that is 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:21.620
 will chase in the lower part 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:27.120
 all practically to the tax we're going to 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:31.980
 put back and then what point are we what 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:35.100
 missing to ok missing the two btp let's say 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:40.920
 these beautiful things that are useful for 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:45.630
 connect the connector to the base the 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:48.540
 connector of the charging jack and 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:53.460
 let's go quietly admit they are 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:55.710
 the screws with the head plus langa there is 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.770
 so let's not say you shouldn't 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.510
 mistake this cable surely here 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.140
 over it 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:06.300
 because the disassembled before ok then 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:10.920
 be careful when reassembling the antennas 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:16.460
 which are very, very delicate 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:21.150
 ok now we just have to practically 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:23.340
 to say put aside if 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:28.050
 we want to be picky are so two i 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.820
 small squares that covered the screws that with 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.620
 the screws are still not in effect me 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:38.780
 something was missing that there are two screws 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.780
 of the 18 that practically 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:49.130
 I'm stunned on off here are two 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:52.880
 central in the charge body that not 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:55.850
 forget don't put it on 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.330
 in fact, as you can see, they refer to the 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:02.890
 collector perfectly to its own 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.890
 initial position 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:10.750
 ok then if we want to be 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:15.320
 these two squares were picky 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:19.460
 messina from home apple they hide 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:22.250
 those screws and sincerely initially 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.440
 they just helped me not to see them 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.950
 screws because we thought there was but then I have 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:31.940
 seen knowing let's say mom apple does 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:35.500
 these jokes and hidden under 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:38.090
 so after a long experience 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.180
 in short, we know that sometimes there is 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:43.610
 some trick we check if they are 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.850
 been these two dt precisely of the 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.850
 antennas 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.580
 ok it's time we just have to go first 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.740
 see the pieces that have remained to understand 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.840
 if there is any piece that is missing 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.750
 we have all that is a child who 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:06.610
 you put you put later in the moment in 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:12.669
 to which we go precisely lcd and touch glass 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.669
