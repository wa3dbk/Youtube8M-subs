because<00:01:36.990> back<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.560> day<00:01:37.680> when<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.890> was<00:01:37.950> in

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
because back in the day when I was in

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.010 
because back in the day when I was in
high<00:01:38.220> school<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:39.150> wanted<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> try<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.960> see

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
high school and I wanted to try and see

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.630 
high school and I wanted to try and see
if<00:01:40.200> my<00:01:40.350> hair<00:01:40.500> would<00:01:40.680> go<00:01:40.799> up<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.310> tried

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
if my hair would go up on I tried

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.179 
if my hair would go up on I tried
Garnier<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.390> thought<00:01:42.840> would<00:01:43.500> probably<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
Garnier I thought would probably be the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.460 
Garnier I thought would probably be the
best<00:01:44.369> one<00:01:44.759> because<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.450> Caucasian<00:01:46.110> products

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
best one because it's Caucasian products

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.399 
best one because it's Caucasian products
so<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.560> figured<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.100> you

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
so I figured that you

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.480 
so I figured that you
I<00:01:48.439> was<00:01:49.009> obviously<00:01:49.700> stupid<00:01:50.240> anyway<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:51.560> then<00:01:52.340> I

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
I was obviously stupid anyway so then I

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.459 
I was obviously stupid anyway so then I
tried<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.060> dark<00:01:53.299> and<00:01:53.479> lovely<00:01:53.659> starch<00:01:54.140> in

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
tried the dark and lovely starch in

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.800 
tried the dark and lovely starch in

to<00:02:30.380> put<00:02:30.680> in<00:02:30.799> so<00:02:30.980> much<00:02:31.130> product<00:02:31.430> but<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:31.730> was<00:02:31.970> just

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
to put in so much product but I was just

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.509 
to put in so much product but I was just
so<00:02:32.360> like<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:33.140> couldn't<00:02:33.709> believe<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.069> was

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
so like I couldn't believe that was

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:35.620 
so like I couldn't believe that was
actually<00:02:34.849> turning<00:02:35.060> black

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
actually turning black

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.240 
actually turning black
so<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.200> just<00:02:36.620> let<00:02:36.830> it<00:02:36.860> turn<00:02:37.130> von<00:02:37.400> der<00:02:37.970> I<00:02:39.130> like<00:02:40.130> the
