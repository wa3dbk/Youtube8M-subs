want to see a second version this video
where<00:04:51.350> you<00:04:51.380> see<00:04:51.650> some<00:04:51.860> masters<00:04:52.310> one<00:04:52.550> gameplay

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
where you see some masters one gameplay

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.939 
where you see some masters one gameplay
will<00:04:53.870> make<00:04:53.990> sure<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.139> push<00:04:54.380> her<00:04:54.500> up<00:04:54.650> there<00:04:54.830> and

will make sure to push her up there and

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:56.980 
will make sure to push her up there and
let<00:04:55.100> our<00:04:55.190> defense<00:04:55.550> try<00:04:55.759> and<00:04:55.880> win<00:04:56.060> a<00:04:56.270> couple<00:04:56.780> at

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
let our defense try and win a couple at

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.760 
let our defense try and win a couple at
least<00:04:57.699> hopefully<00:04:58.699> anyway<00:04:59.080> so<00:05:00.080> as<00:05:00.350> you<00:05:00.500> can<00:05:00.590> see

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
least hopefully anyway so as you can see

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.890 
least hopefully anyway so as you can see
this<00:05:01.340> is<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.580> one<00:05:01.970> loss<00:05:02.240> that<00:05:02.509> we<00:05:02.600> had<00:05:02.750> on<00:05:02.780> the

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
this is the one loss that we had on the

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.200 
this is the one loss that we had on the
base<00:05:03.110> so<00:05:03.410> far<00:05:03.680> and<00:05:03.919> we<00:05:04.759> are<00:05:04.940> going<00:05:05.030> to<00:05:05.120> be

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
base so far and we are going to be

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.700 
base so far and we are going to be
showing<00:05:05.330> some<00:05:05.570> higher<00:05:05.810> level<00:05:06.139> gameplay<00:05:06.289> soon

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
showing some higher level gameplay soon

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.439 
showing some higher level gameplay soon
since<00:05:06.949> she<00:05:07.099> did<00:05:07.400> just<00:05:07.430> reach<00:05:07.729> master<00:05:08.120> too<00:05:08.270> so

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
since she did just reach master too so

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:09.580 
since she did just reach master too so

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.960 
they're gonna get that dark 1600 not so
bad<00:05:29.750> on<00:05:30.020> my<00:05:30.259> part<00:05:30.289> not<00:05:30.680> so<00:05:30.710> bad<00:05:31.039> of<00:05:31.160> a<00:05:31.220> loss<00:05:31.430> yeah

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
bad on my part not so bad of a loss yeah

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.659 
bad on my part not so bad of a loss yeah
not<00:05:32.150> too<00:05:32.300> bad<00:05:32.330> but<00:05:32.479> actually<00:05:33.410> we<00:05:33.800> did<00:05:34.340> change

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
not too bad but actually we did change

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.279 
not too bad but actually we did change
the<00:05:34.849> base<00:05:35.000> right<00:05:35.419> after<00:05:35.840> this<00:05:35.930> attack<00:05:36.110> is

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
the base right after this attack is

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:37.960 
the base right after this attack is
obviously<00:05:36.740> was<00:05:36.860> a<00:05:36.919> third<00:05:37.130> one<00:05:37.340> and<00:05:37.520> we<00:05:37.639> were

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
obviously was a third one and we were

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.719 
obviously was a third one and we were
like<00:05:38.090> shoot<00:05:38.539> we<00:05:38.810> don't<00:05:39.020> want<00:05:39.139> to<00:05:39.199> lose<00:05:39.320> again

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
like shoot we don't want to lose again

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.399 
like shoot we don't want to lose again
so<00:05:40.729> we<00:05:40.820> did<00:05:40.970> was<00:05:41.090> he<00:05:41.180> split<00:05:41.449> the<00:05:41.479> dark<00:05:42.050> looks<00:05:42.289> of

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
so we did was he split the dark looks of

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:43.719 
so we did was he split the dark looks of
storage<00:05:42.680> up<00:05:42.860> in<00:05:42.979> the<00:05:43.070> other<00:05:43.190> building<00:05:43.400> right

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
storage up in the other building right

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:45.580 
storage up in the other building right
there<00:05:43.760> and<00:05:44.150> put<00:05:44.360> a<00:05:44.389> big<00:05:44.690> bomb<00:05:44.900> there<00:05:45.139> instead

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
there and put a big bomb there instead

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.500 
there and put a big bomb there instead
yeah<00:05:46.430> and<00:05:46.550> I<00:05:46.639> think<00:05:46.849> that<00:05:46.970> putting<00:05:47.180> the<00:05:47.330> big

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
yeah and I think that putting the big

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.820 
yeah and I think that putting the big
bomb<00:05:47.690> there<00:05:47.900> is<00:05:48.020> really<00:05:48.320> gonna<00:05:48.440> help<00:05:48.650> in

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
bomb there is really gonna help in

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.920 
bomb there is really gonna help in
future<00:05:49.010> attacks<00:05:49.520> it<00:05:49.699> has<00:05:49.880> actually<00:05:50.539> because

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
future attacks it has actually because

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.480 
future attacks it has actually because
the<00:05:51.500> second<00:05:51.889> again<00:05:52.099> to<00:05:52.220> that<00:05:52.340> middle

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
the second again to that middle

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.040 
the second again to that middle
compartment<00:05:52.669> they<00:05:53.150> do<00:05:53.210> hit<00:05:53.510> that<00:05:53.539> big<00:05:53.720> bomb

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
compartment they do hit that big bomb

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.600 
compartment they do hit that big bomb
and<00:05:54.260> it<00:05:54.349> does<00:05:54.560> take<00:05:54.860> a<00:05:54.889> majority<00:05:55.430> of<00:05:55.460> the

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
and it does take a majority of the

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.430 
and it does take a majority of the
King's<00:05:55.789> life<00:05:56.000> and<00:05:56.270> it<00:05:56.720> does<00:05:56.900> kill<00:05:57.139> a<00:05:57.169> lot<00:05:57.409> of

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
King's life and it does kill a lot of

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.230 
King's life and it does kill a lot of
the<00:05:57.620> other<00:05:57.800> units<00:05:58.250> or<00:05:58.430> the<00:05:58.610> other<00:05:58.760> troops<00:05:59.090> that

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
the other units or the other troops that

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.060 
the other units or the other troops that
are<00:05:59.270> lower<00:05:59.570> level<00:05:59.960> in<00:06:00.020> health<00:06:00.229> that's<00:06:00.889> true

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
are lower level in health that's true

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.189 
are lower level in health that's true
now<00:06:01.610> it's<00:06:01.880> really<00:06:02.150> interesting<00:06:02.389> and<00:06:02.690> funny<00:06:02.960> is

good<00:06:11.389> base<00:06:11.570> even<00:06:11.840> for<00:06:12.199> title<00:06:12.500> nines<00:06:12.770> and<00:06:13.430> I

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
good base even for title nines and I

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.129 
good base even for title nines and I
think<00:06:13.789> that's<00:06:13.940> pretty<00:06:14.120> good<00:06:14.360> for<00:06:14.419> me<00:06:14.780> I<00:06:14.810> mean<00:06:15.080> I

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
think that's pretty good for me I mean I

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:16.990 
think that's pretty good for me I mean I
do<00:06:15.289> like<00:06:15.620> to<00:06:15.770> do<00:06:15.889> these<00:06:16.099> time<00:06:16.310> when<00:06:16.490> I<00:06:16.639> version

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
do like to do these time when I version

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.189

pretty smart basis and you just have to

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:21.249 
pretty smart basis and you just have to
know<00:06:19.759> how<00:06:19.940> to<00:06:20.150> really<00:06:20.389> compensate<00:06:21.020> for<00:06:21.199> the
