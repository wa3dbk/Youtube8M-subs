00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
reason almost like there's some kind of

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.429 
reason almost like there's some kind of
a<00:01:38.069> vapor<00:01:38.280> issue<00:01:38.639> or<00:01:39.509> something<00:01:39.929> going<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.259> with

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
a vapor issue or something going on with

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.800 
a vapor issue or something going on with
the<00:01:40.530> truck<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.069> so<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.090> had<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.299> go<00:01:42.389> really<00:01:42.600> slow

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the truck and so I had to go really slow

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.569 
the truck and so I had to go really slow
to<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.380> able<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.560> put<00:01:43.679> gas<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.219> so<00:01:44.399> right

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
to be able to put gas in it so right

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.039 
to be able to put gas in it so right
then<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.789> knew<00:01:44.909> something<00:01:45.479> was<00:01:45.630> weird

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
then I knew something was weird

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.230 
then I knew something was weird

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.150 
rubber hose which was only a four inch
hose<00:02:15.640> would<00:02:16.060> actually<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:17.320> was<00:02:17.500> all<00:02:17.680> dry

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
hose would actually that was all dry

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.140 
hose would actually that was all dry
rotted<00:02:18.730> after<00:02:19.360> replacing<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.320> hose<00:02:20.650> um<00:02:21.190> I

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
rotted after replacing that hose um I

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.360 
rotted after replacing that hose um I
went<00:02:22.330> ahead<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.630> went<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:23.800> back<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.220> gas

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
went ahead and went it back to the gas

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.980 
went ahead and went it back to the gas
station<00:02:24.400> tried<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.060> put<00:02:25.210> gas<00:02:25.360> in<00:02:25.660> it

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
station tried to put gas in it

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.690 
station tried to put gas in it
the<00:02:26.410> gas<00:02:26.650> went<00:02:26.920> right<00:02:27.100> in<00:02:27.250> there<00:02:27.460> was<00:02:27.550> no

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700

problem nothing was holding me back now

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.920 
problem nothing was holding me back now
I<00:02:29.650> went<00:02:30.370> back<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.580> autozone<00:02:31.240> they<00:02:31.540> did<00:02:31.690> another

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
I went back to autozone they did another

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:32.670 
I went back to autozone they did another
test<00:02:32.200> on<00:02:32.470> it

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
test on it

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.190 
test on it
and<00:02:32.830> now<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.520> tests<00:02:34.390> come<00:02:34.570> back<00:02:34.810> there<00:02:35.050> was

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
and now the tests come back there was

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.230 
and now the tests come back there was
evap<00:02:35.620> leak<00:02:35.890> but<00:02:36.070> it<00:02:36.190> actually<00:02:36.370> gave<00:02:36.760> me<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.880> part

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
evap leak but it actually gave me a part

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.810 
evap leak but it actually gave me a part
number<00:02:37.300> after<00:02:37.780> replacing<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.620> hose<00:02:38.800> so<00:02:39.190> that

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
number after replacing the hose so that

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.060 
number after replacing the hose so that
was<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:39.970> good<00:02:40.180> sign<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:40.810> I'm<00:02:41.020> on<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.230> good<00:02:41.740> start

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
this part right here which was the part

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.540 
this part right here which was the part
number<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.930> came<00:02:47.110> up<00:02:47.320> up<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.740> this<00:02:48.250> was<00:02:48.520> a

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
number it came up up and this was a

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
number it came up up and this was a
canister<00:02:49.240> valve<00:02:49.870> purge<00:02:50.680> valve<00:02:50.980> solenoid

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
canister valve purge valve solenoid

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.030 
canister valve purge valve solenoid
again<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:52.750> was<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.870> canister<00:02:53.410> purge<00:02:53.740> valve

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
again it was a canister purge valve

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.940 
again it was a canister purge valve
solenoid<00:02:54.750> part<00:02:55.750> number<00:02:56.110> P

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.230

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
actually it was very simple to put on I

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.830 
actually it was very simple to put on I
actually<00:03:06.670> put<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.000> on<00:03:07.120> in<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.360> parking<00:03:07.720> lot

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.360 
actually put it on in the parking lot
there<00:03:08.050> autozone<00:03:08.620> took<00:03:08.830> me<00:03:08.920> about<00:03:09.070> three

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
there autozone took me about three
