00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
pretty cool if we go ahead and do this

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.140 
pretty cool if we go ahead and do this
and<00:01:17.330> now<00:01:18.330> if<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.350> resize<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> browser<00:01:20.790> you'll

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
