Keller<00:00:31.500> had<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.340> covered<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:33.030> there<00:00:33.210> was<00:00:33.300> so

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
Keller had it covered but there was so

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.819 
Keller had it covered but there was so
much<00:00:33.600> movement<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> ball<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.710> it

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
much movement on the ball that it

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.250 
much movement on the ball that it
swerved<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.850> around<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.540> think<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
swerved up and around it I think the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.410 
swerved up and around it I think the
word<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.680> Portuguese<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.579> cojones<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.149> called

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.240 
word in Portuguese for cojones is called
Hillis<00:00:39.780> which<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.469> think<00:00:40.770> that's<00:00:40.920> what<00:00:41.129> he's

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
Hillis which I think that's what he's

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.500 
Hillis which I think that's what he's
got<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.489> mean<00:00:41.670> he's<00:00:41.820> got<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> confidence<00:00:42.329> to

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
got I mean he's got the confidence to

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.060 
got I mean he's got the confidence to
know<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.629> if<00:00:42.780> he<00:00:42.870> steps<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.320> onto<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.710> ball

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
know that if he steps up onto that ball

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.470 
know that if he steps up onto that ball
and<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.640> give<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.789> even<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.120> little<00:00:45.300> bit<00:00:45.450> of

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and just give it even a little bit of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.970 
and just give it even a little bit of
space<00:00:45.750> he<00:00:45.930> can<00:00:46.079> rip<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.530> put<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.770> somewhere

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
space he can rip it and put it somewhere

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.450 
space he can rip it and put it somewhere
on<00:00:47.190> frame<00:00:51.020> kori<00:00:52.020> Stephenson<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.860> always

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
on frame kori Stephenson is always

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.069 
on frame kori Stephenson is always
dangerous<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:54.149> an<00:00:54.360> outside<00:00:54.660> shooter<00:00:54.809> because

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
dangerous as an outside shooter because

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.790 
dangerous as an outside shooter because
no<00:00:56.010> distance<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.820> too<00:00:56.850> far<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.809> him<00:00:58.020> he<00:00:58.559> shoots

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
no distance is too far for him he shoots

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.250 
no distance is too far for him he shoots
I<00:00:59.070> think<00:00:59.520> probably<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.090> heaviest<00:01:00.270> ball<00:01:00.750> in

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
I think probably the heaviest ball in

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.799 
I think probably the heaviest ball in
the<00:01:01.410> league<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.949> looks<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.690> ton<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.719> bricks

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the league it looks like a ton of bricks

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.890 
the league it looks like a ton of bricks
coming<00:01:04.379> out<00:01:04.500> yet<00:01:04.739> khari<00:01:05.339> Stephenson<00:01:05.909> has<00:01:06.119> more

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
coming out yet khari Stephenson has more

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.630 
coming out yet khari Stephenson has more
power<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.530> his<00:01:07.680> shot<00:01:07.920> than<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.250> think<00:01:08.310> almost

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
power in his shot than I think almost

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.210 
power in his shot than I think almost
any<00:01:08.970> player<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.600> league

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.430 

you<00:01:16.610> can<00:01:16.760> see<00:01:16.970> when<00:01:17.120> he<00:01:17.210> lines<00:01:17.510> it<00:01:17.780> up<00:01:17.900> that<00:01:18.290> he

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
you can see when he lines it up that he

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.320 
you can see when he lines it up that he
just<00:01:18.680> hammers<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:19.370> ball<00:01:19.580> doesn't<00:01:20.120> give

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
just hammers the ball doesn't give

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
just hammers the ball doesn't give
goalkeepers<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:20.930> chance

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
goalkeepers a chance

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.280 
goalkeepers a chance
there<00:01:21.950> are<00:01:22.070> physics<00:01:22.550> at<00:01:23.330> play<00:01:23.750> here<00:01:23.780> that<00:01:24.260> I

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
there are physics at play here that I

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.320 
there are physics at play here that I
just<00:01:24.500> don't<00:01:24.710> understand<00:01:25.430> I<00:01:25.610> know<00:01:25.670> I<00:01:25.940> don't

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
just don't understand I know I don't

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.510 
just don't understand I know I don't
know<00:01:26.600> how<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:26.990> can<00:01:27.410> take<00:01:27.620> such<00:01:27.830> a<00:01:27.860> short<00:01:28.250> run

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
know how you can take such a short run

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.200 
know how you can take such a short run
up<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:28.910> hit<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.600> ball<00:01:29.810> at<00:01:30.110> damn<00:01:30.320> hard<00:01:30.620> I<00:01:34.210> think

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
up and hit the ball at damn hard I think

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.590 
up and hit the ball at damn hard I think
of<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:37.070> outside<00:01:37.220> shooters<00:01:37.850> we've<00:01:38.090> recognized

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
of the bowl it's great sort of a chaotic

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.210 
of the bowl it's great sort of a chaotic
scene<00:01:53.300> for<00:01:53.600> defenders<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.290> so<00:01:54.800> the<00:01:54.890> Portland

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220

Timbers<00:01:55.280> this<00:01:55.550> season<00:01:55.790> have<00:01:55.880> had<00:01:56.030> success<00:01:56.420> in

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
Timbers this season have had success in

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.660 
Timbers this season have had success in
bouncing<00:01:57.080> on<00:01:57.140> those<00:01:57.350> loose<00:01:57.530> balls<00:01:57.800> in<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.490> box

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
bouncing on those loose balls in the box

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.610 
bouncing on those loose balls in the box
that's<00:01:58.880> just<00:01:59.330> as<00:01:59.510> good<00:01:59.690> as<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.870> magical<00:02:00.440> goal

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
that's just as good as a magical goal

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.170 
that's just as good as a magical goal
from<00:02:00.860> distance<00:02:01.250> that<00:02:01.400> hits<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.730> upper<00:02:01.910> 90

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
from distance that hits the upper 90

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.370
