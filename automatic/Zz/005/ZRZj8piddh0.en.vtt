00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.440 

so<00:01:57.950> from<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.250> beginning<00:01:58.369> you<00:01:58.909> know<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.299> goes

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
so from the beginning you know that goes

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.210 
so from the beginning you know that goes
like<00:01:59.540> you

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.389 

and<00:02:06.240> after<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.690> third<00:02:07.930> card<00:02:08.259> is<00:02:08.560> same

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
and after that and third card is same

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.300 
and after that and third card is same
card<00:02:09.820> as<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.750> first<00:02:10.990> car<00:02:11.230> but<00:02:11.950> in<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.070> player

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
card as the first car but in a player

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.520 
card as the first car but in a player
with<00:02:12.520> an<00:02:12.670> inversion<00:02:13.060> for<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:13.660> higher<00:02:13.930> note<00:02:14.260> and

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
with an inversion for a higher note and

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.520 
with an inversion for a higher note and
so<00:02:15.310> on<00:02:15.490> are<00:02:15.520> around<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:16.570> left<00:02:16.780> hand<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.290> Bay

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
so on are around the left hand the Bay

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.610 
so on are around the left hand the Bay
State<00:02:17.590> goes<00:02:18.280> back<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.880> f-sharp<00:02:19.620> putting

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
State goes back to the f-sharp putting

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.100 
State goes back to the f-sharp putting
the<00:02:20.710> right<00:02:20.890> hand<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.280> playing<00:02:21.490> now<00:02:21.730> c-sharp

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.850 

e.g<00:02:26.110> Shaw<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.460> sea<00:02:27.700> shot<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:29.440> from<00:02:29.770> the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
e.g Shaw and the sea shot so from the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:40.140 
e.g Shaw and the sea shot so from the
beginning<00:02:29.980> goes<00:02:30.580> sounds<00:02:31.000> like<00:02:31.150> this

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.899 

all<00:02:41.150> right<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.750> fourth<00:02:41.989> call<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.519> is<00:02:43.519> another

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
all right the fourth call it is another

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.470 
all right the fourth call it is another
inversion<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:46.459> right<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:47.030> on<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.269> base

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
inversion and the right so on the base

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.470 
inversion and the right so on the base
I'm<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.620> player<00:02:48.860> in<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.129> yard<00:02:49.370> ask<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:50.000> C<00:02:50.180> sharp

again within the right hand of playing

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:00.970 
again within the right hand of playing
the<00:02:54.230> C<00:02:54.470> sharp<00:02:54.799> E<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.590> f<00:02:59.560> so<00:03:00.560> from<00:03:00.890> the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
the C sharp E in the f so from the

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:15.050 
the C sharp E in the f so from the
beginning<00:03:01.099> again<00:03:01.519> from<00:03:01.909> the<00:03:02.000> top

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.950 

right<00:03:16.060> there<00:03:16.300> all<00:03:16.630> I<00:03:16.690> did<00:03:16.870> was<00:03:17.050> go<00:03:17.440> from<00:03:17.680> there

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
right there all I did was go from there

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
first part so let me show you that again

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.380 
first part so let me show you that again
as<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.640> play

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:55.750 

you

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.460 

then<00:03:56.760> car<00:03:57.000> goes<00:03:57.240> right<00:03:57.360> there<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:57.960> now<00:03:58.170> it<00:03:58.440> is

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
then car goes right there and now it is

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.170 
then car goes right there and now it is
a<00:03:58.680> card<00:03:59.100> which<00:03:59.340> is<00:03:59.490> where<00:03:59.700> we<00:03:59.790> go<00:03:59.910> to<00:03:59.940> the

a card which is where we go to the

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.020 
a card which is where we go to the
change<00:04:00.480> so<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.650> next<00:04:02.190> card<00:04:02.430> we're<00:04:02.610> going<00:04:02.850> to

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
change so this next card we're going to

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:11.390 
change so this next card we're going to
is<00:04:03.240> uh<00:04:04.280> is<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.670> major<00:04:05.970> 7<00:04:06.570> e<00:04:06.750> major<00:04:07.260> 9<00:04:10.070> left<00:04:11.070> and

is uh is a major 7 e major 9 left and
the<00:04:11.550> left<00:04:11.730> hand<00:04:11.940> we<00:04:12.030> have<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.270> eat<00:04:12.510> on<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.990> base

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
the left hand we have to eat on the base

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:21.250 
the left hand we have to eat on the base
right<00:04:15.270> hand<00:04:15.540> we<00:04:15.660> have<00:04:15.690> a<00:04:15.840> g-shock<00:04:17.209> be<00:04:18.800> d<00:04:19.800> sharp

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.020 
right hand we have a g-shock be d sharp
F<00:04:22.260> sharp

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.930 

in<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.390> next<00:04:28.600> card<00:04:28.930> after<00:04:29.110> that<00:04:29.410> would<00:04:29.590> be<00:04:29.770> a
