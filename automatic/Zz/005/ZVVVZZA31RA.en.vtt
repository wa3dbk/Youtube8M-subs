00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.110
 low simone a luxury friendly with 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.119
 the Saint Victor excellent result 11 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.790
 which nevertheless bodes well for a good one 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:17.150
 beginning of this trapani if I think it is 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.289
 It was a good training test 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.179
 personally make a little for the phallus 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.769
 from rigor because he was good at 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:29.279
 then hook up to get the rigor 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.990
 but okay this has nothing to do with it 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.720
 I think we did a very good one 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.449
 performance in the sense that we have 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.890
 tried to do what in these 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.280
 five days we tried it in 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.769
 training, however, are summer friendly 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.930
 therefore they give you self-confidence but confidence 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.690
 nothing starts again tomorrow because 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.000
 our goal the championship sites 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.769
 from Liguria to play against the sampdoria vi 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.119
 never played against the samp 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:01:00.199
 the first time as a fan from sun doriano 

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:04.140
 it was a particular emotion 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.780
 but then when the whistle leaves 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.820
 start goes off all season of 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.890
 drills how started this pickup thing 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.890
 think of this team as it is 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.429
 working the coach we are working 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.350
 well under the physical aspect below 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:25.200
 the tactical aspect we still have so much 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.579
 to do, however, the fact that the new ones 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.409
 the old are made available 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.450
 we are trying to get them integrated into 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.210
 as short as possible 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.310
 we are trying to make him understand that 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.710
 to be in drills 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.970
 it is an important square and it is above all 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.890
 an Easter family with drills not 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.710
 start this adventure again with you 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.630
 finding in retreat here has when 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.159
 very well I start a new one anyway 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.679
 adventure after four years spent at 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.200
 Terni and positive truth I have 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.490
 immediately integrated well with the boys with 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.350
 the team mates that made me 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.149
 feel immediately at home then also 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.520
 last warehouse workers with all the staff 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.170
 technician so I'm happy and am 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.549
 load for this new adventure that 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.590
 company which environment you found 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.209
 however a family because it is true 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.190
 how much a family say pentacoli e 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.660
 true sense of the word in fact all me 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.340
 they welcomed the match at 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.680
 captain place that I stay in the room with him 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.660
 but also the other boys who above all 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.590
 on the same side, so I am 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.870
 found immediately well 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.140
 where this trapani can arrive 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.430
 target your personal team 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.670
 my personal goal which you are looking for 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.230
 continuity to play as much as possible 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.519
 that's what's coming in this league 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.049
 of the team I think it's the first 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.010
 objective then that of salvation 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.170
 what is all earned 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.019
 because in the end we are a small one 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.030
 a reality that, however, knows how it does its thing 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.700
 so let's try to keep our heads down 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.329
 without creating pindaric flights and therefore 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.799
 let's try to stay with everyone 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.530
 feet on the ground and what comes 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.480
 however, everything is earned 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.609
 specifically the game today 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.720
 with the sampdoria 1 1 time the team of 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.040
 series to a good result anyway 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.200
 good test because we faced one 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.270
 team that already and from work from 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.280
 15 18 days because I support the first one 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.350
 July could have been ahead of us 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.970
 of preparation on the 30 prepare this 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.310
 important game that we have then 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.960
 it was a good test for us and i guess 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.430
 having dealt with sales we have 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.600
 faced everyone well with the right 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.280
 spirit and with the right desire to 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.810
 play the ball and we also put it 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.040
 at times in difficulty we could win 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.210
 how could we lose but in the end yes 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.550
 they enjoyed it because it was one 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.840
 game anyway we gave it all 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.740
 and we tried anyway to do the 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.740
 things the coach asked us
