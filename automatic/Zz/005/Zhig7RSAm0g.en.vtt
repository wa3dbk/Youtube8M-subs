00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
now on the Nexus 4 is a little bit

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.460 
now on the Nexus 4 is a little bit
different<00:01:56.040> story<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:57.150> go<00:01:57.299> into<00:01:57.479> battery

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
different story if we go into battery

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.830 
different story if we go into battery
and<00:01:58.770> we<00:01:59.580> check<00:01:59.760> out<00:01:59.970> my<00:02:00.090> battery<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.570> see

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
and we check out my battery you can see

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.780 
and we check out my battery you can see
screen<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.320> time<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.979> were<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.189> 22<00:02:02.580> minutes

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
screen on time and I were in 22 minutes

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.990 
screen on time and I were in 22 minutes
and<00:02:03.530> sixty-four<00:02:04.530> percent<00:02:04.650> and<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.460> six

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
and sixty-four percent and it's a six

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
hours 19 minutes off the charger I'm

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.410 
hours 19 minutes off the charger I'm
feeling<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.790> the<00:02:08.910> same<00:02:09.119> amount<00:02:09.239> of

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
feeling like it's the same amount of

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.940 
feeling like it's the same amount of
battery<00:02:09.750> as<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.140> was<00:02:10.290> before<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.830> update

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
battery as it was before the update

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.130 
battery as it was before the update
which<00:02:11.670> unfortunately<00:02:11.970> wasn't<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.870> great

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
which unfortunately wasn't that great

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.810 
which unfortunately wasn't that great
but<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.560> wasn't<00:02:13.860> horrible<00:02:14.040> for<00:02:14.430> me<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.549> could

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
but it wasn't horrible for me I could

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.720 
but it wasn't horrible for me I could

the<00:02:52.040> LTE<00:02:52.430> capabilities<00:02:53.770> hopefully<00:02:54.770> or<00:02:54.950> maybe

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
the LTE capabilities hopefully or maybe

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.910 
the LTE capabilities hopefully or maybe
some<00:02:55.640> developers<00:02:56.060> since<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.600> was<00:02:56.860> disabled<00:02:57.860> by

some developers since it was disabled by
a<00:02:58.010> software<00:02:58.520> tweak<00:02:58.730> can<00:02:59.540> be<00:02:59.660> re-enabled

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
a software tweak can be re-enabled

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.470 
a software tweak can be re-enabled
through<00:03:00.950> software<00:03:01.280> tweak<00:03:01.610> or<00:03:01.820> you<00:03:02.180> can<00:03:02.330> roll

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
through software tweak or you can roll

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.230 
through software tweak or you can roll
back<00:03:02.950> possibly<00:03:03.950> using<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.370> older<00:03:04.640> radio<00:03:04.970> so

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
back possibly using the older radio so

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.540 
back possibly using the older radio so
it<00:03:05.360> just<00:03:05.540> still<00:03:05.720> work<00:03:05.930> hopefully<00:03:06.350> so<00:03:07.220> if

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
it just still work hopefully so if

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.400 
it just still work hopefully so if
you're<00:03:07.760> using<00:03:08.000> LTE<00:03:08.540> right<00:03:08.840> now<00:03:08.990> and<00:03:09.260> you

this update in general would be the

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.150 
this update in general would be the
colors<00:03:20.420> seem<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.810> be<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.960> little<00:03:21.080> bit<00:03:21.260> deeper<00:03:21.650> it

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
grays in these settings seemed deeper to

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
they might have tweaked the colors a

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.970 
they might have tweaked the colors a
little<00:03:41.000> bit<00:03:41.209> but<00:03:42.170> that's<00:03:42.230> pretty<00:03:42.440> much<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.650> for

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980
