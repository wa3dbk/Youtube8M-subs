Title : Itsuka
Original songs of artists : Yuzu
cover by Shiggy H

00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:41.511
When the winds on the street starts to turn chilly

00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:48.871
It makes me worry about you who easily catches a cold

00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:56.071
When the smell of winter starts flowing through me

00:00:56.071 --> 00:01:04.311
Thoughts of meeting you starts to surface in my mind...

00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:11.911
In the midst of hurt, struggling

00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:28.791
We dream of seeing tomorrow and carry on living

00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:36.231
Someday if you're feeling helplessly lonely again

00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:43.831
I'll rush to your side no matter where I am or what I'm doing

00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:51.271
Let's cast aside all common speeches

00:01:51.271 --> 00:02:01.191
When you, a person who doesn't want anything, is here    That's my everything

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:19.911
I wonder if it'll snow this year?

00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:27.271
Those days of being soaked while playing in the snow

00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:35.191
Pure white snowflakes falls and accumulates

00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:43.751
Wonder if it'll surround everything...

00:02:43.751 --> 00:02:51.351
In confusions In failures

00:02:51.351 --> 00:03:07.991
We look back upon yesterday, continuing on our way

00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:15.351
Someday if you're feeling helplessly lonely again

00:03:15.351 --> 00:03:23.031
I'll rush to your side no matter where I am or what I'm doing

00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:30.391
Let's cast aside all common speeches

00:03:30.391 --> 00:03:39.751
When you, a person who doesn't want anything, is here    That's my everything

00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:41.991
Wo, ho-ho-ho-

00:03:41.991 --> 00:03:56.551
People don't face up to the most important things

00:03:56.551 --> 00:04:11.751
Even if I'd probably end up all alone, it doesn't matter anymore

00:04:13.191 --> 00:04:20.951
Someday if the waves decide to carry you away

00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:28.071
I will use all my strength to protect you

00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:35.511
Even when the rapid passing of time lets one see nothing

00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:43.111
When you, a person who doesn't want anything, is here    That's my everything

00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:47.351
Even as I embrace insecurities     Battered by grief

00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:52.471
Trials of beliefs

00:04:52.471 --> 00:05:04.391
I will thinking of you as I continue to sing this song    Because that is 

00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:13.431
my everything
