00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.770
 hello everybody, let's talk one 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.320
 weather conditions in 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.349
 saints in the people had there the fall of the airplane 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.230
 carrying and falling that carried the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.390
 candidate for president of eduardo campos 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.730
 We're going to fall, we'll tell you one 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.470
 weather conditions that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.390
 were present at the site the first to 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.029
 people show off camera 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.070
 a live kiss showing there a long time ago 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.590
 presence of some rain of intensity 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.540
 Moderate rain 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.059
 no forecast there was a lot of rain 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.280
 strong and according to information 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.719
 visuals as well as information 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.670
 two airports 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.850
 we can see it here on radar 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.890
 we see some rain 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.230
 moderate intensity circulating in the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.940
 region mainly in the east range 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.890
 organization of these areas of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.739
 instability that ended up coming with 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.480
 the advancement of this cold front is right 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.500
 Good. Let's start by talking about the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.199
 conditions there at the time of the accident 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.270
 we had and in the heavens before saints ne 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.700
 being registered well we have there 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.010
 presence of rain in the second 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.350
 metal metal information shows here 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.009
 For us the presence of this rain to people 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.689
 you can see here that indicates the 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.840
 presence of rainfall with 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.729
 moderate even a re that shows 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.060
 For us the presence of this rain 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.229
 during the course of this fourth 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.909
 today is correct 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.860
 Well, we've got it too. 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.470
 other information here that the information 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.020
 of overcast and also doubled those 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.200
 information on the show for us the ceiling is 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.470
 of the cloudiness is how much I 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.250
 had and cloud base is in the region 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.220
 that's right 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.579
 there are two forms is the main there 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.680
 people are having unfavorable conditions 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.170
 during the passage of the airplane is right 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.270
 may even influence the fall is 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.189
 We have a lot of people there. 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.990
 wind does not require shear 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.160
 wind can end up causing 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.349
 condition the highest R &amp; D 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.349
 atmospheric instability but this 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.860
 generally reported by the airport . 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.350
 cons 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.620
 the wsj fills you have the presence 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.360
 this condition is that it ends up 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.550
 favoring a plane crash was not what 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.950
 happened in saints is right in saints 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.070
 we had a low ceiling condition 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.260
 The low ceiling can influence the airplane. 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.220
 to have to assault what is the 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.480
 airplane is right 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.000
 many times when we do not find 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.280
 favorable conditions for the landing of the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.890
 plane had just rising again is 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.380
 it is a process of the plane swoop 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.180
 It's okay, and we have it in good condition. 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.310
 low ceiling and this can harm 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.920
 because you do not know where you are and the base 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.280
 of the cloud and where is the ground where you 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.540
 has the surface of the earth is right 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.370
 we had in ceiling condition a 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.890
 little lower okay if you can see 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.870
 information of the metal including the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.000
 Visibility reduction visibility 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.950
 horizontal was rather abrupt, 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.700
 people were with the 3000 meters there 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.950
 is 10 o'clock in the morning and the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.870
 11 hours we have already passed the 2 thousand 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.930
 meters are right and we still have the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.700
 presence of this moderate rainfall in this area 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.070
 It's just a little bit of progress. 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.930
 can see there that the presence in our 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.970
 radio polling station airport 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.340
 Mars is closer than we have 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.010
 Dodo de santos, do not we see these 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.730
 two curves close enough to one of the 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.980
 others 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.650
 it is not the presence of this 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.570
 of these curves showing the temperature 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.890
 est dew point temperature is 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.260
 That's when we have these two 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.880
 curves very close and means that 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.650
 I have a pretty layer a descent 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.410
 this favors the formation of cloudiness 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.720
 I have the presence of my 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.830
 series of my condensation core by 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.630
 survey is about 900 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.880
 890 pascals that is approximately 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.519
 thousand kilometers in relation to 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.489
 surface rate this shows how low 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:05.510
 I had and of the conditions therein of the 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.510
 my cloudiness
