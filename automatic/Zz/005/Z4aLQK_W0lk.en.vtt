00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
made thermal creations now I've used the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.320 
made thermal creations now I've used the
old<00:00:21.720> oh<00:00:22.160> now<00:00:23.160> I've<00:00:23.340> used<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.699> old<00:00:23.880> one<00:00:24.119> for

about a year now maybe a year and a half
it's<00:00:27.000> worked<00:00:27.300> fairly<00:00:27.750> well<00:00:27.960> but<00:00:28.439> what<00:00:28.650> I've

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
it's worked fairly well but what I've

it's worked fairly well but what I've
noticed<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.250> past<00:00:29.460> three<00:00:29.789> months<00:00:30.029> or<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.300> is

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
noticed the past three months or so is

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.849 
noticed the past three months or so is
that<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.869> has<00:00:31.080> been<00:00:31.320> leaving<00:00:31.439> my<00:00:31.650> hair<00:00:31.830> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
that it has been leaving my hair a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.380 
that it has been leaving my hair a
little<00:00:31.920> bit<00:00:32.070> more<00:00:32.130> dry<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.669> frizzy<00:00:32.910> than<00:00:33.270> it

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
little bit more dry and frizzy than it

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.630 
little bit more dry and frizzy than it
normally<00:00:33.570> would<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.890> I'm<00:00:35.070> glad<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.309> Tros

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
normally would so I'm glad that Tros

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.830

mate<00:00:35.820> did<00:00:35.969> come<00:00:36.149> out<00:00:36.270> with<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> new<00:00:36.570> platinum

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
mate did come out with the new platinum

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.270 
mate did come out with the new platinum
straight<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.739> try<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
straight so that you can try that and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.770 
straight so that you can try that and
see<00:00:38.309> if<00:00:38.430> that's<00:00:38.640> gonna<00:00:38.790> work<00:00:39.000> better<00:00:39.270> well<00:00:39.660> I

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
see if that's gonna work better well I

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.240 
see if that's gonna work better well I
already<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.110> both<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> products<00:00:40.950> at<00:00:41.100> my

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
already have both the products at my

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.700 
already have both the products at my
hair<00:00:41.460> right<00:00:41.700> now<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.149> dried<00:00:43.079> my<00:00:43.230> hair<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.649> I

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
hair right now I dried my hair and I

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.380 
hair right now I dried my hair and I
straightened<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.280> using<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> old<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.360> on

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
straightened it using the old one on

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.150 
straightened it using the old one on
this<00:00:45.690> side<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.260> new<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.950> side

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
this side and the new one on this side

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.090 
this side and the new one on this side
so<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.820> be<00:00:48.000> easier<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.510> compare

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
so that it be easier to compare

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.410 
so that it be easier to compare
surprisingly<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.219> could<00:00:50.730> tell<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> difference

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
surprisingly I could tell a difference

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.910 
surprisingly I could tell a difference
with<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> Platinum<00:00:52.020> strengths<00:00:52.320> already<00:00:52.649> when

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
with the Platinum strengths already when

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.950 
with the Platinum strengths already when
I<00:00:53.010> was<00:00:53.129> drying<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:54.149> was<00:00:54.360> softer<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
I was drying it it was softer to the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.689 
I was drying it it was softer to the
touch<00:00:55.079> when<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.620> was<00:00:55.710> running<00:00:56.160> my<00:00:56.250> fingers

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
touch when I was running my fingers

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490 
touch when I was running my fingers
through<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.360> could<00:00:57.539> tell<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.780> my<00:00:57.989> fingertips

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
through it I could tell on my fingertips

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.709 
through it I could tell on my fingertips
on<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.920> side<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.250> they<00:00:59.370> were<00:00:59.399> softer<00:01:00.059> also

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
on this side that they were softer also

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.990 
on this side that they were softer also
after<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.350> straightened<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.430> noticed<00:01:02.940> that

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
after I straightened it I noticed that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.719 
after I straightened it I noticed that
my<00:01:03.239> hair<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> lot<00:01:03.960> more<00:01:04.110> lightweight<00:01:04.729> there

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
my hair is a lot more lightweight there

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.670 
my hair is a lot more lightweight there
weren't<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.090> many<00:01:06.240> flyaways<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.439> less

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
weren't as many flyaways and it's less

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.469 
weren't as many flyaways and it's less
frizzy<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.670> side<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> platinum

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
frizzy on this side with the platinum

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.450 
frizzy on this side with the platinum
strength<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> old<00:01:10.320> thermal<00:01:10.920> creation

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
strength and the old thermal creation

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.160 
strength and the old thermal creation
side<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.270> definitely<00:01:12.510> think<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
side so I definitely think that the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.960 
side so I definitely think that the
platinum<00:01:13.530> strength<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> step<00:01:14.610> up<00:01:14.760> from<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
platinum strength is a step up from the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.630 
platinum strength is a step up from the
old<00:01:15.090> one<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.780> love<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.439> far<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.100> only<00:01:17.340> cons

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
old one I love it so far the only cons

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.340 
old one I love it so far the only cons
that<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.000> would<00:01:18.210> say<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.140> dollar

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
that I would say is that it's a dollar

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.590 
that I would say is that it's a dollar
30<00:01:19.710> more<00:01:20.040> than<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.580> old<00:01:20.759> one<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.210> older<00:01:21.479> one

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
30 more than the old one the older one

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.740 
30 more than the old one the older one
is<00:01:21.750> 399<00:01:22.439> at<00:01:22.590> Target<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.580> new<00:01:23.729> one<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:23.970> 429

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
is 399 at Target and the new one is 429

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.870 
is 399 at Target and the new one is 429
but<00:01:25.409> honestly<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.860> would<00:01:26.189> pay<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.549> difference

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
but honestly I would pay the difference

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.880 
but honestly I would pay the difference
for<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> quality<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.810> you're<00:01:28.200> getting<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
for the quality that you're getting the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.560 
for the quality that you're getting the
one<00:01:29.100> other<00:01:29.340> con<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.820> I'd<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.210> say<00:01:30.390> is

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
one other con that I'd have to say is

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.420 
one other con that I'd have to say is
that<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> scent<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.439> different<00:01:32.009> from<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.280> old

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
that the scent is different from the old

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.850
