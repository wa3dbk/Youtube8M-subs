00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.580
 and gay very good to people that such as 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.799
 you are welcome to a new tutorial 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.150
 on how to make a sand generator 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.810
 automatic and well we are in the snapshot 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:24.330
 14 w 06 p and well let's check how 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.910
 it works to see here or anything 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.160
 chests but if we give it to the lever 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.900
 We see how they are falling and our 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.050
 sand is getting into the chests 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.989
 and well let's stop the right thing and 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.210
 good visit elena in all chests 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.460
 I think it's quite acceptable, not 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.590
 efficiency and good we go with the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.480
 good tutorial good let's start with 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.520
 the circuit that this is a circuit me 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.800
 I love it because it's totally here 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.440
 it is expandable and above is 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.660
 perfect perfect fine here we go to 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.399
 put two pistons mirrors we're going to 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.010
 download a block that is the one that is going 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.930
 to stand our sand and let's give it 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.870
 current to the two pistons of this 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.289
 form is worth and here we are going to join it to the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.289
 current 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.689
 and so perfect 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.740
 and well here we go down four blocks 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.740
 down 2 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.200
 4 here we put our input 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.120
 3 perfect reston antorchitas and here 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.450
 let's form our faith clock and 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.570
 close with the comparator 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.909
 Y 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.650
 so perfect and we join with this part 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.380
 from above perfect people good this already 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.140
 it would be good and here our sand would go 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.760
 If you want to expand it, well do you 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.650
 and put more pistons more reston 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.620
 etcetera is valid but this would already be 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.390
 check it to see how it works 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.909
 good as you see, I think that pretty 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.620
 efficient 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.170
 Lets put 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.230
 here a system to collect the sand 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.560
 let it fall 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.050
 this system to me not one below me 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.600
 love people with a slab to be 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.020
 break the falling sand and put a 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.020
 casket 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.009
 well it works perfectly too 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.230
 It works with 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.380
 blocks pushes bless by pistons that 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.140
 have gravity such as gravel 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.140
 voucher and red sand 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.490
 perfect good I hope that I have 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.420
 liked this tutorial you already know like and 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.420
 Chao favorites
