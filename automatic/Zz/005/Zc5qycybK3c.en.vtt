because when I'm recording if I make

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.850 
because when I'm recording if I make
mistakes<00:01:59.810> I<00:02:00.140> want<00:02:00.289> to<00:02:00.350> start<00:02:00.470> over<00:02:00.619> the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
mistakes I want to start over the

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.059 
mistakes I want to start over the
beginning<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:03.200> do<00:02:03.319> everything<00:02:03.649> one<00:02:03.830> passed

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
beginning so I do everything one passed

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.260 
beginning so I do everything one passed
without<00:02:04.460> without<00:02:05.060> feeling<00:02:05.509> I<00:02:06.759> just<00:02:07.759> find<00:02:07.970> it's

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
without without feeling I just find it's

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.809 
without without feeling I just find it's
faster<00:02:08.630> that<00:02:08.660> way<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.770> he's<00:02:10.220> been<00:02:10.459> I<00:02:10.610> stopped

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
faster that way so he's been I stopped

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.780 
faster that way so he's been I stopped
washing<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.330> get<00:02:11.510> what<00:02:11.599> you'll<00:02:11.750> need<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:13.580> it

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
washing to get what you'll need and it

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.780 
washing to get what you'll need and it
just<00:02:13.970> looked<00:02:14.180> less<00:02:14.390> clumsy<00:02:14.660> I'm<00:02:14.870> like<00:02:15.050> yeah

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
just looked less clumsy I'm like yeah

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.970 
just looked less clumsy I'm like yeah
that's<00:02:16.790> my<00:02:16.970> first<00:02:17.150> time<00:02:17.360> doing<00:02:17.599> this<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.709> so

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
that's my first time doing this and so

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.750 
that's my first time doing this and so
far<00:02:19.220> it's<00:02:19.340> looking<00:02:19.400> pretty<00:02:19.640> well<00:02:19.910> so

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
far it's looking pretty well so

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:33.110 
far it's looking pretty well so
hopefully<00:02:22.760> I<00:02:23.209> won't<00:02:23.360> need<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.750> start<00:02:23.959> over

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.910
