00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 welcome to the appointment with flaps in 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.529
 user of the gadget in the middle of the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.420
 week 22 of October 2014 by now at 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.170
 few days from the arrival of the new ones 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.700
 ipad in stores a little all over the world 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.500
 we are curious about presentables we will do it 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.619
 in the next hours also here on the coach 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.230
 puntetet gadget and news for 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.240
 as for today's day is the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.820
 first he was intrigued by philips and that 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.320
 has launched a new smartphone in China 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.480
 with a screen cure stick waves 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.250
 high level features e 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.000
 for a moment I remembered the philips 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.500
 genius you remember that phone with that 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.420
 microphone that squeezes the little button 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.050
 went down to answer 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.270
 to phone calls 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.700
 the gemini was probably horrendous from the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.219
 aesthetic point of view but had the thing 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.840
 brilliant that the replacement was made 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.610
 directly to your home in case of 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.260
 any kind of difficulty than for 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.030
 then it was something 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.800
 extraordinarily efficient perhaps 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.920
 too happy because he had abandoned 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.030
 very soon the smartphone market 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.460
 who knows maybe these new ones 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.500
 much more powerful smartphones can't 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.110
 arriving even in Europe arrives instead 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.130
 on practically all android products 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.590
 and nokia maps which was previously instead 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.990
 reserved only for the other galaxy then 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.420
 only for some samsung products instead 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.920
 now they are made available 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.290
 for all users we are curious about 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.450
 see what the fate of this will be 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.100
 new map system or better than 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.720
 this review of a system of 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.119
 maps we already know because when 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.079
 had made his debut in the app 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.340
 ios store for iphone was a relative 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.900
 in the last places of the ranking 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.119
 therefore the most important applications 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.579
 He had failed to unleash interest 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.070
 we will see what will happen instead with 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.689
 this version revisited a lot 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.079
 interesting instead I wanted to be 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.640
 I was in high school when I wanted to 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.850
 i was in high school having this app 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.930
 actually the photo ma app 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.149
 an application that was launched 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.219
 just yesterday and that promises 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.280
 simply by using the camera 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.220
 and photographing the text of an equation 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.759
 to give you the solution 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.470
 in real time I never had one 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.630
 great passion for math and 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.070
 even the math for me I would have 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.890
 could finally do some work 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.550
 national teacher who treated me like that 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.740
 bad 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.570
 other curious thing is pompei could 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.190
 also work in other countries 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.000
 out of the united states but only with 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.160
 use of a credit card 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.300
 American countries are not specified 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.310
 I found the news without one 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.340
 country specification will be curious to understand 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.010
 also dub is exactly the system is 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.230
 already functioning, however, the limit is 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.720
 which must be activated through a 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.350
 American credit card and then no 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.420
 only 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.120
 curious the news of panties that are 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.490
 been created with a particular fabric 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.810
 which filters the reactions of yours 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.660
 mobile phone so you can 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.330
 put the phone in your pocket without it 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.490
 take special risks not 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.830
 we will build a gadget to give to 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.150
 radio number one users and not only 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.770
 there is a news to report that of 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.470
 android wear that remains in the new 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.420
 version 4.42 although I remember correctly 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.239
 we are looking into the void for research 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.830
 of the code number brings some 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.480
 novelties for the intelligent management of 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.860
 battery consumption but above all the 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.530
 possibility to download your own 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.630
 music inside and just android were in 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.360
 so that you can also play it 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.160
 when you are not connected, there is 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.280
 also a new series of checks 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.019
 just for music it is also the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.640
 volume control that is now 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.650
 directly from your screen 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.299
 android wear is all about 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.100
 mister gadget and we are later 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.870
 today a presentation of blackberry 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.330
 passport not only later 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.830
 if we do in time of course with 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.989
 all the commitments of the day still 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.360
 presentation of ipad 2 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.650
 we find ourselves as always at 13 e 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.650
 at 8pm on radio number one
