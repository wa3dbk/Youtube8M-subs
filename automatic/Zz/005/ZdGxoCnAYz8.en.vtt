into it topic number one we finally got
to<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.440> place<00:00:49.680> where<00:00:49.950> we<00:00:50.010> were<00:00:50.370> having<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
to the place where we were having the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.330 
to the place where we were having the
time<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.420> investigate<00:00:52.140> properly<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:53.160> is

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
time to investigate properly what is

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.400 
time to investigate properly what is
going<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.149> saving<00:00:54.629> issues<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.230> many

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
going on with the saving issues so many

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.920 
going on with the saving issues so many
people<00:00:55.739> are<00:00:55.890> reporting<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.750> weird

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
people are reporting on and the weird

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.650 
people are reporting on and the weird
part<00:00:58.020> about<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:59.670> didn't<00:01:00.420> get

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
part about it is that we didn't get

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.189 
part about it is that we didn't get
these<00:01:00.930> problems<00:01:01.559> ourselves<00:01:01.850> in<00:01:02.960> normal<00:01:03.960> play

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
these problems ourselves in normal play

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.740 
these problems ourselves in normal play
so<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.220> was<00:01:05.430> obviously<00:01:05.640> people<00:01:06.330> doing

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
so it was obviously people doing

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.600 
so it was obviously people doing
something<00:01:06.900> differently<00:01:07.710> than<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:08.189> were<00:01:08.340> doing

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
something differently than we were doing

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.039 
something differently than we were doing
so<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.150> gotten<00:01:09.420> through<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.840> whole

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
so we have gotten through the whole

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.539 
so we have gotten through the whole
process<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.290> found<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.650> lot<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.310> things

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
process of it and found a lot of things

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.109 
process of it and found a lot of things
that<00:01:15.030> were<00:01:15.270> missing<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.170> not<00:01:16.560> saving<00:01:17.400> if<00:01:17.670> you

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
that were missing and not saving if you

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.840 
that were missing and not saving if you
did<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.960> specific<00:01:19.439> way<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:20.369> instance<00:01:20.700> if

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
did it in a specific way for instance if

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.370 
did it in a specific way for instance if
you<00:01:21.030> really<00:01:21.659> want<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.960> make<00:01:22.110> sure<00:01:22.170> that

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
you really want to make sure that

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.670 
you really want to make sure that
thing's<00:01:22.799> safe<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.729> always<00:01:24.180> need<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.689> test<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
thing's safe you always need to test the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.210 
thing's safe you always need to test the
car<00:01:26.040> or<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> engine<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:28.170> final<00:01:28.680> step<00:01:28.890> only

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
car or the engine in a final step only

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.069 
car or the engine in a final step only
then<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.060> absolutely<00:01:30.240> sure<00:01:30.900> that

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
then you can be absolutely sure that

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.190 
then you can be absolutely sure that
it's<00:01:31.470> saved<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.579> if<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.000> load<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.659> an<00:01:33.780> engine

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
it's saved so if you load in an engine

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.590 
it's saved so if you load in an engine
change<00:01:34.350> something<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.490> even<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
change something and even the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.569 
change something and even the
calculations<00:01:37.590> show<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.189> has<00:01:38.369> been

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
calculations show that it has been

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.330 
calculations show that it has been
accepted<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.509> didn't<00:01:40.170> really<00:01:40.470> save<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.860> so

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
accepted it didn't really save it so

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.539 
accepted it didn't really save it so
that<00:01:42.210> was<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> bummer<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.960> now<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.070> fixed

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
that was a bummer and now we have fixed

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.639 
that was a bummer and now we have fixed
all<00:01:44.700> these<00:01:45.090> things<00:01:45.149> now<00:01:45.659> with<00:01:45.869> every<00:01:46.320> change

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
all these things now with every change

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.219 
all these things now with every change
its<00:01:47.009> track<00:01:47.490> now<00:01:47.820> every<00:01:48.450> change<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.140> is

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
its track now every change it is

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.999 
its track now every change it is
actually<00:01:49.470> saved<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.579> also<00:01:51.290> we<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.710> this

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
little little symbol on top of here so

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.050 
little little symbol on top of here so
how<00:01:56.969> we<00:01:57.030> are<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.020> go<00:01:58.350> about<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.219> not

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
how we are going to go about this is not

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.690 
how we are going to go about this is not

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
sure yet I would like to have an option

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.249 
sure yet I would like to have an option
in<00:02:02.850> there<00:02:03.060> which<00:02:03.299> has<00:02:03.479> been<00:02:03.630> discussed<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
in there which has been discussed in the

in there which has been discussed in the
forum<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.710> lot<00:02:04.860> as<00:02:05.219> well<00:02:05.509> that<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.540> manually

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
forum a lot as well that you manually

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.790 
forum a lot as well that you manually
can<00:02:07.590> save<00:02:07.920> two<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:09.050> we'll<00:02:10.050> see<00:02:10.289> about<00:02:10.410> how

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
can save two and we'll see about how

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.370 
can save two and we'll see about how
difficult<00:02:11.700> or<00:02:11.849> easy<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.810> imply

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
difficult or easy this is to imply

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.270 
difficult or easy this is to imply
but<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.700> will<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.120> course<00:02:15.630> give<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.290> the

but this will of course give you the

still ongoing about saving and we try to
get<00:02:37.440> an<00:02:37.620> optimal<00:02:37.980> solution<00:02:38.040> there<00:02:38.840> alright

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
get an optimal solution there alright

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.890 
get an optimal solution there alright

don't really need to know many of these

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.440 
don't really need to know many of these
numbers<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:04.100> only<00:03:05.100> look<00:03:05.280> at<00:03:05.460> those<00:03:05.700> with<00:03:06.030> blue

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
numbers and only look at those with blue

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.320 
numbers and only look at those with blue
backing<00:03:07.080> but<00:03:07.320> then<00:03:07.560> again<00:03:07.740> then<00:03:08.520> why<00:03:08.760> am<00:03:09.090> i

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
backing but then again then why am i

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.410 
backing but then again then why am i
showing<00:03:09.690> all<00:03:09.990> these<00:03:10.200> numbers<00:03:10.470> anyway<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.640> agree

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
showing all these numbers anyway I agree

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.900 
showing all these numbers anyway I agree
that<00:03:12.450> displaying<00:03:13.380> 240<00:03:14.100> numbers<00:03:14.460> on<00:03:14.700> the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
that displaying 240 numbers on the

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.930 
that displaying 240 numbers on the
screen<00:03:15.120> definitely<00:03:15.750> isn't<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.470> best<00:03:16.710> way<00:03:17.520> to

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
screen definitely isn't the best way to

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.330 
screen definitely isn't the best way to
go<00:03:18.180> about<00:03:18.210> it<00:03:18.450> but<00:03:18.810> many<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.770> suggestions

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
go about it but many of the suggestions

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.670 
go about it but many of the suggestions
were<00:03:20.550> pretty<00:03:20.910> awful<00:03:21.450> too<00:03:21.480> because<00:03:22.140> they<00:03:22.470> would

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
were pretty awful too because they would

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.220 
were pretty awful too because they would
not<00:03:23.520> allow<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.240> view<00:03:24.480> everything<00:03:24.720> you

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
not allow you to view everything you

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.980 
not allow you to view everything you
need<00:03:25.530> in<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:26.400> single<00:03:26.850> screen<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:27.630> that<00:03:27.810> is

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
need in a single screen and that is

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.750 
need in a single screen and that is
really<00:03:28.470> important<00:03:28.950> for<00:03:29.010> what<00:03:29.280> we<00:03:29.430> have<00:03:29.610> in

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
really important for what we have in

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.340 
really important for what we have in
mind<00:03:29.940> here<00:03:30.060> because<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.540> need<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.810> change<00:03:31.140> the

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
mind here because you need to change the

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.710 
mind here because you need to change the
pricing<00:03:31.980> up<00:03:32.100> on<00:03:32.250> top<00:03:32.520> and<00:03:32.760> we<00:03:33.180> want<00:03:33.330> to<00:03:33.480> see<00:03:33.690> the

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
pricing up on top and we want to see the

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.670 
pricing up on top and we want to see the
change<00:03:34.350> across<00:03:34.740> all<00:03:35.070> categories<00:03:35.310> at<00:03:35.970> once<00:03:36.680> so

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
change across all categories at once so

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.230 
change across all categories at once so
how<00:03:38.670> do<00:03:38.730> we<00:03:38.880> fix<00:03:39.420> this<00:03:39.600> well<00:03:40.080> I<00:03:41.209> reshuffle<00:03:42.209> the

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
how do we fix this well I reshuffle the

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.850 
how do we fix this well I reshuffle the
whole<00:03:42.450> thing<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.780> bit<00:03:42.810> but<00:03:43.140> also<00:03:43.320> as<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.620> can

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
whole thing a bit but also as you can

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.420 
whole thing a bit but also as you can
see<00:03:44.040> i<00:03:44.070> made<00:03:44.490> the<00:03:44.670> color<00:03:44.940> stronger<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:46.430> only

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
see i made the color stronger and only

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.900 
see i made the color stronger and only
the<00:03:47.850> top<00:03:48.120> free<00:03:48.570> have<00:03:48.930> full-blown<00:03:49.620> colors<00:03:50.490> for

the top free have full-blown colors for
the<00:03:51.240> text<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:52.130> they<00:03:53.130> are<00:03:53.280> outlined<00:03:53.820> by<00:03:54.120> this

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
the text and they are outlined by this

the text and they are outlined by this
white<00:03:55.560> frame<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.100> then<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.270> rest<00:03:57.480> of<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.840> top

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.540 
white frame and then the rest of the top
10<00:03:58.530> categories<00:03:58.910> are<00:04:00.080> shown<00:04:01.080> with<00:04:01.550> diminished

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
10 categories are shown with diminished

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.230 
10 categories are shown with diminished
strength<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.600> colors<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.550> the<00:04:05.550> rest<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:06.090> it

strength of colors and the rest of it
all<00:04:06.480> they<00:04:06.630> are<00:04:06.660> 60<00:04:07.170> others<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:08.010> numbers<00:04:08.430> are

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
all they are 60 others the numbers are

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.330 
all they are 60 others the numbers are
still<00:04:08.880> there<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:09.510> once<00:04:09.990> you<00:04:10.200> hover<00:04:10.530> above<00:04:11.010> it

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
still there and once you hover above it

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.699 
still there and once you hover above it
which<00:04:11.580> I<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.910> course<00:04:12.090> cannot<00:04:12.480> do<00:04:12.720> in<00:04:12.990> this

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
which I of course cannot do in this

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.800 
which I of course cannot do in this
little<00:04:14.130> mock-up<00:04:14.400> when<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.090> hover<00:04:15.360> over<00:04:15.510> it

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
little mock-up when you hover over it

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.960 
little mock-up when you hover over it
you<00:04:15.959> will<00:04:16.170> get<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.770> numbers<00:04:17.370> shown<00:04:17.609> clearly

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
you will get the numbers shown clearly

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.930 
you will get the numbers shown clearly
but<00:04:18.720> they<00:04:18.870> are<00:04:19.049> not<00:04:19.410> really<00:04:19.830> that<00:04:20.250> visible

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
but they are not really that visible

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.820 
but they are not really that visible
unless<00:04:21.239> you're<00:04:21.690> sitting<00:04:22.049> in<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.260> dark<00:04:22.500> room

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
unless you're sitting in the dark room

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.570 
unless you're sitting in the dark room
and<00:04:22.860> have<00:04:23.340> a<00:04:23.370> good<00:04:23.669> contrast<00:04:24.180> on<00:04:24.330> your<00:04:24.479> monitor

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
and have a good contrast on your monitor

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.029 
and have a good contrast on your monitor
so<00:04:25.840> overall<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:26.870> think<00:04:27.110> there's<00:04:27.530> this<00:04:27.680> much

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
so overall I think there's this much

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.179 
so overall I think there's this much
clearer<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:28.930> should<00:04:29.930> solve<00:04:30.379> the<00:04:30.620> issue<00:04:30.800> of

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:31.189 
clearer and should solve the issue of

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:34.059 
clearer and should solve the issue of
getting<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:31.789> cancer<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:32.569> be<00:04:33.139> very<00:04:33.439> helpful<00:04:33.680> so

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.069 
getting I cancer and be very helpful so

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.129 
getting I cancer and be very helpful so
now<00:04:34.250> you<00:04:34.310> have<00:04:34.430> everything<00:04:35.150> in<00:04:35.270> view<00:04:35.449> and<00:04:35.780> you

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
now you have everything in view and you

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.520 
now you have everything in view and you
can<00:04:36.319> change<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.949> price<00:04:37.189> on<00:04:37.400> top<00:04:37.580> or<00:04:37.759> the

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
can change the price on top or the

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.969 
can change the price on top or the
different<00:04:39.530> regions<00:04:39.949> and<00:04:41.139> see<00:04:42.139> what<00:04:42.590> changes

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
different regions and see what changes

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.059 
different regions and see what changes
in<00:04:43.550> real<00:04:43.849> time<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.659> how<00:04:45.319> the<00:04:45.379> categories

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:46.069 
in real time and how the categories

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.610 
in real time and how the categories
shift<00:04:46.509> also<00:04:47.509> I've<00:04:47.659> been<00:04:47.900> doing<00:04:48.259> a<00:04:48.409> little

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
shift also I've been doing a little

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.010 
shift also I've been doing a little
reading<00:04:48.949> as<00:04:49.639> you<00:04:49.759> can<00:04:49.909> see<00:04:50.150> here<00:04:50.479> i<00:04:50.629> put<00:04:50.840> the

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
reading as you can see here i put the

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.499 
reading as you can see here i put the
off-road<00:04:51.620> section<00:04:52.069> all<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:52.610> way<00:04:52.759> towards<00:04:53.060> the

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
off-road section all the way towards the

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.499 
off-road section all the way towards the
utility<00:04:54.169> section<00:04:54.710> on<00:04:54.919> the<00:04:54.979> left<00:04:55.759> hand<00:04:56.419> side

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
utility section on the left hand side

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.439 
utility section on the left hand side
while<00:04:57.379> the<00:04:57.409> luxury<00:04:58.219> stuff<00:04:58.550> and<00:04:58.819> sports<00:04:59.180> stuff

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
while the luxury stuff and sports stuff

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.059 
while the luxury stuff and sports stuff
is<00:04:59.599> on<00:04:59.780> the<00:04:59.900> right-hand<00:05:00.110> side<00:05:00.409> I<00:05:00.740> think<00:05:00.949> this

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:01.069 
is on the right-hand side I think this

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:03.869 
is on the right-hand side I think this
overall<00:05:01.520> isn't<00:05:02.060> much<00:05:02.180> better<00:05:02.389> set<00:05:03.199> up<00:05:03.229> a

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:03.879 
overall isn't much better set up a

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:07.180 
overall isn't much better set up a

variant<00:05:07.729> I<00:05:07.879> think<00:05:08.360> it's<00:05:08.539> much<00:05:09.139> closer<00:05:09.500> to<00:05:09.710> an

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
variant I think it's much closer to an

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.700 
variant I think it's much closer to an
optimal<00:05:10.460> solution<00:05:11.360> than<00:05:11.719> the<00:05:12.050> preview<00:05:12.469> on<00:05:12.560> the

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
optimal solution than the preview on the

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849 
game which wasn't planned let's to

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.420 
game which wasn't planned let's to
finish<00:05:47.210> it<00:05:47.330> off<00:05:47.509> faster<00:05:48.199> and<00:05:48.379> to<00:05:49.039> a<00:05:49.069> higher

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
finish it off faster and to a higher

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.149 
finish it off faster and to a higher
standard<00:05:49.879> of<00:05:50.240> quality<00:05:50.629> as<00:05:51.229> we<00:05:51.440> always<00:05:51.650> strive

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
standard of quality as we always strive

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.930 
standard of quality as we always strive
to<00:05:52.400> do<00:05:52.810> so<00:05:53.810> next<00:05:54.409> week<00:05:54.589> already<00:05:54.979> we<00:05:55.219> are<00:05:55.250> joined

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
to do so next week already we are joined

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.079 
to do so next week already we are joined
by<00:05:56.120> at<00:05:56.990> least<00:05:57.259> part<00:05:57.770> time<00:05:57.860> by<00:05:58.370> new<00:05:58.550> programmer

00:05:59.079 --> 00:05:59.089 
by at least part time by new programmer

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:02.829 
by at least part time by new programmer
and<00:05:59.360> that<00:06:00.169> will<00:06:00.379> be<00:06:00.529> helping<00:06:01.009> us<00:06:01.129> a<00:06:01.580> lot<00:06:01.639> and<00:06:02.330> he

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:02.839 
and that will be helping us a lot and he

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:06.070 
and that will be helping us a lot and he
is<00:06:02.930> primarily<00:06:03.589> going<00:06:04.069> to<00:06:04.219> look<00:06:04.400> into<00:06:05.080> getting

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
is primarily going to look into getting

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.050 
is primarily going to look into getting
the<00:06:06.919> game<00:06:07.690> compatible<00:06:08.690> to<00:06:09.229> the<00:06:10.159> Unreal<00:06:10.729> Engine

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
the game compatible to the Unreal Engine

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.790 
the game compatible to the Unreal Engine
so<00:06:12.050> that<00:06:12.529> we<00:06:12.710> can<00:06:13.029> port<00:06:14.029> it<00:06:14.180> over<00:06:14.360> without<00:06:14.800> much

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
so that we can port it over without much

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.480 
so that we can port it over without much
of<00:06:16.009> a<00:06:16.430> problem<00:06:17.029> once<00:06:17.990> we<00:06:18.650> arrive<00:06:19.009> at<00:06:19.039> that

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
of a problem once we arrive at that

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.719 
of a problem once we arrive at that
point

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
point

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:22.730 
point
there's<00:06:21.240> a<00:06:21.360> lot<00:06:21.539> of<00:06:21.569> testing<00:06:22.469> to<00:06:22.589> be<00:06:22.620> done

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
there's a lot of testing to be done

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.640 
there's a lot of testing to be done
first<00:06:23.339> and<00:06:23.550> we<00:06:23.969> cannot<00:06:24.419> afford<00:06:24.599> to<00:06:25.110> do<00:06:25.620> this

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
first and we cannot afford to do this

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.010 
first and we cannot afford to do this
testing<00:06:26.430> by<00:06:26.610> ourselves<00:06:26.819> because<00:06:27.569> that<00:06:27.809> would

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
testing by ourselves because that would

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.350 
testing by ourselves because that would
delay<00:06:28.409> game<00:06:28.860> development<00:06:29.249> quite<00:06:29.789> a<00:06:29.819> bit<00:06:30.089> which

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
delay game development quite a bit which

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.499 
delay game development quite a bit which
we<00:06:30.569> don't<00:06:30.689> what<00:06:30.960> we<00:06:31.889> are<00:06:32.219> getting<00:06:32.789> delayed<00:06:33.240> by

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:33.509 
we don't what we are getting delayed by

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:36.799 
we don't what we are getting delayed by
everything<00:06:34.080> else<00:06:34.439> already<00:06:34.860> some<00:06:35.809> getting

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:36.809 
everything else already some getting

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:38.659 
everything else already some getting
something<00:06:37.020> on<00:06:37.169> top<00:06:37.319> of<00:06:37.379> that<00:06:37.589> wouldn't<00:06:38.009> be<00:06:38.430> too
