 little bit hoarse I apologize I'm not 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.520
 making an effort for me 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.170
 listen because I want to scream but something 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.080
 so typical when you use one and I know and 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.150
 screamed but here I am bringing this 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.150

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.770
 well let's start with our skin 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.260
 I'm going to use this base today 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.570
 by laura mercier with this first theme 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.310
 that helps me correct redness and 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.950
 It is also perfect for skins 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.440
 brunettes I will blur well and I will go 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.070
 creating the layers to have a maximum 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.170
 coverage after I blew it away I'm going to 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.120
 apply the concealer but today I 'm going to 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.550
 do different I'm going to place the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.470
 orange and that maybelline because 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.350
 because I tell them that I have dark circles 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.760
 of horrible vampire then the orange 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.120
 helps me correct 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.070
 those dark shades and over 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.640
 placed the maybelline and lit it with 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.160
 the viura and blender to have a maximum 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.860
 a maximum coverage and I'll accept it 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.050
 with that mccain powder is very light and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.660
 velvety so that it lasts longer 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.940
 during the day and I did not form lines 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.640
 I do not open the corrector, but while 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.220
 he acts and I leave him there a little while I go 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.170
 to do the outline quickly in everything 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.570
 my face with the tanned powder 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.909
 and I'm also going to outline my nose with 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.939
 the same powder and under the lip to 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.850
 create more depth then I will remove 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.549
 the excess dust that had applied what 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.940
 diffused and distributed in the rest of the 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.990
 face to seal my makeup 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.020
 remember that all products are 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.610

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.909

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.819
 with my eyes and I'm going to do it with 20 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.680
 ricky that is this cream shadow for 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.349

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.299
 start applying the colors I'm going to 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.150
 use this mineralized powder of 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.099
 angel in the eyebrow bone to create 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.370
 lighting and I'm going to make up the 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.410
 eyebrows quickly behind cameras for 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.349
 continue with the tanned powder in the 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.060
 part of the basin and go creating 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:34.209
 dimension and transition in colors 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.280
 that we are going to use I am going to mix these 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.849
 two tones this coral and that as pink 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.720
 cake on the eyelid to achieve that 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.510
 super cute pastel coral tone in all my 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.310
 party he blurred it with little touches later 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.890

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.950

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.319
 coppery and I'll do it in all the 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.489
 basin to go creating degrade of the 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.620
 colors 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.819
 I retouch a little bit the part of the 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.579
 eyelid with the same colors 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.160
 above and I'm going to apply the powder 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.390
 illuminated in the part of the cream to 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.390
 create that point of light 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.600
 then I'm going to make a well-attached line 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.680
 to the eyelashes with this brown pencil and the 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:23.900
 I will blur with my pencil type brush 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:26.090
 to create that smoky and natural line 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.400
 and he quickly placed my eyelashes 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.409
