00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.160
 Welcome to a new with 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.199
 video of me 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.020
 Today it's back in fashion by rhi 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.689
 but even failed or otherwise 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.119
 something to one of the robots so um 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.160
 such a motto with the different types 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.199
 are and that given her everything 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.820
 first you have to invite you down 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.600
 here on the same page as the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.710
 last video 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.570
 who saw this and that is here 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.300
 model or do you need that once 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.059
 Here is this packed file and her 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.989
 needs just the mod and two elements 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.870
 Just download arrows Peter 1.8 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.780
 so have you done these two now? 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.870
 packed files and what does that do with it 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.800
 now here is procession ap the tr 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.010
 percent 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.609
 Certainly some of you can 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.769
 and then there is a point here 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.710
 minecraft folder you go on it but 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.030
 on bin and here are these minecraft files 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.189
 you just open with a 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.220
 But I am more massive with myself 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.630
 is left to itself as well as all 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.970
 first you have to be a meter in 4 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.380
 that's been here with me 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.119
 not written with all for 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.820
 just delete it if it should be there 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.229
 Next , opened the motto and pulls 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.299
 all files here about the service though 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.650
 soon has been installed and 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.820
 therefore the motto already installed 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.479
 just have to coat or take you 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:39.210
 swat and does exactly the same 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.000
 so everything just pulls over here 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.740
 purely so that's the motto 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.299
 installed that was just totally 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.570
 simply, each of you would have to 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.520
 manage and therefore see ourselves as we 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.299
 are now in the me now on the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.860
 old i also have no matter where you are 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.149
 currently the weather is already prepared 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.040
 proudly declare 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.350
 and there is still a pc behind 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.740
 the child may village some of you 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.950
 Seen yes that visit very good 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.720
 test object just look like this 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.520
 First we have to get this 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.800
 different 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:18.270
 yes because species staples for how to 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.920
 small forces have it easy 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.270
 you in the player and picked up then comes 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.800
 above fear travel block 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.230
 but we take it now 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.550
 Example like paula then comes here like this 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.800
 what is unfortunately invisible 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.600
 that is still a bug but you are in 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.750
 that means you see it then 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.150
 already that does not matter now 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:43.770
 this little yet invisible here only 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:46.830
 These exercises are visible tell her 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:51.420
 you see, now we take that 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:58.680
 again and again, and coal is also 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:00.930
 invisible and here and here and now 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:06.660
 last but not least snowballs 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:08.100
 so the different types tinkered and 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.120
 Now I can tell you indeed times show what 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.380
 all can do 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.910
 Of course we still need one 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.910
 bow h 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.840
 ok it now next to the bow in your hand 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.870
 and now for example if the 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.200
 show explosive arrows want to show 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.200
 I'll give you one 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.980
 's currently 1:18 that one of 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.910
 must aim or can then flies 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.380
 all nice and thick air 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.610
 oh yes that's nice 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.290
 it was natural that does of course 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.280
 really fun if you are so in here 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:55.740
 can smell the air 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:57.750
 and then there's the fire out there 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.550
 So they were explained again 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.490
 the just exploding for it 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.340
 So you need like gunpowder for 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.940
 the flash longer you need diamond around 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.070
 when crafting dingsda comes then 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.530
 holdings the sticks in company 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:18.870
 feathers under then the man then 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:23.390
 the first lightning happens 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.770
 Air is actually cool and then 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.070
 Take out the sow and then there's 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.060
 still 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.500
 I do not know what's coming now that is 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.480
 the feudinger the easy catch to 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.370
 you need a burn for that 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.160
 to take coal the coal takes another 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.600
 above 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.640
 So everything really has to be funny 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.720
 admit 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.010
 ok and now there are still ice 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.250
 come for you snowballs also 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.720
 does upstairs 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.580
 Aha 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.470
 These are the ones I know 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.979
 However, the consumption is yes and there 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.750
 comes back out there then actual 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.979
 unnecessary but that is a little joke in 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.840
 this length board has good so that 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:10.700
 one eggs and now for the last one for 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.070
 the eislinger actually happens like that 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.180
 there was the matter 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.560
 so nothing great now that's what 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.330
 your water until the example if 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.350
 If you are maybe here now 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.030
 still taken water 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.010
 if you stand here now and to 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:30.450
 after all, want and can have no frankness 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:32.400
 you do this and this is you 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.860
 simply on the streets without stopping 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.520
 left side 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.169
 the practice is whether the package is already off 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.699
 well so villages can be destroyed and 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.849
 Everything is actually a cool mod with 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:47.469
 different types and have indeed 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.469
 create a video they failed and
