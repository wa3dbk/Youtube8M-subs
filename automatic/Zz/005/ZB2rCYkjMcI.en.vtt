00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.690 
have three kids come on guys let's go
we've<00:00:42.300> got<00:00:42.570> Adam<00:00:43.050> who's<00:00:43.230> 13<00:00:43.739> we've<00:00:44.489> got

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
we've got Adam who's 13 we've got

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.790 
we've got Adam who's 13 we've got
Michael<00:00:45.059> who's<00:00:45.239> 10<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.870> Chloe<00:00:46.170> who's<00:00:46.440> seven

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
so it's busy but I guess the typical day

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.779 
so it's busy but I guess the typical day
would<00:00:49.260> involve<00:00:49.680> me<00:00:50.010> taking<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.430> kids<00:00:50.640> to
