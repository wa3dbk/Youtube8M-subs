hey everyone we're here testing out the

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.369

arma 2 operation arrowhead demo on the
HP<00:00:14.740> stream<00:00:14.920> 7<00:00:16.980> what<00:00:17.980> we've<00:00:18.130> got<00:00:18.340> is<00:00:19.140> actually

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
HP stream 7 what we've got is actually

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.779 
HP stream 7 what we've got is actually
these<00:00:20.320> in<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.560> graphics<00:00:21.070> settings<00:00:21.400> is<00:00:21.490> a<00:00:21.520> very

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
these in the graphics settings is a very

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.460 
these in the graphics settings is a very
low<00:00:22.410> quality<00:00:23.410> preference<00:00:24.690> 800<00:00:25.690> x<00:00:25.750> 600<00:00:26.080> there

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
low quality preference 800 x 600 there

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.890 
low quality preference 800 x 600 there
doesn't<00:00:26.860> seem<00:00:26.890> to<00:00:27.010> be<00:00:27.100> any<00:00:27.280> difference<00:00:27.670> in

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
doesn't seem to be any difference in

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.850 
doesn't seem to be any difference in
frame<00:00:28.900> rate<00:00:29.110> if<00:00:29.320> you<00:00:29.590> choose<00:00:29.920> 640<00:00:30.550> x<00:00:30.700> 480<00:00:31.090> so

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
frame rate if you choose 640 x 480 so

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.190 
frame rate if you choose 640 x 480 so
why<00:00:32.860> that<00:00:33.070> is<00:00:33.160> i'm<00:00:33.309> not<00:00:33.340> sure<00:00:33.760> but<00:00:33.789> it's<00:00:34.329> it

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
why that is i'm not sure but it's it

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.369 
why that is i'm not sure but it's it
must<00:00:35.410> be<00:00:35.500> the<00:00:35.620> game<00:00:35.800> engine<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:37.390> we've<00:00:37.930> chosen

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
must be the game engine so we've chosen

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.600 
must be the game engine so we've chosen
a<00:00:38.560> number<00:00:38.829> 600<00:00:39.370> it's<00:00:39.489> a<00:00:39.760> better<00:00:40.600> resolution

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
a number 600 it's a better resolution

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.400 
a number 600 it's a better resolution
everything<00:00:42.610> else<00:00:42.760> is<00:00:42.970> as<00:00:43.150> low<00:00:43.540> as<00:00:43.570> i<00:00:44.020> can<00:00:44.230> get

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
everything else is as low as i can get

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:53.250 
everything else is as low as i can get
it<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:47.220> yeah<00:00:48.220> so<00:00:48.489> that's<00:00:50.309> that's<00:00:51.309> it<00:00:52.079> now<00:00:53.079> it

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
it and yeah so that's that's it now it

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.660 
it and yeah so that's that's it now it
doesn't<00:00:53.530> get<00:00:53.620> very<00:00:53.649> high<00:00:53.980> frame<00:00:54.250> rates<00:00:54.489> even

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
doesn't get very high frame rates even

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.880 
doesn't get very high frame rates even
at<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:55.000> lowest<00:00:55.360> settings<00:00:55.899> and<00:00:58.500> why<00:00:59.500> that<00:00:59.739> is

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
at the lowest settings and why that is

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.370 
at the lowest settings and why that is
I'm<00:01:00.040> not<00:01:00.190> entirely<00:01:00.489> sure<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:02.079> not<00:01:02.320> a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
I'm not entirely sure it's not a

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.009 
I'm not entirely sure it's not a
graphically<00:01:02.980> complex<00:01:03.640> game<00:01:03.910> I<00:01:04.180> can<00:01:04.899> only

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
graphically complex game I can only

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.899 
graphically complex game I can only
assume<00:01:05.199> that<00:01:05.439> it's<00:01:05.770> not<00:01:05.950> very<00:01:06.130> well<00:01:06.369> optimized

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
assume that it's not very well optimized

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.340 
assume that it's not very well optimized
I<00:01:08.520> mean<00:01:09.520> certainly<00:01:09.939> we've<00:01:10.240> had<00:01:10.630> more<00:01:10.810> complex

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
I mean certainly we've had more complex

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.699 
I mean certainly we've had more complex
games<00:01:11.649> that<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:13.689> run<00:01:13.869> better<00:01:14.109> like<00:01:14.380> I<00:01:14.499> say

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:14.709 
games that that run better like I say

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:17.669 
games that that run better like I say
the<00:01:14.920> 640<00:01:15.459> x<00:01:15.579> 480<00:01:16.380> doesn't<00:01:17.380> make<00:01:17.499> any

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
the 640 x 480 doesn't make any

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:19.830 
the 640 x 480 doesn't make any
difference<00:01:17.889> in<00:01:18.159> frame<00:01:18.369> rate<00:01:18.579> so<00:01:18.880> it's<00:01:19.810> a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
difference in frame rate so it's a

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.090 
difference in frame rate so it's a
little<00:01:19.959> peculiar<00:01:25.499> now<00:01:26.499> the<00:01:26.560> other<00:01:26.679> thing<00:01:26.829> guys

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
little peculiar now the other thing guys

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.080 
little peculiar now the other thing guys
is<00:01:27.340> I<00:01:27.819> got<00:01:27.999> a<00:01:28.029> I<00:01:28.359> got<00:01:28.450> I<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.459> apologize<00:01:30.609> I

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
is I got a I got I have to apologize I

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.949 
is I got a I got I have to apologize I
don't<00:01:31.840> know<00:01:31.959> anything<00:01:32.229> about<00:01:32.409> ARMA<00:01:32.859> 2<00:01:33.039> and<00:01:33.959> I

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:34.959 
don't know anything about ARMA 2 and I

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:37.410 
don't know anything about ARMA 2 and I
have<00:01:35.409> run<00:01:35.619> around<00:01:35.979> here<00:01:36.310> for<00:01:36.639> and<00:01:36.849> I<00:01:37.090> see<00:01:37.299> my

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
have run around here for and I see my

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.089 
have run around here for and I see my
teammates<00:01:39.209> however<00:01:40.209> I<00:01:40.599> did<00:01:41.560> not<00:01:41.590> encounter

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:42.099 
teammates however I did not encounter

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:47.539 
teammates however I did not encounter
any<00:01:42.420> 10<00:01:43.420> buildings<00:01:45.359> but<00:01:46.359> that's<00:01:46.569> about<00:01:46.810> it<00:01:46.869> so

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
any 10 buildings but that's about it so

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.550 
any 10 buildings but that's about it so
at<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.700> very<00:01:48.729> least<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:50.049> get<00:01:50.200> an<00:01:50.289> idea<00:01:50.319> what

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
at the very least you get an idea what

00:01:50.560 --> 00:02:05.080 
at the very least you get an idea what
the<00:01:50.740> frame<00:01:50.950> rate<00:01:51.159> is

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:15.040 

I<00:02:12.580> gotta<00:02:13.580> say<00:02:13.760> this<00:02:13.910> is<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.150> very<00:02:14.540> large<00:02:14.720> scope

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
I gotta say this is a very large scope

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.949 
I gotta say this is a very large scope
on<00:02:15.260> this<00:02:15.410> sniper<00:02:15.590> rifle<00:02:16.540> really<00:02:17.540> kind<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.810> gets

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
on this sniper rifle really kind of gets

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:26.229 
on this sniper rifle really kind of gets
in<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.140> way<00:02:24.580> but<00:02:25.580> if<00:02:25.670> keep<00:02:25.849> an<00:02:25.970> eye<00:02:26.030> on<00:02:26.060> the

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
in the way but if keep an eye on the

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.520 
in the way but if keep an eye on the
frame<00:02:26.420> rate<00:02:26.599> counter<00:02:26.870> you'll<00:02:27.049> see<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.349> it

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
frame rate counter you'll see it it

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.500 
frame rate counter you'll see it it
really<00:02:27.769> takes<00:02:28.190> some<00:02:28.420> some<00:02:29.420> deep<00:02:29.720> drops<00:02:31.510> which

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
really takes some some deep drops which

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.920 
really takes some some deep drops which
is<00:02:32.690> unfortunate<00:02:33.349> but<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:34.450> guess<00:02:35.450> those<00:02:35.720> of<00:02:35.840> you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
is unfortunate but I guess those of you

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.690 
is unfortunate but I guess those of you
play<00:02:36.230> arma<00:02:36.500> 2<00:02:36.680> can<00:02:36.890> determine<00:02:37.310> if<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.549> is

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
play arma 2 can determine if this is

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:50.740 
play arma 2 can determine if this is
something<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:39.500> could<00:02:39.650> live<00:02:39.739> with<00:02:49.750> my

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
something that you could live with my

00:02:50.750 --> 00:03:21.610 
something that you could live with my
guide

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.890 

anyways<00:03:22.620> I'm<00:03:23.220> not<00:03:23.460> going<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.730> sit<00:03:24.450> here<00:03:24.510> nav

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
anyways I'm not going to sit here nav

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.750 
anyways I'm not going to sit here nav
you<00:03:25.080> guys<00:03:25.230> watch<00:03:25.500> me<00:03:25.740> just<00:03:25.950> run<00:03:26.130> around<00:03:26.250> bored

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
you guys watch me just run around bored

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.140 
you guys watch me just run around bored
do<00:03:27.030> not<00:03:27.300> do<00:03:27.480> anything<00:03:28.640> but<00:03:29.640> hopefully<00:03:30.030> it

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
do not do anything but hopefully it

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.470 
do not do anything but hopefully it
gives<00:03:30.240> you<00:03:30.390> an<00:03:30.480> idea<00:03:30.570> of<00:03:31.020> how<00:03:31.500> well<00:03:31.770> it<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:33.000> runs

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
gives you an idea of how well it it runs

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.130 
gives you an idea of how well it it runs
on<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.080> stream<00:03:34.320> 7<00:03:34.740> and<00:03:35.510> if<00:03:36.510> it's<00:03:36.750> worth<00:03:36.930> your

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
on the stream 7 and if it's worth your

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.300
