00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.100
 my name is primary and good I do the 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.860
 horse and in my function it is to give 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.210
 life as art director to the work to 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.210
 all the characters that we see 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.470
 I think it's a work in the first place 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.210
 very or visually enough I do not think that 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.940
 very beautiful and it is something very little seen in 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.170
 mexico then the first place opens 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.019
 as another kind of 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.719
 of things that you see is very shocking and 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.350
 then the message is not very pretty 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.600
 Kids really like them 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.899
 It entertains a lot and I think it's a 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.899
 work 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.490
 what you have to rescue from this father 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:13.070
 that you have to encourage the imagination is 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.210
 very important to know that for the 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.490
 children is an exercise 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.380
 I'm very father because they have the actor 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.439
 although no more sees before the other in this 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.600
 case they have the actor's energy 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.209
 directly these medicines you do not see no 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.000
 you feel and the children do not know 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:30.720
 they understand the conversion of the theater to 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.860
 the smart 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.860
 it is very important to me 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.160
 I think it's a work that is worth a lot 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.770
 penalty for the mini is a new project 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.790
 and I think you 're going to like them very much 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.490
 everything is all supposed imagination 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.260
 that lament of sebasti치n and his 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.260
 imagination in everything I think 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.289
 will save everything he created in his 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:07.240
 moments for let's say you can follow 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.240
 living in your imagination 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.740
 things 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:25.600
 let's see the most loved ones this is 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:28.250

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.810
 they find I do not know what a live 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.810
 with the eyes of the blind 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.110

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.340
 carpenter part of the buoys 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.340
 the wise tree 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.379
 well the pencil is the spider that is a 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.480
 trip are cobwebs of characters
