moments that in one decree that would
stand<00:00:09.480> out<00:00:09.720> for<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.080> do<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.710> see<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.220> one<00:00:11.370> the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
one day games of a stumbling its way

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000 
one day games of a stumbling its way
through<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.540> hope<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.290> survives<00:00:16.620> because

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
through I hope it survives because

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.110 
through I hope it survives because
there's<00:00:17.220> quite<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> bit<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.610> history<00:00:17.910> with<00:00:18.030> it

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:18.120 
there's quite a bit of history with it

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.700 
there's quite a bit of history with it
now<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.420> be<00:00:18.720> ashamed<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.380> someone<00:00:19.620> like

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
now and be ashamed for someone like

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.200 
now and be ashamed for someone like
Michael<00:00:19.980> Bevan<00:00:20.400> who<00:00:20.520> had<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.700> great<00:00:20.910> one<00:00:21.060> day

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
Michael Bevan who had a great one day

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.340 
Michael Bevan who had a great one day
career<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.600> all<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.870> sudden<00:00:22.110> have<00:00:22.230> that

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
career to all of a sudden have that

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.440 
career to all of a sudden have that
obliterated<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.640> no<00:00:23.820> longer<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.150> formal

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
obliterated and it's no longer a formal

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.760 
obliterated and it's no longer a formal
again<00:00:24.630> that's<00:00:24.840> his<00:00:24.990> history<00:00:25.320> gone<00:00:25.500> with<00:00:25.650> it

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
again that's his history gone with it

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.620 
again that's his history gone with it
and<00:00:26.370> he<00:00:26.430> put<00:00:26.580> fifteen<00:00:26.940> years<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.180> work<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.360> it

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
and he put fifteen years of work in it

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.570 
and he put fifteen years of work in it
so<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.110> think<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.890> needs<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> be<00:00:29.130> tweaked<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.550> bit

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
so I think it needs to be tweaked a bit

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.760 
so I think it needs to be tweaked a bit
I<00:00:29.730> do<00:00:30.000> find<00:00:30.360> that<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:31.020> middle<00:00:31.290> oh<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> bit

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
I do find that the middle oh is a bit

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.410 
I do find that the middle oh is a bit
tedious<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.219> watch<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.790> twenty<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.149> forty

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
tedious to watch the twenty to forty

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.960 
tedious to watch the twenty to forty
hours<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.620> recently<00:00:35.010> suggested<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:35.940> a

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
hours and I recently suggested it was a

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.540 
hours and I recently suggested it was a
bit<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.240> throw<00:00:36.450> away<00:00:36.540> live<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:36.960> maybe<00:00:37.110> we

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
bit of a throw away live but maybe we

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.890 
bit of a throw away live but maybe we
increased<00:00:38.550> force<00:00:38.820> two<00:00:39.000> sixes<00:00:39.360> sixes<00:00:39.750> two

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
increased force two sixes sixes two

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.810 
increased force two sixes sixes two
nines<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.350> get<00:00:40.500> batsman<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.310> play<00:00:41.490> some<00:00:41.700> more

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
nines to get batsman to play some more

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.120 
nines to get batsman to play some more
shots<00:00:42.230> maybe<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.410> bowlers<00:00:43.710> wouldn't<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:43.980> too

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
shots maybe the bowlers wouldn't be too

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.800 
shots maybe the bowlers wouldn't be too
happy<00:00:44.400> but<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.970> positive<00:00:45.240> side<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.660> that

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
happy but on the positive side of that

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.120 
happy but on the positive side of that
then<00:00:46.050> they're<00:00:46.350> more<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> chance<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.010> getting

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
then they're more a chance to getting

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.380 
then they're more a chance to getting
wicked<00:00:47.400> if<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> batsmen<00:00:47.850> are<00:00:47.880> attacking<00:00:48.329> him

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
wicked if the batsmen are attacking him

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.540 
wicked if the batsmen are attacking him
so<00:00:48.660> we've<00:00:49.410> got<00:00:49.560> to<00:00:49.650> spruce<00:00:49.860> up<00:00:50.010> as<00:00:50.160> many<00:00:50.340> loves

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
so we've got to spruce up as many loves

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.770 
so we've got to spruce up as many loves
interesting<00:00:51.150> to<00:00:51.239> say<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.480> because<00:00:51.600> it's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
interesting to say that because it's

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.760 
interesting to say that because it's
going<00:00:51.900> to<00:00:51.960> ask<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.230> if<00:00:52.290> you're<00:00:52.380> happy<00:00:52.620> with

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
going to ask you if you're happy with

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.170 
going to ask you if you're happy with
the<00:00:52.950> balance<00:00:53.340> between<00:00:53.610> bad<00:00:53.880> and<00:00:54.030> bought

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the balance between bad and bought

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.030 
the balance between bad and bought
because<00:00:54.899> these<00:00:55.079> days<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.320> bat<00:00:55.620> seems<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.950> be

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
because these days the bat seems to be

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.130 
because these days the bat seems to be
dominating<00:00:56.550> everywhere<00:00:56.970> the<00:00:57.360> new<00:00:57.480> technology

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
dominating everywhere the new technology

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.020 
dominating everywhere the new technology
is<00:00:58.290> bringing<00:00:58.590> all<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> bats<00:00:59.040> in<00:00:59.250> boundary

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
is bringing all the bats in boundary

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.590 
is bringing all the bats in boundary
ropes

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
ropes

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.240 
ropes
sometimes<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.290> a<00:01:01.350> temptation<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.920> bring<00:01:02.100> them

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
sometimes as a temptation to bring them

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.579 
sometimes as a temptation to bring them
in<00:01:02.370> out<00:01:02.730> fields<00:01:03.210> especially<00:01:03.360> like<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.019> saw

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
in out fields especially like you saw

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.859 
in out fields especially like you saw
your<00:01:04.739> Mumbai<00:01:05.009> out<00:01:05.399> fields<00:01:05.729> are<00:01:05.850> very<00:01:06.299> quick<00:01:06.509> he

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
your Mumbai out fields are very quick he

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.169 
your Mumbai out fields are very quick he
said<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:07.560> balance<00:01:07.859> getting<00:01:08.100> lost<00:01:08.249> it<00:01:08.789> is<00:01:08.939> I

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
said is the balance getting lost it is I

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:10.819 
said is the balance getting lost it is I
mean<00:01:09.299> how<00:01:09.479> many<00:01:09.600> how<00:01:09.810> often<00:01:10.079> you<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> 3-run

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
mean how many how often you see a 3-run

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.770 
mean how many how often you see a 3-run
in<00:01:10.979> international<00:01:11.909> cricketers<00:01:12.270> dies<00:01:12.509> very

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
in international cricketers dies very

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.719 
in international cricketers dies very
rarely<00:01:13.079> and<00:01:13.799> there's<00:01:13.979> not<00:01:14.069> lending<00:01:14.310> twos<00:01:14.549> in

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
rarely and there's not lending twos in

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.819 
rarely and there's not lending twos in
fact<00:01:14.939> I'd<00:01:15.060> say<00:01:15.179> the<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:15.389> oh<00:01:15.450> four<00:01:15.689> or<00:01:15.840> six<00:01:16.049> so

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
fact I'd say the one oh four or six so

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:17.719 
fact I'd say the one oh four or six so
the<00:01:16.950> air<00:01:17.069> fields<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.399> definitely<00:01:17.670> getting

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the air fields are definitely getting

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.669 
the air fields are definitely getting
shorter<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.299> quicker<00:01:18.509> boundaries<00:01:19.350> smaller

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
shorter and quicker boundaries smaller

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.980 
shorter and quicker boundaries smaller
bats<00:01:20.549> seem<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.149> be<00:01:21.240> bigger<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.539> more<00:01:21.749> powerful

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
bats seem to be bigger and more powerful

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.870 
bats seem to be bigger and more powerful
and<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.679> think<00:01:22.829> the<00:01:22.889> biggest<00:01:23.069> change<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.549> actual

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
and I think the biggest change is actual

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.910 
and I think the biggest change is actual
physique<00:01:24.389> of<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.569> players<00:01:24.810> you're<00:01:25.679> there<00:01:25.829> in

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
physique of the players you're there in

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.529 
physique of the players you're there in
the<00:01:26.009> gym<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.340> mean<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.880> day<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.179> was<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.450> know

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
the gym I mean in a day it was you know

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.569 
the gym I mean in a day it was you know
you<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:28.170> sort<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.469> looked<00:01:29.159> at<00:01:29.249> the<00:01:29.310> gym<00:01:29.459> and

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
you you sort of looked at the gym and

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.249 
you you sort of looked at the gym and
ever<00:01:29.670> went<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.030> there<00:01:30.179> but<00:01:30.329> these<00:01:30.810> days<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
ever went in there but these days the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.629 
ever went in there but these days the
guys<00:01:31.409> are<00:01:31.590> big<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:31.889> all<00:01:32.009> about<00:01:32.189> power<00:01:32.459> and

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:32.639 
guys are big it's all about power and

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:35.209 
guys are big it's all about power and
speed<00:01:32.909> twenty20<00:01:33.749> cricket<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.139> they're<00:01:34.259> you

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
speed twenty20 cricket and they're you

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:36.230 
speed twenty20 cricket and they're you
know<00:01:35.249> they're<00:01:35.340> hitting<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.729> ball<00:01:35.880> longer

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
know they're hitting the ball longer

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.569 
know they're hitting the ball longer
because<00:01:36.450> they're<00:01:36.779> much<00:01:36.929> stronger<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.619> maybe

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
because they're much stronger so maybe

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.730 
because they're much stronger so maybe
they've<00:01:38.789> got<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.999> try<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.659> give<00:01:40.289> the<00:01:40.409> bowl<00:01:40.590> of

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
they've got to try and give the bowl of

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.319 
they've got to try and give the bowl of
some<00:01:40.889> incentive<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.549> now<00:01:41.639> the<00:01:41.700> MCC<00:01:42.179> we've

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
some incentive for now the MCC we've

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.669 
some incentive for now the MCC we've
talked<00:01:42.509> about<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.810> possibility<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.499> getting

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
talked about the possibility of getting

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.980 
talked about the possibility of getting
the<00:01:43.829> seems<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.249> bit<00:01:44.369> larger<00:01:44.759> even<00:01:45.450> increasing<00:01:45.929> a

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
the seems a bit larger even increasing a

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.749 
the seems a bit larger even increasing a
number<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.380> seems<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.709> eight<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.700> know

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
number of seems to eight you know

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.789 
number of seems to eight you know
they're<00:01:47.909> radical<00:01:48.090> ideas<00:01:48.630> but<00:01:48.869> maybe<00:01:49.619> it's

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
they're radical ideas but maybe it's

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.129 
they're radical ideas but maybe it's
time<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:49.979> started<00:01:50.279> thinking<00:01:50.340> about<00:01:51.139> because

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:52.139 
time we started thinking about because

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:54.169 
time we started thinking about because
even<00:01:52.380> today<00:01:52.499> the<00:01:53.039> phosphotase<00:01:53.429> rickets<00:01:54.060> up

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
even today the phosphotase rickets up

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.059 
even today the phosphotase rickets up
front<00:01:54.450> even<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.079> batsman<00:01:55.349> dominated<00:01:55.889> game

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
front even in a batsman dominated game

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:57.440 
front even in a batsman dominated game
like<00:01:56.249> t20<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.789> still<00:01:56.969> worth<00:01:57.119> his<00:01:57.270> weight<00:01:57.389> in

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
like t20 it still worth his weight in

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.419 
like t20 it still worth his weight in
gold<00:01:57.569> so<00:01:57.959> somewhere<00:01:58.799> down<00:01:58.859> the<00:01:59.099> line<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.249> need

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
gold so somewhere down the line you need

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.010 
gold so somewhere down the line you need
to<00:01:59.579> encourage<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.090> kind<00:02:00.389> of<00:02:00.569> bowler<00:02:00.779> don't

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
to encourage that kind of bowler don't

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.019 
to encourage that kind of bowler don't
you<00:02:01.109> and<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.289> just<00:02:01.529> wonder<00:02:02.099> I<00:02:02.279> mean<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.609> you<00:02:02.939> were

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:03.029 
you and I just wonder I mean I you were

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:04.940 
you and I just wonder I mean I you were
saying<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.419> me<00:02:03.450> some<00:02:04.020> time<00:02:04.200> ago<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.469> it's<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
saying to me some time ago that it's the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.050 
saying to me some time ago that it's the
best<00:02:05.159> time<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.429> the<00:02:05.459> world<00:02:05.639> to<00:02:05.700> be<00:02:05.789> a<00:02:05.819> batsman

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
best time in the world to be a batsman

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.270 
best time in the world to be a batsman
yeah<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.049> think<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.590> there's<00:02:08.069> not<00:02:08.160> many

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
yeah I think it is there's not many

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.040 
yeah I think it is there's not many
great<00:02:08.670> opening<00:02:09.270> quick<00:02:09.450> balls<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.840> mean<00:02:09.990> you

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
great opening quick balls I mean you

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.569 
great opening quick balls I mean you
haven't<00:02:10.259> got<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.500> fearsome<00:02:11.160> West<00:02:11.310> Indies

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:11.579 
haven't got the fearsome West Indies

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.030 
haven't got the fearsome West Indies
quartet<00:02:12.000> or<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.269> huazi<00:02:13.170> macro<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.739> whack<00:02:13.890> a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
quartet or the huazi macro and whack a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.710 
quartet or the huazi macro and whack a
Eunice<00:02:14.310> Ellen<00:02:14.610> Donnell<00:02:14.879> type<00:02:15.060> bowlers<00:02:15.450> around

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
Eunice Ellen Donnell type bowlers around

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.940 
Eunice Ellen Donnell type bowlers around
because<00:02:15.989> they're<00:02:16.260> all

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
because they're all

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.339 
because they're all
you<00:02:17.010> know<00:02:17.069> struggling<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:18.510> stay<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.110> park

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
you know struggling to stay on the park

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.690 
you know struggling to stay on the park
and<00:02:19.590> they're<00:02:19.739> making<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.370> option<00:02:20.610> now

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
and they're making the option now

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.130 
and they're making the option now
playing<00:02:21.000> twenty20<00:02:21.510> rather<00:02:21.660> than<00:02:21.750> test<00:02:21.959> great

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
playing twenty20 rather than test great

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.619 
playing twenty20 rather than test great
so<00:02:22.379> it's<00:02:23.010> probably<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.340> best<00:02:23.489> time<00:02:23.700> ever<00:02:24.120> to

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
so it's probably the best time ever to

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.240 
so it's probably the best time ever to
be<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:25.110> top<00:02:25.410> order<00:02:25.620> batsman<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.010> Test<00:02:26.190> cricket

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
be a top order batsman in Test cricket

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.180 
be a top order batsman in Test cricket
right<00:02:26.580> now<00:02:26.730> because<00:02:26.849> there's<00:02:27.060> not<00:02:27.239> many

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
right now because there's not many

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.140 
right now because there's not many
penetrating<00:02:29.190> damaging<00:02:29.610> happening<00:02:29.849> bowlers

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
penetrating damaging happening bowlers

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.520 
penetrating damaging happening bowlers
so<00:02:30.269> we've<00:02:30.420> somehow<00:02:30.690> got<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.930> encourage<00:02:31.230> him

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
so we've somehow got to encourage him

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.020 
so we've somehow got to encourage him
back<00:02:31.680> another<00:02:31.860> fold<00:02:32.160> it's<00:02:32.670> one<00:02:32.849> of<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
back another fold it's one of the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.790 
back another fold it's one of the
reasons<00:02:33.390> in<00:02:33.780> we're<00:02:34.349> getting<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.709> many

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
reasons in we're getting so many

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.199 
reasons in we're getting so many
injuries<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:35.280> think<00:02:35.519> that<00:02:35.670> travelling<00:02:36.060> much

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
injuries I think that travelling much

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.820 
injuries I think that travelling much
more<00:02:36.450> or<00:02:36.930> is<00:02:36.989> it<00:02:37.080> also<00:02:37.200> because<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.620> what<00:02:37.739> you

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
more or is it also because of what you

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.320 
more or is it also because of what you
just<00:02:37.980> said<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.519> spend<00:02:38.760> more<00:02:38.849> time<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.209> gym

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
just said to spend more time in the gym

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.220 
just said to spend more time in the gym
than<00:02:39.540> actually<00:02:39.810> bullying

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
than actually bullying

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.620 
than actually bullying
and<00:02:40.920> more<00:02:41.160> diagnosis<00:02:41.790> as<00:02:41.940> well<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.300> mean<00:02:42.480> you've

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
and more diagnosis as well I mean you've

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.120 
and more diagnosis as well I mean you've
got<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.930> million<00:02:43.170> people<00:02:43.290> around<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.680> side<00:02:43.920> as

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
got a million people around the side as

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.470 
got a million people around the side as
soon<00:02:44.310> as<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.459> get<00:02:44.519> an<00:02:44.730> inkling<00:02:45.000> you're<00:02:45.239> off<00:02:45.330> to

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
soon as you get an inkling you're off to

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.710 
soon as you get an inkling you're off to
the<00:02:45.560> MRI<00:02:46.560> scan<00:02:46.950> which<00:02:47.250> will<00:02:47.430> pick<00:02:47.610> up<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.849> strain

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
the MRI scan which will pick up a strain

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.420 
the MRI scan which will pick up a strain
15<00:02:49.230> years<00:02:49.410> ago<00:02:49.500> they<00:02:49.830> probably<00:02:50.040> have<00:02:50.250> played

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
15 years ago they probably have played

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.070 
15 years ago they probably have played
with<00:02:50.580> those<00:02:50.700> strains<00:02:51.000> but<00:02:51.540> now<00:02:51.720> as<00:02:51.870> soon<00:02:51.989> as

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
with those strains but now as soon as

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.210 
with those strains but now as soon as
it's<00:02:52.230> diagnosed<00:02:52.799> everyone's<00:02:53.099> got<00:02:53.190> a

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
it's diagnosed everyone's got a

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.280 
it's diagnosed everyone's got a
responsibility<00:02:53.730> say<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.959> you're<00:02:55.079> gonna<00:02:55.170> have

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
responsibility say and you're gonna have

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.490 
responsibility say and you're gonna have
10<00:02:55.500> days<00:02:55.650> off<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.280> recover<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:57.450> more<00:02:57.810> diagnosis

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
10 days off to recover so more diagnosis

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.920 
10 days off to recover so more diagnosis
leads<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:58.950> more<00:02:59.099> law<00:02:59.819> injuries<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.780> guess

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
leads to more law injuries I guess

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.180 
leads to more law injuries I guess
because<00:03:01.260> they're<00:03:01.470> actually<00:03:01.739> seeing<00:03:01.980> what

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
because they're actually seeing what

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.610 
because they're actually seeing what
they<00:03:02.310> are<00:03:02.430> in<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.610> past<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:03.000> didn't<00:03:03.239> know<00:03:03.620> and

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
they are in the past I didn't know and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.589 
they are in the past I didn't know and
yeah<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.250> think<00:03:05.400> maybe<00:03:05.970> sometimes<00:03:06.209> different

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
yeah I think maybe sometimes different

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.940 
yeah I think maybe sometimes different
types<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.870> training<00:03:07.170> do<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.560> like<00:03:07.709> lean

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
types of training do you like lean

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.410 
types of training do you like lean
travelling<00:03:08.340> teams<00:03:08.519> then<00:03:08.730> because<00:03:09.060> sometimes

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
travelling teams then because sometimes

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.000 
travelling teams then because sometimes
nowadays<00:03:09.810> are<00:03:09.959> travelling<00:03:10.290> entourage<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:10.890> as

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
nowadays are travelling entourage is as

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
big as the plane stuff it seems we are

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.860 
big as the plane stuff it seems we are
out<00:03:14.069> of<00:03:14.099> order<00:03:14.280> sometimes<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:15.000> mean<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.540> can't

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
out of order sometimes I mean I can't

confuse a situation and support and
