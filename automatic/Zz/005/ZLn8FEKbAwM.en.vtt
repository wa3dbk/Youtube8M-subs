headquarters once again I'm here with
Richard<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.700> when<00:00:15.360> you're<00:00:15.480> showing<00:00:15.630> this

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
Richard and when you're showing this

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:16.730 
Richard and when you're showing this
it's<00:00:16.139> very<00:00:16.350> urgent

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
it's very urgent

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
it's very urgent
this<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.310> PA<00:00:17.640> z77<00:00:18.510> -<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.320> deluxe<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:20.699> a

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
this is the PA z77 - I deluxe so it's a

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.910 
this is the PA z77 - I deluxe so it's a
we've<00:00:21.480> done<00:00:21.660> me<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> textbook<00:00:22.170> before<00:00:22.619> but<00:00:22.800> this

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
we've done me a textbook before but this

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.370 
we've done me a textbook before but this
is<00:00:22.980> sort<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:24.000> combination<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.720> our<00:00:24.930> plot<00:00:25.230> and

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
is sort of a combination of our plot and

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.460 
is sort of a combination of our plot and
skill<00:00:25.619> as<00:00:25.859> well<00:00:26.220> as<00:00:26.490> mini<00:00:27.210> ITX<00:00:27.330> sights<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.080> as

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
skill as well as mini ITX sights so as

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.820 
skill as well as mini ITX sights so as
you<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.650> see<00:00:28.830> you've<00:00:29.070> got<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:30.090> whole

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
you can see you've got this whole

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.479 
you can see you've got this whole
digital<00:00:31.830> CRM<00:00:33.380> daughterboard<00:00:34.380> here<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.100> that's

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
digital CRM daughterboard here so that's

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.030 
digital CRM daughterboard here so that's
been<00:00:35.700> solved<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.690> 10<00:00:36.899> phase<00:00:37.170> power

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
been solved in this is 10 phase power

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.979 
been solved in this is 10 phase power
for<00:00:38.399> overclocking<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:40.070> 1157<00:00:41.070> 55<00:00:41.629> CPU<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.719> here

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
for overclocking the 1157 55 CPU in here

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.500 
for overclocking the 1157 55 CPU in here
and<00:00:43.309> also<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.489> CPU<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:44.910> move<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.239> way<00:00:45.480> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
and also the CPU can move this way and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.690 
and also the CPU can move this way and
chips<00:00:46.050> over<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:47.070> give<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.309> more<00:00:47.460> space

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
chips over here to give you more space

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.229 
chips over here to give you more space
between<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.379> PCI<00:00:50.070> Express<00:00:50.280> slot<00:00:50.610> so

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
between that and the PCI Express slot so

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.080 
between that and the PCI Express slot so
you<00:00:51.690> can<00:00:52.500> put<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> larger<00:00:53.039> chords<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.520> as<00:00:53.910> well

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
you can put a larger chords in as well

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.369 
you can put a larger chords in as well
without<00:00:54.270> getting<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.719> graphics<00:00:55.079> card<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:56.120> for

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
without getting a graphics card so for

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.500 
without getting a graphics card so for
further<00:00:58.379> further<00:00:59.100> cases<00:00:59.670> like<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> still

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
have a big fan over the top it's ideal

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.420 
have a big fan over the top it's ideal
for<00:01:06.659> overclocking<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.439> keeping<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> size

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
for overclocking and keeping the size

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.980 
for overclocking and keeping the size
absolutely<00:01:09.090> minimal<00:01:09.270> as<00:01:09.510> well<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.869> you're

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
absolutely minimal as well and you're

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.810 
absolutely minimal as well and you're
not<00:01:10.020> gonna<00:01:10.229> risk<00:01:10.470> blowing<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.100> vrm<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.640> talk

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
not gonna risk blowing the vrm to talk

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.490 
not gonna risk blowing the vrm to talk

full<00:01:47.150> deluxe<00:01:47.450> board<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:48.440> out<00:01:48.560> okay<00:01:49.370> well<00:01:49.670> I

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
full deluxe board and it out okay well I

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.340 
full deluxe board and it out okay well I
think<00:01:49.880> he<00:01:50.120> feels<00:01:50.270> I'm<00:01:50.570> Richard<00:01:50.900> I<00:01:51.020> think<00:01:51.080> what

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
think he feels I'm Richard I think what

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.930 
think he feels I'm Richard I think what
we're<00:01:51.440> gonna<00:01:51.500> do<00:01:51.770> is<00:01:51.830> I<00:01:52.010> think<00:01:52.250> silver<00:01:52.700> stone

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
we're gonna do is I think silver stone

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.630 
we're gonna do is I think silver stone
have<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.300> new<00:01:54.170> micro<00:01:54.500> ATX<00:01:54.620> case<00:01:55.220> it's<00:01:55.430> going<00:01:55.580> to

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
have a new micro ATX case it's going to

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.160 
have a new micro ATX case it's going to
fit<00:01:55.760> this<00:01:55.850> well<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:56.300> instead<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.720> a<00:01:56.810> seven

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
fit this well so instead of a seven

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.770 
fit this well so instead of a seven
