with<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.850> quick<00:00:06.259> overclock<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.799> quick<00:00:08.130> look<00:00:08.280> at

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
with a quick overclock a quick look at

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.360 
with a quick overclock a quick look at
4.4<00:00:09.510> gig<00:00:09.780> overclock<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:10.920> what<00:00:11.040> you're<00:00:11.160> doing

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
4.4 gig overclock so what you're doing

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.299 
4.4 gig overclock so what you're doing
this<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.759> msi<00:00:12.179> UEFI<00:00:12.870> boss<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.590> what<00:00:14.160> you're

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
this is the msi UEFI boss so what you're

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.070 
this is the msi UEFI boss so what you're
doing<00:00:14.340> if<00:00:14.790> you're<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.269> if<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.780> have<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
doing if you're in the if you have the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.070 
doing if you're in the if you have the
msi<00:00:16.500> boss<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:17.699> go<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:17.970> overclock<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.869> then

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
msi boss you go to overclock and then

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.370 
msi boss you go to overclock and then
you<00:00:19.199> just<00:00:19.380> simply<00:00:19.680> go<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.939> the<00:00:20.939> adjust<00:00:21.810> CPU

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
you just simply go to the adjust CPU

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.849 
you just simply go to the adjust CPU
ratio<00:00:22.890> here<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:24.390> can<00:00:24.539> set<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.960> four

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
ratio here and you can set it to four

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.580 
ratio here and you can set it to four
four<00:00:26.640> four<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.390> forty<00:00:27.990> four<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.470> will

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
four four so forty four and that will

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.040 
four four so forty four and that will
set<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.890> 4.4<00:00:29.519> gigahertz<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.150> now<00:00:30.720> fixed

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
set it to 4.4 gigahertz and now fixed

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.350 
set it to 4.4 gigahertz and now fixed
mode<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.470> what<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.550> want<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.820> have<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.120> on

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.150 
because that'll make all caused the same
speed<00:00:36.329> every<00:00:36.510> core<00:00:37.079> will<00:00:37.170> be<00:00:37.230> running<00:00:37.500> at<00:00:37.559> 4.4

gigs and I'm going to look at more of

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.910 
gigs and I'm going to look at more of
these<00:00:40.980> settings<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> msi<00:00:41.910> bios<00:00:42.780> has<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.800> many

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
these settings the msi bios has so many

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.470 
these settings the msi bios has so many
extra<00:00:44.399> settings<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.879> I'm<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.120> research

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
extra settings and I'm going to research

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.660 
extra settings and I'm going to research
over<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> next<00:00:46.140> month<00:00:46.829> or<00:00:47.010> two<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:47.460> I'm

overclocking<00:00:49.920> guide<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.539> motherboard

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
overclocking guide on this motherboard

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.229 
overclocking guide on this motherboard
in<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.899> CPU<00:00:52.379> but<00:00:52.800> CPU<00:00:53.370> core<00:00:53.610> voltage<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:54.120> you

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
in this CPU but CPU core voltage all you

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.939 
in this CPU but CPU core voltage all you
have<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.449> do<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.660> set<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.140> one<00:00:55.379> point<00:00:55.620> one

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
have to do is set that to one point one

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.849 
have to do is set that to one point one
four<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:57.690> offset<00:00:58.140> mode<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.710> leave

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
four and the offset mode you can leave

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.400 
four and the offset mode you can leave
that<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.100> auto<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.149> think<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.840> uses<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that on auto and I think it uses in a

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.939 
that on auto and I think it uses in a
mode<00:01:01.800> called<00:01:01.969> adaptive<00:01:02.969> mode<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.830> that's<00:01:04.830> a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
mode called adaptive mode so that's a

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.550 
mode called adaptive mode so that's a
new<00:01:05.129> feature<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.820> Haswell<00:01:06.560> z87

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
new feature on the Haswell z87

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.590 
new feature on the Haswell z87
motherboards<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.549> after<00:01:09.150> you've<00:01:09.240> done<00:01:09.299> that

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
motherboards so after you've done that

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.450 
motherboards so after you've done that
so<00:01:09.810> all<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.350> do<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.590> really<00:01:11.280> at

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
so all what you have to do is really at

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.580 
so all what you have to do is really at
the<00:01:11.520> moment<00:01:11.700> at<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.000> basic<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:13.170> put<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.439> to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
the moment at the basic just put this to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.469 
the moment at the basic just put this to
one<00:01:13.740> point<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.159> four<00:01:14.520> or<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.119> also<00:01:15.270> be

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
one point one four or you also be

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.060 
one point one four or you also be
similar<00:01:15.780> might<00:01:16.110> be<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.439> point<00:01:16.680> one<00:01:16.830> five

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
similar might be one point one five

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.969 
similar might be one point one five
might<00:01:17.310> be<00:01:17.400> one<00:01:17.580> point<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:17.970> six<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.860> put<00:01:19.860> your

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
might be one point one six and put your

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.200 
might be one point one six and put your
cause<00:01:20.250> up<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:21.710> 44<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:22.860> well<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.280> then<00:01:23.820> all<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
cause up to 44 as well and then all you

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.140 
cause up to 44 as well and then all you
do<00:01:24.330> after<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.470> save<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.150> so

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
do after that is you save it so

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.330 
do after that is you save it so
overclocking<00:01:27.659> profile<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.799> my<00:01:29.100> four

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
overclocking profile this is my four

point four and click Save overclocking
profile<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.570> then<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:34.200> exit<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.100> box<00:01:35.790> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.130 
profile and then just exit the box and
then<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:37.979> should<00:01:38.310> overclock<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.900> should

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
then it should overclock and you should

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.130 
then it should overclock and you should
have<00:01:40.409> these<00:01:40.619> super<00:01:41.130> safe<00:01:41.430> overclock<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.540> this

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
have these super safe overclock so this

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.230 
have these super safe overclock so this
in<00:01:43.350> my<00:01:43.530> opinion<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.640> super<00:01:45.000> safe

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
in my opinion is like the super safe

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.050 
in my opinion is like the super safe
this<00:01:45.630> was<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.140> madman<00:01:46.799> 4.2<00:01:47.640> gig<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
this was like the madman 4.2 gig on the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.120 
this was like the madman 4.2 gig on the
Ivy<00:01:48.420> Bridge<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.259> super<00:01:49.710> safe<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.100> think

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
Ivy Bridge this is super safe I think

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.120 
Ivy Bridge this is super safe I think
anyone<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.390> get<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.720> overclock<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.409> has

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
anyone can get this overclock on has

anyone can get this overclock on has
well<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.640> think<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.509> really<00:01:54.860> easy

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.520 
well I think it's a really easy
overclock<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.729> obtain<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.420> we'll<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.350> put

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530
