numbers are powerful we use numbers to
support<00:00:16.590> our<00:00:17.430> case<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:18.119> use<00:00:18.510> numbers<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.650> help

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
to think that the numbers speak for

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.080 
to think that the numbers speak for
themselves<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:41.100> case<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.579> numbers<00:00:41.910> do

your<00:01:04.140> audience<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.270> math<00:01:06.600> in

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
your audience to do to do the math in

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.870 
your audience to do to do the math in
their<00:01:07.049> head<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.530> even<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.340> were<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> use<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
their head and even if you were to use a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.570 
their head and even if you were to use a
telestrator<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:09.990> as<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.619> see<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:11.280> May

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
telestrator and so as you can see in May

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.320 
telestrator and so as you can see in May
in<00:01:11.939> New<00:01:12.119> York<00:01:12.570> oh<00:01:12.840> my<00:01:13.080> gosh<00:01:13.409> snore<00:01:14.310> snore<00:01:14.850> snore

in New York oh my gosh snore snore snore
and<00:01:16.110> also<00:01:16.500> don't<00:01:16.680> make<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.189> mistake<00:01:17.430> don't

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
and also don't make this mistake don't

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.760 
and also don't make this mistake don't
think<00:01:18.270> well<00:01:18.450> instead<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> numbers<00:01:19.590> I'll

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
think well instead of the numbers I'll

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.190 
think well instead of the numbers I'll
use<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> graph<00:01:20.610> there's<00:01:21.090> too<00:01:21.390> much<00:01:21.570> going<00:01:21.840> on

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
use a graph there's too much going on

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.789 
use a graph there's too much going on
here

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
here

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.460 
here
where<00:01:23.369> should<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.670> focus<00:01:24.000> there<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.780> no<00:01:25.200> focus

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
where should I focus there is no focus

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.950 
where should I focus there is no focus
here's<00:01:25.950> an<00:01:26.070> improvement<00:01:26.520> what<00:01:27.299> we've<00:01:27.479> done<00:01:27.720> in

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
here's an improvement what we've done in

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.770 
here's an improvement what we've done in
contrast<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.799> prior<00:01:29.430> slide<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.479> what

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
contrast to the prior slide is that what

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.170 
contrast to the prior slide is that what
we've<00:01:30.960> done<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.560> break<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.979> down<00:01:32.189> by<00:01:32.549> quarter

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
we've done is break it down by quarter

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.020 
we've done is break it down by quarter
so<00:01:33.780> there<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.290> less<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.979> concentrate<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.759> but

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
so there is less to concentrate on but

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.450 
so there is less to concentrate on but
again<00:01:36.509> you're<00:01:36.930> not<00:01:37.290> directing<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
again you're not directing the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.480 
again you're not directing the
conversation<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:40.170> what<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.409> recommend<00:01:41.220> that

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
conversation so what I recommend that

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.020 
conversation so what I recommend that
you<00:01:41.549> do<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.270> employ<00:01:42.990> custom<00:01:43.920> animation<00:01:44.700> so

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
you do is you employ custom animation so

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.539 
you do is you employ custom animation so
here<00:01:45.450> I'm<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.290> animate<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.009> chart<00:01:47.310> I'm

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
here I'm going to animate the chart I'm

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.050 
here I'm going to animate the chart I'm
going<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.299> direct<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:49.350> discussion<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.670> here

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
bring in Chicago you see that there's

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.929 
bring in Chicago you see that there's
quite<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> difference<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.619> performance<00:02:04.979> during

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
quite a difference in performance during

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.940 
quite a difference in performance during
the<00:02:06.210> third<00:02:06.540> quarter<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.229> there<00:02:07.560> something

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
the third quarter is there something

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.010 
the third quarter is there something
going<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.399> here<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:09.149> may<00:02:09.300> also<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:09.660> able<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
going on here we may also be able to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.770 
going on here we may also be able to
discern<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.770> trend<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.640> Chicago<00:02:11.940> seems<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.629> be

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
discern a trend that Chicago seems to be

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.550 
discern a trend that Chicago seems to be
on

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
on

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.340 
on
good<00:02:13.980> growth<00:02:14.490> curve<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.569> see<00:02:15.900> isn't<00:02:16.170> that

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
good growth curve so you see isn't that

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.370 
good growth curve so you see isn't that
much<00:02:16.980> more<00:02:17.430> engaging<00:02:18.180> isn't<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.020> much

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
much more engaging isn't this a much

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.949 
much more engaging isn't this a much
more<00:02:19.410> meaningful<00:02:20.150> presentation<00:02:21.150> let's<00:02:21.750> bring

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
more meaningful presentation let's bring

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.860 
more meaningful presentation let's bring
in<00:02:22.230> our<00:02:22.590> third<00:02:23.069> series<00:02:23.400> now<00:02:24.240> we<00:02:24.300> can<00:02:24.569> bring<00:02:24.720> in

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
in our third series now we can bring in

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.320 
in our third series now we can bring in
Los<00:02:25.050> Angeles<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.709> again<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.459> third<00:02:26.760> quarter

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
Los Angeles and again the third quarter

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.630 
Los Angeles and again the third quarter
seems<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.959> be<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.380> mystery<00:02:29.069> look<00:02:29.340> at<00:02:29.459> Los

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
seems to be a mystery look at Los

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.090 
seems to be a mystery look at Los
Angeles<00:02:29.880> which<00:02:30.390> had<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.630> great<00:02:31.200> second<00:02:31.800> quarter

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
Angeles which had a great second quarter

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.210 
Angeles which had a great second quarter
but<00:02:32.130> why<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:33.000> severe<00:02:33.600> decline<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.890> third

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
but why that severe decline in the third

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.780 
but why that severe decline in the third
all<00:02:36.209> right<00:02:36.569> let<00:02:37.050> me<00:02:37.080> delete<00:02:37.650> these<00:02:37.950> animations

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
all right let me delete these animations

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.340 
all right let me delete these animations
here<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.300> let<00:02:39.450> me<00:02:39.480> show<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.810> how<00:02:40.050> you<00:02:40.110> can

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
here and let me show you how you can

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.490 
here and let me show you how you can
actually<00:02:40.819> employ<00:02:41.819> custom<00:02:42.510> animation<00:02:43.080> all

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
actually employ custom animation all

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.350 
actually employ custom animation all
right<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:43.860> now<00:02:44.220> what<00:02:44.580> I'm<00:02:44.730> going<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:45.000> do<00:02:45.209> is

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
right so now what I'm going to do is

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.690 
right so now what I'm going to do is
discard<00:02:45.840> those<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.830> let's<00:02:47.070> come<00:02:47.250> back<00:02:47.280> here

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
discard those and let's come back here

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.750 
discard those and let's come back here
onto<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.480> slide<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.290> add<00:02:49.560> in<00:02:50.070> custom

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
onto the slide and add in custom

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.390 
onto the slide and add in custom
animation<00:02:51.300> first<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:52.230> course<00:02:52.470> select<00:02:53.070> your

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
animation first of course select your

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.670 
animation first of course select your
chart<00:02:53.730> then<00:02:54.120> go<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.420> animations<00:02:55.050> tab<00:02:55.320> on

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
chart then go to the animations tab on

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.309 
chart then go to the animations tab on
the<00:02:55.800> ribbon<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.910> we<00:02:57.060> want<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.360> look<00:02:57.540> at<00:02:57.720> custom

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
the ribbon you we want to look at custom

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.979 
the ribbon you we want to look at custom
animation<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.550> over<00:02:59.670> here<00:03:00.000> we<00:03:00.269> have<00:03:00.600> the

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
animation so over here we have the

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.259 
animation so over here we have the
dialog<00:03:01.410> box<00:03:01.680> now<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.519> course<00:03:02.700> I've<00:03:02.910> already

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
dialog box now of course I've already

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.259 
dialog box now of course I've already
applied<00:03:03.840> animation<00:03:04.800> or<00:03:04.980> using<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.519> mouse<00:03:05.819> click

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
applied animation or using a mouse click

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.809 
applied animation or using a mouse click
here's<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.410> gotcha<00:03:07.709> step<00:03:08.130> there's<00:03:08.400> nothing

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
here's the gotcha step there's nothing

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.640 
here's the gotcha step there's nothing
here<00:03:09.030> that<00:03:09.060> says<00:03:09.360> well<00:03:09.540> how<00:03:09.720> do<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.930> introduce

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
here that says well how do I introduce

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.890 
here that says well how do I introduce
one<00:03:11.190> series<00:03:12.000> or<00:03:12.860> one<00:03:14.090> category<00:03:15.090> at<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.330> time<00:03:15.569> so

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
one series or one category at a time so

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.750 
one series or one category at a time so
you<00:03:15.930> use<00:03:16.140> your<00:03:16.470> drop-down<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.459> come<00:03:17.579> down

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
you use your drop-down and come down

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.420 
you use your drop-down and come down
here<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.239> effect<00:03:18.930> options<00:03:19.320> over<00:03:20.130> here<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.340> the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
here to effect options over here in the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.550 
here to effect options over here in the
effect<00:03:20.790> options<00:03:21.390> dialog<00:03:21.810> box<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:22.230> see<00:03:22.260> this

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
effect options dialog box you see this

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.400 
effect options dialog box you see this
tab<00:03:22.890> for<00:03:23.670> chart<00:03:23.940> animation<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.019> see<00:03:25.200> I'm

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
tab for chart animation so you see I'm

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.340 
tab for chart animation so you see I'm
bringing<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.610> chart<00:03:26.940> elements<00:03:27.420> in<00:03:27.600> by<00:03:27.840> series

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
bringing the chart elements in by series

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.190 
bringing the chart elements in by series
the<00:03:28.590> series<00:03:28.769> are<00:03:29.190> New<00:03:29.579> York<00:03:29.880> Chicago<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.900> Los

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
the series are New York Chicago and Los

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.500 
the series are New York Chicago and Los
Angeles<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:32.280> other<00:03:32.310> choice<00:03:33.000> would<00:03:33.329> be<00:03:33.390> to

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
Angeles the other choice would be to

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.870 
Angeles the other choice would be to
bring<00:03:33.780> them<00:03:33.989> in<00:03:34.320> by<00:03:34.590> category<00:03:35.310> in<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.670> case

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
bring them in by category in that case

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.640 
bring them in by category in that case
that<00:03:36.090> would<00:03:36.180> be<00:03:36.329> quarter<00:03:36.720> one<00:03:36.989> quarter<00:03:37.290> two

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
that would be quarter one quarter two

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.069 
that would be quarter one quarter two
quarter<00:03:38.100> three<00:03:38.340> quarter<00:03:38.519> four<00:03:38.850> after<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:39.810> of

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
quarter three quarter four after that of

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.530 
quarter three quarter four after that of
course<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.470> have<00:03:40.739> other<00:03:41.070> choices<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.850> mentioned

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
course I have other choices I mentioned

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.000 
course I have other choices I mentioned
that<00:03:42.660> we<00:03:42.840> could<00:03:43.019> set<00:03:43.320> this<00:03:43.530> up<00:03:43.590> to

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
that we could set this up to

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.920 
that we could set this up to
automatically<00:03:44.970> appear<00:03:45.510> so<00:03:45.660> if<00:03:45.780> you're

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
automatically appear so if you're

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.610 
automatically appear so if you're
creating<00:03:46.769> your<00:03:46.950> PowerPoint<00:03:47.519> for<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.790> kiosk<00:03:48.329> or

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
creating your PowerPoint for a kiosk or

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.949 
creating your PowerPoint for a kiosk or
self-running<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.950> slide<00:03:50.609> show<00:03:51.120> then<00:03:51.600> you<00:03:51.810> would

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
self-running a slide show then you would

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.099 
self-running a slide show then you would
set<00:03:52.200> up<00:03:52.230> one<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:52.980> with<00:03:53.519> previous<00:03:54.120> or<00:03:54.420> after

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
set up one of the with previous or after

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.599 
set up one of the with previous or after
with<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.410> timing<00:03:55.980> so<00:03:56.160> it's<00:03:56.310> really<00:03:56.489> very

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
with the timing so it's really very

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.300 
with the timing so it's really very
simple<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.359> Gotcha<00:03:57.630> step<00:03:58.049> is<00:03:58.230> again<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:59.040> look

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
simple the Gotcha step is again to look

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.479 
simple the Gotcha step is again to look
over<00:03:59.640> here<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.239> say<00:04:01.109> what<00:04:01.620> are<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:02.070> effect

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
over here and say what are the effect

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.160 
over here and say what are the effect
options<00:04:02.760> that<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.450> want<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:04.079> apply<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:05.160> my<00:04:06.170> chart

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
options that I want to apply to my chart

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.789 
options that I want to apply to my chart
and<00:04:07.620> again<00:04:07.970> remember<00:04:08.970> don't<00:04:09.390> rely<00:04:09.900> upon<00:04:10.140> the

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
and again remember don't rely upon the

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.810 
and again remember don't rely upon the
numbers<00:04:11.370> alone<00:04:12.180> they<00:04:13.109> belong<00:04:13.739> in<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:14.220> handout

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
numbers alone they belong in the handout
