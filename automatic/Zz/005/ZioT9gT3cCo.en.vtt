 Spanish for yesterday 5.1.1 on the iphone 3gs 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:22.060
 iphone 4 iphone 4s and ipod touch 4g lo 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.920
 we have tested at all and they work for 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.230
 to be able to do this you have to have the 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.679
 device with jailbreak and how 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.010

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.839
 a very important one you have to make a 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.730
 Backup and Transfer Purchases 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:40.150
 on iTunes because there was a 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.190
 device that when restarting us no no 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.949
 it went on we were left with the apple of 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.960
 apple start and in the end we had to 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.239
 restore it by leaving it in mode 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.400
 recovery notwithstanding the second 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.860
 try with that same iphone we 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.080
 allowed normally 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.940
 if this happens to someone, we leave you 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.060
 a link to the video of how to leave the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.360
 iphone in recovery mode for 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.970
 can restore it and another link to another 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.960
 video of how to backup and 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.400
 another how to jailbreak in 5.1.1 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.140
 we leave everything written in the 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.350
 description to make you more comfortable 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.810
 in this video we have filmed the tutorial 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.620
 with an iphone 3gs and a demonstration 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.660
 iphone 4s iphone 4s do not need 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.460
 install siri only the servers in 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.750
 Spanish is very well explained the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.890
 description so we start first 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.000
 we check 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.000
 that this is an iphone 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.990
 3gs 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.630
 3gs with the version 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.740
 5.1.1 decide has installed 1.1 point 6 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.060
 we have to add this source 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.520
 there is hack store dotcom repo that would be 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.920
 within edit add and we write 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.099
 in Spanish it would be daughter that store puntocom 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.710
 for ripoll once added click 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.230
 ready we go inside 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.160
 we went down state 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.340
 until 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:31.290
 we have to install series for 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:34.390
 5.1 point x we install it occupies enough 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.940
 I recommend that you use wifi I go to 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.430
 cut the video until you download and 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.040
 gives us the option to make a jump 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.160
 we hit ping networks and we wait for it 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.160
 turn on 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.230
 we go back to cydia and in the same 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.230
 source 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.319
 we unload 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.400
 no idea 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.400
 and we installed it 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.739
 also after installing it we will 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.810
 ask us to make a king spring a 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.770
 restart 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.770
 we reset them 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.989
 normally when it lights up here we 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.290
 give the option or ask us if we want 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.500
 activate series 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.730
 as if it were the home screen of 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.950
 iPhone activation 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.959
 to me in this case he did not ask me because 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.700
 it's not the second time I do it in the 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.010
 first time if you gave me the option to 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.310
 activate it then if you ask what 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.550
 active jce and active is location a 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.060
 once installed we enter the icon 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:20.579
 series of r 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:23.909
 and in the lower part here we enter 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:28.169
 continue booking we select series in 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:31.400
 Spanish press disney's and then where 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.400
 a certificate 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.889
 we wait 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.620
 to cross to the window and now 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.620
 We press in series of r in Spanish 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.330
 we wait a few seconds 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.040
 and install the serial certificates 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.760
 we press install 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:02.230
 and install 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:04.150
 we press ok once this is done we can 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.409
 see that the certificates were installed 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.979
 here within settings 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:09.979
 general 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.200
 profile and it appears to us as we want 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:23.270
 uninstall click on delete once 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.270
 done this we reset the iphone 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:39.310
 once started what we do with 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.310
 a pin code 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.060
 we enter within settings 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.060
 general 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:55.710
 we activate it and we have to take into account 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:58.479
 that until the version ayo 6 comes out 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.659
 official for everyone only works 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:03.449
 with Spanish from the USA then it will work 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:05.860
 surely with a Spanish from Spain 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:08.339
 well we have it activated we are going to 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.339

 let's go into cydia to check 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.880
 the version in this case is 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:42.639
 iphone 4s with the 5.1.1 that in theory 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:45.280
 in this version I have installed if leader 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:48.400
 only 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.980
 I did not need to install series because 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.030
 had installed by default then 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.030

00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:37.349
 Spanish 

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.190
