00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.480 
a time capsule and I'm not really sure
whose<00:00:08.970> idea<00:00:09.330> it<00:00:09.420> was<00:00:09.450> but<00:00:09.960> knowing<00:00:10.920> that<00:00:11.130> when

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
whose idea it was but knowing that when

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.810 
whose idea it was but knowing that when
this<00:00:11.670> track<00:00:11.969> was<00:00:12.210> paved<00:00:12.540> in<00:00:12.719> 1958<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.889> then<00:00:14.610> in

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
this track was paved in 1958 and then in

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.180 
this track was paved in 1958 and then in
1978<00:00:15.719> only<00:00:15.960> two<00:00:16.170> inches<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.500> asphalt<00:00:17.039> were

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
1978 only two inches of asphalt were

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.519 
1978 only two inches of asphalt were
added<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.789> top<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.779> essence<00:00:19.410> we

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
added to the top of that in essence we

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.550 
added to the top of that in essence we
were<00:00:19.619> digging<00:00:19.859> up<00:00:20.130> 50<00:00:20.670> years<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.270> material<00:00:22.050> so

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
were digging up 50 years of material so

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.200 
were digging up 50 years of material so
i'm<00:00:22.710> not<00:00:22.890> sure<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.189> it'll<00:00:23.519> last<00:00:23.699> 50<00:00:24.060> more

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
i'm not sure that it'll last 50 more

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.849 
i'm not sure that it'll last 50 more
years<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.840> i<00:00:25.170> don't<00:00:25.320> want<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.500> be<00:00:25.560> around<00:00:25.650> in

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
years and i don't want to be around in

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.800 
years and i don't want to be around in
50<00:00:26.099> years<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.369> dig<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.609> up<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.570> time

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
50 years to dig it up but this time

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.470 
50 years to dig it up but this time
capsule<00:00:28.320> can<00:00:28.470> last<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:29.010> hundred<00:00:29.250> years<00:00:29.730> we

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
capsule can last a hundred years we

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.089 
capsule can last a hundred years we
expect<00:00:30.510> maybe<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.199> about<00:00:31.289> 20<00:00:31.650> years<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.980> will

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
expect maybe in about 20 years that will

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.920 
expect maybe in about 20 years that will
dig<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.520> up<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.790> see<00:00:33.059> what's<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:33.870> i

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
dig it up and see what's in it but i

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.270 
dig it up and see what's in it but i
wanted<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.290> point<00:00:34.440> out<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> couple<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> fun

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
wanted to point out a couple of the fun

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.590 
wanted to point out a couple of the fun
things<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:35.880> decided<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> put<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.660> there

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
things that we decided to put in there

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.360 
things that we decided to put in there
we<00:00:39.600> actually<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> piece<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.920> pothole

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
we actually have a piece of the pothole

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.130 
we actually have a piece of the pothole
that<00:00:41.879> we<00:00:42.000> decided<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> put<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.780> there<00:00:42.989> i

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
that we decided to put in there i

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.630 
that we decided to put in there i
figured<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.620> was<00:00:43.950> something<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.340> should

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
figured that was something that should

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.580 
figured that was something that should
live<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.149> memory<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.440> record

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
live on in memory and for the record

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.529 
live on in memory and for the record
that<00:00:46.980> what<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.340> yeah<00:00:47.520> no<00:00:48.239> that's

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
that what that is yeah no that's

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.090 
that what that is yeah no that's
actually<00:00:48.690> lime<00:00:49.050> rock<00:00:49.320> from<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.829> earlier

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
actually lime rock from that earlier

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.910 
actually lime rock from that earlier
okay<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.719> for<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.020> record<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.530> at<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
okay so and for the record we at the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.510 
okay so and for the record we at the
bottle<00:00:53.250> there<00:00:54.980> I'm<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> make<00:00:56.370> sure<00:00:56.399> that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
bottle there I'm going to make sure that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.240 
bottle there I'm going to make sure that
you<00:00:57.449> tell<00:00:57.660> them<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.960> whoa<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.649> we

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you tell them that I whoa but we

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.680 
you tell them that I whoa but we
actually<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.670> saved<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.120> concrete<00:01:00.510> patch

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
actually have saved the concrete patch

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.420 
actually have saved the concrete patch
that<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.020> used<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.530> we're<00:01:01.739> determining<00:01:02.250> what

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
that we used and we're determining what

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.529 
that we used and we're determining what
we<00:01:02.550> should<00:01:02.730> do<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.300> that

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
we should do with that I think that

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.109 
we should do with that I think that
should<00:01:03.750> live<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.650> infamy<00:01:04.799> here<00:01:05.309> someplace<00:01:05.610> on

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
should live in infamy here someplace on

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.660 
should live in infamy here someplace on

lime rock from the dirt track we also

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.830 
lime rock from the dirt track we also

advisory we did the press release and so

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.530 
advisory we did the press release and so
to<00:01:46.829> think<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.700> will<00:01:47.880> even<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.210> readable

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540

wherever you want to put it so I don't

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.750 
wherever you want to put it so I don't
need<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.510> Daytona<00:02:32.840> 500<00:02:33.439> and<00:02:33.769> a<00:02:34.069> lot<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.310> races

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
need a Daytona 500 and a lot of races

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.910 
need a Daytona 500 and a lot of races
after<00:02:34.909> that<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.269> can<00:02:35.359> be<00:02:35.450> real<00:02:35.720> exciting<00:02:36.200> it's

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
after that it can be real exciting it's

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.740 
after that it can be real exciting it's
going<00:02:37.099> to<00:02:37.220> be<00:02:37.340> it's<00:02:37.670> going<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.540> be<00:02:38.599> like<00:02:38.689> a

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
going to be it's going to be like a

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.300 
going to be it's going to be like a
Talladega<00:02:39.230> race<00:02:39.500> except<00:02:39.920> for<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.069> little

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
Talladega race except for a little

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.949 
Talladega race except for a little
smaller<00:02:40.790> racetrack<00:02:41.299> because<00:02:41.510> its<00:02:41.659> tracks<00:02:41.870> a

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
smaller racetrack because its tracks a

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.470 
smaller racetrack because its tracks a
lot<00:02:42.109> narrower<00:02:42.349> than<00:02:42.670> Talladega<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:43.909> I<00:02:44.269> think

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
lot narrower than Talladega and I think

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.610 
lot narrower than Talladega and I think
that's<00:02:44.659> just<00:02:44.840> going<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:45.049> be<00:02:45.079> an<00:02:45.200> incredible

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
that's just going to be an incredible

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.319 
that's just going to be an incredible
race<00:02:45.829> so<00:02:46.069> it's<00:02:46.519> going<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.730> be<00:02:46.819> fun<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.150> come

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
race so it's going to be fun to come

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.039 
race so it's going to be fun to come
here<00:02:47.599> there'll<00:02:48.500> be<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.650> lot<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.750> pressure<00:02:50.750> and

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
here there'll be a lot of pressure and

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.589 
here there'll be a lot of pressure and
prestige<00:02:51.590> about<00:02:52.220> winning<00:02:52.609> the<00:02:52.760> first<00:02:52.940> race<00:02:53.269> on

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
prestige about winning the first race on

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.530 
prestige about winning the first race on
the<00:02:53.750> new<00:02:53.900> asphalt<00:02:54.109> because<00:02:54.859> this<00:02:55.579> track<00:02:55.849> is

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
the new asphalt because this track is

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.059 
the new asphalt because this track is
soon<00:02:56.780> ominous<00:02:57.109> was<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.439> with<00:02:57.620> NASCAR
