they want to make sure that their stuff
lasts<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.300> long<00:03:03.450> time<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:04.080> holds<00:03:04.260> up<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.680> all

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
lasts a long time and it holds up to all

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.890 
lasts a long time and it holds up to all
the<00:03:04.980> frigid<00:03:05.430> conditions<00:03:05.640> all<00:03:06.120> over<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.720> world

the frigid conditions all over the world

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.110 
the frigid conditions all over the world
and<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.349> warm<00:03:07.530> conditions<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.849> they<00:03:08.970> had

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
and the warm conditions and so they had

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.000 
and the warm conditions and so they had
this<00:03:09.269> machine<00:03:09.480> where<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.440> boot<00:03:10.620> was<00:03:10.800> hooked

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
this machine where the boot was hooked

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.449 
this machine where the boot was hooked
up<00:03:11.099> to<00:03:11.159> the<00:03:11.340> binding<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.690> would<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.459> was

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
up to the binding and it would it was

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.690 
up to the binding and it would it was
just<00:03:14.670> flexing<00:03:15.150> back<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.659> forth<00:03:16.159> for<00:03:17.159> hours

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
just flexing back and forth for hours

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.550 
just flexing back and forth for hours
and<00:03:17.879> hours<00:03:17.970> days<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.480> days<00:03:18.659> weeks<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.409> weeks

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
and hours days and days weeks and weeks

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.869 
I don't know a year and this thing it
was<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.800> was<00:03:22.950> just<00:03:23.069> getting<00:03:23.370> its<00:03:23.519> wear<00:03:23.700> and

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
was it was just getting its wear and

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.059 
was it was just getting its wear and
tear<00:03:24.090> just<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.599> see<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.530> doesn't<00:03:25.769> break

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
tear just to see that it doesn't break

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.380 
tear just to see that it doesn't break
down<00:03:26.129> and<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.790> other<00:03:26.909> thing<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.180> was<00:03:27.330> really

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
down and the other thing that was really

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.910 
down and the other thing that was really
cool<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:28.470> they<00:03:28.590> could<00:03:28.650> actually

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
cool is that they could actually

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.039 
cool is that they could actually
physically<00:03:29.519> roll<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.120> machine<00:03:30.480> into<00:03:30.959> the

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
physically roll the machine into the

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.399 
physically roll the machine into the
refrigeration<00:03:31.620> system<00:03:32.090> -<00:03:33.090> -20<00:03:33.750> C<00:03:33.780> which<00:03:34.200> is

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
refrigeration system - -20 C which is

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:35.869 
refrigeration system - -20 C which is
you<00:03:34.920> know<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.159> coldest<00:03:35.489> were<00:03:35.610> allowed<00:03:35.849> to

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
you know the coldest were allowed to

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.940 
you know the coldest were allowed to
raise<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.299> World<00:03:36.480> Cup<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:37.049> it<00:03:37.590> was<00:03:37.739> really

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
raise the World Cup so it was really

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.350 
raise the World Cup so it was really
cool<00:03:38.159> to<00:03:38.340> see<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.640> thought<00:03:38.790> put<00:03:39.030> into<00:03:39.239> that

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
cool to see the thought put into that

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.759 
cool to see the thought put into that
and<00:03:41.030> entering<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.150> facility<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:43.080> seeing

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769
