00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 thank you very much list today 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.670
 we are opening section and it is called 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.589
 live gym in this section we are going to 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.150
 be talking a little bit of exercises 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.620
 maybe we will get some 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.049
 healthy eating all that 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.400
 you have to have in your daily life to 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.640
 maintain a balance that is very 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.070
 important and the first step is to win 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.109
 that feeling that feeling of rejection 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.539
 towards the exercise because everyone has 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.420
 past that when we're starting to 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.550
 exercise lazy daily 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.800
 next it hurts everything I do not know how to do it 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.780
 well that's not for me I'm not given 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.059
 then I promise you that if you 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.410
 they commit to me by changing their 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.239
 I'm going to help them change 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.129
 not only your body but a style of 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.809
 life and that you sit and watch sport 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.309
 then let's start with this 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.230
 first exercises are for the legs 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.879
 so that they have firm hard legs 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.520
 and everything in its place we are going to put the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.100
 feet slightly looking and tomas open 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.539
 that the height of the shoulders and opposite 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.710
 back straight and we're going to lower this 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.710
 squat come 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.840
 so 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.870
 3 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.100
 4 can continue as they are fixed 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.750
 stance always have to be in the 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.300
 Straight back is very important that no 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.610
 they joroben towards opposite and that they do not happen 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.740
 the angle of 90 degrees or that lower more 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.010
 beyond the knee with the tip of the foot 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.260
 because you can mention the second 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.670
 exercise are the exertions the 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.080
 exhaustion depends on how you do it 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.270
 you can work two body parts 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.890
 different from the quadriceps femoris and the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.479
 gluteus we're going to do in this 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.490
 moment is to work the quadriceps 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.880
 we are opposite and we are going to take the step 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:43.020
 short short and the knee that does not pass the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:45.940
 tip 1 we return to 2 change 3 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.680
 yes we can if we can this helps you 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.240
 the quadriceps if we can put on 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.119
 side so they give the movement as it is 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.119
 equal right 1 we return 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.240
 we can continue doing it 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.610
 already when they have something more experience 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.649
 as anatel you can add a little 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.810
 of weight and this will make it difficult for 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.360
 little more work and that helps 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.500
 development sounding for muscle mass is 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.989
 important as it is doing to the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.989
 celia that the knee does not pass the tip 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.790
 of the foot and that you never put the foot of the 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.489
 knee on the floor never because you can 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.500
 have injuries and good then with 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.569
 these exercises we will go unifying 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.459
 the leg let's go grabbing a little bit 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.410
 more of form and you go forward we give you 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.940
 imposing each time a little more than 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.130
 different things so they have 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.069
 variety is very easy they can do it in 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.989
 his house and well with some I 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.850
 I recommend about four series of 10 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.019
 repetitions each and with that is more 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.090
 enough for us to go 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:44.430
 starting but well this was the bbva 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.430
 gym and let's go with the specialists
