00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.150
 the girls are going to need to put the 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.900
 cauliflower 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.900
 To boil 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.530
 well in pieces 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:52.100
 they are a little soft the cauliflower 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.260
 not too soft for 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.430
 that they will not ruin us 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:03.409
 we take a tablespoon half a spoonful of 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:07.040
 salt and they are nothing else let them boil 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:11.030
 as for about 5 or 6 minutes with what 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.680
 They are soft not very soft because if 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.860
 they are not going to cheapen and we will not be able to 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.110
 I'll put them in the egg 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.710
 dripping there to be removed 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.800

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.050
 cauliflower in the egg 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.050
 good good good 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:39.310

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.030
 to the pan as is the oil 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.030

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.350
 well it's not so hot mine 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.350

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.509

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.860
 the sides 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.630
 and since they are golden brown then 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.450
 they pass 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.310
 to a container does not drain the 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.530
