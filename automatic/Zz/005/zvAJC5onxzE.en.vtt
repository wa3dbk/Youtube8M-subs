collagen elastin fibers break and

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.240 
collagen elastin fibers break and
deteriorate<00:05:45.300> you'll<00:05:45.930> cause<00:05:46.560> wrinkles<00:05:46.740> and

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250

the<00:05:47.400> damage<00:05:47.790> is<00:05:48.000> unrepairable<00:05:48.960> so<00:05:49.680> that<00:05:49.830> means

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
the damage is unrepairable so that means

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.710 
the damage is unrepairable so that means
it<00:05:50.280> doesn't<00:05:50.430> matter<00:05:50.640> if<00:05:50.850> you<00:05:51.060> are<00:05:51.120> a<00:05:51.390> girl<00:05:51.690> a
