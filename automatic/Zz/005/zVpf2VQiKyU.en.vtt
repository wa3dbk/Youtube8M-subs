00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
because there's like ambient radiation

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.670 
because there's like ambient radiation
in<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.700> air<00:03:53.760> this<00:03:54.600> then<00:03:54.900> turned<00:03:55.200> into<00:03:55.410> what

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
in the air this then turned into what

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.949 
in the air this then turned into what
has<00:03:55.920> become<00:03:56.220> seemingly<00:03:56.910> known<00:03:57.359> as<00:03:57.569> the

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
has become seemingly known as the

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.240 
has become seemingly known as the
neutron<00:03:58.319> cream<00:03:58.590> incident<00:04:00.590> where<00:04:01.590> this<00:04:01.829> this

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
neutron cream incident where this this

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.280 
neutron cream incident where this this
prank<00:04:02.730> became<00:04:03.239> more<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.660> more<00:04:03.780> elaborate<00:04:04.170> the

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
nevertheless I think there might be

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.850 
nevertheless I think there might be
these<00:05:15.120> piece<00:05:15.330> of<00:05:15.419> PSAs<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:16.050> it<00:05:16.320> started<00:05:16.740> with

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
these piece of PSAs and it started with

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.790 
these piece of PSAs and it started with
hi<00:05:17.520> I'm<00:05:17.880> the<00:05:18.060> actor<00:05:18.360> Karl<00:05:18.600> Urban<00:05:18.780> and<00:05:19.169> I'm<00:05:19.470> John

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
hi I'm the actor Karl Urban and I'm John

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.710 
hi I'm the actor Karl Urban and I'm John
Cho<00:05:20.100> which<00:05:20.760> I<00:05:20.940> thought<00:05:21.120> was<00:05:21.270> great<00:05:21.510> because<00:05:21.630> it

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
Cho which I thought was great because it

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.580 
Cho which I thought was great because it
implied<00:05:22.050> that<00:05:22.169> John<00:05:22.380> isn't<00:05:22.560> an<00:05:22.710> actor<00:05:26.000> so<00:05:27.590> so

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
implied that John isn't an actor so so

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.590 
implied that John isn't an actor so so
we<00:05:28.710> got<00:05:28.919> him<00:05:29.070> and<00:05:29.220> we<00:05:29.250> got<00:05:29.400> him<00:05:29.550> really<00:05:29.820> bad<00:05:30.000> to

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
we got him and we got him really bad to
