00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
my pointer in my ring but you should

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.040 
my pointer in my ring but you should
practice<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:22.950> over<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.790> over<00:02:23.940> again<00:02:24.209> with

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
practice this over and over again with

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.680 
practice this over and over again with
each<00:02:25.200> finger<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.030> can<00:02:27.180> do<00:02:27.269> this<00:02:27.390> anywhere

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
each finger and you can do this anywhere

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.780 
each finger and you can do this anywhere
in<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.959> fretboard<00:02:28.200> ok<00:02:28.620> but<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:29.370> for<00:02:29.610> another

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
in the fretboard ok but so for another

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.890 
in the fretboard ok but so for another
example<00:02:30.060> let's<00:02:30.239> go<00:02:30.300> down<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> fifth<00:02:30.780> fret

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
example let's go down to the fifth fret

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.780 
example let's go down to the fifth fret
and<00:02:31.830> i'm<00:02:32.040> going<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.220> put<00:02:32.340> my<00:02:32.370> pointer<00:02:32.760> finger

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
and i'm going to put my pointer finger

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.930 
and i'm going to put my pointer finger
on<00:02:33.150> let's<00:02:33.420> say<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.470> e-string<00:02:34.890> ok<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.459> I'm

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
on let's say the the e-string ok and I'm

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.670 
on let's say the the e-string ok and I'm
going<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.090> hammer<00:02:36.299> on<00:02:36.390> with<00:02:36.930> my<00:02:37.110> thumb<00:02:37.410> I'm

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
going to hammer on with my thumb I'm

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.670 
going to hammer on with my thumb I'm
sorry<00:02:38.519> not<00:02:38.610> my<00:02:38.670> thumb<00:02:38.910> my<00:02:39.110> middle<00:02:40.110> finger<00:02:40.319> ok

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
sorry not my thumb my middle finger ok

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:51.949 
sorry not my thumb my middle finger ok
so<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:49.739> this<00:02:50.370> gets<00:02:50.549> really<00:02:50.970> boring<00:02:51.420> believe

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
so and this gets really boring believe

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.190 
so and this gets really boring believe
me<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:53.209> this<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.360> about<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.750> speed<00:02:55.019> that<00:02:55.140> I

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
me so this is about the speed that I

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.259 
me so this is about the speed that I
would<00:02:55.380> start<00:02:55.650> at<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.069> then<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.060> work<00:02:57.239> your

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
would start at and then you work your

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.690 
would start at and then you work your
way<00:02:57.450> up<00:02:57.540> with<00:02:58.140> everything<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:59.370> learning

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
way up with everything in and learning

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.970 
way up with everything in and learning
the<00:02:59.819> guitar<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.239> learn<00:03:00.390> really<00:03:00.840> slow<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.440> you

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
the guitar you learn really slow and you

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.670 
the guitar you learn really slow and you
work<00:03:02.160> your<00:03:02.190> way<00:03:02.370> up<00:03:02.459> also<00:03:03.180> do<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.359> pinky<00:03:07.880> and

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
work your way up also do the pinky and

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.180 
work your way up also do the pinky and
practice<00:03:10.680> each<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:11.040> these<00:03:11.130> four<00:03:11.579> I'd<00:03:12.329> say<00:03:13.190> it's

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
practice each of these four I'd say it's

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.890 
practice each of these four I'd say it's
it's<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.459> good<00:03:14.609> exercise<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:15.150> do<00:03:15.239> each<00:03:15.510> one<00:03:15.720> for

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
it's a good exercise to do each one for

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.630 
it's a good exercise to do each one for
about<00:03:16.109> a<00:03:16.140> minute<00:03:16.410> move<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.220> all<00:03:17.310> around<00:03:17.340> the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
about a minute move it all around the

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.240 
about a minute move it all around the
fretboard<00:03:17.880> um<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:19.530> know<00:03:19.620> even<00:03:19.739> do<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.040> up<00:03:20.130> a

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
fretboard um you know even do it up a

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.370 
fretboard um you know even do it up a
lot<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.820> high<00:03:20.970> frets<00:03:21.359> it<00:03:21.959> just<00:03:22.200> uh<00:03:22.260> it

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
lot of the high frets it just uh it

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.440 
lot of the high frets it just uh it
really<00:03:22.890> helps<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:23.579> explore<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:24.180> learn<00:03:24.209> the

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
really helps you explore and learn the

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.130 
really helps you explore and learn the
flip<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:25.049> fretboard<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.850> if<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.390> do<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.900> I'd

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
flip the fretboard so if you do that I'd

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.080 
flip the fretboard so if you do that I'd
say<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.380> minute<00:03:28.859> every<00:03:29.310> exercise<00:03:29.609> and<00:03:29.940> just

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
say a minute every exercise and just

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.580 
say a minute every exercise and just
kind<00:03:30.209> of<00:03:30.239> move<00:03:30.390> around<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.630> fretboard<00:03:30.870> you'll

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
kind of move around the fretboard you'll

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.319 
kind of move around the fretboard you'll
be<00:03:31.739> good<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.100> just<00:03:32.220> keep<00:03:32.400> working<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.090> sender

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
be good and just keep working the sender

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.180 
be good and just keep working the sender
you're<00:03:33.420> playing<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:33.959> make<00:03:34.620> sure<00:03:34.650> now<00:03:35.070> I'll

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
you're playing and make sure now I'll

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.099 
you're playing and make sure now I'll
show<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.400> I'll<00:03:35.609> move<00:03:35.820> my<00:03:36.030> metronome<00:03:36.390> up<00:03:36.750> to

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
show you I'll move my metronome up to

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.710 
show you I'll move my metronome up to
about<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.470> hundred<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:38.040> this<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.299> speed<00:03:39.600> that

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
about a hundred and this the speed that

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.110 
about a hundred and this the speed that
I<00:03:39.780> kind<00:03:40.140> of<00:03:40.350> practice<00:03:40.709> that<00:03:40.890> have<00:03:40.980> been<00:03:41.130> bad

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
I kind of practice that have been bad

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.140 
I kind of practice that have been bad
lately<00:03:42.390> but<00:03:43.160> so<00:03:44.160> it's<00:03:44.280> faster<00:03:44.519> right<00:03:44.910> now<00:03:45.030> it's

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
lately but so it's faster right now it's

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:56.500 
lately but so it's faster right now it's
about<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.359> hundred<00:03:45.569> and<00:03:45.810> ten<00:03:46.340> so

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.550 

so<00:03:57.510> they<00:03:57.690> get<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.960> point<00:03:58.080> that's<00:03:58.230> pretty<00:03:58.500> easy

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
so they get the point that's pretty easy

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.590 
so they get the point that's pretty easy
you<00:03:59.280> could<00:03:59.400> also<00:03:59.550> do<00:03:59.790> multiple<00:04:00.210> hammer-ons

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
you could also do multiple hammer-ons

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.990 
you could also do multiple hammer-ons
and<00:04:00.750> how<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:01.020> works<00:04:01.260> is<00:04:01.530> let's<00:04:02.400> go<00:04:02.760> back<00:04:02.970> down

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
and how that works is let's go back down

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.670 
and how that works is let's go back down
to<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:05.160> fifth<00:04:05.580> fret<00:04:05.730> g<00:04:06.390> string<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:07.020> what<00:04:07.560> you

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
to the fifth fret g string and what you

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.130 
to the fifth fret g string and what you
can<00:04:07.830> do<00:04:07.980> is<00:04:08.340> do<00:04:08.880> a<00:04:08.910> three-way<00:04:09.360> hammer<00:04:09.600> on<00:04:09.810> ok

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
can do is do a three-way hammer on ok

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.630 
can do is do a three-way hammer on ok
and<00:04:10.170> this<00:04:10.380> this<00:04:10.650> is<00:04:10.770> where<00:04:10.980> it<00:04:11.310> gets<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.520> little

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
and this this is where it gets a little

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.180 
and this this is where it gets a little
bit<00:04:11.790> tricky<00:04:12.030> so<00:04:12.720> I'm<00:04:12.870> going<00:04:13.170> to<00:04:13.230> hammer<00:04:13.470> on<00:04:13.620> to

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
bit tricky so I'm going to hammer on to

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.970 
bit tricky so I'm going to hammer on to
my<00:04:14.310> middle<00:04:14.670> finger<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.180> then<00:04:15.630> my<00:04:15.810> pinky<00:04:16.200> ok<00:04:16.920> so

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
if something like this and I'm also

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:28.220 
if something like this and I'm also
doing<00:04:18.450> it<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.350> beat<00:04:19.530> too<00:04:19.770> so<00:04:27.110> there<00:04:28.110> we<00:04:28.200> go

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
doing it to the beat too so there we go

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:40.130 
doing it to the beat too so there we go
off<00:04:28.350> on<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.620> beat<00:04:38.480> that's<00:04:39.480> a<00:04:39.660> good<00:04:39.810> one<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:39.990> do

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
off on the beat that's a good one to do

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.490 
off on the beat that's a good one to do
then<00:04:40.680> also<00:04:40.860> switch<00:04:41.220> it<00:04:41.340> up<00:04:41.430> let's<00:04:41.670> do<00:04:42.230> let's<00:04:43.230> do

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
then also switch it up let's do let's do

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.320 
then also switch it up let's do let's do
without<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.370> middle<00:04:44.580> finger<00:04:44.850> so<00:04:45.030> we'll<00:04:45.150> do

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
without the middle finger so we'll do

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.540 
without the middle finger so we'll do
our<00:04:45.710> let's<00:04:46.710> go<00:04:46.800> down<00:04:46.950> here<00:04:47.010> we'll<00:04:47.310> do<00:04:47.400> our

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
our let's go down here we'll do our

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.760 
our let's go down here we'll do our
pointer<00:04:48.300> finger<00:04:48.660> or<00:04:48.840> ring<00:04:48.900> finger<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:49.620> then

pointer finger or ring finger and then

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.990 
pointer finger or ring finger and then
our<00:04:49.890> pinkie<00:04:50.220> so<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:56.340> every<00:04:56.490> time<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:56.760> beat

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
our pinkie so so every time that beat

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000 
our pinkie so so every time that beat
hits<00:04:57.330> my<00:04:57.840> pinky<00:04:58.200> is<00:04:58.260> touching<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:58.680> screen
