but<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.729> time<00:01:44.970> we've<00:01:45.899> GTA<00:01:46.259> an<00:01:46.470> actual<00:01:46.740> full

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
but this time we've GTA an actual full

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.190 
but this time we've GTA an actual full
game<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.000> install<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.750> 5<00:01:48.990> grand

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
game you have to install it for 5 grand

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.630 
game you have to install it for 5 grand
it<00:01:49.409> takes<00:01:49.530> about<00:01:49.619> five<00:01:49.890> minutes<00:01:50.130> before<00:01:50.399> you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
it takes about five minutes before you

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.999 
it takes about five minutes before you
can<00:01:50.790> actually<00:01:50.939> play<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.509> now<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.500> reckon<00:01:52.890> this

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
can actually play it now I reckon this

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.969 
can actually play it now I reckon this
is<00:01:53.040> because<00:01:53.430> when<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.509> enter<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> VEC<00:01:55.200> there

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
is because when you enter the VEC there

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.249 
is because when you enter the VEC there
is<00:01:56.100> no<00:01:56.219> loading<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.659> example<00:01:57.750> when<00:01:58.170> you

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
is no loading so for example when you

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.870 
is no loading so for example when you
enter<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.560> building<00:01:58.770> when<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.399> go<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> another

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
enter a building when you go to another

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.149 
enter a building when you go to another
island<00:02:00.329> there's<00:02:00.450> no<00:02:00.540> loading<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.560> i<00:02:01.590> reckon

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
island there's no loading so i reckon

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.679 
island there's no loading so i reckon
this<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.310> how<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> rockstar<00:02:02.850> get<00:02:03.030> surrounded<00:02:03.479> by

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
this is how a rockstar get surrounded by

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.410 
this is how a rockstar get surrounded by
including<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.700> fried<00:02:05.700> minute<00:02:06.000> mandatory

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
including this fried minute mandatory

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.930 
including this fried minute mandatory
install<00:02:07.099> but<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> one-off<00:02:08.610> you

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
install but this is a one-off you

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.760 
install but this is a one-off you
install<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.270> once<00:02:09.629> when<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.259> first<00:02:10.470> hit<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770

game five minutes and then

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.160 
game five minutes and then
