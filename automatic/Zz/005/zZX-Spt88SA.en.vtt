00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
and then lastly if we could just for a

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.740 
and then lastly if we could just for a
moment<00:03:49.920> think<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.489> Microsoft<00:03:51.030> isn't<00:03:51.480> just

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
moment think the Microsoft isn't just

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.080 
moment think the Microsoft isn't just
some<00:03:52.050> evil<00:03:52.440> corporation<00:03:53.130> although<00:03:53.520> yes<00:03:53.820> their

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
some evil corporation although yes their

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.570 
some evil corporation although yes their
bottom<00:03:54.480> line<00:03:54.690> is<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.200> simply<00:03:55.530> make<00:03:55.680> money<00:03:55.980> this

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
bottom line is to simply make money this

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.840 
bottom line is to simply make money this
could<00:03:56.850> also<00:03:57.150> be<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.900> peek<00:03:58.560> into<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.160> future<00:03:59.280> and

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
could also be a peek into the future and

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.699 
could also be a peek into the future and
if<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.120> have<00:04:00.300> things<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.720> come<00:04:00.959> maybe
