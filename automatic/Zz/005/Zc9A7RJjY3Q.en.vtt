00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670

women's tennis has improved in recent

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.970 
women's tennis has improved in recent
years<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.460> level<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.939> play<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.560> really<00:00:22.560> really

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
years the level of play is really really

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.980 
years the level of play is really really
high<00:00:23.189> they're<00:00:23.550> hitting<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> ball<00:00:24.150> incredibly

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
high they're hitting the ball incredibly

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.640 
high they're hitting the ball incredibly
hard<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:26.029> they<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.210> all<00:00:27.420> become<00:00:27.869> incredibly

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
hard and they have all become incredibly

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.950 
hard and they have all become incredibly
fit<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.310> move<00:00:29.670> around<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.119> court<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.689> lot

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
fit and move around the court a lot

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.030 
fit and move around the court a lot
better<00:00:31.790> now<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> result<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:34.040> we

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
better now the result of that is that we

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.819 
better now the result of that is that we
see<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.550> lot<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.880> really<00:00:36.840> hard<00:00:37.170> hitting<00:00:37.620> from

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
see a lot of really hard hitting from

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.330 
see a lot of really hard hitting from
the<00:00:37.980> baseline<00:00:38.840> what<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:39.960> don't<00:00:40.140> see<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the baseline what we don't see is the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.310 
the baseline what we don't see is the
women<00:00:41.670> opening<00:00:42.210> up<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.480> court<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.050> much

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
women opening up the court so much

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.470 
women opening up the court so much
that's<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.190> big<00:00:44.340> difference<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> men<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
that's the big difference to the men the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.340 
that's the big difference to the men the
men<00:00:45.690> get<00:00:45.930> more<00:00:46.219> topspin<00:00:47.219> into<00:00:47.520> their<00:00:47.670> shots

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
men get more topspin into their shots

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.229 
men get more topspin into their shots
they<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.590> more<00:00:49.980> movement<00:00:50.700> especially<00:00:50.879> on

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
they have more movement especially on

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.080 
they have more movement especially on
the<00:00:51.329> forehand<00:00:51.719> side<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.620> around<00:00:53.550> their<00:00:53.730> hand

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
the forehand side and around their hand

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.939 
the forehand side and around their hand
and<00:00:54.480> their<00:00:54.780> prestretching<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.559> forearm

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
and their prestretching the forearm

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.040 
and their prestretching the forearm
muscles<00:00:56.309> more<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.270> allows<00:00:57.629> them<00:00:57.989> to

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
muscles more and this allows them to

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.619 
muscles more and this allows them to
open<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> court<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.520> lot<00:00:59.820> more<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.449> that's

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
open up the court a lot more so that's

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.590 
open up the court a lot more so that's
really<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.989> big<00:01:01.320> difference<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> see

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
really the big difference that I see

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.929 
really the big difference that I see
also<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> women's<00:01:04.110> side<00:01:04.460> very<00:01:05.460> few<00:01:05.729> women

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
also on the women's side very few women

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.870 
also on the women's side very few women
hit<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.960> defensive<00:01:07.590> slice<00:01:07.860> backhand<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.700> think

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
hit a defensive slice backhand I think

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.640 
hit a defensive slice backhand I think
that<00:01:09.030> will<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.330> great<00:01:09.630> addition<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.200> many

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
that will be a great addition for many

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.300 
that will be a great addition for many
players<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.460> order<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.830> simply<00:01:13.830> stay<00:01:14.070> in

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
players in order to simply stay in

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.910 
players in order to simply stay in
rallies<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> lot<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.330> times<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.869> see<00:01:16.110> women<00:01:16.680> on

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
rallies a lot of times I see women on

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.280 
rallies a lot of times I see women on
defense<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.610> backhand<00:01:18.030> side<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.750> they

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
defense on the backhand side and they

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.499 
defense on the backhand side and they
simply<00:01:19.710> hit<00:01:19.860> another<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.520> hard<00:01:20.880> backhand

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
simply hit another really hard backhand

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.060 
simply hit another really hard backhand
back<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> problem<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
back and then the problem is that the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.100 
back and then the problem is that the
court<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.460> open<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> defensive<00:01:24.540> slice<00:01:24.869> in

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
court is open so a defensive slice in

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.600 
court is open so a defensive slice in
that<00:01:25.140> situation<00:01:26.090> would<00:01:27.090> certainly<00:01:27.479> be<00:01:27.869> useful

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
that situation would certainly be useful

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.249 
that situation would certainly be useful
now<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.670> other<00:01:29.880> thing<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.930> serves

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
now the other thing I see is that serves

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.410 
now the other thing I see is that serves
have<00:01:31.560> certainly<00:01:31.950> improved<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.090> women's

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
have certainly improved on the women's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.830 
have certainly improved on the women's
tour<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:34.320> lot<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.040> girls<00:01:35.490> are<00:01:35.640> serving<00:01:36.150> 180

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
tour a lot of girls are serving 180

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.289

these women that are playing that are
hitting<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.299> ball<00:02:42.510> hard<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.280> would<00:02:44.280> make

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
hitting the ball hard and would make

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.300 
hitting the ball hard and would make
life<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.940> lot<00:02:45.120> easier<00:02:45.709> so<00:02:46.709> that's<00:02:46.950> kind<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.190> what

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
life a lot easier so that's kind of what
