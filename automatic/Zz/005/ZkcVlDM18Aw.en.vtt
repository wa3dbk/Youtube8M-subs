00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.570 
big test for us just to see how we are
at<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.990> beginning<00:03:22.140> in<00:03:22.620> terms<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:23.010> chemistry

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
at the beginning in terms of chemistry

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.050 
at the beginning in terms of chemistry
because<00:03:23.760> we<00:03:23.970> haven't<00:03:24.300> really<00:03:24.420> had<00:03:24.709> time<00:03:25.709> to

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
because we haven't really had time to

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.520 
because we haven't really had time to
build<00:03:27.060> lines<00:03:27.420> yet<00:03:27.840> but<00:03:28.080> we've<00:03:28.230> been<00:03:28.380> working

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
build lines yet but we've been working

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.380 
build lines yet but we've been working
on<00:03:28.800> a<00:03:28.830> system<00:03:29.100> so<00:03:29.520> it's<00:03:29.670> going<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.910> be<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.060> test

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
on a system so it's going to be a test

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.600 
on a system so it's going to be a test
to<00:03:30.540> see<00:03:30.780> if<00:03:31.020> we<00:03:31.740> can<00:03:31.920> just<00:03:31.950> put<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.400> stuff

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
to see if we can just put that stuff

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.199 
to see if we can just put that stuff
together<00:03:32.820> on<00:03:33.060> our<00:03:33.209> own<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:35.180> hopefully<00:03:36.180> our

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
together on our own so hopefully our

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.760 
together on our own so hopefully our
game<00:03:36.480> goes<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.900> this<00:03:37.050> weekend<00:03:37.410> I'm<00:03:37.500> really

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770

Jersey and actually skate against

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.120 
Jersey and actually skate against
another<00:03:42.750> team<00:03:43.020> instead<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.500> playing<00:03:43.739> against

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
another team instead of playing against

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.729
