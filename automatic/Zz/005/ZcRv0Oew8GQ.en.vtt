and<00:00:03.270> overall<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:03.929> general<00:00:04.259> idea<00:00:04.529> for<00:00:04.830> how<00:00:04.950> to

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
and overall the general idea for how to

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.410 
and overall the general idea for how to
avoid<00:00:05.339> baits<00:00:05.609> when<00:00:05.850> it<00:00:05.970> comes<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.299> being

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
avoid baits when it comes to being

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.440 
avoid baits when it comes to being
ganked<00:00:06.750> let's<00:00:07.350> get<00:00:07.529> started<00:00:07.940> now<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.000> key<00:00:09.300> to

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
ganked let's get started now the key to

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.180 
ganked let's get started now the key to
avoiding<00:00:09.540> Bates<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.230> actually<00:00:10.559> fairly<00:00:10.740> simple

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
avoiding Bates is actually fairly simple

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.400 
avoiding Bates is actually fairly simple
if<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.429> can<00:00:11.580> understand<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.269> but<00:00:12.750> first<00:00:13.049> you

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
if you can understand it but first you

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.709 
if you can understand it but first you
need<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.590> be<00:00:13.769> aware<00:00:14.040> when<00:00:14.099> you're<00:00:14.429> vulnerable

you're vulnerable now a gank may happen

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.250

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
situations is going on and above all

situations is going on and above all
else<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> opponent's<00:00:38.969> have<00:00:39.059> players

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
else of the opponent's have players

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.880 
else of the opponent's have players
missing<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> map<00:00:40.020> especially<00:00:40.739> their

missing on the map especially their

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.290 
missing on the map especially their
jungler<00:00:41.160> then<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.520> gank<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.120> possible

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
jungler then the gank is just possible

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.110 
jungler then the gank is just possible
in<00:00:42.719> general<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.680> track<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> enemy<00:00:44.370> players<00:00:44.640> by

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
in general so track the enemy players by

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.670 
in general so track the enemy players by
constantly<00:00:45.539> checking<00:00:45.899> your<00:00:46.110> mini-map<00:00:46.440> in

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
constantly checking your mini-map in

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.610 
constantly checking your mini-map in
predicting<00:00:47.219> their<00:00:47.340> movements<00:00:48.379> anyways<00:00:49.379> when

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
predicting their movements anyways when

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.020 
predicting their movements anyways when
it<00:00:49.710> comes<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.980> avoiding<00:00:50.280> Bates<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.789> all

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
it comes to avoiding Bates it's all

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.060 
it comes to avoiding Bates it's all
about<00:00:51.059> reading<00:00:51.600> body<00:00:51.780> language<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.590> by<00:00:53.039> that

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
about reading body language and by that

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.069 
about reading body language and by that
I<00:00:53.430> mean<00:00:53.670> judging<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.239> way<00:00:54.390> your<00:00:54.629> puns<00:00:54.870> are

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
I mean judging the way your puns are

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.560 
I mean judging the way your puns are
acting<00:00:55.590> most<00:00:56.219> players<00:00:56.489> will<00:00:56.730> go<00:00:56.879> aggressive

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
acting most players will go aggressive

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.630 
acting most players will go aggressive
when<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> gank<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.350> coming<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:58.949> they<00:00:59.399> play<00:00:59.609> a

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
when a gank is coming if they play a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.790 
when a gank is coming if they play a
passive<00:01:00.149> or<00:01:00.329> defensive<00:01:00.750> often<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.440> then

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
passive or defensive often and then

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.380 
passive or defensive often and then
suddenly<00:01:02.160> turn<00:01:02.399> aggressive<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:03.030> little<00:01:03.270> to

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
suddenly turn aggressive for little to

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.179 
suddenly turn aggressive for little to
no<00:01:03.480> reason<00:01:03.870> or<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.650> reason<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.159> can't

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
no reason or for a reason that you can't

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.000 
no reason or for a reason that you can't
figure<00:01:05.580> out<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:06.119> gank<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.810> likely<00:01:07.350> since<00:01:07.830> their

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
figure out a gank is likely since their

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.740 
figure out a gank is likely since their
body<00:01:08.220> language<00:01:08.400> shows<00:01:08.880> but<00:01:09.390> they<00:01:09.479> have<00:01:09.630> an

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
body language shows but they have an

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.530 
body language shows but they have an
ally<00:01:10.049> coming<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.760> however<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:12.030> method<00:01:12.240> only

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
ally coming in however this method only

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.510 
ally coming in however this method only
works<00:01:12.689> if<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.560> them<00:01:13.740> being<00:01:13.920> passive<00:01:14.430> /

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
works if you see them being passive /

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.399 
works if you see them being passive /
defensive<00:01:15.030> earlier<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.990> make<00:01:16.200> sure<00:01:16.229> that

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
defensive earlier so make sure that

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.990 
defensive earlier so make sure that
you're<00:01:16.619> always<00:01:16.799> observing<00:01:17.369> your<00:01:17.580> opponent's

play style as a sudden change in it this
is<00:01:20.520> indicative<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.939> something<00:01:21.450> coming<00:01:21.810> in
