okay so after the roll is undone what we
do<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.700> we<00:00:05.819> have<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:05.970> couple<00:00:06.299> of<00:00:06.420> tags<00:00:06.629> on<00:00:06.899> here

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
do is we have a couple of tags on here

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.299 
do is we have a couple of tags on here
that<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.350> wanted<00:00:07.589> for<00:00:07.740> you<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.919> pay<00:00:08.069> close

that I wanted for you to pay close
attention<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.880> first<00:00:09.840> one<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.139> going<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.349> be

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
attention to first one is going to be

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.749 
attention to first one is going to be
how<00:00:10.769> you're<00:00:10.950> going<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.099> roll<00:00:11.280> out<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.580> liner

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
how you're going to roll out the liner

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.249 
how you're going to roll out the liner
some<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.150> them<00:00:12.300> will<00:00:12.420> actually<00:00:12.450> say<00:00:12.900> roll<00:00:13.110> out

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
some of them will actually say roll out

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.959 
some of them will actually say roll out
the<00:00:13.410> width<00:00:13.590> most<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.429> them<00:00:14.549> are<00:00:14.639> gonna<00:00:14.730> say

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
the width most of them are gonna say

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.430 
the width most of them are gonna say
roll<00:00:15.150> out<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.450> length<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.289> this

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
roll out the length so in this

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.109 
roll out the length so in this
particular<00:00:16.980> case<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:17.340> do<00:00:17.460> have<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.730> liner<00:00:17.940> in

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
particular case we do have the liner in

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.189 
particular case we do have the liner in
the<00:00:18.180> proper<00:00:18.510> place<00:00:18.720> because<00:00:18.930> we're<00:00:19.050> going<00:00:19.140> to

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
the proper place because we're going to

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.019 
the proper place because we're going to
roll<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.410> out<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.740> length<00:00:19.949> secondly<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
roll it out the length secondly is a

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.269 
roll it out the length secondly is a
tracking<00:00:21.449> tag<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:21.900> have<00:00:22.109> should<00:00:23.070> match

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
tracking tag that we have should match

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.590 
tracking tag that we have should match
your<00:00:23.519> packing<00:00:23.910> slip<00:00:24.090> it's<00:00:24.240> going<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.510> an

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
your packing slip it's going to have an

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.910 
your packing slip it's going to have an
order<00:00:24.840> number<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.199> one<00:00:25.380> happens<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.740> be<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
order number this one happens to be a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.950 
order number this one happens to be a
stock<00:00:26.220> roll<00:00:26.519> it'll<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.390> master<00:00:27.779> roll

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
stock roll it'll have a master roll

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.300 
stock roll it'll have a master roll
number<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.529> don't<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:28.769> your<00:00:28.920> width<00:00:29.130> and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
number on it don't have your width and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.470 
number on it don't have your width and
your<00:00:29.369> length<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:29.760> I'll<00:00:29.849> just<00:00:29.970> check<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.330> make

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
your length so I'll just check and make

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.569 
your length so I'll just check and make
sure<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.900> matches<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.920> our<00:00:32.130> operator

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
sure that that matches as our operator

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.819 
sure that that matches as our operator
and<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> data<00:00:33.210> was<00:00:33.360> actually<00:00:33.570> done<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.440> then

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
and the data was actually done and then

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.470 
and the data was actually done and then
also<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.430> tracking<00:00:35.880> number<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.300> we

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
also we have a tracking number that we

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.760 
also we have a tracking number that we
can<00:00:36.660> track<00:00:36.870> back<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.290> make<00:00:37.380> sure<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.649> you

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
can track back and make sure that you

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.740 
can track back and make sure that you
have<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.070> right<00:00:38.250> liner<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:39.180> we're<00:00:39.570> going<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
have the right liner so we're going to

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.750 
have the right liner so we're going to
make<00:00:40.140> sure<00:00:40.350> if<00:00:40.500> maybe<00:00:40.770> if<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.460> cut<00:00:41.640> that

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
make sure if maybe if you can cut that

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.250 
make sure if maybe if you can cut that
out<00:00:41.820> or<00:00:42.149> keep<00:00:42.239> track<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.540> where<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.870> sack<00:00:43.110> is

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
out or keep track of where that sack is

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.389 
out or keep track of where that sack is
if<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.590> problem<00:00:43.980> that's<00:00:44.100> some

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
if you have a problem that's some

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.440 
if you have a problem that's some
information<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:45.000> we're<00:00:45.149> gonna<00:00:45.270> need<00:00:45.329> to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
information that we're gonna need to

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.750 
information that we're gonna need to
know<00:00:45.690> ok<00:00:46.680> we'll<00:00:46.829> roll<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:46.980> out<00:00:47.129> for<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.399> okay

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
know ok we'll roll it out for you okay

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.000 
know ok we'll roll it out for you okay
so<00:00:48.420> we've<00:00:48.690> got<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.020> liner<00:00:49.230> unwrapped<00:00:49.770> and

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
so we've got the liner unwrapped and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.680 
so we've got the liner unwrapped and
ready<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> go<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.760> proper<00:00:51.090> place<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.570> we're

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
ready to go in the proper place so we're

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.939 
ready to go in the proper place so we're
going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> show<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.050> how<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> unroll<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.800> real

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
going to show you how to unroll it real

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:10.060 
going to show you how to unroll it real
quick<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:53.460> go

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.800 

when<00:01:10.610> you<00:01:10.670> get<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.910> liner<00:01:11.120> unrolled<00:01:11.600> make

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
when you get the liner unrolled make

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.180 
when you get the liner unrolled make
sure<00:01:11.930> that<00:01:12.110> you<00:01:12.230> have<00:01:12.380> an<00:01:12.590> equal<00:01:12.860> amount<00:01:12.950> of

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
sure that you have an equal amount of

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.830 
sure that you have an equal amount of
liner<00:01:13.430> on<00:01:13.670> both<00:01:13.820> sides<00:01:14.090> of<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.360> rink<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:14.750> I'm

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
liner on both sides of the rink so I'm

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.970 
liner on both sides of the rink so I'm
actually<00:01:15.020> going<00:01:15.260> to<00:01:15.320> pull<00:01:15.500> it<00:01:15.620> this<00:01:15.740> way<00:01:15.950> a

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
actually going to pull it this way a

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
actually going to pull it this way a
little<00:01:16.040> bit<00:01:16.250> because<00:01:16.430> we<00:01:16.580> had<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.730> little<00:01:16.820> bit

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
little bit because we had a little bit

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:32.240 
little bit because we had a little bit
extra<00:01:17.210> on<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.450> other<00:01:17.600> side

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.160 

we've<00:01:33.250> got<00:01:33.400> a<00:01:33.430> good<00:01:33.640> amount<00:01:33.820> of<00:01:33.940> liner<00:01:34.180> on<00:01:35.020> the

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
we've got a good amount of liner on the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.110 
we've got a good amount of liner on the
side<00:01:35.440> here<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:36.040> be<00:01:36.160> able<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.550> come<00:01:36.760> up<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.000> over

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
side here to be able to come up and over

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.460 
side here to be able to come up and over
the<00:01:37.270> board<00:01:37.510> so<00:01:37.750> now<00:01:37.870> we're<00:01:37.960> gonna<00:01:38.080> find<00:01:38.380> the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
the board so now we're gonna find the

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.130 
the board so now we're gonna find the
edges<00:01:39.030> you're<00:01:40.030> gonna<00:01:40.180> have<00:01:40.360> two<00:01:40.540> edges<00:01:40.930> to<00:01:41.050> the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
edges you're gonna have two edges to the

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.570 
edges you're gonna have two edges to the
liner<00:01:41.350> you're<00:01:41.500> gonna<00:01:41.620> have<00:01:41.770> an<00:01:41.860> usually<00:01:42.520> an

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
liner you're gonna have an usually an

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.780 
liner you're gonna have an usually an
open<00:01:42.850> end<00:01:43.000> on<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.180> top<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:45.070> a<00:01:45.160> single<00:01:45.520> edge<00:01:45.610> on

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
open end on the top and a single edge on
