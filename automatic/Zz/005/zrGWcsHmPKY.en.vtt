I'm making a video reviewing this versus

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.990 
I'm making a video reviewing this versus
the<00:01:13.200> phone<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.780> other<00:01:15.780> iphone<00:01:16.320> my<00:01:16.830> iphone<00:01:17.520> 4

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
the phone like other iphone my iphone 4

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.440 
the phone like other iphone my iphone 4
so<00:01:18.540> between<00:01:18.830> these<00:01:19.830> two<00:01:20.100> right<00:01:20.250> here<00:01:20.280> i<00:01:20.640> have

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
so between these two right here i have

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.420 
so between these two right here i have
both<00:01:21.720> Iowa<00:01:22.080> side<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.470> solve<00:01:22.650> nuts<00:01:22.890> basically

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
both Iowa side and solve nuts basically

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.140 
both Iowa side and solve nuts basically
and<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.729> which<00:01:23.850> one's<00:01:24.090> faster<00:01:24.540> um<00:01:25.939> do<00:01:26.939> that's

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
and see which one's faster um do that's

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.560 
and see which one's faster um do that's
so<00:01:27.479> difference<00:01:28.320> between<00:01:28.680> them<00:01:29.030> have<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> case

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
so difference between them have the case

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.179 
so difference between them have the case
on<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.439> basically<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:32.100> like

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
on this one but it basically it's like

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.600 
on this one but it basically it's like
it's<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.479> an<00:01:33.630> all<00:01:33.810> black<00:01:34.400> so<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.520> have

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
it's just it's an all black so you have

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.190 
it's just it's an all black so you have
I<00:01:35.700> do<00:01:35.939> prefer<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.420> white<00:01:36.540> one<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.020> I
