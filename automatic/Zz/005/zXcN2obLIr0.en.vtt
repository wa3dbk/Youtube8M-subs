00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.450
 they know 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.319
 for twente 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:11.549
 most fans of the airport 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.150
 thanks to very exciting and very good authors that people might be the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.509
 best of the netherlands and that the fans are wondering also see a nice one 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.439
 gesture ps and the supporters 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.329
 but they were reduced to Feyenoord 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.329
 what ran according to brewer and not in the game of twente 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.460
 he therefore wants to fall into the same 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.670
 for its side they said yes sorry but i think i was there was nothing 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.850
 had been going on but he did not enjoy it anymore 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.730
 in May that remained 0 0 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.800
 us a difficult competition for us 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.740
 what do you think it should show how much the team is once again formal seats 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.780
 quite a bit different 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.100
 they pulled forward 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.230
 asml a real fall a person's hair 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.780
 can be for that and the experienced and for your team still well attuned to each other 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.900
 so we have declined and recorded great confidence in the currency 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.980
 it would then be competitive immediately 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.660
 if you look at the preparations for the look at the big games 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.500
 this even meter against quick boys 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.540
 but that the contest against the verdict 8 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.130
 we have 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.150
 not too thunderous 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.950
 I am not backwards 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.260
 from a structural feed when it remained sixth it is the charter 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.860
 from 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.360
 taken a hearing but to rain on their best after which the legs 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.360
 see this week though that is right 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.540
 but of the only rider and we are sure that the hold we played so well 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.740
 and 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.040
 yes now just come to the points again 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.410
 the exit number three goals with diplomas to do rutte goes 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.930
 if you did not want to hear a moment during the extension 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.469
 let us know then we or the region of 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.330
 we are not dangerous snakes 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.080
 and then I listen to where three channels died the other clubs were 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.350
 for a free kick 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.269
 tomasson 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.409
 but I am confident that he missed a fair in Renesse 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.799
 and at least the plan happened 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.129
 roda jc needs to watch out for fc twente 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:18.379
 Yes definitely
