00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 welcome all subscribers and viewers 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.080
 channel today we will open on the power block 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.290
 functions which is intended for 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.210
 motorization of different sets of lego te on 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.379
 back side of the box we can 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.600
 see what awaits us in this set also 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.850
 On the box there is a mark that in this on 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.490
 water included batteries here 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.070
 sure boxes will come in handy we can 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.289
 find a booklet which describes what 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.750
 exactly the models we can analyze with 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.079
 using this set but it shows 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.050
 Set from old years since 80 293 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.879
 started producing and in 2008 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.980
 however, it is applied from 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.399
 modern sets one of them is you 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.200
 see in the next review 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.420
 besides electrical elements which 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.730
 we will look at the last in the set 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.300
 you discover the following mechanical 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:00.479
 3 cardan elements 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.479
 [music] 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.780
 three small gears with 8 teeth 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.979
 [music] 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.310
 bigger gear with twenty four 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:21.380
 other specially white gear 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:27.800
 which I will tell later as well as two 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:30.440
 gray Russian size of 5 units and here 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.659
 the most interesting electronics for 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.580
 Convenience Some modules I have arranged 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.680
 on server plate which is natural 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.470
 not included in the kit in front of us 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.899
 battery box orange switch 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.509
 has 3 positions when it is in the middle 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.550
 battery pack is turned off but depending 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.800
 from that we switch it to the left or 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.780
 right motors connected to 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.009
 the battery pack will be rotated into that 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.080
 or other side 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.569
 this device is powered by six 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.640
 finger batteries no charger 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.310
 there is no device for it so we 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.840
 will have to charge the batteries separately 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.009
 or buy new batteries let's 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.080
 try to connect 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.690
 the only engines that are in 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.910
 this set is the so-called m 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.610
 engine this engine can be 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.019
 used by many different 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.329
 mechanisms but its power and 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.970
 torque is not enough for example 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:25.549
 in order to move the big league 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.510
 typewriter more often used for this 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.790
 other engines as you can see the switch 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.829
 on battery box and successfully changes 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.890
 motor rotation direction 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:39.769
 and now I will show why you need both 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.750
 white gear thing is that when 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.609
 motor lacks rotational 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.980
 moment to commit any 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:48.380
 action then in theory he should just 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.840
 stop but it can lead to 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.660
 engine breakdown but it will help us out 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.640
 white gear when I block it 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.400
 the engine still continues to rotate 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.040
 he does not stop his work and not 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.610
 will be damaged 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.290
 [music] 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:09.700
 you and I have two more modules left 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.110
 light bulbs and switch 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.990
 connect them directly to the battery pack 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.120
 and the engine is connected to the switch 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:23.219
 there is also a special connector for this 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.219
 [music] 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.500
 [music] 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.540
 essentially the switch performs the same 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.110
 function as the orange lever on 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.640
 battery pack in neutral 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.340
 device modules connected to this 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.920
 two other positions will not work 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.710
 include devices and if it is an engine 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.630
 up change its direction of rotation in 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.900
 in general, I already say this when I told 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.900
 about the battery pack and finally two 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:58.690
 light bulbs they are very bad but 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.690
 glows pretty bright them immediately noticeable 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.199
 [music] 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.479
 I want to show you a list of which 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.580
 initially sold without engines but 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.229
 has a motorization function using 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.720
 recruitment which we are with you today 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.240
 considered in sets as much as 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.460
 the rule is already put and the battery pack and 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.069
 motor truth lights not so often 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.229
 come across in general if serious 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.590
 planning to get acquainted with a series of technician 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.539
 then this set will definitely come in handy 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.639
 if the review was helpful then surely 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.560
 like and subscribe to the channel 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.259
 and of course I'm glad when you share 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.180
 my videos but I am still waiting for you to be interesting 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.750
 questions in the comments about this 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.389
 recruitment 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.090
 maybe you want to learn more before 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:02.680
 the next review in it we just 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.680
 applicable this set
