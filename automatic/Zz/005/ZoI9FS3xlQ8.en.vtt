00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.790
 the bamboo belongs to a huge 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.710
 family in the bamboo world ago 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.200
 many differences in normans 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.430
 about 75 different people to miss 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.430
 more known on the fid is acquired 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.300
 this one for example it is a strong desire 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.400
 be aware that most are 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.740
 originating from china region for 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.989
 best known who are the yunnan locate him 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.790
 we planted a lighthouse josiah augusta 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.019
 for that was so piece that's the case 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.149
 the biggest development in europe 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.550
 which is about 7 meters high 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.350
 in my imagination the good end is 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.820
 whoever has big canes 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.230
 when I think of my taste, we think of 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.659
 fello star who is this one thinks of this 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.280
 shock effect at the volume level it is rather 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.780
 to work by isolating the loaders 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.399
 and we do not have the same thing at all 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.780
 rather a shock effect have certainly but 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.190
 much finer is what we see 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.230
 rather well it is rather the grace of the 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.180
 foliage things will push some 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.550
 next to each other so 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.800
 very tight a bamboo non traces and 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.410
 no risk it happens to my neighbor 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.970
 the rhizomes remains clustered so he's not going 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.830
 not to be invasive must know the 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.690
 development of far josiah is less 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.429
 faster than that of phyllostachys the 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.200
 do I said is bamboo type 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:16.060
 saas peter very used in small 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.920
 gardens they are also very well suited 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.320
 for pot culture a real 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.240
 ornamental utility isolated by their 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.460
 port and how they develop 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.409
 each year its diameter 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.599
 circumference will grow loads 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.459
 always having a port more or less 

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:32.649
 will say a little redundant now that 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:34.780
 repeat is absolutely falling so 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.000
 this one has the characteristic really 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.170
 to adapt to all regions ago 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.789
 we will say two varieties 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.590
 among the gesir beacons that fits well 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.880
 precisely to the heat that are soft 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.660
 of course for the name of europe but 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.910
 also for the south 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.890
 it's the far more robusta we have 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.030
 so here next to us and another who 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.110
 is right on the other side which is the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.280
 lighthouse josiah I confess 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.770
 the lighthouse josiah these benefits are only getting 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.510
 size no maintenance we'll say at 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.000
 after 18 months because they concern 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.500
 watering that's important and at the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.660
 planting it is not necessary to 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.460
 put a barrier to limit his 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.860
 development as we see it 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.870
 she who develops in the natural state 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.250
 what are the other flagship varieties 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.900
 like that in the vase 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.490
 finally I said to ruffec is very well known 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.100
 very common which is a very good 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.450
 drought resistance in particular that 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.040
 a development around 2 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.320
 meters high there is the josiah lighthouse 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.209
 jouzou which is very very rustic 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.090
 they are very well off cold 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.880
 also to drought just a year ago 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.920
 here also me who is quite prevalent the 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.720
 only small flat is that he resists 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.090
 at 10 degrees man there is a lighthouse 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.440
 zianides to for heat so both 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.370
 who fear nothing is robusta 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.170
 junaidi ni tida ruffat in court ima je 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.730
 prefers the northern climates of 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.800
 europe what advice we have nothing 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.440
 given to plant the sweets what 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.320
 whatever the varieties need a 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.840
 well-drained soil and a rather ph 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.489
 slightly acidic it is necessary not to 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.290
 plant how do you whatever the 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.290
 variety in a land that holds 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.240
 he
