00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 today's movie food sells movie 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.230
 Galician called 18 food 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.880
 he is very well known leaves us with water 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.040
 in the mouth all the time 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.320
 he tells several stories that are going on 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.780
 around the table in one of them a 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.570
 character prepares a fish in crust of 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.609
 salt that is the preparation today this recipe 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.000
 it may seem difficult to do more 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.859
 it easy here have a mullet 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.960
 a pound and a half but can be any 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.810
 another whole fish that got a 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.850
 Always thoroughly clean to spice crust 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.620
 make the fish even more tasty I 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.440
 I'll put fresh herbs 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.809
 here I have mint and marjoram 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.809
 basil that I'm going to be well mixed 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:49.379
 But I booked a sprig of each one 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:51.660
 to vote in the fish cavity now 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.030
 mix in a serving bowl and two 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.770
 pounds of coarse salt, it is important to use the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.809
 its too thick for him not to salt so much 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.300
 fish because what I want to form 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:06.240
 a crust that holds every unit of the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.820
 load and within it the guys are going to 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.450
 glue of this crust mingles 4 in the sky 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.450
 temperate 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.270
 a whole fish limb with this mixture of 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.340
 salt 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.680
 be careful to cover the sides too. 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.730
 so that all steam is concentrated 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.730
 inside the house 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.659
 bring to a preheated oven below 50 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.909
 degrees and sliding for about 45 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.460
 minutes because until the heat reaches the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.270
 sea fish a little and do not worry 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.270
 he will not be 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.350
 if the fish accompanied by two lemons in 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.330
 and olive oil and can serve 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.990
 like rice or just a small salad 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.610
 even for super lightweight 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.560
 I really think the most things 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.650
 important events in life happen 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.650
 from the table and you a kiss and until the next
