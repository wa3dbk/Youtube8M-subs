(Nigeria Bus Driver - only on BattaBox)
We park there, Lasman would just come 
 and say Park and start to beat us and collect our money.

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:12.685
They beat us well well

00:00:17.527 --> 00:00:21.527
Now it's more than 10 years

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:33.367
The business is okay i thank God, because i 
 feed myself,my wife and pay house rent

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:45.907
The only one problem in this business is Lasman and Police

00:00:47.432 --> 00:00:54.432
Lasman and Police would just come and stay at 
 the bus-stop the Governor built for us

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.290
We park there, Lasman would just come and say Park 
 and start to beat us and collect our money.

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:08.316
They beat us well well, maybe because i'm a driver

00:01:07.714 --> 00:01:15.714
They will ask me to come down, give me blow on my hand, give me 
 blow on my head, because they want to pursue me from my bus

00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:26.334
I will park at the bus-stop, they will say they want to 
 arrest me that i did not park at the normal bus-stop

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:41.430
Bail is Starting from N10,000, N7,000. If you get 
 help, they might collect N8,000 or N9,000

00:01:41.558 --> 00:01:49.560
If you don't see a person you know, they won't leave you 
 except they ticket your motor, or carry you to Alausa

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.560
I can't count it

00:01:57.993 --> 00:02:08.990
I feel if this Governor's term finishes now, let another man 
  take over.
