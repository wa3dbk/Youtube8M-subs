00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:12.150
 good man is still dark outside yes 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.240
 Here you can always watch nothing going on outside 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.130
 everything is dark here 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.680
 we were just thinking of ideas today 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.949
 You always find that pretty cool the day 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.720
 begins here with a 0.7 liter is 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.560
 lemon that's already there is already 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.580
 my creative in it and ssc-trainer 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.840
 because you know you are the capsules 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.460
 not so good you do not need around 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.630
 Flame is free to get it for free 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.890
 try to expand it simple 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.620
 buy something when I'm not anymore 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.820
 I want to take it that way it is 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.370
 By the way , my hair is already there 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.899
 but it has become extremely white 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.539
 otherwise skin is technically I have nothing 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.129
 detected 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.320
 I pull the rhine and then there is 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.020
 here again the pulp d3 and b12 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.399
 with 5000 international units so 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.050
 since then I take that with me 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.460
 all together already that b12 video 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.199
 done and I really have to say that 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.500
 makes blatant what that has to do 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.210
 necessarily profile profile but be with 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.799
 1000 international units world 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.080
 theirs generally do not come far think 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.260
 That's why I can only recommend 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.400
 and here is my screen and me 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.950
 then turn on again once the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.830
 Breakfast is so then I am again 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.520
 Here is the breakfast of the breakfast mountain 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:24.420
 Sure, a huge thing is me 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.680
 I have an oat vanilla this time 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.080
 taken 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.150
 from Cologne or do I believe the hot ones 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.610
 know exactly what you see I change there 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.259
 always important by the seeds 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.650
 Flaxseed quite important for an omega 3 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.729
 and just keep the grains and fruits 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.869
 little wise the bears for the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.869
 antioxidants 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:48.840
 the whole thing is partly the same 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:53.100
 1476 calories for breakfast 40 grams 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.470

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.810

 At the start breast comes yes I'm full 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.469

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.710
 Now I 'm pulling some bta aslan 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.890

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.750

 it is a luxury product i have that 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.100
 Feeling that I have the feeling it is 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.870
 so if i have no two weeks now 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.160
 bhs taken that my regeneration 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.570
 got worse again 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.030
 Now I'll take it back now 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.910
 regeneration better in training or 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.630
 After training I train myself and 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.180
 I'm going to make some now 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.150
 sweet potato fries and then I switch 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.210
 Just come back so this is so 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.400
 Sweet potatoes are finished by the mountain 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.490

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.310

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.790
 recipe in a nutshell finished the whole thing 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.040
 now 20 grams of protein 984 calories 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.410
 a total of 26 grams carbohydrates its 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:08.190
 and say no more than 1.7 grams of fat 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.870
 So lohfeld the very best 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.610
 then the pcs has eleven 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.580
 I have 30 grams of protein protein 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.740
 moved in here after training 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.620
 the dirty here also the bta of 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.030
 750 calories 11 grams of protein barely fat 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.310
 and carbohydrates 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.300
 she is not so tragic and I'm pulling 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.480
 this in now 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.830
 so we see our friends is light 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.960
 bad again I have the here now 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.130
 the lamp unfortunately mainz living room but 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.440
 I did something about it 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.620
 but I think I'm fine, too 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.410
 pull me now purely plate bread yes and 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.730
 Although I have a rewe the stuff 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.470
 how to get really horny nutella bread 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.930
 118 calories 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.880
 I have to look because I have it with me 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.650
 thinner yes so in any case we have 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:00.160
 21 grams of fat 43 grams of carbohydrates and 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.990
 420 calories in total most of the time I 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.500
 so the bras with it are one 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.850
 we have to count that up a bit 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.230
 but I can now technically 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.870
 bad is not possible 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:15.330
 and then there are 40 grams of dried 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.299
 mango stripes 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.720
 here we have fled from the flames 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.920
 the co 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:30.060
 yes we know percent discount 38 grams 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:37.440
 nuts nuts are also in snacks 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:39.330
 Here, the 13 grams of fat, and 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.730
 plums and the stomach where they have to 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.400
 a team 50 calories 63 grams 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.460
 carbohydrates hardly fat and a bit 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:51.480
 better and then there's two more later 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.950
 Checks I think we'll see that then 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.470
 Here I am again at the start 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.270
 I now have a problem I can 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.310
 somehow not exactly say 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.770
 the meeting because that's all now 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.220
 there are snacks here and there are 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.560
 Now here's another peanut butter bread 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.020
 with jam and so the worries 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.970
 wholemeal bread that I still pull myself in 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.860
 and then I go to the museum 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:20.970
 purely a fruit music and too good 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:25.890
 Finally there's a raise 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:29.690
 Swing the check I just starting from 1q 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:32.460
 we do not need but 20 grams 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.470
 a little bit of protein or a map yes 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.590
 right there we have 20 grams so who 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.560
 However, it is the teeth shaker as 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.390
 protein with taste and I switched 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.190
 with a 1 music it will be that too 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.169
 last for today I'm going now 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.030
 another smoothie next to it is the 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.480
 mixer I have mine here in it so 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.530
 here the asstel come in there the data 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:06:01.740
 come therefore another first graf 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:02.990
 two apples two apples and water 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.030
 Of course it is clear 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:10.530
 so that would be the day ended around 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:14.580
 Day ends with 4087 calories 116 or 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:17.550
 say 117 grams of protein 7 139 grams 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:22.020
 carbohydrates and 67 grams of fat 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:24.360
 that's the way it looks 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.789
 I'm really shoveling everything right now 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.560
