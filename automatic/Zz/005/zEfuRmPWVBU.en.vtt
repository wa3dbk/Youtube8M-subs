00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
this is his reasoning between why the PS

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.090 
this is his reasoning between why the PS
why<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.120> ps4<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.690> outside<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.110> xbox<00:00:52.590> one<00:00:52.829> he

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
why that ps4 is outside the xbox one he

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.979 
why that ps4 is outside the xbox one he
says<00:00:53.309> people<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:54.059> been<00:00:54.180> more<00:00:54.360> satisfied

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
says people have been more satisfied

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.920 
says people have been more satisfied
with<00:00:55.020> xbox<00:00:55.649> 360<00:00:56.250> than<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> ps3<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.780> that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
with xbox 360 than the ps3 so in that

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.930 
with xbox 360 than the ps3 so in that
respect<00:00:58.140> they<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:58.980> less<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> need<00:00:59.789> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
respect they have less of the need to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.849 
respect they have less of the need to
upgrade<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> short<00:01:00.930> term<00:01:01.109> due<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.500> regular

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
upgrade in the short term due to regular

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.939 
upgrade in the short term due to regular
updates<00:01:02.430> for<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> xbox<00:01:03.120> 360<00:01:03.660> let<00:01:04.619> me<00:01:04.710> shorten

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
updates for the xbox 360 let me shorten

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.820 
updates for the xbox 360 let me shorten
that<00:01:05.220> for<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.610> he<00:01:06.360> says<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> xbox<00:01:07.320> 360

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
that for you he says that the xbox 360

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.580 
that for you he says that the xbox 360
is<00:01:07.979> better<00:01:08.189> than<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> ps3<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
is better than the ps3 so because the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.270 
is better than the ps3 so because the
ps3<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.220> worse<00:01:11.610> than<00:01:11.820> xbox<00:01:12.240> 360<00:01:12.869> ps3<00:01:13.830> owners

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
ps3 is worse than xbox 360 ps3 owners

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.630 
ps3 is worse than xbox 360 ps3 owners
have<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.670> upgrade<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:16.080> ps4<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.920> that's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
have to upgrade to the ps4 and that's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.170 
have to upgrade to the ps4 and that's
his<00:01:17.820> reasoning<00:01:18.890> really<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.820> your

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
his reasoning really that is your

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.060 
his reasoning really that is your
reasoning<00:01:21.600> that's<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.020> best<00:01:22.380> defense<00:01:22.890> you

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
reasoning that's the best defense you

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.420 
reasoning that's the best defense you
could<00:01:23.250> come<00:01:23.400> up<00:01:23.430> with<00:01:24.439> saw<00:01:25.439> something<00:01:26.159> tells

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
could come up with saw something tells

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.370 
could come up with saw something tells
me<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.880> he's<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.600> get<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.780> little<00:01:27.930> slap

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
me that he's going to get a little slap

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.660 
me that he's going to get a little slap
on<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.619> wrist<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.280> or<00:01:29.460> something

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
on the wrist for this or something

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.240 
on the wrist for this or something
because<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.140> stupidest<00:01:31.799> statement

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
because this is the stupidest statement

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.219 
because this is the stupidest statement
I've<00:01:32.400> ever<00:01:32.640> heard<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.970> my<00:01:33.090> life<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.079> because

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
I've ever heard of my life so because

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.160 
I've ever heard of my life so because

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
our last product was worse the new ones

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.870

with<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.959> connector<00:03:31.350> do<00:03:31.500> anything<00:03:31.890> with<00:03:32.040> it

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
with the connector do anything with it

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.979 
with the connector do anything with it
so<00:03:32.610> basically<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.239> goes<00:03:33.390> back<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.959> same

think<00:03:47.580> this<00:03:47.700> is<00:03:47.820> a<00:03:47.850> promise<00:03:48.060> they<00:03:48.299> need<00:03:48.480> to

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
think this is a promise they need to

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.300 
think this is a promise they need to
break<00:03:48.810> but<00:03:49.049> developers<00:03:49.500> probably<00:03:50.010> not<00:03:50.130> too

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
break but developers probably not too

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.229 
break but developers probably not too
happy<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:50.970> my<00:03:51.930> final<00:03:52.110> loose<00:03:52.440> for<00:03:52.650> today<00:03:52.860> is

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
like the buttons on the back like a

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.910 
like the buttons on the back like a
normal<00:04:06.810> stuff<00:04:07.019> does<00:04:07.260> if<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:07.530> guys<00:04:07.709> never

of<00:04:10.799> duty<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:11.370> think<00:04:11.730> it's<00:04:11.850> like<00:04:12.000> 75<00:04:12.450> percent<00:04:12.959> of

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
of duty I think it's like 75 percent of

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.710 
of duty I think it's like 75 percent of
professional<00:04:13.500> teams<00:04:13.739> I'll<00:04:13.950> use<00:04:14.190> them<00:04:14.720> pretty

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
professional teams I'll use them pretty

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.969 
professional teams I'll use them pretty
much<00:04:15.840> when<00:04:15.989> it<00:04:16.019> does<00:04:16.200> it's<00:04:16.410> got<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.650> buttons

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
much when it does it's got the buttons

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.140 
much when it does it's got the buttons
on<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.190> back<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:17.519> you<00:04:17.609> don't<00:04:17.640> need<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:17.940> touch

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150
