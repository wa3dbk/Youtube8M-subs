00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.859
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.740
 new video on the channel chic hat 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.049
 Today, everyone has the right focus 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.610
 in the picture design and that is what I have 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.220
 i was at one of you a few days ago 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.150
 exhibition and I have it all 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.480
 horrible pictures seen 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.220
 I keep seeing that yes that 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.830
 beginners do not know exactly how to do that 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.930
 focus point sets correctly respectively 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.040
 Just do not pay attention and 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.660
 I can notice that the absolute 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.250
 looks awful what they are doing 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.239
 or so and the one person in the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.610
 Exhibition where the winter is there 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.559
 Apparently there has not been issued any 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.530
 I just wanted to have experience now 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.670
 let's do the video and you can 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.430
 explain again 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.870
 with the right focus it finds 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.020
 actually one of the most important 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.039
 Fixing the photograph for the golden one 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.739
 cut and and the picture design 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.119
 in general, the focal point it first yes 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.430
 on the subject of patrons in portraits are yes 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.770
 mostly eyes in the game and here too 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.310
 or here especially should be on 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.770
 always be sharp in every case 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.520
 the picture just seems pretty 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:24.360
 unprofessional and quite strange 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.400
 if the eyes are out of focus exceptions 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.060
 confirm the rule here too 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.740
 but I think at 95 or 99 98 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.200
 percent of the pictures are really 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.400
 so that the eyes should be sharp because 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.320
 the picture is simply not us 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.790
 Great 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.500
 it is the same with animal portraits 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.790
 my eyes should be sharp too 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.590
 I've been pretty annoyed 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.220
 I had a great who in front of the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.700
 camera 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.530
 and then that was about 6 o'clock in the morning 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.899
 most of the pictures were somehow 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.759
 shaky synonymous with iso 2500 or 3200th 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.049
 and an image schaaf however, was of 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.670
 to create the beak 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.610
 I've been quite annoyed 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.140
 because 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.200
 You rarely get motive before 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.539
 the camera and here it is 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.370
 especially important that the eyes are sharp 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.930
 are 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.130
 let's somehow look stupid 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.170
 it is the same with insects, that is 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.110
 yes i the most important rule the eyes 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.450
 should always be sharp 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.250
 at macro photography insects so yes 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.500
 pay attention that the eyes are shaafs 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.420
 not any mistakes but the ones 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.540
 eyes 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.180
 It's just standard now I have 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.370
 Listen carefully enough 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.390
 just that the eyes schafschur 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.160
 and and that applies approximately at yes at 95 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.340
 percent of images and exceptions 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.959
 confirm as always the rule 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.080
 then we come to other motives 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.670
 Another motive yes we stay again 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.310
 short at macro photography 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.440
 who flowers him here for a short time 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.110
 in blooms where should the sharpness 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.910
 point there are the best if the 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.300
 in most pictures 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.340
 if you photographed flowering now 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.660
 should be best in any case 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.560
 he mostly man in the middle who likes 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.299
 I should say 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.220
 the parts with the pollen sharp 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.290
 because they have so many fine ones 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.980
 nose many fine details and are too 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.810
 First of all very interesting and afterwards 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.340
 so they somehow also quite 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.000
 if the background is sharp and 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.680
 the front is a bit out of focus and that is yes 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.959
 actually rather the motive 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.540
 fine nuances in the middle is not 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.280
 are sharp 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.260
 Of course you can also on the 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.480
 petals can make it sharp 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.380
 still on the camera position 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.680
 and yes, I have only one other 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.610
 example image and indeed the rosehip 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.780
 just have to be representative 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.940
 for all macro also look like this 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.950
 any 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.590
 Actually, it is also appropriate 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.480
 Just look at the end for example 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.570
 the apple style or just above at the 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.340
 Rosehip on this black black 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.440
 about to sharply on this black tyler 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.780
 because yes, the views of the 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.650
 observers simply headed there 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.750
 and that just looks good because 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.230
 otherwise I would not have anything in it 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.300
 picture motive and generally should the 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.720
 focus point to be used yes the 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.940
 image statement to amplify and the eyes 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.560
 to guide the viewer 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.250
 maybe a story to tell 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.700
 and the picture statement just so positive 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.250
 to influence then again what is in the 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.290
 level with the sharp point thus animals 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.030
 then you should take pictures as well 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.070
 always exactly the sharp point in the 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.890
 You are looking for a level now, for example 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.750
 plant several like this 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.790
 stand next to each other and then in the 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.200
 can see different sharpness 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.240
 always remember which one 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.540
 most striking plant is on which one 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.080
 which one wants to emphasize somehow or 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.570
 Whatever I say now 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.090
 must now with a motive if one 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.770
 now represents such a smaller group 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.820
 it is probably most often as a 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:22.490
 best if you are the first motive 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:26.480
 Sharp because that's easy 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.340
 even so the motive does not work then 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.680
 consistent if somehow one of 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.900
 inside or from them middle flowers 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.780
 is now focused on the example 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.940
 flowers and then somehow something 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.070
 blurred because it depends on it or something 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.620
 you can do that differently too 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.270
 Landscapes use that yes the 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.970
 foreground and creates a frame 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.920
 That's nice again 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.140
 So depending on how the effect wanted 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.400
 is or not I am 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:57.440
 I hope you could with the video 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.670
 something now to help you and best 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.090
 it is easy at the 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.500
 many time to let image design 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.080
 static 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.870
 landscape photography still life and such 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.960
 continue and there at every recording about it 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.990
 think about where you are best in now 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.120
 sharp point down and then if 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.980
 automatically synonymous the images better all the more 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.490
 more you pay in a picture invested 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:24.010
 with the static motives all the better 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.870
 they are usually tried as well 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.430
 I'm convinced by myself 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.500
 that they will get better 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.740
 and I think I will be 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.090
 at street photography and at 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.630
 sportfotografie there something different 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.280
 but at landscapes still life macros 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.130
 and so on it is really real 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.570
 that's how many people look at it 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.910
 this video here on the channel 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.910
 send a hat and see you next video
