00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.980 

the<00:00:01.500> power<00:00:01.709> for<00:00:01.949> we're<00:00:02.220> going<00:00:02.340> to<00:00:02.429> be<00:00:02.990> fitting

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
the power for we're going to be fitting

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.510 
the power for we're going to be fitting
the<00:00:04.080> bump<00:00:04.259> on<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.470> undercarriage<00:00:04.890> so<00:00:05.220> take

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
the bump on the undercarriage so take

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.290 
the bump on the undercarriage so take
that<00:00:05.549> six<00:00:06.120> millimeters<00:00:06.600> group<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.049> just

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
that six millimeters group and just

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.610 
that six millimeters group and just
place<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.599> hole<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.050> you'll<00:00:10.200> notice

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
place it in the hole and you'll notice

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.499 
place it in the hole and you'll notice
as<00:00:10.830> well<00:00:11.010> on<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.519> other<00:00:11.670> side<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.330> you've

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
as well on the other side that you've

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.710 
as well on the other side that you've
got<00:00:12.750> two<00:00:13.710> little<00:00:13.889> lugs<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:15.410> the<00:00:16.410> one<00:00:16.590> hole<00:00:17.720> so

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
got two little lugs and the one hole so

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.260 
got two little lugs and the one hole so
put<00:00:19.260> your<00:00:19.470> screw<00:00:20.220> through<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.000> line

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
put your screw through and the line

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.460 
put your screw through and the line
those<00:00:22.230> two<00:00:22.590> pins<00:00:22.920> up<00:00:23.840> onto<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> side<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.199> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
those two pins up onto the side of the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.429 
those two pins up onto the side of the
undercarriage<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:27.050> then<00:00:28.369> just<00:00:29.369> gently<00:00:29.670> screw

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
undercarriage and then just gently screw

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.880 
undercarriage and then just gently screw
that<00:00:31.439> down<00:00:31.800> into<00:00:32.160> position<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:33.860> need<00:00:34.860> a

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
that down into position I need a

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.100 
that down into position I need a
magnetic<00:00:35.550> screwdriver<00:00:35.790> for<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.020> we

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
magnetic screwdriver for this so that we

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.709 
magnetic screwdriver for this so that we
can<00:00:37.260> get<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.640> screw<00:00:38.640> into<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.030> hole<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.540> know

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
can get the screw into the hole you know

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.400 
can get the screw into the hole you know
how<00:00:39.870> much<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.200> love<00:00:40.230> these<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:46.170> quickly

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
how much I love these so just quickly

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.720 
how much I love these so just quickly
playing<00:00:47.250> with<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.489> cut<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.969> into<00:00:48.149> position

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.319 

I'm<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.570> then<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.739> jump<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.940> through

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
I'm so and then just jump is through

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:05.270 
I'm so and then just jump is through
that<00:00:57.539> down<00:01:03.650> then<00:01:04.650> once<00:01:04.890> we've<00:01:05.070> done<00:01:05.220> that

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
that down then once we've done that

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.870 
that down then once we've done that
we're<00:01:06.090> then<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.450> be<00:01:06.540> putting<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
we're then going to be putting the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.620 
we're then going to be putting the
aluminium<00:01:08.880> leg<00:01:09.360> bar<00:01:11.119> that<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.240> put<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> in

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
aluminium leg bar that we put the in

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.090 
aluminium leg bar that we put the in
capsular<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:14.090> place<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.360> through<00:01:16.100> two

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
capsular and place that through two

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.109 
capsular and place that through two
holes<00:01:17.130> like<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.140> allowing<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.439> stick<00:01:19.860> out

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
holes like so allowing it to stick out

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.899 
holes like so allowing it to stick out
roughly<00:01:21.119> about<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:22.140> much<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.700> once

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
roughly about that much like so and once

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.690 
roughly about that much like so and once
you've<00:01:24.090> done<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.920> your<00:01:25.920> allen<00:01:26.220> key<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.580> was

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
you've done that your allen key that was

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.149 
you've done that your allen key that was
provided<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.650> one<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.799> little<00:01:28.920> grub

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
provided and one of the little grub

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.090 
provided and one of the little grub
screws<00:01:30.439> and<00:01:33.590> we're<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.710> going<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.979> be

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
screws and we're just going to be

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.899 
screws and we're just going to be
placing<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.630> there<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.280> then<00:01:38.280> tie<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.729> in

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
placing that in there and then tie it in

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.600 
placing that in there and then tie it in
a<00:01:39.030> nap<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.720> hold<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.100> holds<00:01:41.520> that

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
a nap and hold in so that holds that

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.420 
a nap and hold in so that holds that
into<00:01:41.880> position<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.560> do<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.770> do<00:01:43.979> exactly<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
into position so do that do exactly the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.249 
into position so do that do exactly the
same<00:01:44.460> with<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> other<00:01:44.909> side<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.740> then<00:01:47.310> that

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:02:00.649 

completes<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.439> stage

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.719
