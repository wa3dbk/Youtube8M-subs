from<00:01:49.149> drinking<00:01:49.299> this<00:01:49.599> but<00:01:49.869> you<00:01:50.289> know<00:01:50.409> it<00:01:50.529> helps

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
from drinking this but you know it helps

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.649 
from drinking this but you know it helps
promote<00:01:50.979> digestive<00:01:51.880> health<00:01:52.090> which<00:01:52.389> i<00:01:52.599> think

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
promote digestive health which i think

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.389 
promote digestive health which i think
is<00:01:52.959> really<00:01:53.259> really<00:01:53.409> cool<00:01:53.740> because<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:54.219> like

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
is really really cool because it like

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.480 
is really really cool because it like
absorbs<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.919> nutrients<00:01:56.919> from<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.219> foods

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
absorbs the nutrients from the foods

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.039 
absorbs the nutrients from the foods
that<00:01:57.609> you<00:01:57.759> actually<00:01:57.969> eat<00:01:58.419> so<00:01:58.659> I<00:01:58.689> think<00:01:58.810> that's

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
that you actually eat so I think that's

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.080 
that you actually eat so I think that's
pretty<00:01:59.649> cool<00:02:00.009> and<00:02:00.340> there's<00:02:00.520> just<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.819> bunch<00:02:00.939> of

pretty cool and there's just a bunch of

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.239 
pretty cool and there's just a bunch of
different<00:02:01.239> other<00:02:01.599> benefits<00:02:02.169> in<00:02:02.380> this<00:02:02.950> drink

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:05.940 
different other benefits in this drink

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.010 
and I like it so there comes in two
different<00:02:05.979> flavors<00:02:06.609> this<00:02:07.270> one<00:02:07.539> is<00:02:07.810> the

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
different flavors this one is the

guess<00:02:15.100> is<00:02:15.280> how<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.460> would<00:02:15.610> explain<00:02:15.940> it

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
guess is how I would explain it

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.400 
guess is how I would explain it
and<00:02:16.730> it's<00:02:17.240> something<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:17.780> just<00:02:18.140> could<00:02:18.319> not

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
and it's something that I just could not

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.020 
and it's something that I just could not
drink<00:02:18.740> like<00:02:19.010> straight<00:02:19.340> essentially<00:02:19.880> what<00:02:20.000> I

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
drink like straight essentially what I

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.240 
drink like straight essentially what I
drink<00:02:20.360> this<00:02:20.510> is<00:02:20.750> in<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.590> middle<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.010> day

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250

to<00:03:10.370> me<00:03:10.489> they're<00:03:10.640> kind<00:03:10.819> of<00:03:10.850> like<00:03:10.970> a<00:03:11.030> granola<00:03:11.510> bar

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
calories in it which I don't think is

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.509 
calories in it which I don't think is
really<00:03:17.360> bad<00:03:17.540> for<00:03:18.170> like<00:03:18.350> a<00:03:18.380> breakfast<00:03:18.950> bar<00:03:19.190> and

kind<00:03:25.730> of<00:03:25.790> difficult<00:03:25.970> for<00:03:26.390> me<00:03:26.510> just<00:03:26.780> because<00:03:26.810> I

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
kind of difficult for me just because I

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.539
