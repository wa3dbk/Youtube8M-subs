00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.240 
and we will go beyond their particular
earthquake<00:01:53.819> which<00:01:54.599> will<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:54.989> the<00:01:55.709> two<00:01:55.979> hundred

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
earthquake which will be the two hundred

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.359 
earthquake which will be the two hundred
percent<00:01:56.340> run<00:01:56.789> and<00:01:57.679> maybe<00:01:58.679> even<00:01:58.860> two<00:01:59.099> three<00:01:59.280> or

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
percent run and maybe even two three or

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.620 
percent run and maybe even two three or
four<00:01:59.580> hundred<00:01:59.670> percent<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.209> that<00:02:00.300> earth<00:02:00.450> but

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
four hundred percent of that earth but

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.749 
four hundred percent of that earth but
it<00:02:00.780> really<00:02:01.020> does<00:02:01.289> depend<00:02:01.709> on<00:02:01.890> how<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.489> bridge

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
it really does depend on how the bridge

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:18.570 
it really does depend on how the bridge
behaves<00:02:03.179> with<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.630> trucks<00:02:03.869> sitting<00:02:04.080> on

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.650 

and<00:02:19.580> it's<00:02:19.760> clear<00:02:20.030> this<00:02:20.240> bridge<00:02:20.480> has<00:02:20.510> a

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
and it's clear this bridge has a

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.690 
and it's clear this bridge has a
tremendous<00:02:21.200> amount<00:02:21.440> of<00:02:21.590> resilience<00:02:22.100> that<00:02:22.640> we

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
tremendous amount of resilience that we

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.460 
tremendous amount of resilience that we
can<00:02:22.970> really<00:02:23.180> punish<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.750> lot<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.230> still

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
can really punish it a lot and it still

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.710 
can really punish it a lot and it still
hangs<00:02:24.710> together<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.540> one<00:02:26.540> of<00:02:26.630> the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
hangs together and one of the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.660 
hangs together and one of the
preliminary<00:02:27.320> conclusions<00:02:27.890> we<00:02:28.070> have<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.520> that

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
preliminary conclusions we have is that

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.940 
preliminary conclusions we have is that
for<00:02:28.850> small<00:02:29.120> earthquakes<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:30.320> trucks<00:02:30.560> help<00:02:30.830> a

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
for small earthquakes the trucks help a

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.790 
for small earthquakes the trucks help a
lot<00:02:31.210> but<00:02:32.210> today<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.780> trucks<00:02:33.020> were<00:02:33.200> making<00:02:33.740> it

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
lot but today the trucks were making it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.130 
lot but today the trucks were making it
worse<00:02:34.010> aggravating<00:02:34.700> it<00:02:34.930> there's<00:02:35.930> no<00:02:36.110> other

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
worse aggravating it there's no other

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.740 
worse aggravating it there's no other
lab<00:02:36.500> in<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.770> country<00:02:37.190> like<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:38.450> it's

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
lab in the country like this so it's

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.780 
lab in the country like this so it's
been<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.900> lot<00:02:39.080> of<00:02:39.110> fun<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.680> it's<00:02:40.190> exciting<00:02:40.490> when

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
been a lot of fun and it's exciting when

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.690 
been a lot of fun and it's exciting when
you<00:02:41.060> get<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.270> shake<00:02:41.450> things
