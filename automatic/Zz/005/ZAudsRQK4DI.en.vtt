00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.270 
that's not volcanic plug our son saw the
interesting<00:02:41.360> thing<00:02:41.540> is<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:42.050> it's<00:02:42.920> right

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
interesting thing is that it's right

looking<00:03:21.530> suspiciously<00:03:22.520> at<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.790> blacks<00:03:23.030> and

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
looking suspiciously at the blacks and

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.870 
looking suspiciously at the blacks and
his<00:03:23.570> own<00:03:23.810> all<00:03:24.130> essentially<00:03:25.130> is<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.400> fully

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
his own all essentially is a fully

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.540 
his own all essentially is a fully
functional<00:03:26.360> motor<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.489> here<00:03:28.489> i<00:03:28.730> have

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.380 

some<00:03:32.210> of<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:32.420> sound<00:03:33.670> ok<00:03:34.670> let's<00:03:34.940> try<00:03:35.120> it<00:03:35.210> one

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
some of the sound ok let's try it one

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.310 
some of the sound ok let's try it one
more<00:03:35.480> time<00:03:35.630> so<00:03:36.200> that's<00:03:36.380> my<00:03:36.530> major<00:03:37.510> as<00:03:38.510> my<00:03:39.020> sound

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
more time so that's my major as my sound

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.690 
more time so that's my major as my sound
I<00:03:39.680> guess<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.590> if<00:03:42.890> I<00:03:43.040> move<00:03:43.250> back<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:44.000> forward

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
I guess and if I move back and forward

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:53.560 
I guess and if I move back and forward
notice<00:03:51.100> little<00:03:52.100> pieces<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.820> soundtrack

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
notice little pieces of the soundtrack

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.880 
notice little pieces of the soundtrack
the<00:03:53.780> motor<00:03:55.540> just<00:03:56.540> like<00:03:56.720> that

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.590 

motor<00:04:00.670> killers<00:04:01.210> motor<00:04:02.020> killers
