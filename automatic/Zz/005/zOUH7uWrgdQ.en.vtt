00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
you will see new muscle growth from this

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.969

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
really unconventional but try it out

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.450 
really unconventional but try it out
change<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.180> time<00:01:33.450> between<00:01:33.720> each<00:01:34.110> rep<00:01:34.500> No

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
change the time between each rep No

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.090 
change the time between each rep No
change<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.420> time<00:01:36.660> between<00:01:36.870> sets<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:38.010> you

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
change the time between sets have you

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.030 
change the time between sets have you
ever<00:01:38.370> timed<00:01:38.760> yourself<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.960> easy<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.620> go<00:01:40.770> from

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
ever timed yourself it's easy to go from

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.220 
ever timed yourself it's easy to go from
a<00:01:41.130> squaw<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.910> feel<00:01:42.120> like<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.960> that

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
and you sit the new text on the phone

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.170 
and you sit the new text on the phone
for<00:01:46.080> four<00:01:46.410> or<00:01:46.530> five<00:01:46.770> minutes<00:01:47.280> yeah<00:01:47.820> that's

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
for four or five minutes yeah that's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.310 
for four or five minutes yeah that's
really<00:01:48.479> ineffective<00:01:49.550> try<00:01:50.550> 30<00:01:50.940> seconds<00:01:51.479> change

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
really ineffective try 30 seconds change

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.590 
really ineffective try 30 seconds change
the<00:01:52.530> time<00:01:52.830> of<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.250> day<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.490> work<00:01:53.820> out<00:01:54.060> will<00:01:54.570> it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the time of the day you work out will it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.410 
the time of the day you work out will it
matter<00:01:54.990> yes<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.680> will<00:01:55.860> because<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.090> used

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
matter yes it will because if you used

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.840 
matter yes it will because if you used
to<00:01:57.540> do<00:01:57.690> it<00:01:57.869> at<00:01:58.050> 4:00<00:01:58.410> p.m.<00:01:58.470> and<00:01:59.130> then<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.580> force

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
to do it at 4:00 p.m. and then you force

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.960 
to do it at 4:00 p.m. and then you force
yourself<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.270> do<00:02:00.479> 6:00<00:02:00.900> a.m.<00:02:01.190> that<00:02:02.190> is<00:02:02.550> harder

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
yourself to do 6:00 a.m. that is harder

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.270 
yourself to do 6:00 a.m. that is harder
so<00:02:03.570> if<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:04.110> harder<00:02:04.470> it's<00:02:04.680> gonna<00:02:04.830> be<00:02:05.010> more

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
so if it's harder it's gonna be more

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.469 
so if it's harder it's gonna be more
productive<00:02:05.810> add<00:02:06.920> more<00:02:07.920> calories<00:02:08.489> if<00:02:09.239> you're

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
productive add more calories if you're

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.470 
productive add more calories if you're
underneath<00:02:09.780> or<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.170> eat<00:02:10.679> from<00:02:10.860> maintenance

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
underneath or just eat from maintenance

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.520 
underneath or just eat from maintenance
you<00:02:12.480> really<00:02:12.840> think<00:02:13.080> you're<00:02:13.200> gonna<00:02:13.320> grow
