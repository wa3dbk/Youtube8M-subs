problem<00:04:34.640> with<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.060> redstone<00:04:35.420> system<00:04:35.750> in

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
problem with the redstone system in

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.900 
problem with the redstone system in
terms<00:04:35.840> of<00:04:36.080> closing<00:04:36.470> because<00:04:36.590> maybe<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.670> water

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
terms of closing because maybe the water

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.520 
terms of closing because maybe the water
destroyed<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.450> red<00:04:38.570> stone<00:04:38.750> but<00:04:38.990> yeah<00:04:39.170> I<00:04:39.200> can't

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
destroyed the red stone but yeah I can't

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.170 
destroyed the red stone but yeah I can't
see<00:04:39.740> anything<00:04:39.890> happening<00:04:40.850> in<00:04:40.940> terms<00:04:41.060> of

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
see anything happening in terms of

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.370 
see anything happening in terms of
closing<00:04:41.510> so<00:04:41.600> I<00:04:41.660> guess<00:04:41.810> you<00:04:41.900> cannot<00:04:42.080> close<00:04:42.230> the

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
closing so I guess you cannot close the

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.640 
closing so I guess you cannot close the
gates<00:04:42.530> apologize<00:04:43.250> not<00:04:43.430> my<00:04:43.550> fault<00:04:43.730> um<00:04:44.600> we<00:04:45.560> have

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
gates apologize not my fault um we have

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.510 
gates apologize not my fault um we have
the<00:04:45.830> mmm<00:04:47.320> we<00:04:48.320> have<00:04:48.440> the<00:04:48.590> flood<00:04:48.950> gate<00:04:49.190> and<00:04:49.400> the

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
the mmm we have the flood gate and the

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.830 
the mmm we have the flood gate and the
emergency<00:04:50.000> flood<00:04:50.180> gate<00:04:50.330> we<00:04:50.450> will<00:04:50.570> look<00:04:50.660> at<00:04:50.750> the

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
emergency flood gate we will look at the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.880 
emergency flood gate we will look at the
flood<00:04:50.990> gate<00:04:52.750> which<00:04:53.750> turns<00:04:54.290> on<00:04:54.820> I'm<00:04:55.820> assuming

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
flood gate which turns on I'm assuming

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.500 
flood gate which turns on I'm assuming
either<00:04:57.890> one<00:04:58.250> of<00:04:58.280> these<00:04:58.430> middle<00:04:58.820> ones<00:04:59.030> or<00:04:59.360> one

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
either one of these middle ones or one

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.480 
either one of these middle ones or one
of<00:04:59.600> these<00:04:59.690> two<00:04:59.960> side<00:05:00.290> ones<00:05:00.560> i<00:05:00.740> have<00:05:00.890> no<00:05:01.070> idea<00:05:01.190> we

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
of these two side ones i have no idea we

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.660 
of these two side ones i have no idea we
will<00:05:01.610> see<00:05:01.760> where<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:01.940> water<00:05:02.090> comes<00:05:02.300> out<00:05:02.420> um

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
will see where the water comes out um

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:11.230 
will see where the water comes out um
hopefully<00:05:04.670> very<00:05:05.030> quick<00:05:08.230> where<00:05:09.230> is<00:05:09.320> it<00:05:10.240> please

minecraft<00:05:13.910> oh<00:05:15.070> there<00:05:16.070> we<00:05:16.160> go<00:05:16.190> that's

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
minecraft oh there we go that's

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.130 
minecraft oh there we go that's
floodgates<00:05:17.000> i'm<00:05:17.120> getting<00:05:17.420> the<00:05:17.510> emergency<00:05:17.960> oh

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
floodgates i'm getting the emergency oh

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.710 
floodgates i'm getting the emergency oh
wait<00:05:18.440> that<00:05:18.590> is<00:05:18.740> all<00:05:19.010> that's<00:05:19.220> floodgate<00:05:19.580> huh<00:05:20.000> so

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
wait that is all that's floodgate huh so

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.970 
wait that is all that's floodgate huh so
emergency<00:05:20.930> flood<00:05:21.380> gate<00:05:21.590> must<00:05:21.740> be<00:05:21.830> one<00:05:21.950> of

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
emergency flood gate must be one of

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.010 
emergency flood gate must be one of
those<00:05:22.100> two<00:05:22.310> so<00:05:23.150> flood<00:05:23.360> gate<00:05:23.480> opens<00:05:23.720> both<00:05:23.900> of

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
those two so flood gate opens both of

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.220 
those two so flood gate opens both of
those<00:05:24.170> that's<00:05:24.860> cool<00:05:25.160> um<00:05:28.330> the<00:05:29.330> emergency<00:05:30.020> fog

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
those that's cool um the emergency fog

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.010 
those that's cool um the emergency fog
gate<00:05:30.470> now<00:05:30.880> opens<00:05:31.880> something<00:05:32.630> else<00:05:32.750> I<00:05:32.840> think

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
gate now opens something else I think

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.750 
gate now opens something else I think
easy<00:05:33.410> because<00:05:33.770> they're<00:05:33.890> color<00:05:34.160> coded<00:05:34.220> as<00:05:34.610> well

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
easy because they're color coded as well

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.490 
easy because they're color coded as well
so<00:05:34.910> I<00:05:34.940> think<00:05:35.000> it<00:05:35.210> will<00:05:35.330> open<00:05:35.420> one<00:05:35.630> of<00:05:35.750> either

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
so I think it will open one of either

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.260 
so I think it will open one of either
those<00:05:36.860> two<00:05:37.130> up<00:05:37.250> top<00:05:37.460> or<00:05:37.730> those<00:05:37.940> two<00:05:38.150> at<00:05:38.240> the

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
those two up top or those two at the

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.650 
those two up top or those two at the
bottom<00:05:38.830> it<00:05:39.830> opens<00:05:40.070> it<00:05:40.160> to<00:05:40.250> at<00:05:40.340> the<00:05:40.400> top<00:05:40.580> and<00:05:40.910> you

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
bottom it opens it to at the top and you

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.210 
bottom it opens it to at the top and you
have<00:05:41.750> a<00:05:41.810> nice<00:05:41.930> pretty<00:05:42.200> layout<00:05:42.920> that<00:05:43.070> comes

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
have a nice pretty layout that comes

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.040 
have a nice pretty layout that comes
down<00:05:43.370> from<00:05:43.430> there<00:05:43.790> and<00:05:44.000> then<00:05:44.660> there's<00:05:44.840> two

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
down from there and then there's two

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.490 
down from there and then there's two
other<00:05:45.200> ones<00:05:45.500> which<00:05:45.860> will<00:05:46.370> come<00:05:46.580> God<00:05:47.300> which<00:05:48.260> I'm

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
other ones which will come God which I'm

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.530 
other ones which will come God which I'm
probably<00:05:48.890> on<00:05:49.250> the<00:05:49.310> other<00:05:49.430> side<00:05:49.730> i'm<00:05:49.850> not<00:05:49.970> sure

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
probably on the other side i'm not sure

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.280 
probably on the other side i'm not sure
but<00:05:50.570> I'm<00:05:50.810> pretty<00:05:50.990> sure<00:05:51.350> uh<00:05:52.600> are<00:05:53.600> they<00:05:53.900> where
