settings associated with this gear one

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.640 
settings associated with this gear one
of<00:00:45.830> them<00:00:45.949> might<00:00:46.129> be<00:00:46.250> something<00:00:46.549> like<00:00:46.580> coverage

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
of them might be something like coverage

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.740 
of them might be something like coverage
we<00:00:48.650> can<00:00:48.799> even<00:00:48.979> change<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.430> outer<00:00:49.879> profile<00:00:50.510> of

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
we can even change the outer profile of

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.009 
we can even change the outer profile of
the<00:00:50.989> spikes<00:00:53.229> and<00:00:54.790> make<00:00:55.790> a<00:00:55.970> very<00:00:56.420> unique<00:00:56.750> tool

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
the spikes and make a very unique tool

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.869 
the spikes and make a very unique tool
very<00:00:57.470> different<00:00:57.860> from<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.250> initial<00:00:58.610> one<00:00:58.729> that

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
very different from the initial one that

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.179 
very different from the initial one that

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
working on it and sculpting on it so I'm

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.840 
working on it and sculpting on it so I'm
going<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.229> hit<00:01:18.320> ctrl<00:01:18.740> D<00:01:18.920> twice<00:01:19.189> just<00:01:19.579> to<00:01:19.700> add<00:01:19.820> a

going to hit ctrl D twice just to add a

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.330 
going to hit ctrl D twice just to add a
little<00:01:19.939> bit<00:01:20.179> more<00:01:20.210> resolution<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:20.990> this<00:01:21.249> and<00:01:22.249> I

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
little bit more resolution to this and I

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.279 
little bit more resolution to this and I
might<00:01:22.429> choose<00:01:22.640> something<00:01:22.700> like<00:01:23.270> my<00:01:23.929> blobby

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
might choose something like my blobby

might choose something like my blobby
brush<00:01:25.299> and<00:01:26.299> I<00:01:26.390> can<00:01:26.539> start<00:01:26.780> sculpting<00:01:27.049> away

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
brush and I can start sculpting away

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.469 
brush and I can start sculpting away
let's<00:01:29.270> take<00:01:29.479> a<00:01:29.509> look<00:01:29.749> at<00:01:29.929> another<00:01:30.229> tool<00:01:31.479> inside

scroll<00:01:57.710> back<00:01:57.950> down<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.369> initialize<00:01:59.139> now<00:02:00.139> when

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
scroll back down to initialize now when

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.599 
scroll back down to initialize now when
you<00:02:00.350> open<00:02:00.380> up<00:02:00.709> initialize<00:02:01.189> for<00:02:01.459> this

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
you open up initialize for this

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.219 
you open up initialize for this
different<00:02:02.030> tool<00:02:02.209> for<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:02.600> spiral<00:02:02.959> you'll

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
different tool for this spiral you'll

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.599 
different tool for this spiral you'll
notice<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:03.649> we<00:02:03.770> have<00:02:03.799> several<00:02:04.399> different

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
notice that we have several different

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.929 
notice that we have several different
settings<00:02:05.149> each<00:02:06.109> initial<00:02:07.039> primitive<00:02:07.219> is<00:02:07.639> going

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
settings each initial primitive is going

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.699 
settings each initial primitive is going
to<00:02:07.999> have<00:02:08.149> its<00:02:08.330> own<00:02:08.539> settings<00:02:09.140> here<00:02:09.410> under

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
to have its own settings here under

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.490 
to have its own settings here under
initialize<00:02:10.300> so<00:02:11.300> this<00:02:11.450> one<00:02:11.630> also<00:02:11.660> has<00:02:11.990> coverage

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
initialize so this one also has coverage

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.550 
initialize so this one also has coverage
but<00:02:13.100> we<00:02:13.220> can<00:02:13.340> turn<00:02:13.520> up<00:02:13.700> or<00:02:13.910> down<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:15.410> can

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
but we can turn up or down you can

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.179 
but we can turn up or down you can
change<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.010> thickness

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
change the thickness

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.880 
change the thickness
and<00:02:19.390> many<00:02:20.390> different<00:02:20.540> attributes<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:21.859> I

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
and many different attributes so I

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.679 
and many different attributes so I
suggest<00:02:22.310> when<00:02:22.549> you're<00:02:22.640> new<00:02:22.879> to<00:02:23.000> ZBrush<00:02:23.390> just

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689 
suggest when you're new to ZBrush just

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.559 
suggest when you're new to ZBrush just
jump<00:02:24.019> into<00:02:24.290> this<00:02:24.409> tool<00:02:25.010> palette<00:02:25.400> here<00:02:25.640> check

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
jump into this tool palette here check

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.690 
jump into this tool palette here check
out<00:02:26.719> each<00:02:26.900> one<00:02:27.079> of<00:02:27.170> these<00:02:27.230> primitives<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:27.890> see

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
out each one of these primitives and see

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.330 
out each one of these primitives and see
what<00:02:28.849> you<00:02:28.939> can<00:02:29.060> do<00:02:29.209> so<00:02:29.739> again<00:02:30.739> now<00:02:31.069> that<00:02:31.219> we're

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
what you can do so again now that we're

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.250 
what you can do so again now that we're
done<00:02:31.489> changing<00:02:31.939> these<00:02:32.030> initial<00:02:32.450> settings<00:02:32.810> I'm

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
done changing these initial settings I'm

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.080 
done changing these initial settings I'm
going<00:02:33.319> to<00:02:33.530> go<00:02:33.620> up<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:33.889> make<00:02:34.069> polymesh3d<00:02:34.549> and

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
going to go up to make polymesh3d and

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.110 
going to go up to make polymesh3d and
then<00:02:35.989> we<00:02:36.049> can<00:02:36.200> start<00:02:36.439> sculpting<00:02:36.739> take<00:02:37.730> notice

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
then we can start sculpting take notice

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.030 
then we can start sculpting take notice
that<00:02:38.329> that<00:02:38.540> initial<00:02:39.049> setting<00:02:39.409> pull<00:02:39.680> down<00:02:39.859> his

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
that that initial setting pull down his

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.309 
that that initial setting pull down his
naturist<00:02:40.459> appeared<00:02:40.849> once<00:02:41.689> you<00:02:41.810> convert<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.290> to

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
naturist appeared once you convert it to

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.229 
naturist appeared once you convert it to
a<00:02:42.439> polymesh3d<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.430> won't<00:02:43.609> be<00:02:43.760> able<00:02:43.879> to<00:02:44.000> change

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
a polymesh3d you won't be able to change

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.119 
a polymesh3d you won't be able to change
any<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.540> those<00:02:44.719> initial<00:02:45.139> settings<00:02:45.469> so<00:02:46.099> you

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
any of those initial settings so you

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.830 
any of those initial settings so you
want<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.489> set<00:02:46.670> all<00:02:46.879> the<00:02:46.909> settings<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.569> what<00:02:47.719> you

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
want to set all the settings to what you

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.379 
want to set all the settings to what you
want<00:02:48.049> before<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.469> convert<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:49.120> now<00:02:50.120> we<00:02:50.180> can

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
want before you convert it now we can

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:55.210 
want before you convert it now we can

these common use tools and let's take a

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.479 
these common use tools and let's take a
look<00:03:10.939> at<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:11.209> Poseidon<00:03:11.810> character<00:03:12.310> now<00:03:13.310> this

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
look at this Poseidon character now this

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.909 
look at this Poseidon character now this
Poseidon<00:03:14.030> character<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.659> a<00:03:14.719> polymesh3d<00:03:15.469> at

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:15.919 
Poseidon character is a polymesh3d at

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.649 
Poseidon character is a polymesh3d at
this<00:03:16.069> point<00:03:16.370> which<00:03:16.939> means<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.329> doesn't<00:03:17.510> have

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
this point which means it doesn't have

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.690 
this point which means it doesn't have
any<00:03:17.930> initial<00:03:18.109> settings<00:03:18.650> but<00:03:19.219> I<00:03:19.250> can<00:03:19.519> do

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
any initial settings but I can do

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.819 
any initial settings but I can do
sculpting<00:03:20.180> on<00:03:20.269> it<00:03:20.389> right<00:03:20.569> away<00:03:22.780> if<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:24.620> were

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
sculpting on it right away if you were

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.949 
sculpting on it right away if you were
