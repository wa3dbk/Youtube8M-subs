very<00:00:15.210> interesting<00:00:16.020> very<00:00:16.199> interesting<00:00:16.350> it

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
very interesting very interesting it

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.340 
very interesting very interesting it
looks<00:00:17.070> like<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.460> maybe<00:00:18.390> he<00:00:18.570> realizes<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.140> he

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
looks like I maybe he realizes that he

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.990 
looks like I maybe he realizes that he
might<00:00:19.529> get<00:00:19.650> ground<00:00:19.949> stomped<00:00:20.310> here<00:00:20.460> if<00:00:20.640> once

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
might get ground stomped here if once

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.790 
might get ground stomped here if once
that<00:00:21.240> goes<00:00:21.390> down<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.230> he's<00:00:22.380> going<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.619> try<00:00:22.769> and

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
that goes down and he's going to try and

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.460 
that goes down and he's going to try and
lock<00:00:23.010> himself<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.490> he<00:00:23.670> might<00:00:23.939> also<00:00:24.210> be<00:00:24.480> taking

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
lock himself in he might also be taking

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.990 
lock himself in he might also be taking
me<00:00:25.560> down<00:00:25.710> only<00:00:26.220> one<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.490> these<00:00:26.609> simulators

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
me down only one of these simulators

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.939 
me down only one of these simulators
that<00:00:27.119> could<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> possibility<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.890> think

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
that could be a possibility and I think

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.470 
that could be a possibility and I think
if<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.460> noise<00:00:29.730> hanging<00:00:30.060> down<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.240> other<00:00:30.359> one

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
if that noise hanging down the other one

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.820 
if that noise hanging down the other one
there<00:00:30.630> mine<00:00:30.750> okay<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.050> was<00:00:31.289> thinking<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.560> if

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
there mine okay I was thinking that if

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.889 
there mine okay I was thinking that if
he<00:00:32.189> did<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.489> then<00:00:33.000> I'm<00:00:33.180> not<00:00:33.360> sure<00:00:33.600> how<00:00:33.809> it

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
he did that then I'm not sure how it

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.540 
he did that then I'm not sure how it
works<00:00:34.020> exactly<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.800> think<00:00:35.100> possibly

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
works exactly but I think possibly

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.950 
works exactly but I think possibly
dragoons<00:00:35.940> couldn't<00:00:36.300> fit<00:00:36.450> through<00:00:36.630> there<00:00:36.840> was

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
dragoons couldn't fit through there was

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.139 
dragoons couldn't fit through there was
one<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:38.010> Marines<00:00:38.309> could<00:00:38.520> or<00:00:38.820> something

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
one but the Marines could or something

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.510 
one but the Marines could or something
like<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.590> that<00:00:40.590> doesn't<00:00:41.040> make<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.280> whole<00:00:41.399> lot

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
like that that doesn't make a whole lot

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.590 
like that that doesn't make a whole lot
of<00:00:41.670> sense<00:00:41.820> though<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.000> think<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:42.510> a

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
of sense though I think it's just a

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.930 
of sense though I think it's just a
larger<00:00:42.989> larger<00:00:43.230> units<00:00:43.710> tanks<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.399> stuff<00:00:44.489> hold

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
larger larger units tanks and stuff hold

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.470 
larger larger units tanks and stuff hold
it<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:46.250> flash<00:00:47.250> repairing<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.879> bunker<00:00:48.210> just

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
it so flash repairing that bunker just

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.069 
it so flash repairing that bunker just
long<00:00:48.719> enough<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:50.090> to<00:00:51.090> buy<00:00:51.329> himself<00:00:51.600> time<00:00:51.870> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
long enough to to buy himself time to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.650 
long enough to to buy himself time to
kill<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:53.280> simulator<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.329> he<00:00:54.510> actually

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
kill that a simulator and he actually

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.139 
kill that a simulator and he actually
left<00:00:54.930> his<00:00:55.170> Marines<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.710> outside<00:00:56.340> which<00:00:57.030> is

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
left his Marines on the outside which is

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.639 
left his Marines on the outside which is
interesting<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.840> they<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.140> attack<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.620> I

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
interesting so they can attack and I

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.049 
interesting so they can attack and I
think<00:00:58.859> maybe<00:00:58.980> he<00:00:59.190> wants<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> even<00:00:59.730> just<00:00:59.820> a

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
think maybe he wants to even just a

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.619 
think maybe he wants to even just a
stall<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.600> bit<00:01:01.020> longer<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:02.480> hold<00:01:03.480> be

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
stall a little bit longer to hold be

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.109 
stall a little bit longer to hold be
soft<00:01:03.960> from<00:01:04.830> finding<00:01:05.280> out<00:01:05.369> what<00:01:05.700> he's<00:01:05.850> done

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
soft from finding out what he's done

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.240 
soft from finding out what he's done
make<00:01:06.990> him<00:01:07.140> produce<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.619> couple<00:01:07.950> more<00:01:08.040> injured

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
make him produce a couple more injured

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.649 
make him produce a couple more injured
goons<00:01:08.430> or<00:01:08.580> something<00:01:08.790> like<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:08.939> visa<00:01:09.299> does

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
goons or something like that visa does

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.010 
goons or something like that visa does
have<00:01:09.869> an<00:01:10.409> expansion<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.189> though<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.700> he's<00:01:12.390> cut

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
have an expansion of though and he's cut

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.609 
have an expansion of though and he's cut
his<00:01:13.700> yeah<00:01:14.700> bc<00:01:14.909> really<00:01:15.900> now<00:01:16.110> he<00:01:16.170> can't<00:01:16.470> fit

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
inevitable shuttle it's a possibility of

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.940 
inevitable shuttle it's a possibility of
but<00:01:40.710> i'm<00:01:41.250> not<00:01:41.310> sure<00:01:41.750> if<00:01:42.750> that's<00:01:43.380> his<00:01:43.560> reasoning

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
but i'm not sure if that's his reasoning

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.700 
but i'm not sure if that's his reasoning
or<00:01:44.009> not<00:01:44.689> it<00:01:45.689> could<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:45.990> some<00:01:46.170> kind<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.470> drop

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
or not it could be some kind of a drop

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.010 
or not it could be some kind of a drop
although<00:01:47.100> no<00:01:47.729> i<00:01:47.759> don't<00:01:48.060> pretty<00:01:48.750> sure<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:48.930> not

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
although no i don't pretty sure it's not

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.080 
although no i don't pretty sure it's not
a<00:01:49.079> drop<00:01:49.320> because<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:50.100> he<00:01:50.310> was<00:01:50.670> going<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:50.939> a

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
a drop because if he was going for a

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.340 
a drop because if he was going for a
drop<00:01:51.329> he<00:01:51.509> probably<00:01:51.689> would<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:51.930> just<00:01:51.990> got<00:01:52.259> in

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
drop he probably would have just got in

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.910 
drop he probably would have just got in
the<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.530> starboard<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.520> he<00:01:54.119> would<00:01:54.270> not<00:01:54.420> be

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
the one starboard and he would not be

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.020 
the one starboard and he would not be
we've<00:01:55.920> got<00:01:56.070> more<00:01:56.189> factories<00:01:56.610> or<00:01:56.790> whatever

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
he's going to use to produce his drops

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.260 
he's going to use to produce his drops

this is gonna work bc was gonna have he

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.440 
this is gonna work bc was gonna have he
has<00:02:18.330> observers<00:02:18.900> out<00:02:19.050> already<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:20.270> that<00:02:21.270> isn't

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
has observers out already so that isn't

going to matter too much I don't think

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.130 
going to matter too much I don't think
flash<00:02:23.849> doesn't<00:02:24.090> Academy<00:02:24.540> up<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:24.810> he's<00:02:25.020> not

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
flash doesn't Academy up so he's not

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.390 
flash doesn't Academy up so he's not
going<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.380> have<00:02:25.470> comps<00:02:25.830> out<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.069> even<00:02:26.250> take

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
going to have comps out to even take

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
care of those observers at the moment so

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.490

the only thing that this is this is
really<00:02:35.310> going<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.550> do<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:36.239> going<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.510> stop

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
really going to do it is going to stop

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.540 
really going to do it is going to stop
the<00:02:36.840> reverb<00:02:37.110> harassed<00:02:37.319> because<00:02:37.500> those<00:02:38.250> raids

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
the reverb harassed because those raids

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.130 
the reverb harassed because those raids
are<00:02:38.819> going<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.090> be<00:02:39.180> able<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.540> intercept<00:02:39.870> any

are going to be able to intercept any
shuttles<00:02:40.790> around<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.319> keep<00:02:43.319> these<00:02:43.530> from

dropping<00:02:44.100> Reapers<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.519> there<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.720> that's

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
dropping Reapers in there so so that's

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.110 
dropping Reapers in there so so that's
that's<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.380> good<00:02:47.100> on<00:02:47.220> flash<00:02:47.459> as<00:02:47.670> part<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:47.940> the

that's a good on flash as part of the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.550 
that's a good on flash as part of the
very<00:02:48.420> least<00:02:48.510> he's<00:02:48.720> gonna<00:02:48.840> stop<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.290> River

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
very least he's gonna stop that River

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.900 
very least he's gonna stop that River
grass<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.100> that's<00:02:50.370> going<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.549> give<00:02:50.610> him<00:02:50.790> some

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
grass and that's going to give him some

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.820 
grass and that's going to give him some

has<00:02:59.760> 21<00:02:59.940> base<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.569> he's<00:03:00.660> gonna<00:03:00.810> be<00:03:00.900> trapped

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
has 21 base and he's gonna be trapped

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.630 
has 21 base and he's gonna be trapped
it's<00:03:01.410> just<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.709> one<00:03:01.830> based<00:03:02.069> a<00:03:02.250> little<00:03:02.489> while

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
too he could yeah so 00 shuttle goes

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.550 
too he could yeah so 00 shuttle goes
down<00:03:05.970> nothing<00:03:06.510> inside<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.959> though<00:03:07.080> as<00:03:07.230> far<00:03:07.380> as

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
down nothing inside it though as far as

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.620 
down nothing inside it though as far as
I<00:03:07.620> know<00:03:07.680> maybe<00:03:08.489> a<00:03:08.580> probe<00:03:08.880> or<00:03:09.120> something<00:03:09.450> but<00:03:09.600> uh

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
I know maybe a probe or something but uh

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.690 
I know maybe a probe or something but uh
that<00:03:10.530> was<00:03:10.799> a<00:03:10.830> little<00:03:10.980> bit<00:03:11.160> costly<00:03:11.580> though

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
that was a little bit costly though

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.720 
that was a little bit costly though
sacrificing<00:03:12.390> look<00:03:12.540> like<00:03:12.690> all<00:03:12.870> three<00:03:13.380> raids

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
sacrificing look like all three raids

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.130 
sacrificing look like all three raids
three<00:03:14.730> rates<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.329> dying<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.750> take<00:03:15.959> down<00:03:16.079> that

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
three rates just dying to take down that

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.710 
three rates just dying to take down that
shuttle<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.709> maybe<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:17.010> probe<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.940> flash

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
shuttle and maybe a probe so flash

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
looking to be in trouble here indeed and

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.780 
looking to be in trouble here indeed and
cans<00:03:22.019> now<00:03:22.200> going<00:03:22.560> down<00:03:22.769> so<00:03:23.040> those<00:03:23.340> rates<00:03:23.640> are

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
cans now going down so those rates are

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.789 
cans now going down so those rates are
going<00:03:23.820> to<00:03:23.970> be<00:03:24.030> completely<00:03:24.600> useless<00:03:24.870> now<00:03:25.260> so

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
going to be completely useless now so

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.490 
going to be completely useless now so
basically<00:03:26.329> be<00:03:27.329> soup<00:03:27.570> countering<00:03:28.079> everything

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500

flashes<00:03:41.730> plan<00:03:41.970> is<00:03:42.180> now<00:03:42.329> because<00:03:42.799> basu<00:03:43.799> is

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
flashes plan is now because basu is

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.280 
flashes plan is now because basu is
expanding<00:03:44.400> all<00:03:44.519> over<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.820> place<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.299> flash

expanding all over the place and flash

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.050 
expanding all over the place and flash
has<00:03:46.650> no<00:03:46.890> way<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.160> get<00:03:47.430> out<00:03:47.459> of<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.760> expansion

has no way to get out of the expansion

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.060 
has no way to get out of the expansion
if<00:03:48.390> he<00:03:48.540> were<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.750> get<00:03:49.109> out<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.290> doesn't<00:03:49.859> have

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
if he were to get out it doesn't have

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.160 
if he were to get out it doesn't have
the<00:03:50.100> forces<00:03:50.519> on<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.609> ground<00:03:50.700> necessary<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.930> do

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
the forces on the ground necessary to do

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.170 
the forces on the ground necessary to do
anything<00:03:52.500> really<00:03:52.859> another<00:03:53.670> robotics

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
anything really another robotics

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.300 
anything really another robotics
facility<00:03:54.329> going<00:03:54.840> down<00:03:54.989> for<00:03:55.170> be<00:03:55.380> soo<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.920> a

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
facility going down for be soo and a

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.170 
facility going down for be soo and a
Stargate<00:03:57.060> so<00:03:57.780> um<00:03:58.640> what<00:03:59.640> we're<00:03:59.760> probably<00:04:00.000> going

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
Stargate so um what we're probably going

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.259 
Stargate so um what we're probably going
to<00:04:00.239> see<00:04:00.450> here<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:00.900> as<00:04:01.290> carriers<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.130> I'm

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
to see here is as carriers and I'm

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.430 
to see here is as carriers and I'm
thinking<00:04:03.269> they<00:04:03.510> got<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.810> second<00:04:04.109> robotics

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
thinking they got the second robotics

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.460 
thinking they got the second robotics
facility<00:04:04.560> for<00:04:05.519> mass<00:04:06.329> observers<00:04:06.989> because

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
facility for mass observers because

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.030 
facility for mass observers because
obviously<00:04:07.819> well<00:04:08.819> he<00:04:09.630> does<00:04:09.810> have<00:04:09.889> cloak<00:04:10.889> for

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
obviously well he does have cloak for

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.729 
obviously well he does have cloak for
AIDS<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.569> I<00:04:12.569> don't<00:04:13.109> know<00:04:13.170> maybe<00:04:13.290> he<00:04:13.470> wants<00:04:13.709> to

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
AIDS and I don't know maybe he wants to

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.819 
AIDS and I don't know maybe he wants to
pump<00:04:14.010> out<00:04:14.130> his<00:04:14.310> observers<00:04:14.959> quickly<00:04:15.959> just<00:04:16.680> in

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
pump out his observers quickly just in

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.250 
pump out his observers quickly just in
case<00:04:17.010> some<00:04:17.419> flash<00:04:18.419> starts<00:04:18.750> targeting<00:04:19.140> as

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
case some flash starts targeting as

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.690 
case some flash starts targeting as
observer<00:04:19.620> so<00:04:19.830> that<00:04:19.979> you<00:04:20.039> can<00:04:20.159> use<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.459> cloak

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
observer so that you can use the cloak

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
observer so that you can use the cloak
grates<00:04:21.000> against

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
grates against

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.090 
grates against
he<00:04:23.180> against<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.240> carriers<00:04:24.690> but<00:04:25.290> I<00:04:25.350> that

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
he against the carriers but I that

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.960 
he against the carriers but I that
remains<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.430> be<00:04:26.460> seen<00:04:26.760> i<00:04:26.910> guess<00:04:27.120> it<00:04:27.780> could<00:04:28.050> be<00:04:28.230> i

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
remains to be seen i guess it could be i

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.760 
remains to be seen i guess it could be i
don't<00:04:29.970> know<00:04:30.030> i<00:04:30.060> mean<00:04:30.420> possibly<00:04:31.020> he's<00:04:31.440> gonna<00:04:31.560> go

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
don't know i mean possibly he's gonna go

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.620 
don't know i mean possibly he's gonna go
for<00:04:31.800> more<00:04:32.700> readers<00:04:33.090> or<00:04:33.210> something<00:04:33.480> like<00:04:33.540> that

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
for more readers or something like that

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.330 
for more readers or something like that
but<00:04:33.870> i<00:04:33.930> suspect<00:04:34.350> that's<00:04:34.650> why<00:04:34.890> he's<00:04:35.040> gotten<00:04:35.310> you

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
but i suspect that's why he's gotten you

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.490 
but i suspect that's why he's gotten you
to<00:04:35.580> ebonics<00:04:36.510> facilities<00:04:36.960> i<00:04:37.050> guess<00:04:37.170> we'll<00:04:37.350> see

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
to ebonics facilities i guess we'll see

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.690 
to ebonics facilities i guess we'll see
in<00:04:37.560> a<00:04:37.620> minute<00:04:37.710> here<00:04:37.950> oh<00:04:39.290> no<00:04:40.400> these<00:04:41.400> are

dragoons here he could be going may

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.090 
dragoons here he could be going may

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
off those two goons this time and maybe

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.100 
off those two goons this time and maybe
maybe<00:05:37.080> that's<00:05:37.350> okay<00:05:37.710> that<00:05:38.010> might<00:05:38.190> be<00:05:38.220> a<00:05:39.110> don't

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
maybe that's okay that might be a don't

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.210 
maybe that's okay that might be a don't
know<00:05:40.169> why<00:05:40.290> didn't<00:05:40.530> see<00:05:40.650> see<00:05:40.979> that<00:05:41.130> as

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
know why didn't see see that as

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.950 
know why didn't see see that as
possibility<00:05:41.700> but<00:05:41.790> yeah<00:05:42.300> that's<00:05:42.510> I<00:05:42.690> guess

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
possibility but yeah that's I guess

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.680 
possibility but yeah that's I guess
that's<00:05:43.140> why<00:05:43.290> he<00:05:43.320> got<00:05:43.680> those<00:05:44.150> multiple<00:05:45.150> he

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
that's why he got those multiple he

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.940 
that's why he got those multiple he
might<00:05:45.870> have<00:05:45.990> been<00:05:46.080> getting<00:05:46.290> the<00:05:46.410> de<00:05:46.530> to<00:05:46.680> box

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
might have been getting the de to box

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.770 
might have been getting the de to box
facilities<00:05:47.520> so<00:05:47.850> you<00:05:47.940> can<00:05:48.060> get<00:05:48.180> more<00:05:48.240> shuttles

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
facilities so you can get more shuttles

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.550 
facilities so you can get more shuttles
so<00:05:49.380> he<00:05:49.470> can<00:05:49.590> ferry<00:05:49.860> his<00:05:50.010> troops<00:05:50.310> in<00:05:50.630> which<00:05:51.630> i'm

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
so he can ferry his troops in which i'm

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.200 
so he can ferry his troops in which i'm
really<00:05:52.620> not<00:05:53.040> sure<00:05:53.130> why<00:05:53.340> he<00:05:53.580> did<00:05:53.760> that<00:05:53.790> he<00:05:54.060> could

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
really not sure why he did that he could

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.180 
really not sure why he did that he could
have<00:05:54.300> just<00:05:54.450> gone<00:05:54.510> for<00:05:54.930> air<00:05:55.500> or<00:05:55.800> something<00:05:56.070> like

too smart to to get caught with anything

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.700 
too smart to to get caught with anything
I<00:06:10.610> mean<00:06:11.180> from<00:06:11.689> the<00:06:11.840> flash<00:06:12.020> before<00:06:12.199> out<00:06:12.499> at<00:06:12.620> that

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
I mean from the flash before out at that

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.890 
I mean from the flash before out at that
point<00:06:13.039> so<00:06:13.340> there's<00:06:14.180> nothing<00:06:14.300> you<00:06:14.509> can<00:06:14.659> do<00:06:14.749> off

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.649 
point so there's nothing you can do off
one<00:06:15.110> base<00:06:15.319> that's<00:06:15.620> going<00:06:15.800> to<00:06:15.999> catch<00:06:16.999> a<00:06:17.240> three
