00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.869 

I<00:00:02.720> think<00:00:03.720> every<00:00:04.020> day<00:00:04.259> our<00:00:05.190> work<00:00:05.490> is<00:00:05.730> about

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
I think every day our work is about

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.610 
I think every day our work is about
crossing<00:00:06.450> professional<00:00:06.930> boundaries<00:00:07.290> and

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
crossing professional boundaries and

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.830 
crossing professional boundaries and
it's<00:00:08.010> about<00:00:08.160> working<00:00:08.309> together<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:09.210> don't

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
it's about working together I don't

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.570 
it's about working together I don't
think<00:00:09.900> there's<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.260> children's<00:00:10.650> center<00:00:11.040> in<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
think there's a children's center in the

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.919 
think there's a children's center in the
country<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:12.030> could<00:00:12.179> work<00:00:12.330> if<00:00:12.570> they<00:00:12.690> worked

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
country that could work if they worked

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.540 
country that could work if they worked
as<00:00:13.110> an<00:00:13.170> isolated<00:00:13.860> agency<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.980> so<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.010> think

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
as an isolated agency and so I think

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.820 
as an isolated agency and so I think
everything<00:00:17.970> we<00:00:18.240> do<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.720> about<00:00:18.830> multi-agency

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
everything we do is about multi-agency

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.109 
everything we do is about multi-agency
work<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:21.119> think<00:00:21.740> that<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.070> main<00:00:23.250> challenge

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
work and I think that the main challenge

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.150 
work and I think that the main challenge
to<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.260> teams<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.890> are<00:00:25.949> existing

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
to that is that teams that are existing

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.070 
to that is that teams that are existing
teams<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:26.849> been<00:00:26.970> very<00:00:27.180> used<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.570> working<00:00:27.930> on

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
teams have been very used to working on

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.960 
teams have been very used to working on
their<00:00:28.260> own<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:29.130> they've<00:00:29.279> been<00:00:29.310> used<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.760> having

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
their own so they've been used to having

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.530 
their own so they've been used to having
to<00:00:30.060> deal<00:00:30.269> with<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:31.369> family<00:00:32.369> situation<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:33.180> their

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
to deal with a family situation on their

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.370 
to deal with a family situation on their
own<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.190> for<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.120> Children's<00:00:36.570> Center<00:00:36.960> as

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
own and so for the Children's Center as

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.410 
own and so for the Children's Center as
a<00:00:37.440> new<00:00:37.770> center<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.610> an<00:00:38.820> area<00:00:39.030> where<00:00:39.300> there

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
a new center in an area where there

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.610 
a new center in an area where there
hasn't<00:00:39.570> been<00:00:39.750> anything<00:00:40.020> else<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.440> been<00:00:40.559> a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.770 
hasn't been anything else it's been a
real<00:00:40.770> challenge<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:41.579> st.<00:00:41.940> arrangements<00:00:42.450> it's

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
real challenge in st. arrangements it's

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.900 
real challenge in st. arrangements it's

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
weakness in what you're doing I think

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.950 
weakness in what you're doing I think
that<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.800> key<00:00:53.600> areas<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.780> we've

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
that one of the key areas that we've

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.750 
that one of the key areas that we've
really<00:00:55.379> worked<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.010> our<00:00:56.129> social<00:00:56.370> care

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760

very<00:01:00.809> far<00:01:01.109> away<00:01:01.260> from<00:01:01.410> us<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> families

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
very early concerns around safeguarding

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.380 
very early concerns around safeguarding
and<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:13.560> fact<00:01:13.770> those<00:01:13.920> families<00:01:14.340> now<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
and the fact those families now that the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.820 
and the fact those families now that the
social<00:01:15.720> workers<00:01:16.020> are<00:01:16.140> actually<00:01:16.409> very<00:01:16.560> long

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
social workers are actually very long

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.590 
social workers are actually very long
way<00:01:17.009> away<00:01:17.220> from<00:01:17.250> them<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.540> very

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
way away from them and it's very

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.330 
way away from them and it's very
difficult<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.170> make<00:01:19.290> contact<00:01:19.530> them<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.100> by

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
difficult to make contact them and by

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.070 
difficult to make contact them and by
the<00:01:20.400> very<00:01:20.640> nature<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:21.150> these<00:01:21.270> families<00:01:21.900> they

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
the very nature of these families they

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.800 
the very nature of these families they
don't<00:01:22.290> known<00:01:22.860> even<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.340> landlines<00:01:23.810> they

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
don't known even to have landlines they

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.120 
don't known even to have landlines they
may<00:01:24.990> have<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.200> mobile<00:01:25.380> phone<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:25.890> they<00:01:25.950> have

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
may have a mobile phone but they have

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.280 
may have a mobile phone but they have
credit<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.759> or<00:01:27.299> many<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.840> them<00:01:28.080> live<00:01:28.259> in

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
credit on it or many of them live in

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.870 
credit on it or many of them live in
areas<00:01:28.560> where<00:01:28.770> there's<00:01:28.950> no<00:01:29.070> signal<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.759> think

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
areas where there's no signal so I think

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.760 
areas where there's no signal so I think
they're<00:01:30.090> very<00:01:30.140> isolated<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.380> we've<00:01:31.560> done<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
they're very isolated so we've done a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.390 
they're very isolated so we've done a
lot<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.009> work<00:01:32.280> with<00:01:33.060> social<00:01:33.509> care<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:35.070> kind<00:01:35.340> of

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
lot of work with social care to kind of

a support network isn't about getting
their<00:02:00.090> information<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:00.930> give<00:02:01.140> it

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
their information so we can give it

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.469 
their information so we can give it
somebody<00:02:01.500> secretly<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.310> about<00:02:02.579> getting

somebody secretly it's about getting

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.480 
somebody secretly it's about getting
agencies<00:02:04.200> together<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:05.009> work<00:02:05.189> with<00:02:05.399> the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
bit of a challenge because we don't have

involved<00:03:30.550> with<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.730> family<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:32.470> family

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
involved with the family and the family

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.930 
involved with the family and the family
at<00:03:33.010> very<00:03:33.220> early<00:03:33.310> stage<00:03:33.940> of<00:03:35.610> getting<00:03:36.610> support

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
at very early stage of getting support

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.870 
at very early stage of getting support
from<00:03:37.030> agencies<00:03:37.950> but<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.010> suppose<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.850> fact

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
from agencies but I suppose the fact

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.820 
from agencies but I suppose the fact
that<00:03:40.180> that<00:03:40.360> children<00:03:40.780> center<00:03:41.200> had<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.620> good

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
that that children center had a good

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.560 
that that children center had a good
system<00:03:42.130> in<00:03:42.280> place<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.880> they'd<00:03:43.120> thought<00:03:43.330> about

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
system in place and they'd thought about

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.750 
system in place and they'd thought about
referring<00:03:44.140> to<00:03:44.230> all<00:03:44.350> straight<00:03:44.620> away<00:03:44.860> meant

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
referring to all straight away meant

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.030 
referring to all straight away meant
that<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:47.140> know<00:03:47.260> we<00:03:47.440> had<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.590> seamless

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
that you know we had a seamless

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.350 
that you know we had a seamless
transition<00:03:48.070> well<00:03:48.700> as<00:03:48.820> seamless<00:03:49.180> as<00:03:49.210> possible

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
transition well as seamless as possible

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.630 
transition well as seamless as possible
transition<00:03:50.110> for<00:03:50.230> that<00:03:50.320> family<00:03:50.560> and<00:03:50.980> in<00:03:51.430> fact

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
transition for that family and in fact

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.460 
transition for that family and in fact
we<00:03:52.270> have<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.540> situation<00:03:52.720> where<00:03:53.200> I<00:03:53.230> was

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
we have the situation where I was

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.780 
we have the situation where I was
ringing<00:03:53.740> the<00:03:53.770> health<00:03:53.980> visitor<00:03:54.400> saying<00:03:54.640> this

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
ringing the health visitor saying this

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.400 
ringing the health visitor saying this
family<00:03:55.210> are<00:03:55.240> moving<00:03:55.690> in<00:03:55.810> next<00:03:55.900> week<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:56.350> she

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
family are moving in next week and she

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.750 
family are moving in next week and she
didn't<00:03:56.650> know<00:03:56.710> anything<00:03:56.830> about<00:03:56.950> them<00:03:57.340> yet<00:03:57.520> and

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
didn't know anything about them yet and

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.460 
didn't know anything about them yet and
I<00:03:58.210> think<00:03:58.240> what<00:03:58.570> it<00:03:58.660> showed<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:59.080> us<00:03:59.110> is<00:03:59.440> that

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
I think what it showed to us is that

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.950 
I think what it showed to us is that
families<00:03:59.830> will<00:04:00.220> move<00:04:00.430> from<00:04:00.850> area<00:04:01.240> to<00:04:01.270> area<00:04:01.510> and

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
families will move from area to area and

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.110 
families will move from area to area and
they<00:04:02.560> could<00:04:02.800> be<00:04:02.950> there<00:04:03.160> for<00:04:03.190> good<00:04:03.820> two<00:04:04.090> or

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
they could be there for good two or

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.880 
they could be there for good two or
three<00:04:04.480> weeks<00:04:04.510> before<00:04:04.960> anybody<00:04:05.350> knows<00:04:05.590> they're

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
three weeks before anybody knows they're

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.620 
three weeks before anybody knows they're
there<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:06.370> in<00:04:06.580> that<00:04:06.700> time<00:04:06.910> their<00:04:07.300> issues

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
there and in that time their issues

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.570 
there and in that time their issues
because<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:07.900> best<00:04:08.080> escalate<00:04:08.800> quite<00:04:09.100> high<00:04:09.280> so

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
because the best escalate quite high so

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.390 
because the best escalate quite high so
it<00:04:10.300> had<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:10.480> go<00:04:10.720> into<00:04:11.320> job<00:04:11.740> detection<00:04:12.130> arena

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
it had to go into job detection arena

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.370 
it had to go into job detection arena
but<00:04:12.550> we<00:04:12.670> were<00:04:12.760> able<00:04:12.880> to<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.600> know<00:04:13.750> intervene

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
but we were able to you know intervene

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.740 
but we were able to you know intervene
early
