00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.849
 or what welcome treatments to this video 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.039
 and we will see below how 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.739
 reduce the size of the photographs in 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.480
 Android without losing quality as we see 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.369
 that photos taken on a smartphone 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.020
 they are getting bigger and taller 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.189
 resolution by the number of pixels 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.710
 who argue that in the new 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.390
 devices this implies that it will occupy 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.189
 more storage space like the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.930
 what are we seeing next and 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.000
 also a greater consumption of data at 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.129
 moment to share the images in the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.870
 social networks to reduce the size of 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.880
 a much quicker and easier way 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.670
 let's make an application called 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.650
 image optimizer is an application that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.860
 currently allows to compress files 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.710
 in jpg and png format is an application 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.360
 free and we will install it from 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.860
 google play or in the description of 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.170
 video I leave the link so that 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.170
 can download totally free 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.010
 let's open the application and 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.230
 automatically when running it 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.000
 the application will start scanning the 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.960
 photographs or the images that we have 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.540
 saved in our smartphone 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.630
 let's click here where they say sorbet and 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.610
 let's sort it by date by 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.860
 name or size if we click on 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.400
 size twice will show us 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.960
 first the larger images that 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.909
 we have stored in our 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.830
 device we're just going to 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.729
 select the images are the photos 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.729
 that we have taken 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.280
 and then click where it says 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.280
 optimize 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.560
 now we wait for moments according to the 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.960
 amount of photos will be delayed in covering 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.900
 the images in this case has compressed 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.050
 from 23 to 6.8 megs an approximate size 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.540
 of 72 percent that have reduced 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.170
 it really is very good that simple 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.760
 how can we optimize these images and 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.490
 we can realize that it no longer appears 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.380
 in the list of images with greater 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.649
 size if we go to the configuration 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.510
 we can set the folders where it goes 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.140
 to scan this application by default 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.580
 are those of the camera and those of captures 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.010
 of screen we can select 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.170
 any folder and just at the end 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.460
 select store and if we click on the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.680
 We can remove any folder 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.470
 we can also select a 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.420
 different directory is to say so that 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.150
 do not replace the original photograph 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.590
 I saved it in another folder completely 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.540
 different 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.940
 which is currently the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.800
 photography and we select the directory 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.800
 and click again on select 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.470
 also within the options of 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.630
 configuration we can set the 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.080
 compression size one size of that of 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.150
 percentage of 70 is very well dependent 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.100
 Well, from each one of you, the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.410
 preference you want and in the case of 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.570
 the PNG can be used by levels 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.650
 let's go to the gallery and we're going to 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.620
 check 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.340
 the images that have been optimized 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:14.660
 for this application in this case 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.180
 one of the images is that it weighed 5 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.920
 megas let's go to options have 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.830
 details 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.560
 we will see that 5 megs spent 1.4 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.930
 has really reduced quite a bit and if 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.300
 we zoom in on this image we see that 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.209
 the quality remains the same as it does not 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.640
 has lost any detail in this way 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.530
 it's how you can compress your 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.480
 images comfortably in your 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.120
 smartphone or on your tablet using 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.890
 this free application so far this 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.660
 video and do not forget to subscribe to the channel
