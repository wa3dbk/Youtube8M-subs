00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
 so you have a little video again and 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.120
 Everyone knows Germany here 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:13.620
 candles buns or bread buns or 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:17.150
 whatever you call it, yes and so 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.710
 I built one myself 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:24.000
 that's just heating up 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.519
 this bowl is unfortunately a bit small 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.740
 that's why you drive in a circle 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.990
 See that it drives I have it for 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.880
 a school project made easy says 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.899
 quite simply these two drive too 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.370
 home still electricity 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.450
 this is a tube and that's it 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.690
 also the styrofoam 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.399
 it already looks like it wants to move 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.070
 put the bowl is easy too 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.000
 small 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.140
 but I already have it 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.610
 Bath tried but I wanted 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.079
 now reluctantly in the bathroom 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.579
 make the video yes you should stop 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.350
 for school should make boat 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.910
 drive with the engine or 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.610
 but I have now just for 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.830
 that decided 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.650
 There we will become the teachers 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.360
 already be said that a small 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.200
 children pool set up the drive to it 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.220
 leave because here are the keys of the car 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.110
 plan 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.729
 that's why it can not drive now 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.729
 But one just has seen the inside 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.720
 that's just how it is 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.720
 just so easy 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.220
 it could have been more difficult 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.380
 But I only have one day 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.470
 Maybe that would have been possible now 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.470
 again watching break times then do 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:56.140
 I drive you see 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.140
 It just wants to get in motion 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.670
 but the candle was a bit weak and that was 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.570
 it already 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.570
 thanks for watching
