00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
where I've been business for years so I

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.210

your bench is getting too sticky and
it's<00:02:21.400> probably<00:02:21.610> more<00:02:21.879> when<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.120> add<00:02:22.269> in<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
it's probably more when you add in the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.720 
it's probably more when you add in the
next<00:02:22.840> step<00:02:23.140> which<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:24.299> cream<00:02:25.299> of<00:02:25.420> tartar<00:02:25.959> I

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
next step which is the cream of tartar I

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.130 
next step which is the cream of tartar I
use<00:02:27.730> solid<00:02:28.540> vegetable<00:02:30.180> fat<00:02:31.180> which<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.660> perfect

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
use solid vegetable fat which is perfect

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.990 
use solid vegetable fat which is perfect
in<00:02:32.230> Australia<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.709> use<00:02:32.980> comfort<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.730> can<00:02:33.819> get

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
in Australia I use comfort you can get

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.330 
in Australia I use comfort you can get
from<00:02:34.120> any<00:02:34.209> supermarket<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.319> I<00:02:35.860> use<00:02:36.069> that

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
from any supermarket and I use that

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.629 
from any supermarket and I use that
instead<00:02:36.879> of<00:02:37.950> icing<00:02:38.950> sugar<00:02:38.980> or<00:02:39.220> corn<00:02:39.459> flour

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:39.639 
instead of icing sugar or corn flour

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:40.890 
instead of icing sugar or corn flour
because<00:02:40.030> you<00:02:40.090> don't<00:02:40.269> really<00:02:40.480> want<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.780> be

adding that into this recipe you can see

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:51.260 
adding that into this recipe you can see
this<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.130> coming<00:02:45.340> together

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.850

and think of if you've just put one dot
of<00:04:42.110> color<00:04:42.470> in<00:04:42.770> there<00:04:42.949> how<00:04:43.370> long<00:04:43.610> you<00:04:43.819> would

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
of color in there how long you would

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.820 
of color in there how long you would
need<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.449> knead<00:04:44.720> that<00:04:44.750> through<00:04:45.319> to<00:04:45.500> get<00:04:45.680> the

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
need to knead that through to get the

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.370 
need to knead that through to get the
color<00:04:46.069> consistently<00:04:47.229> through<00:04:48.229> the
