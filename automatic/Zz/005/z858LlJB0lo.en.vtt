00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
is the predominant area of where we get

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.060 
is the predominant area of where we get
plants<00:01:39.240> from<00:01:39.360> our<00:01:39.509> nurseries<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.290> we<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:40.950> go

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
plants from our nurseries and we just go

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.889 
plants from our nurseries and we just go
down<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.520> plant<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:41.850> plant<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.479> each<00:01:42.630> hole

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
down and we plant one plant in each hole

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.230 
down and we plant one plant in each hole
and<00:01:43.170> then<00:01:43.920> under<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> plastic<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:44.820> well<00:01:45.000> you

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
and then under the plastic as well you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.330 
and then under the plastic as well you
see<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.720> drip<00:01:45.990> tape<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.159> how<00:01:47.280> we

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
see this is drip tape this is how we

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.240 
see this is drip tape this is how we
give<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.759> berries<00:01:48.149> nutrients<00:01:48.750> and

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
give the berries nutrients and

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.780 
give the berries nutrients and

the<00:01:55.470> end<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.770> row<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.219> every<00:01:56.880> day<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.360> give

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
the end of the row and every day we give

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.609 
the end of the row and every day we give
the<00:01:57.689> berries<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> little<00:01:58.259> bit<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.439> water

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
the berries a little bit of water

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.399 
the berries a little bit of water
underneath<00:01:59.240> as<00:02:00.240> well<00:02:00.450> as<00:02:00.600> some<00:02:00.719> fertilization

underneath as well as some fertilization

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.469 
underneath as well as some fertilization
it<00:02:01.560> depends<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.130> variety<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.270> want<00:02:03.420> to

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
it depends on the variety but we want to

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.789 
it depends on the variety but we want to
keep<00:02:03.600> them<00:02:03.750> growing<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.350> keep<00:02:04.530> them<00:02:04.680> healthy

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
keep them growing and keep them healthy

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.440 
keep them growing and keep them healthy
all<00:02:05.100> seas<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.520> only<00:02:05.729> other<00:02:05.909> time<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.180> use

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
all seas the only other time we use

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.750 
all seas the only other time we use
overhead<00:02:06.719> irrigation<00:02:06.960> is

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
overhead irrigation is

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.030 
overhead irrigation is
is<00:02:07.940> on<00:02:08.119> a<00:02:08.150> freeze<00:02:08.450> night<00:02:08.750> when<00:02:09.650> we<00:02:09.830> have<00:02:10.010> a

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
is on a freeze night when we have a

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.680 
is on a freeze night when we have a
frost<00:02:10.550> or<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.790> freeze<00:02:10.850> event<00:02:11.450> when<00:02:11.600> the

temperatures below 32 degrees

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.180 
temperatures below 32 degrees
and<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.300> purpose<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:14.960> is<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:16.160> know

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
and the purpose of that is is you know

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.400 
and the purpose of that is is you know
just<00:02:16.610> like<00:02:16.730> your<00:02:16.880> freezer<00:02:17.120> at<00:02:17.330> home

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
just like your freezer at home

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.690 
just like your freezer at home
everything<00:02:18.410> will<00:02:18.620> freeze<00:02:18.830> if<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.490> don't

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
everything will freeze if you don't

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.270 
everything will freeze if you don't
provide<00:02:20.360> water<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:21.320> water<00:02:21.530> provides<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.070> sheet

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
provide water the water provides a sheet

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.910 
provide water the water provides a sheet
of<00:02:22.370> ice<00:02:22.580> over<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.330> plant<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.080> berry<00:02:24.320> it

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
of ice over the plant and the berry it

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.460 
of ice over the plant and the berry it
keeps<00:02:25.250> everything<00:02:25.610> under<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.300> ice<00:02:26.570> at<00:02:26.930> 32

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
keeps everything under that ice at 32

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.070 
keeps everything under that ice at 32
degrees<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:28.270> while<00:02:29.270> it<00:02:29.390> makes<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.660> nice<00:02:29.810> pretty

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
degrees so while it makes a nice pretty

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.720 
degrees so while it makes a nice pretty
picture<00:02:30.350> when<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.040> whole<00:02:31.190> field<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.580> all

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
picture when the whole field is all

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.000 
picture when the whole field is all
white<00:02:32.000> looks<00:02:32.480> like<00:02:32.660> ice<00:02:32.870> it's<00:02:33.500> actually<00:02:33.800> doing

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
white looks like ice it's actually doing

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.400 
white looks like ice it's actually doing
a<00:02:34.070> very<00:02:34.220> good<00:02:34.310> job<00:02:34.460> of<00:02:34.640> protecting<00:02:35.120> we<00:02:35.990> use<00:02:36.230> the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
a very good job of protecting we use the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.700 
a very good job of protecting we use the
same<00:02:36.650> plant<00:02:37.130> all<00:02:38.060> season<00:02:38.720> so<00:02:39.080> when<00:02:39.260> we<00:02:39.380> plant

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
same plant all season so when we plant

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.040 
same plant all season so when we plant
strawberries<00:02:39.950> in<00:02:40.340> October<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.480> plant<00:02:41.870> will

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
strawberries in October that plant will

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.890 
strawberries in October that plant will
continue<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:42.920> produce<00:02:43.130> hand<00:02:44.060> after<00:02:44.510> hand<00:02:44.690> or

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
continue to produce hand after hand or

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.510 
continue to produce hand after hand or
strawberries<00:02:45.380> until<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.770> end<00:02:45.920> of<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.130> season

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
strawberries until the end of the season

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.220 
strawberries until the end of the season
now<00:02:46.970> when<00:02:47.150> we<00:02:47.270> get<00:02:47.390> them<00:02:47.540> in<00:02:47.690> early<00:02:48.020> in<00:02:48.110> the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
now when we get them in early in the

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.380 
now when we get them in early in the
season<00:02:48.410> they're<00:02:48.710> real<00:02:48.920> tiny<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:49.790> they<00:02:49.910> grow<00:02:50.210> as

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
season they're real tiny so they grow as

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.570 
season they're real tiny so they grow as
we<00:02:50.570> add<00:02:50.720> fertilization<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.740> nutrients<00:02:52.220> to

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
we add fertilization and nutrients to

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.980 
we add fertilization and nutrients to
the<00:02:52.700> plan<00:02:52.910> but<00:02:52.940> if<00:02:53.180> you<00:02:53.240> look<00:02:53.390> closer<00:02:53.720> you<00:02:53.960> can

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
the plan but if you look closer you can

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.410 
the plan but if you look closer you can
see<00:02:54.110> that<00:02:54.380> there<00:02:55.220> this<00:02:55.640> plant<00:02:55.910> here<00:02:56.090> is<00:02:56.180> in<00:02:56.300> all

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
see that there this plant here is in all

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.540 
see that there this plant here is in all
different<00:02:56.870> stages<00:02:57.110> we<00:02:57.530> have<00:02:57.710> the<00:02:58.100> initial

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
different stages we have the initial

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.520 
different stages we have the initial
fruit<00:02:58.790> here<00:02:59.150> that's<00:02:59.630> coming<00:02:59.840> on<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.380> this<00:03:00.470> is

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
fruit here that's coming on and this is

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.790 
fruit here that's coming on and this is
what<00:03:00.770> we'll<00:03:00.950> be<00:03:01.040> picking<00:03:01.250> very<00:03:02.150> shortly<00:03:02.800> we

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
what we'll be picking very shortly we

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.199 
what we'll be picking very shortly we
never<00:03:04.010> truly<00:03:04.459> stop<00:03:04.730> picking<00:03:05.060> strawberries

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
never truly stop picking strawberries

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.000 
never truly stop picking strawberries
they're<00:03:05.660> just<00:03:05.870> in<00:03:05.990> different<00:03:06.140> stages<00:03:06.500> so<00:03:06.830> this

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
they're just in different stages so this

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.010 
they're just in different stages so this
fruit<00:03:07.250> will<00:03:07.370> be<00:03:07.400> ready<00:03:08.030> in<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.240> next<00:03:08.330> ten<00:03:08.840> days

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
fruit will be ready in the next ten days

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.680 
fruit will be ready in the next ten days
or<00:03:09.050> so<00:03:09.440> then<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.070> see<00:03:10.250> blooms<00:03:10.610> here<00:03:11.030> on<00:03:11.180> the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
or so then you see blooms here on the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.449 
or so then you see blooms here on the
plant<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.170> that's<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.770> next<00:03:12.950> hand<00:03:13.250> of

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
plant and that's the next hand of

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.860 
plant and that's the next hand of
strawberries<00:03:14.030> that's<00:03:14.180> starting<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.570> come<00:03:14.750> out

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
strawberries that's starting to come out

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.290 
strawberries that's starting to come out
the<00:03:15.650> blooms<00:03:15.950> are<00:03:16.160> generally<00:03:16.550> about<00:03:16.760> one<00:03:17.060> month

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
the blooms are generally about one month

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.090 
the blooms are generally about one month
away<00:03:17.510> once<00:03:18.260> you<00:03:18.320> start<00:03:18.620> seeing<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:18.920> white

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
away once you start seeing the white

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.220 
away once you start seeing the white
flowers<00:03:19.580> and<00:03:19.790> then<00:03:20.360> if<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.570> look<00:03:20.690> even<00:03:20.840> closer

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
flowers and then if you look even closer

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.710 
flowers and then if you look even closer
inside<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.190> plant<00:03:22.489> you<00:03:23.090> can<00:03:23.269> already<00:03:23.480> see<00:03:23.690> a

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
inside the plant you can already see a

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.080 
inside the plant you can already see a
new<00:03:23.989> crown<00:03:24.350> coming<00:03:24.860> out<00:03:24.980> of<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.190> ground<00:03:25.400> so

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
new crown coming out of the ground so

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.400 
new crown coming out of the ground so
while<00:03:26.360> these<00:03:26.540> blooms<00:03:26.900> are<00:03:27.080> going<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.260> be<00:03:27.380> a

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
while these blooms are going to be a

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.320 
while these blooms are going to be a
month<00:03:27.680> away<00:03:27.920> in<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.489> couple<00:03:28.790> of<00:03:28.850> months<00:03:29.030> there's

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
month away in a couple of months there's

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.150
