because<00:01:32.460> after<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.750> all<00:01:33.869> happens<00:01:34.229> very

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
because after that it all happens very

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.530 
because after that it all happens very
fast<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.850> don't<00:01:35.970> want<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.149> do<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.390> by

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
fast if you you don't want to do this by

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.600 
fast if you you don't want to do this by
accident<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.170> know<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.350> get<00:01:37.740> some<00:01:38.189> stuff<00:01:38.430> on

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
accident you know you get some stuff on

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.859 
accident you know you get some stuff on
there<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.939> you're<00:01:39.060> trying<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.329> protect<00:01:39.720> now

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
there that you're trying to protect now

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.030 
there that you're trying to protect now
you<00:01:39.930> really<00:01:40.170> want<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.439> make<00:01:40.560> sure<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.950> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you really want to make sure that you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.010 
you really want to make sure that you
want<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.460> erase<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.000> from<00:01:42.689> there

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
want to erase it from there

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.719 
want to erase it from there
you've<00:01:43.140> got<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.409> reinstall<00:01:43.770> an<00:01:43.920> OS<00:01:44.189> though<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
you've got to reinstall an OS though the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.459 
you've got to reinstall an OS though the
disk<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.240> clean<00:01:45.509> at<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.780> point<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.320> want

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
disk is clean at that point so you want

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.370 
disk is clean at that point so you want
to<00:01:46.530> select<00:01:46.680> reinstall<00:01:47.670> OS<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.719> this<00:01:49.229> is

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
to select reinstall OS and this is

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.190 
to select reinstall OS and this is
obviously<00:01:49.740> an<00:01:49.979> OS<00:01:50.280> 10<00:01:50.520> Lion<00:01:50.820> system<00:01:51.420> now<00:01:51.869> I

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
obviously an OS 10 Lion system now I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.590 
obviously an OS 10 Lion system now I
sort<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.829> thought<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.310> maybe<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:54.000> stored<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
sort of thought that maybe it stored the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.870 
sort of thought that maybe it stored the
entire<00:01:54.899> OS<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.920> hidden<00:01:56.130> partition<00:01:56.520> but<00:01:56.850> I

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
entire OS on that hidden partition but I

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.840 
entire OS on that hidden partition but I
was<00:01:57.060> wrong<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.630> fact<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:58.979> got<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.399> go<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.729> get

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
was wrong in fact it's got to go and get

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.060 
was wrong in fact it's got to go and get
the<00:01:59.969> components<00:02:00.539> from<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.930> Mac<00:02:01.140> App<00:02:01.170> Store<00:02:01.770> so

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
the components from the Mac App Store so

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.950 
the components from the Mac App Store so
you<00:02:02.100> spend<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.939> lot<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.270> time<00:02:03.509> sort<00:02:03.840> of

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
you spend a lot of time sort of

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.779 
you spend a lot of time sort of
retrieving<00:02:04.649> those<00:02:04.770> components<00:02:05.369> from<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.610> web

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
retrieving those components from the web

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.880 
retrieving those components from the web
even<00:02:06.060> more<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.719> than<00:02:06.990> installing<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.710> so

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
even more so than installing it so

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.620 
even more so than installing it so
that's<00:02:08.070> a<00:02:08.130> bit<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.369> headache<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.450> want

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
that's a bit of a headache but you want

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.630 
that's a bit of a headache but you want
to<00:02:09.690> select<00:02:09.870> your<00:02:10.020> Macintosh<00:02:10.560> HD<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.220> same<00:02:11.460> one

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
to select your Macintosh HD the same one

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.190 
to select your Macintosh HD the same one
that<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.790> wiped<00:02:12.120> out<00:02:12.360> as<00:02:12.600> your<00:02:12.810> install

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
that you wiped out as your install

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.450 
that you wiped out as your install
destination<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.950> Cour

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
destination of Cour

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.880 
destination of Cour
and<00:02:14.610> then<00:02:14.970> it'll<00:02:15.120> go<00:02:15.210> reach<00:02:15.750> out<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.350> Apple's

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
and then it'll go reach out to Apple's

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.580 
and then it'll go reach out to Apple's
server<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.600> servers<00:02:18.600> I'm<00:02:19.140> sure<00:02:19.290> they<00:02:19.440> don't

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
server and servers I'm sure they don't

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.040 
server and servers I'm sure they don't
have<00:02:19.710> one<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.460> start<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.450> grab<00:02:21.750> those

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
have one and start to grab those

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.750 
have one and start to grab those
components<00:02:22.800> necessary<00:02:22.920> for<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
components necessary for the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.760 
components necessary for the
installation<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.510> Lion<00:02:24.960> there's<00:02:25.320> obviously

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
installation of Lion there's obviously

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.530 
installation of Lion there's obviously
some<00:02:26.040> kind<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.340> authentication<00:02:26.730> process

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
some kind of authentication process

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.300 
some kind of authentication process
making<00:02:27.750> sure<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.710> they're<00:02:28.980> going<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.160> give

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
making sure that they're going to give

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.310 
making sure that they're going to give
you<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.580> right<00:02:29.850> set<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.480> components<00:02:31.140> for<00:02:31.260> your

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
you the right set of components for your

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.950 
you the right set of components for your
system<00:02:31.950> after<00:02:32.880> that's<00:02:33.030> all<00:02:33.180> completed<00:02:33.690> you

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
system after that's all completed you

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.870 
system after that's all completed you
get<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> system<00:02:34.680> reboot<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.250> then<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.610> begins

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
get a system reboot and then it begins

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.700 
get a system reboot and then it begins
to<00:02:36.090> install<00:02:36.450> this<00:02:36.600> takes<00:02:36.900> about<00:02:37.110> half<00:02:37.230> an<00:02:37.560> hour

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
to install this takes about half an hour

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.770 
to install this takes about half an hour
so<00:02:37.890> it's<00:02:38.010> about<00:02:38.130> 45<00:02:38.550> minutes<00:02:39.150> for<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
so it's about 45 minutes for the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.480 
so it's about 45 minutes for the
download<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.260> then<00:02:40.350> about<00:02:40.530> half<00:02:40.830> an<00:02:40.980> hour<00:02:41.100> for

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
download and then about half an hour for

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.700 
download and then about half an hour for
the<00:02:41.580> install<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.270> not<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:43.200> got<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.470> set<00:02:43.590> aside

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
the install so not you got to set aside

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.560 
the install so not you got to set aside
a<00:02:43.920> little<00:02:44.250> bit<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.460> time<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:45.090> get<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.330> little

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
a little bit of time so you get a little

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.570 
a little bit of time so you get a little
check<00:02:45.780> mark<00:02:46.020> after<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.470> part<00:02:46.770> has<00:02:46.950> completed

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
check mark after that part has completed

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.670 
check mark after that part has completed
and<00:02:47.730> an<00:02:48.180> automatic<00:02:48.510> reboot<00:02:49.110> which<00:02:49.290> will<00:02:49.470> bring

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
and an automatic reboot which will bring

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.710 
and an automatic reboot which will bring
you<00:02:49.830> back<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.130> factory<00:02:50.580> fresh<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.390> will<00:02:51.510> boot

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
you back to factory fresh you will boot

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.540 
you back to factory fresh you will boot
right<00:02:51.959> back<00:02:52.200> up<00:02:52.410> as<00:02:52.590> if<00:02:52.740> you<00:02:52.860> just<00:02:53.070> pulled<00:02:53.370> this

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
right back up as if you just pulled this

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.240 
right back up as if you just pulled this
thing<00:02:53.790> out<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.630> box<00:02:54.840> so<00:02:55.320> anyway<00:02:55.920> guys<00:02:56.040> the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
thing out of the box so anyway guys the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.380 
thing out of the box so anyway guys the
reason<00:02:56.550> for<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:56.760> was<00:02:56.940> just<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.270> illustrate

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
reason for this was just to illustrate

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.530 
reason for this was just to illustrate
the<00:02:58.020> steps<00:02:58.620> involved<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.250> in<00:02:59.520> restoring<00:03:00.420> your

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
the steps involved in in restoring your

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.750 
the steps involved in in restoring your
system<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.050> course<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.560> since<00:03:02.190> it's<00:03:02.340> unlike

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
system of course and since it's unlike

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.850 
system of course and since it's unlike
any<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.180> Mac<00:03:03.360> books<00:03:03.600> before<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.380> thought
