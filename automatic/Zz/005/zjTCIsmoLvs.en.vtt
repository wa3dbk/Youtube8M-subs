00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
first trick that I learned that I was

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.539 
first trick that I learned that I was
psyched<00:00:34.790> about<00:00:34.909> was<00:00:35.299> probably<00:00:35.690> a<00:00:35.780> 360<00:00:36.409> I<00:00:36.589> just

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:37.549 
psyched about was probably a 360 I just

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:40.090 
psyched about was probably a 360 I just
kind<00:00:37.820> of<00:00:37.879> got<00:00:38.089> everything<00:00:38.809> moving<00:00:39.229> and<00:00:39.470> I<00:00:39.769> felt

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
kind of got everything moving and I felt

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.160 
kind of got everything moving and I felt
comfortable<00:00:40.220> with<00:00:40.610> it<00:00:40.760> so<00:00:41.000> kind<00:00:41.780> of<00:00:41.870> made

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
comfortable with it so kind of made

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:56.840 
comfortable with it so kind of made
everything<00:00:42.379> start

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.160 

my<00:00:57.850> favorite<00:00:58.120> part<00:00:58.270> about<00:00:58.330> competing<00:00:58.750> is

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
my favorite part about competing is

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.200 
my favorite part about competing is
landing<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.190> run<00:01:00.370> that<00:01:00.520> I've<00:01:00.670> been<00:01:00.760> working<00:01:01.120> on

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
landing a run that I've been working on

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.930 
landing a run that I've been working on
for<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.840> past<00:01:02.080> week<00:01:02.560> or<00:01:02.740> so<00:01:02.800> just<00:01:03.520> feels<00:01:03.730> good

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
for the past week or so just feels good

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.620 
for the past week or so just feels good
to<00:01:04.000> land<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.280> competing<00:01:06.280> really<00:01:06.820> boosts<00:01:07.450> the

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
to land it competing really boosts the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.490 
to land it competing really boosts the
skill<00:01:07.870> level<00:01:07.900> and<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:09.580> just<00:01:10.240> basically<00:01:10.630> ski<00:01:11.470> a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
skill level and you just basically ski a

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.840 
skill level and you just basically ski a
lot<00:01:11.680> better<00:01:11.860> because<00:01:12.160> everyone<00:01:12.610> else<00:01:12.640> is

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
lot better because everyone else is

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.490 
lot better because everyone else is
skiing<00:01:13.090> better<00:01:13.330> I'm<00:01:14.020> not<00:01:14.260> really<00:01:14.410> nervous

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
skiing better I'm not really nervous

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.650 
skiing better I'm not really nervous
