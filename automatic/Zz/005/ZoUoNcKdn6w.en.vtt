00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.460
 hello that such friends as strangers I am 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.220
 lupita welcome to the channel the recipes 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.550
 from the hospital it seems to them if we start 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.660
 with today's recipe we are going to prepare 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:17.560
 a rich blackberry sauce blic o 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.280
 mirror that will serve us for cake 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:25.850
 we are going to need 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.850
 a cup of water a cup of sugar 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.219
 the juice of an orange and blackberry sauce 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.320
 fresh or frozen I the ones that I have 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.690
 here they are frozen 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.470
 and the first thing we're going to do is put 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.370
 in a pot the sugar with water to 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.370
 form a syrup 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.030
 here we have already boiling our 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.449
 sugar with water 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.610
 the syrup is already being made and what 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.969
 I am now going to do is add the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.969
 blackberries 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.409
 and I'm going to let them cook for a few 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.100
 minutes approximately from 10 to 15 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:19.290
 minutes 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.290
 we add our orange juice 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:30.070
 and let's let them cook 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.070
 for approximately 10 or 15 minutes 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.030
 I 'm going to cover this and in ten minutes 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.850
 I will check 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.560
 15 minutes have passed and we see how 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.820
 they start to get rid of the blackberries 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.610
 we can undo them with a fork and 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.770
 a spoon or with the potato press 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.300
 and we're going to let them continue to boil 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.300
 until the sauce its kind 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.410
 I forgot to tell you at the beginning of 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.110
 recipe that we would also need 3 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.750
 tablespoons of corn starch dissolved in 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.910
 a quarter cup of water 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.600
 I now that they are boiling 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.590
 I will add blackberries 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.590
 little by little 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.990
 so that they begin to thicken well 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.990
 blackberry sauce 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.760
 since my sauce started to thicken I'm going to 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:34.189
 add the rest of the corn starch 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.189
 I have here in my middle fire 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.020
 and I have not stopped moving it 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.000
 so that they are not going to hit me and so 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.270
 I will continue 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.640
 until you have the desired thickness if 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.050
 you see that it is still watery 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.050
 or something like that can add another 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.000
 teaspoon of corn starch and if you 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.590
 it's too thick they can add a 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.590
 a little more orange juice 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:17.700
 here we have our sauce 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.910
 I'm going to let her cool down so she can 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.840
 package 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.490
 or decorate 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:30.050
 in the cake or bread 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:32.870
 or I do not know some hot that made a few crepes a 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.470
 toasted bread let's wait for it 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.600
 cool 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.590
 here we have our sauce 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.380
 blackberry and the container I put in this 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.000
 small 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.940
 and now I'm going to cover it 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.160
 I hope you liked the video that 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.290

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.740
