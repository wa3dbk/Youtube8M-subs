00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.589
 uninterruptible power supplies series 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.870
 dual chipboard 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.639
 are very powerful systems in terms of 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.929
 computational capabilities of algorithms 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.420
 energy conversion 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.790
 the initial version had a functional 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.590
 inverters switching to the network in the new 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.300
 same software version 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.890
 source feature added 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.050
 battery charging current 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.630
 the highest in the world among sources 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.220
 uninterruptible power supply for 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.859
 demonstration of device capabilities 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.109
 start the term using the car for 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.420
 This assembled the next system in 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.530
 car instead of battery connected 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.530
 uninterrupted power supply unit 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.379
 so how when running the car starter 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.260
 can be significant current surges and 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.120
 no battery buffer available for 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.680
 vehicle electronics protection applied 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.989
 electrolytic drive 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.390
 the capacitor is also connected to the terminals 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.860
 battery 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.960
 as there is no source of energy 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.520
 uninterruptible power supply not 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.520
 turns on the display 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.920
 connect the wires to the battery and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.430
 run the uninterrupted source 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.430
 power supply 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.610
 for the charge system settings we enter 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.610
 programming menu 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.060
 set the charge voltage to 13 volts 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.030
 support charge voltage also 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.410
 13 volts 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.410
 maximum charge current 250 amperes 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.790
 turn on the source switches to the network 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.310
 and displays charge status now 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:08.679
 no extra wires on the battery 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.780
 need to produce 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.239
 measurement is necessary so that the car does not 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.640
 started by turning the starter 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.050
 so to turn on the starter using 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.090
 special wire connected 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.530
 retractor relay 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.530
 the ignition switch is in the off position 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.489
 that fell on this starter wire 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.290
 spinning average current when the starter 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.510
 is about 120 amps 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.430
 accordingly the charger is not 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.190
 limits current and stabilizes 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.360
 voltage level is dark from properties 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.489
 However, at the beginning of the starter 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.709
 voltage subsides yes about 7 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.860
 volt means current at this moment 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.780
 250 amps for this experience 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.640
 applied special firmware which 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.040
 allows the charger to operate at such 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.209
 low voltage battery serial 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.280
 uninterruptible power supply 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.250
 instantaneous shutdown threshold is 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.860
 80 is permanently programmed 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.310
 Now we will start the car regularly 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.310
 disconnect the wire 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.430
 we start the car ex 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.190
 the car started the same way as from 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.110
 battery because the algorithm 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.750
 Charger operation includes 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.790
 power factor corrector 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.590
 effective current value in wires 220 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.620
 Volt is small that allows 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.620
 use thin brake wires
