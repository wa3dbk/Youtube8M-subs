 my name is newly laid cable at the WM am responsible for the 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.800
 Development of the complete overview alone 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.009
 like the remote control 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.900
 and I want to know you today 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.079

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:27.230
 completely new 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.230
 Preller drinking glass 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.830

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.830
 we have more dial up competition 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.590
 for beginners affordable prices 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.390
 developed 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.340
 so that one 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.890
 a beginner 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.450
 his car 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.980
 and with this the car can develop with its capabilities 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.960
 as I said the car is 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.710
 Scale 1 17 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.650
 one of Good Bye Bye as you can see 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.970
 a few features to mention these are maybe in this one too 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.400
 Price category very unusual the front of the driveway 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.880
 both customers 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.250
 with a screwdriver 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.410
 of the author 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.410
 as in the small slipper 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.480
 either 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.590
 always perfect in propulsion provides as rebellious 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.050
 the whole thing is a cardan drive 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.799
 as we consider this as the efficient driving technology for 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.980
 look at 4 area 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.000
 16 plastic bag stabilizers front back I think also very unusual 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.950
 Furthermore, many different settings are the prohibition the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.950
 Future who left position 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.890
 any track conditions 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.780
 be adjusted 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.080
 the rtr seduction 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.230
 provides 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.370
 around 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.560
 because for beginners 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.930

 Lutz Motor calls 5 40 larger 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:15.289
 and fine 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:18.719
 1600 was 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.719
 Of course this can be done 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:25.369
 the development of one's own driving skills 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.679
 be successively and gradually replaced 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.879
 around the car with its diverse has 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.160
 around the car 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.020
 guided Fight for color variants the one here one sees blue-white 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.020
 and that of elastic and busy 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.479
 that will clear up 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:47.479
 do not buy together when driving 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.419
 the purchase then ran during development 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.149
 for the tires 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:54.759
 the turmoil 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:57.759
 should be citizens for the competition area 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.799
 bring excellent performance and for the beginning of the ARD 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:05.449
 maximum liability 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:08.079
 offer at the first driving tests 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.719

 OMV claims leadership 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.610
 Other new products for this year are Dr 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.599
 it crashes takes the rtr podcast 8 BM Ciudad Real 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.590
 because it is also in the 1 8 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.879
 in scale 1 8 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.319
 based on our 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.099
 the most successful 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.699
 Burned versions

 from the Best of Tapes and s8 Bates are now available 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.809
 also as electric version 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:50.529
 this has been allowed 

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:53.609
 existing know-how merged 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.399

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.259
 50 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.159
 successful automaker 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.159
 we have now created a product what 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.479
 either 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:12.199
 the shutter drive which also already successfully used in the competition 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.279
 was as on 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:17.979
 our well-known design 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.300
 Aichach seducer vehicles what they now perfect from the weight distribution 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.719
 the electrical version has been adjusted 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:28.889
 Features are natural 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.740
 the SPD to the 8 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.199
 and the way to the 8 engines 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.090
 As I said both would be successfully used in the competitive field in 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.090
 America and Europe are already big races 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:45.620
 Falco last year as always 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.819

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.330
 many settings 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.599
 so for everyone 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.759
 to be the right one 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.870
 where the two cars are maybe already learned from the press 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.180
 drivers are now off 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.580
 available immediately

 Also new to felt or evenings is the s 8 resp 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.229
 in the dispute 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.819
 at a strip should in this case 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:26.990
 the value instead of the Wii u 20 megahertz FM to them control system 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.509
 2 Thomas Lidy's heart recipient 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.599
 so installed 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:38.729
 NRW Sek 3 RX receiver 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:44.919
 can then be used with m11x as well as with harvesting the troupe lessons 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.759
 the Blade Warband etc 3 EQs 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:52.300
 and Bell understandably with the LRP c3 is in the boat second time 4 gigahertz 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.479
 destruction 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.999
 the other features 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:57.869
 while percent 

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:02.639
 exactly equal to the features percent of the program Neshat or rtr 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.960
 but as I said with a second time 4 gigahertz receiver 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.029
 so that one does not take any of the aforementioned cases 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:12.500
 must be around this car 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.539
 then directly 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.539
 driven with ambiguous March 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.530
 According to the already well-known Ehlert website Expo 2010 is back as 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.960
 Remote control 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.850
 Colors like yellow 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.300
 a new era cheap mad 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.569
 cheaper 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:35.289
 but not less good 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:40.779
 seven new 2 2 marked the destruction of the LRP ride 2 SGX pro 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.080
 since then the DRS 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.569
 as the name naturally says 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:47.949
 there will be 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.220
 the onslaught on the testing empty 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.450
 a trouble-free second time less than ten hours 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:56.749
 space 

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:59.089
 a fault by 

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:00.849
 op of the setting 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:03.469
 impossible 

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:07.870
 the door from this remote control are of course again the function for 

00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:10.159
 both channels 

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:13.139
 sorry for the clock 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:15.119
 also for both channels 

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:16.960
 a normal confirmation 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.530
 Of course, Blanco and that of our very small 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:22.899
 and robust 

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:26.089
 three channel 2 2 times 4 gigahertz receiver 

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:29.319
 he has 2 the bread second frequent 

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:32.339
 every day she's perfect with these compounds 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:36.370
 for remote control for beginners but also for advanced users 

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:40.379
 with a very appealing design 

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:42.489
 to always stop it
