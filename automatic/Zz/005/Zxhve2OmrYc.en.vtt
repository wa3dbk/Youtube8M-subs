what<00:00:20.570> I<00:00:20.600> proposed<00:00:21.050> in<00:00:21.230> the<00:00:21.320> 1960s<00:00:22.100> is<00:00:22.340> a

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.370 
what I proposed in the 1960s is a

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.790 
what I proposed in the 1960s is a
continental<00:00:23.030> scale<00:00:23.320> invention<00:00:24.320> for

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
continental scale invention for

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.170 
continental scale invention for
harnessing<00:00:25.640> wind<00:00:26.210> where<00:00:26.660> it<00:00:26.780> was<00:00:27.010> plentiful

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
harnessing wind where it was plentiful

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.690 
harnessing wind where it was plentiful
such<00:00:29.180> as<00:00:29.330> we<00:00:29.450> do<00:00:29.600> here<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.320> this<00:00:31.160> becomes<00:00:31.550> then

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
such as we do here and this becomes then

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.360 
such as we do here and this becomes then
a<00:00:31.760> wind<00:00:32.210> turbine<00:00:32.960> driving<00:00:33.379> a<00:00:33.530> generator<00:00:33.829> that

is the same as this unit it's presently

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.620 
is the same as this unit it's presently
the<00:00:40.070> electrolyzer<00:00:40.579> because<00:00:41.030> it's<00:00:41.180> in<00:00:41.300> a<00:00:41.390> solar

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630

the electrolyzer because it's in a solar
rich<00:00:42.290> moment<00:00:42.920> so<00:00:43.310> I<00:00:43.340> brought<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.700> same

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
rich moment so I brought the same

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.210 
rich moment so I brought the same
they're<00:00:44.329> both<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:44.600> same<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:45.230> this<00:00:45.500> is<00:00:45.710> in<00:00:45.920> the

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
they're both the same and this is in the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.710 
they're both the same and this is in the
representation<00:00:46.610> of<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.120> deserts<00:00:47.450> and<00:00:47.600> other

convert<00:00:51.500> it<00:00:51.590> to<00:00:51.620> electricity<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.460> then<00:00:52.610> to

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
convert it to electricity and then to

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.900 
convert it to electricity and then to

the fuel potential energy in hydrogen
and<00:00:56.059> oxygen<00:00:56.450> so<00:00:57.170> this<00:00:57.290> represents<00:00:57.860> then<00:00:58.160> the

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
and there the water columns above it so

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.440 
and there the water columns above it so
it's<00:02:15.110> slightly<00:02:15.350> pressurized<00:02:15.950> here<00:02:16.910> we<00:02:17.210> have

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
it's slightly pressurized here we have

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.680 
it's slightly pressurized here we have
the<00:02:17.630> ox

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
the ox

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.059 
the ox
stored<00:02:19.380> into<00:02:19.770> this<00:02:19.920> tube<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:21.950> oops

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
stored into this tube and oops

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:30.320 
stored into this tube and oops
oh<00:02:23.340> no<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.750> hurt<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:28.620> turn<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:29.040> around<00:02:29.330> over

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
oh no that hurt to turn it around over

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.830 
oh no that hurt to turn it around over
here<00:02:30.600> we<00:02:30.990> have<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:32.130> output<00:02:32.160> tube<00:02:32.910> from<00:02:33.720> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
here we have the output tube from the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.170 
here we have the output tube from the
hydrogen<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.620> output<00:02:35.130> from<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.819> oxygen

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
hydrogen and the output from the oxygen

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.470 
hydrogen and the output from the oxygen
going<00:02:37.110> down<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.100> fuel<00:02:38.340> cell<00:02:38.610> which<00:02:39.330> is

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
going down to the fuel cell which is

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.210 
going down to the fuel cell which is
converting<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.080> gasses<00:02:40.560> into<00:02:40.860> electricity

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
converting the gasses into electricity

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.390 
converting the gasses into electricity
which<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:41.970> going<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:43.709> little<00:02:43.950> motor<00:02:44.100> with

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
which is going to the little motor with

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.500 
which is going to the little motor with
the<00:02:44.520> window

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
the window

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.180 
the window
yeah<00:02:45.720> it's<00:02:45.900> reversible<00:02:46.260> as<00:02:46.470> well<00:02:46.500> it's<00:02:47.010> a

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
yeah it's reversible as well it's a

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.550 
yeah it's reversible as well it's a
motor<00:02:47.610> generator<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.870> at<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.080> moment<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.530> is

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
motor generator and at the moment it is

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.650 
motor generator and at the moment it is
being<00:02:49.920> demonstrated<00:02:50.190> as<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.610> motor<00:02:50.850> but<00:02:51.570> I'm

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
being demonstrated as a motor but I'm

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.600 
being demonstrated as a motor but I'm
also<00:02:51.840> note<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.530> importantly<00:02:53.130> so<00:02:53.370> we're

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
also note and importantly so we're

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.490 
also note and importantly so we're
making<00:02:53.910> water<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.510> we<00:02:54.959> could<00:02:55.080> just<00:02:55.380> as<00:02:55.470> well

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
making water and we could just as well

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.949 
making water and we could just as well
have<00:02:55.709> started<00:02:56.100> with<00:02:56.220> bad<00:02:56.430> water<00:02:56.670> or<00:02:57.060> ocean

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
have started with bad water or ocean

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.120 
have started with bad water or ocean
water<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.650> produced<00:02:59.010> hydrogen<00:02:59.489> one<00:03:00.390> kilo<00:03:00.840> of

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
water and produced hydrogen one kilo of

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.680 
water and produced hydrogen one kilo of
hydrogen<00:03:02.130> then<00:03:02.280> produces<00:03:02.730> 9<00:03:02.910> kilos<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.540> pure

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
hydrogen then produces 9 kilos of pure

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.860 
hydrogen then produces 9 kilos of pure
water<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.200> it's<00:03:04.319> also<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:05.390> water<00:03:06.390> purification

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
water so it's also a water purification

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.400 
water so it's also a water purification
system<00:03:07.650> in<00:03:07.680> operation<00:03:08.519> as<00:03:08.880> much<00:03:09.690> as<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:09.989> is<00:03:10.019> an

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
system in operation as much as it is an

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.699 
system in operation as much as it is an
energy<00:03:10.950> distribution<00:03:11.550> system<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:13.170> this<00:03:13.560> is

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
energy distribution system so this is

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.710 
energy distribution system so this is
reversible<00:03:14.040> then<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.580> this<00:03:14.790> instead<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.360> being

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
reversible then so this instead of being

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.170 
reversible then so this instead of being
spun<00:03:16.050> by<00:03:16.290> electricity<00:03:16.680> this<00:03:17.519> could<00:03:17.850> be<00:03:18.030> a

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
spun by electricity this could be a

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.740 
spun by electricity this could be a
motor<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:19.550> wind<00:03:20.550> generator<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.390> wind<00:03:21.600> is

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
motor a wind generator that the wind is

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.650 
motor a wind generator that the wind is
blowing<00:03:21.989> that's<00:03:22.860> making<00:03:23.340> electricity<00:03:23.700> that's

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
blowing that's making electricity that's

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.199 
blowing that's making electricity that's
going<00:03:25.049> through<00:03:25.079> this<00:03:25.709> fuel<00:03:26.100> cell<00:03:26.370> reversible

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
going through this fuel cell reversible

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.759 
going through this fuel cell reversible

applications that we'll discuss in more
detail<00:03:49.310> later<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.150> could<00:03:51.359> actually<00:03:51.480> run

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
detail later so you could actually run

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.990 
detail later so you could actually run
both<00:03:52.200> of<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.530> cells<00:03:52.799> as<00:03:53.070> electrolyzers<00:03:53.790> and

both of the cells as electrolyzers and
turn<00:03:54.180> around<00:03:54.450> run<00:03:54.630> both<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:54.959> cells<00:03:55.440> as<00:03:55.620> fuel

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
turn around run both the cells as fuel

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.099 
turn around run both the cells as fuel
cells<00:03:56.070> yes<00:03:56.459> quite<00:03:56.640> right<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:57.180> meet<00:03:57.840> peak

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109

loads<00:03:58.560> or<00:03:59.070> store<00:03:59.730> energy<00:04:00.180> when<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.630> have

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
loads or store energy when you have

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.229 
loads or store energy when you have
surplus<00:04:01.290> electricity<00:04:01.890> from<00:04:02.040> any<00:04:02.250> source<00:04:02.519> so

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
surplus electricity from any source so

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.670 
surplus electricity from any source so
this<00:04:03.359> gives<00:04:03.570> a<00:04:03.720> way<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.019> level<00:04:04.470> the

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
this gives a way to level the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.069 
this gives a way to level the
utilization<00:04:05.340> of<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.880> existing<00:04:06.329> grid<00:04:06.540> and

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
utilization of the existing grid and

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.590 
utilization of the existing grid and
again<00:04:07.829> our<00:04:07.980> theme<00:04:08.190> is<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:08.790> get<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:08.940> much<00:04:09.150> larger

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
again our theme is to get a much larger

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.300 
again our theme is to get a much larger
return<00:04:09.959> on<00:04:10.140> investment<00:04:10.709> for<00:04:10.920> what<00:04:11.040> we<00:04:11.160> already

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
return on investment for what we already

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.080 
return on investment for what we already
have<00:04:11.640> then<00:04:12.299> if<00:04:12.570> we<00:04:12.690> continue<00:04:12.870> on<00:04:13.380> present

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
have then if we continue on present

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.490 
have then if we continue on present
