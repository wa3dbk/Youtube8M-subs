about<00:00:23.850> incentives<00:00:24.560> well<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.769> think<00:00:26.220> incentives

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
about incentives well I think incentives

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.060 
about incentives well I think incentives
are<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.480> as<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.529> say<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> book<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
are the as we say in the book the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.919 
are the as we say in the book the
cornerstone<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.580> modern<00:00:29.730> life<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.630> you

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
cornerstone of modern life that that you

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.650 
cornerstone of modern life that that you
can<00:00:31.099> if<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.309> didn't<00:00:32.579> have<00:00:32.669> if<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.510> had<00:00:33.600> to

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
can if you didn't have if you had to

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.720 
can if you didn't have if you had to
take<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.780> first<00:00:34.050> guess<00:00:34.320> at<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.399> was<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.670> to

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
take a first guess at what was going to

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.549 
take a first guess at what was going to
predict<00:00:36.030> what<00:00:36.090> people<00:00:36.390> are<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.690> do<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
predict what people are going to do the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.170 
predict what people are going to do the
best<00:00:37.739> place<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.160> start<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.610> by<00:00:38.700> looking<00:00:38.969> at

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
best place to start is by looking at

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.639 
best place to start is by looking at
what<00:00:39.239> their<00:00:39.480> tenants<00:00:39.840> are<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.410> may<00:00:40.500> not

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
what their tenants are and it may not

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.380 
what their tenants are and it may not
always<00:00:40.710> be<00:00:40.980> right<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:41.460> if<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.850> know<00:00:42.120> what

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
always be right but if you know what

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.180 
always be right but if you know what
people's<00:00:42.780> incentives<00:00:43.170> are<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.980> good

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
people's incentives are you have a good

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.740 
people's incentives are you have a good
good<00:00:44.789> guess<00:00:44.969> what<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.300> done<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.570> past

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
good guess what have done the past

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.569 
good guess what have done the past
typical<00:00:46.140> guess<00:00:46.320> what<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.559> code<00:00:47.010> maybe<00:00:47.250> money

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
typical guess what the code maybe money

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.529 
typical guess what the code maybe money
maybe<00:00:47.789> fame<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.420> maybe<00:00:48.770> family<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.100> may<00:00:50.250> be

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
maybe fame and maybe family it may be

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.000 
maybe fame and maybe family it may be
yeah<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:51.870> talk<00:00:52.050> about<00:00:52.199> social<00:00:52.469> incentive

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
yeah so we talk about social incentive

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.090 
yeah so we talk about social incentive
Sprint's<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.699> kind<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.379> social<00:00:55.379> stigma

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
Sprint's it's the kind of social stigma

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.040 
Sprint's it's the kind of social stigma
and<00:00:56.250> penalties<00:00:56.730> were<00:00:57.090> praised<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.600> that

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
and penalties were praised that that

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.020 
and penalties were praised that that
colleagues<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.800> family<00:00:59.520> members<00:00:59.760> can<00:00:59.910> heap

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
colleagues can family members can heap

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.310 
colleagues can family members can heap
on<00:01:00.180> someone<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:00.660> actually<00:01:00.960> believe<00:01:01.079> those

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
on someone and we actually believe those

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.410 
on someone and we actually believe those
are<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.710> most<00:01:01.949> cases<00:01:02.160> more<00:01:02.820> powerful<00:01:03.270> than

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
are in most cases more powerful than

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.119 
are in most cases more powerful than
financial<00:01:03.780> incentives<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.769> then<00:01:04.979> there<00:01:05.100> are

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
financial incentives and then there are

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.190 
financial incentives and then there are
even<00:01:05.369> moral<00:01:05.700> incentives<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.240> mean<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.510> think<00:01:06.540> one

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
even moral incentives I mean I think one

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.510 
even moral incentives I mean I think one
of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> big<00:01:07.500> questions<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.950> always<00:01:08.159> struck

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
of the big questions that always struck

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.039 
of the big questions that always struck
me<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.939> when<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.420> think<00:01:09.570> about<00:01:09.630> crime<00:01:10.020> and

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
me is when you think about crime and

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.170 
me is when you think about crime and
people<00:01:10.530> will<00:01:10.619> ask<00:01:10.710> me<00:01:10.830> what<00:01:11.430> WI's<00:01:11.670> crime<00:01:12.000> so

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
people will ask me what WI's crime so

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.969 
people will ask me what WI's crime so
high<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:13.049> I'll<00:01:13.170> say<00:01:13.290> no<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.560> think<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.830> real

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
high and I'll say no I think the real

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.100 
high and I'll say no I think the real
question<00:01:14.130> twice<00:01:14.430> crimes<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.939> low<00:01:15.119> every<00:01:15.900> day<00:01:16.080> I

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
question twice crimes of low every day I

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.920

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.039 
worried I'm going to flip around here so
what<00:01:32.939> did<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.090> find<00:01:33.240> out<00:01:33.329> about<00:01:33.390> crime<00:01:33.810> rate

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
what did you find out about crime rate

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.609 
what did you find out about crime rate
and<00:01:34.159> abortion<00:01:35.159> well<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.060> what<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.869> believe<00:01:37.350> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
and abortion well so what I believe to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.660 
and abortion well so what I believe to
be<00:01:37.890> true<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.310> think<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.549> evidence

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
be true and I think the evidence

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.719 
be true and I think the evidence
supports<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:40.100> hypothesis<00:01:41.100> which<00:01:41.310> many

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
supports it is a hypothesis which many

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.330 
supports it is a hypothesis which many
people<00:01:42.030> find<00:01:42.150> jarring<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.869> disturbing<00:01:43.470> but

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
people find jarring and disturbing but

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.310 
people find jarring and disturbing but
nonetheless<00:01:44.579> i<00:01:44.909> believe<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.509> probably

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
nonetheless i believe is is probably

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.230 
nonetheless i believe is is probably
right<00:01:46.590> which<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.850> legalization<00:01:48.210> of

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
right which is that the legalization of

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.319 
right which is that the legalization of
abortion<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.140> 1970s<00:01:50.009> was<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
abortion in the 1970s was one of the

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.880 
abortion in the 1970s was one of the
primary<00:01:51.630> reasons<00:01:51.869> why<00:01:52.200> crime<00:01:52.500> fell<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
primary reasons why crime fell in the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.639 
primary reasons why crime fell in the
1990s<00:01:53.610> because<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.270> whole<00:01:54.810> generation<00:01:55.049> of
