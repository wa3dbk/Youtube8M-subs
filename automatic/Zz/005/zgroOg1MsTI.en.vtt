 hi i am yayo saldarriaga and i will be with 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.379
 you in the diploma and lesson of 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.510
 art as a teacher 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.120
 here and all three I remember 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.630
 when I was just beginning in photography 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.970
 the address time from before 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.980
 it was very well known only you could 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.350
 appreciate in productions that the very 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.090
 big 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:35.580
 it was almost weird to talk in those 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.790
 terms here in Peru is more me 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.710
 I remember that in the 90's 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.280
 the photographer was coming to be a kind of 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.500
 art director because he decided where he 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.900
 they put the objects that they clothe of beautiful 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.300
 to the model what kind of hairstyle what is 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.120
 the environment that I had used then 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.239
 like everything fell on the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.410
 Photographer's responsibility on the day of 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.839
 see the art direction has been 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.420
 become a very important point 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.430
 for any type of production either 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.580
 a production of technique for a 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.030
 commercial or for a short film a 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.920
 documentary a movie for obligation 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.800
 photographic is more high address 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.300
 for photographs of objects the direct 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.909
 speaker must learn not only to 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.380
 compose what will be in place 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.630
 captured by the camera but from 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.509
 what elements and why they have more weight 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.850
 than others and where they should be located 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.640
 that somehow one wins more 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.549
 importance that if in your light is a 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.450
 very intense school 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:44.149
 so I think that if there is a 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.420
 direction race and give you the toulouse is 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.360
 the precise place indicated to take it 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.399
 the next they study in your light are 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.460
 people who are required a lot 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.610
 and that seems good to me because in the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.820
 requirement is where it looks 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.740
 the talents that come up I want 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.560
 invite friends to the diploma of 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.200
 art direction that I am very sure 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.810
 that will cover expectations is going to 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.210
 convert 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.680
 produced 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.980
 the team of professionals who 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.970
 we need other professionals to 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.970
 do our work better
