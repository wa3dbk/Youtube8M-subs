00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.190
 hello everyone on this occasion we are going to 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.250
 recycle tetrabrik packaging to make 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.279
 this beautiful Christmas sphere and so power 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.750
 decorate in these parties subscribe if 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.180
 you have not done it yet so you do not 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.250
 miss any recycling video and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.070
 Stay with me to see how I did this 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.340
 nice sphere with tetra brik good for 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.640
 start let's draw on our 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.350
 container tetra brik measurement circles 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.230
 that you want, I'm going to do it 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.480
 with an opening of the compass of a 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.629
 centimeter and a half so they will come out 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.030
 circles of 3 centimeters in diameter 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.910
 Well, nothing once we make several 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.820
 circles that are going to be 20 we're going to 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.309
 cut them and let's draw a triangle 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.949
 in them I'm going to draw them in a 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.890
 blank paper because if you drew it on 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.920
 the tetrabrik will not be able to see it and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.470
 We make the respective circle that 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.270
 I'm commenting to draw the triangle 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.270
 within this circle 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.259
 we are going to put ourselves anywhere 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.259
 the circumference 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.250
 we click 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.080
 and let's make a mark to the left 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.120
 and a mark to the right after 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.780
 we click on one of the brands that we have 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.380
 made will open to the other 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.380
 brand 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.230
 we make a third brand and there already 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.400
 We have the three brands needed to 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.970
 our time now we simply join 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.970
 these brands 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.890
 and we have already marked a triangle inside 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.320
 of the circumference to not be 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.320
 doing this process in each of the 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.540
 circles what I do is do it one and 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.119
 when I frame the circles in the 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.760
 tetrabrik I put it on and I do 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.670
 small marks in each of the 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.830
 tips of our triangle and now yes 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.209
 I can join the lines to form the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.310
 triangles within our 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.370
 circumference once you already 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.820
 we have cut out we are going to double 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.430
 the lines that make up the triangle what 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.160
 we turned towards the silver part 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.280
 they will stay this way well then 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.040
 let's go and take glue and what 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.860
 we put in one of the eyelashes that it has 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.410
 we are going to unite it with another one of 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.620
 this way and we will sustain with a 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.590
 clip or what you have for 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.860
 sustain this type of work we are going to 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.739
 join another triangle but look carefully 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.060
 that have to go together with the tips 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.730
 upwards 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.220
 in this it is with the tip up and 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.590
 this one too so the next 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.190
 we also look at them with the tip towards 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.600
 above 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.600
 so we put glue and paste with 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.570
 the tip up and now we're going to 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.430
 place the following in total 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.799
 we will place 5 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.109
 well we have to stay more or less 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.750
 so here with all the clamps you can not see 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:24.470
 very good but here I already have one ready 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.660
 and this is the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.850
 the final part or how we will remain 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.820
 the five united triangles we're going to 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.270
 make two equal pieces two out of five 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:39.170
 let's join the central part of our 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.690
 sphere we are going to use for this ten 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.840
 circles and we will join them from the 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.370
 next way before we were joining 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.790
 all the triangles with the tip towards 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.610
 up in this case we are going to join one 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.400
 up and the other down the 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.320
 next with the tip up and the 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.240
 next down 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:06.510
 well up to finish the ten circles and 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:09.299
 join also the first with the last 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:14.330
 and now the next step will be to add 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:17.420
 this piece to the center court 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.060
 we already have the first part stuck and 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.510
 before pasting the second part we are going to 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:27.800
 pass a string or ribbon that you 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.110
 have to be able to hang our experts 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.950
 for that I have cut a small 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.020
 tetrabrik circle 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.900
 and I have here the string that I'm going to 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.150
 put 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.200
 and once we've done that , we do 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.740
 a knot 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.740
 here 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:50.180
 leaving enough tape or lamb 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.759
 to be able to place it 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:57.650
 So we have secured the 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:05:03.070
 string and now we're just going to pass 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.070
 through the middle of our party 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.200
 this round visit does not ensure that 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.210
 our string is not going to go out I'm going to 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.600
 put a little bit of glue here to 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.700
 that I will not move and now I have 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.090
 ready then nothing now yes we can paste 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.220
 to the rest of our sphere let's go 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.160
 placing glue on all 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.000
 tabs and we 're going to stick it to the rest of 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.740
 the sphere fixing it with our tweezers 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.560
 if you are liking this video give me 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.750
 I like and share this video as 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.300
 can see even though we have not yet 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.360
 removed the tweezers is already seeing how 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.030
 our Christmas sphere will be 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.030
 well this is the work we have done 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.820
 today and this is how our 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.040
 recycling of tetrabrik remember that if 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.280
 you liked this video you can leave me 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.040
 Like it and share it with your friends and 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.380
 relatives at the end of this video you 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.810
 I leave other videos to recycle in 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.880
 this Christmas, I only hope that 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.770
 I hope there I liked you so 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.670
 do and see you in the next video 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.670
 until next time
