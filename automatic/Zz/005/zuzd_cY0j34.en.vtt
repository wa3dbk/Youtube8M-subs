00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:07.660
 you do not have that ezekiel is here to see and 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:10.210
 please give me some mountain I did not think 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.599
 that was going so early this year it's 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.179
 doing a little cold you liked the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.519
 spectacular mountain people mostly 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:20.019
 well I have to tell you before 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.789
 directly address the issue that the 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.199
 games returned the bank cards 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.029
 from the province of buenos aires here the 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.140
 white bay plaza shopping the days 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.729
 Thursday with the cards with the 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.789
 plastics I felt the lender 

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:32.230
 oldest in the country by 20 percent 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.490
 source of the possibility of paying in 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.380
 six installments without interest to know 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.930
 what are the many bay shops 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.330
 white plaza shopping adhered to this 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.060
 promises on the bank's website the 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.800
 Province of Buenos Aires but there is a lot 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.090
 people who are already stimulated by this 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.400
 climate that we have innovative that offers 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.440
 s open thinking about your project to 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.790
 the snow this winter is what it suggests 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.710
 mountain that is what can not be left 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.660
 of carrying the year was mount what 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.960
 suggests always is dressing in three 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.270
 layers if first the first layer 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.760
 just what you have is a shirt 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.920
 thermal that is indispensable for 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.070
 retain body heat and eliminate 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.430
 Too much faster 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.560
 the second layer is suggested a micro 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.140
 polar can be a vest can be a 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.660
 busito a jacket the polar micro what 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.729
 will give us is freedom of movement and 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.850
 in turn what is going to generate us is something 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.830
 that is not so heavy if you do not have something 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.170
 heavy we will be more free to 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.910
 move and it will generate heat and 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.040
 thermal retention is good and the 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.110
 third and last layer of obviously is 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.390
 the jacket the jacket can be a 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.040
 three-layer jacket yes where one chooses the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.770
 coat if you wear a little more a little 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.300
 minus the so-called a technical jacket 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.759
 exactly where there is breathability 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.800
 but above all there is impermeability 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.780
 that what will give us is the protection 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.149
 against snow what we are saying 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.950
 when both for the lady and for the 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.630
 horse for the lady as for the 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.960
 Gentleman always the models come 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.490
 to give me a knight in a cloth 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.490
 equally each of the same style 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.720
 snow pants that can be in 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.220
 sharp skin is a fabric called soft 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.830
 cell also that comes elastic and well 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.780
 waterproof or something also between layers 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.280
 with a lot of breathability 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.270
 and that allows us a lot of freedom of 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.650
 movement of the pÃ©rez boot and that is 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.420
 indispensable to walk on the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.280
 snow so it will allow us to move 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.860
 freely about about the year 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.110
 thermal socks gloves and with respect to 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.819
 the thermal socks we can make stockings 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.220
 of first skin so that the one who suffers 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.130
 much the cold and add another half 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.260
 above and if not a single as how it is used 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.520
 classically the eyes and body that 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.080
 visited we put the goggles 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.120
 indispensable for vision for 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.890
 its also with the vision and adding 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.930
 some hat we can add a bar 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.430
 yes that's the multifunction handkerchiefs 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.569
 that we do not press like neck those that 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:03.000
 they use as a hat they are the truth that very 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.000
 very very ductile would be the word 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.489
 The mountain proposal is very worthy of consideration 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.379
 because good does not only allow you 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.510
 be in the conditions that you have to 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.030
 be your body but also gives you 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.790
 the ability to search so very 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.290
 our models 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.660
 exactly now every time the fabrics are 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.400
 more techniques there are more and more engineering 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.950
 in them and this what allows us 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.480
 fashion and protection at the same time 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.659
 good 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.060
 with the right frame so that we 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.409
 we present we say goodbye thinking about 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.250
 the snow and the heap 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.250
 thanks to you
