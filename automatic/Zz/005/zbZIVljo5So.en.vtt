another<00:02:20.140> very<00:02:20.470> useful<00:02:20.890> tool<00:02:21.099> that<00:02:21.370> we<00:02:21.489> will

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
another very useful tool that we will

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.600 
another very useful tool that we will

that were working with in the scene it's

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.150 
that were working with in the scene it's
very<00:02:34.239> useful<00:02:34.629> for<00:02:34.959> when<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.530> are<00:02:35.680> modeling

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
elements inside the user interface so

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.080 
elements inside the user interface so
let's<00:03:34.540> turn<00:03:34.780> off<00:03:34.959> time<00:03:35.560> slider<00:03:35.889> we<00:03:36.670> don't<00:03:36.910> need

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
let's turn off time slider we don't need

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.660 
let's turn off time slider we don't need
that<00:03:37.299> go<00:03:38.200> back<00:03:38.380> up<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.709> your<00:03:38.829> elements<00:03:39.370> we<00:03:39.489> can

that go back up to your elements we can

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.120 
that go back up to your elements we can
turn<00:03:40.000> off<00:03:40.180> range<00:03:40.569> slider<00:03:40.900> so<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.769> turns<00:03:41.950> out

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
turn off range slider so it turns out

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.770 
turn off range slider so it turns out
some<00:03:42.310> of<00:03:42.340> these<00:03:42.459> animation<00:03:42.970> elements<00:03:43.329> that<00:03:43.569> we
