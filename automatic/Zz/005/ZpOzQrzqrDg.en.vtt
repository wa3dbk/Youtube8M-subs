performance with the XLR one the actual

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.850 
performance with the XLR one the actual
audio<00:01:03.090> being<00:01:03.420> determined<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.080> little<00:01:04.409> bit<00:01:04.589> by

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
audio being determined a little bit by

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.710 
audio being determined a little bit by
the<00:01:04.920> audio<00:01:05.519> interface<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.270> plug<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.600> in

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the audio interface that you plug it in

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
the audio interface that you plug it in
to<00:01:06.960> plug<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.920> into<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.159> rubbish<00:01:08.490> audio

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
to plug it into a rubbish audio

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.130 
to plug it into a rubbish audio
interface<00:01:09.240> you're<00:01:09.479> going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> get<00:01:09.750> poorer

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
interface you're going to get poorer

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.380 
interface you're going to get poorer
sound<00:01:10.500> quality<00:01:10.950> put<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.580> into<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> good<00:01:12.090> audio

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
sound quality put it into a good audio

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.630 
sound quality put it into a good audio
interface<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.170> you're<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.100> certainly

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
interface and you're going to certainly

benefit<00:01:15.570> from<00:01:15.900> using<00:01:16.350> better<00:01:16.770> quality

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
benefit from using better quality

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.300 
benefit from using better quality

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it very very good for doing the sort of

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.819 
it very very good for doing the sort of
videos<00:01:38.909> i<00:01:39.210> do<00:01:39.270> if<00:01:40.200> i<00:01:40.350> had<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.560> choose<00:01:40.619> between

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
videos i do if i had to choose between

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.889 
videos i do if i had to choose between
the<00:01:41.280> two<00:01:41.490> i<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:42.060> couldn't<00:01:42.390> do<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.540> i<00:01:42.689> would

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
the two i just couldn't do it i would

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.990 
the two i just couldn't do it i would
probably<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.770> all<00:01:43.890> fairness<00:01:44.130> look<00:01:44.579> around<00:01:44.850> at

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
probably in all fairness look around at

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.389 
probably in all fairness look around at
the<00:01:45.119> pricing<00:01:45.720> maybe<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.590> style<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> mic

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
the pricing maybe the style of the mic

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.490 
the pricing maybe the style of the mic
see<00:01:47.729> which<00:01:47.909> fits<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.360> best<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:48.840> your<00:01:48.960> setup

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
see which fits in best with your setup

of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> two<00:01:52.799> microphones<00:01:53.430> are<00:01:53.729> really<00:01:54.689> going

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
of the two microphones are really going

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.780 
of the two microphones are really going
to<00:01:54.930> deliver<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.500> what<00:01:56.070> you're<00:01:56.219> expecting<00:01:56.520> when
