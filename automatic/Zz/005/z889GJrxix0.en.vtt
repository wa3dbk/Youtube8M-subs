00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.170

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:12.620
 say that I already made a shipment of 250 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:16.350
 super training books has been 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.600
 well something spectacular so one last 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.020
 last two days in fact these beards 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.939
 they are not because I'm leaving 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.610
 beard for sure but because I have not had 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.870
 time to shave 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:33.020
 and good has been spectacular 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.540
 the launch of this book has been 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.230
 fantastic has a lovely welcome 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.040
 phenomenal there have been people who have 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.940
 I have already dedicated the dedicated order 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.500
 the term of the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:53.820
 dedications I'm sorry but back I 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.330
 very very beautiful very intense and good the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.980
 truth is that I never never thought that 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.140
 I would be signing books the truth is that 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.190
 I was funny to myself signing books 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.610
 but but so a very nice experience 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.970
 and good and I believed and I wanted to talk in this 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.220
 video and not of the book but of the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.940
 importance of training 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.040
 it does not matter what kind of discipline you are 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.300
 training that or whatever yours is 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.620
 spearfishing if it is professional apnea 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.650
 to compete 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:35.440
 it does not matter if you are free rider of 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:39.380
 agreement training is what gives you 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.990
 knowledge and learning about what 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.670
 you will find yourself later in the sea 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.260
 but not because of what you find in the 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.190
 sea ​​because the sea you're going to find a 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.900
 lots of variables 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.270
 then at home you can not train 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.400
 inside the sea because the sea is in the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.800
 sea ​​and your house is in your house but if 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:00.320
 you can know your body and your mind your 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.150
 reactions to apnea and this is what 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.260
 that I encourage you to train the 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:10.429
 discipline that is but beyond 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.819
 train the apnea itself yes what 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.650
 I recommend that you train and practice 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.109
 some points where you know that 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.269
 you need to improve the kidney stroke by 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:23.629
 example in spearfishing as it is more 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.250
 complex because he has the rifle with what 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.349
 which which would be the position 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.250
 correct and what would be the position 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.510
 correct to plummet how to carry 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.730
 The rifle 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.000
 with the safety buoy and so on 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.870
 etcetera good then to go training and see 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.560
 at what points 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.560
 I have to improve 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.700
 and in the apnea in the dynamic apnea in the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.560
 static apnea in pre-investment apnea 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.840
 constant weight be the discipline that is 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.890
 also keep training especially going 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:03.360
 training your mind and creating a series of 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.630
 mental patterns that you choose for 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.460
 think before and during your apnea in fact 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.140
 I have a student called 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.300
 Roberto Aguilar and we are laughing 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.700
 very much now everyone reading their 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.860
 comments and is studying in his 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.110
 online internet profile and he has 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.200
 there are a number of things that are taught 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.660
 to strengthen your mind and there you have caught 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.780
 a mantra a kind of mantra and good 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.360
 the first thing he said was 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.100
 I am not the one who suffer with the 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.990
 contractions and the blows 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.100
 diaphragmatic 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.210
 is my body is not my mind is my body 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.310
 then it was about controlling yourself 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.010
 and in fact it works for you one day a day 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.230
 next came back to comment something like that and 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.940
 said I did good after the bullshit 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.430
 Yesterday's day did not work for me 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.500
 this but when the blows came to me 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.360
 diaphragmatic and contractions 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.870
 I became aware of 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.570
 I repeated again the same phrase of no 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.750
 it is my mind that suffers is my body and 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.910
 it did not work and I did but when it happened 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.520
 account of what I was thinking and of 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.410
 what I was thinking was focusing his 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.030
 attention in the pains began to 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.480
 pronounce a mantra that was 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.670
 pronouncing the letter and constantly 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.860
 to blur their attention from the 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.660
 diaphragmatic strokes and focus on 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.440
 pronounce the letter and now this 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.950
 served this made his mind go 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.320
 deconcentra headquarters of the blows 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.350
 and good is one of the techniques of 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.510
 Mantras have been used for centuries 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.500
 to leave your mind blank and you can 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:46.650
 help also means find where 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.140
 you have to improve and look for resources 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.480
 I agree something that you know works 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.420
 because if it works for you if I decide now 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.889
 think about something 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.169
 and then I do an apnea 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.860
 and transfer that kind of thinking to 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:06.370
 sea is quite likely to come out 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:10.080
 very similar to how I have done it now 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:13.389
 dry and if you do not have resources ask me 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.879
 write make comments here below where 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.240
 you want with all the doubts that 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:20.639
 have and 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.849
 and fabrics and fabrics I will answer this kind of 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:27.270
 things the training the training 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:31.139
 super training is very important you 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.539
 I encourage you that if you do not have the book, 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:36.680
 you take it I do not know I do not know how many are left 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.680
 there were 500 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:44.700
 I've done a shipment of almost 250 in the 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.700
 last four days so 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.099
 There are few I encourage you to ask 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.070
 and good and that you enjoy the method 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.160
 training that is working has 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:02.409
 operated has helped a lot of people 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:05.409
 and I'm really worth it 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:08.679
 and nothing else this is what I wanted you 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:11.949
 talk about your particular training 

00:06:08.679 --> 00:06:14.679
 practices and trains dry and what 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:16.839
 you want to train in the water in the sea 

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:18.369
 sometimes always with a partner who 

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:21.550
 be watching after your day 

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:24.069
 when you have finished fishing 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.430
 you have finished practicing 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:29.250
 train certain things 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.810
 your partner flirts and hears you wait for me 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.290
 of 5 minutes I'm going to make two descents 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:38.130
 to practice this concretely take it 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:41.070
 the kidney blow and the position of the 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:43.740
 verticality the propulsion of 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:46.350
 kicks of force to boost from to 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.780
 principle whatever it is in what you believe 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.449
 what do you have to improve 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.240
 so nothing else 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:57.590
 I hope that 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:00.580
 enjoy the sea and if you watch this video in 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:03.830
 some other web page that you know that in 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:06.349
 apnea training dotcom has 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:09.380
 a lot of videos like this one you have a 

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:11.479
 private video area and you also have 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.130
 there it is not moving all the 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:15.620
 community asking questions give 

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:18.050
 answers etcetera etcetera nothing more 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:21.550
 Have a good day or a good night 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.550
 and happy barely
