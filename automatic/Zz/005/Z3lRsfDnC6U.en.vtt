 pinch of oregano a lemon a handful of

 spaghetti the equivalent of a ration

 for two people and the juice of a lemon 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.730
 well let's start with the 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.730
 elaboration of this dish 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.820
 the first deadline to make this dish 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.430
 is to take the lemon and on a grater 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.010
 and grate the bark that we're going to 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.720
 Reserve to dress the spaghetti more 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.580
 late what we are going to do to 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.129
 continuation is that with the lemon that already 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.740
 we have scratched it we are going to cut it into four 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.400
 fat slices and the rest we 're going to 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.590
 cut into finite slices 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.170
 the next room we are going to make is 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.940
 get a saucepan with water and bring the 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.320
 water boiling 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.880
 once we see that the water is already 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.740
 boiling what we are going to do is 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.040
 add a pinch of salt 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.720
 in this perfect and desirable way the 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.790
 handful of spaghetti 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.060
 next what we are going to do is 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.720
 pick and pepper the breasts 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:41.700
 this form link pimenta mos we are 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.700
 now a little pepper 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.799
 this 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:51.159
 and we take the thin slices of lemon and 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.590
 we are going to put them inside this 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.370
 form together with a pinch 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.060
 of oregano 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:04.390
 order and now we put together the two parts of 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.880
 the breasts acÃ­n and this we are going it to 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.220
 put to fry in a pan is 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.200
 important that people are finite 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.080
 because if not, they will not do well inside 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.540
 unless you want to get a breast 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.660
 fat and open it in half that in this 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.790
 case would be the same 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.100
 Now what we have done is catch and in 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.900
 one part impose oil to heat 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.400
 once what's hot 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.680
 let's do is with the slices 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.680
 Thick lemon we are going to take 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.260
 the shape 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.870
 very well perfect 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.960
 and we're going to take the tickets that 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.650
 we have prepared before 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.010
 and we're going to put them on top and we're going to 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.010
 leave 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.680
 once spent a few minutes we have 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.269
 turned the breasts as you see 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.489
 in the part where the slices of 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.469
 lemon have been a bit raw so 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.299
 so much later what we are going to do is 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:03.840
 remove the lemon slices and let's go 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:06.450
 to take another turn on each side 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.069
 once they have finished doing it and 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.870
 what we have done is that we have 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.700
 drained and we have put it in a 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.310
 salad bowl and now what we're going to do 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.860
 they are lining up for it what we're going to 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.710
 to do is catch and stable the parsley 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.270
 chopped 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:28.080
 this forms the juice of a lemon 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:32.940
 lemon rind effect left 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.630
 before like this in this perfect way there 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.550
 goes 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.550
 a track of olive oil 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.099
 Pepper 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.390
 and a little bit of 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.299
 and now we are going to remove everything very 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.299
 all right 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.900
