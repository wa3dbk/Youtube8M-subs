00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.190
 is to focus on the game place, says Karen from 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.199
 the beginning i did a different deal 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.690
 mallorca the arguments you both 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.970
 they liked asking to make the cards 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.740
 will make the Bretons first in 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.619
 sequence but you asked the cadets 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.750
 Okay, let's make the stadt credits is the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.359
 breed that follow various traits of cats 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.809
 right then they are the organisms of 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.969
 Credits are the mutant mutant quotes 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.390
 and oscar infantile now the name of the theme 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.770
 thiele inhabitants are located next to 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.530
 also south of the right 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.250
 bordering with ciro goal and worth 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.780
 roth 7 sorry to pronounce yourself blow 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.719
 but for English 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.449
 is a region of closed forests and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.610
 burning deserts that have thigh 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.829
 point its own climate vegetation then 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.840
 it is not a copy of skype is right 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.180
 very cool an application fee 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.040
 I recommend for you to see certain who 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.830
 download right who does not have unfortunately 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.010
 only then the Tupi but it's also legal only 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.720
 to know is the dream of small 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.000
 if we compare with other provinces 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.710
 and both me and skype in defendant Sergio 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.310
 I think it's a little bit further than the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.380
 half of the total land of skyrim and 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.540
 half pension but with a certain credit 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.020
 is known for his intelligence and 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.390
 agility abuse accused certain well 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.400
 similar to cats themselves are stealthy 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.560
 with silent story right well 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.930
 Like cats, there is a certain 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.409
 skill for warrior and his great 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.799
 intelligence despite being recognized as 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.280
 kg are smart they are rarely wizards 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.640
 is intelligence is more gifted to the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.890
 control of magic they do not have this gift 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.670
 they are the smartest of them is more 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.780
 for stealth right then 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.180
 robbery planning 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.619
 It's that kind of right thing then 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.020
 ideal to go with what the 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.340
 very good thieves I even played with katy 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.170
 I do not usually stay on the right track. 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.789
 I play more with imperial, I played with Kate. 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.210
 in thieves church is awesome 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.870
 31 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.450
 very fast the sell part of the game 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.110
 sergio cad tissot without clawing right in 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.030
 hands 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.000
 different from other breeds such as 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.740
 example of humans that pressures 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.920
 notebooks that do not have and causing 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.710
 extra with those sure asses is and how it is 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.110
 that a cat is just a defense and no weapon 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.630
 without anything it is not difficult to see a cat 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.120
 formed in the street but in the game the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.150
 claws are their defense beyond their 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.650
 night vision is that as cats also the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.620
 ratings are very similar to cat 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.900
 have is the night view that in 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.060
 places in a minor 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.700
 leaves the right light in places 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.890
 dark as she was an ultra 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.890
 violet is an infrared in the case of 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.780
 lethal red that sees in the dark and 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.670
 skype this is a certain power that you 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.400
 you can turn it on and off as long as you like 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.220
 How many times a day do they come 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.130
 crowded these powers in some 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.680
 work out how the thieves there when 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.960
 making england is very useful right 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.050
 very useful even their different bodies 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.470
 of humans are covered for sure. 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.600
 calls to fear for sure this 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.800
 wrong policy please correct right 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.550
 It has a digestive system 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.890
 to differentiate the right then the system 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.300
 their digestive system is not the same 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.970
 example of the Norse Imperials 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.520
 human beings is differentiated as from an animal 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.520
 Right, I do not know how to use it without hearing cat 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.500
 is differentiated is to walk and 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.870
 themselves are also traits that 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.220
 differentiate cadets from seven to seven 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.650
 candidates as well as Angolans are 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.780
 called races beasts well that 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.270
 had noticed there are beast races of the empire 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.270
 without any report that still proves 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.970
 right now in every shaky accusation of 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.100
 cadets with other inter races are very 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.920
 for thieves and have their own 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.770
 traces of certain warrior expelled then 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.390
 the traits of warriors and this is very 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.880
 Thank you for watching the right video. 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.060

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.500
 joinha sure you liked the video 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.390
 evaluates the video primarily from its 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.430
 criticism leaves the suggestion that people 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.370
 can improve on the right channel 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.750
 if you are new 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.280

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.199
 returning video stage that has a 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.520
 making difficult returned we're 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.590
