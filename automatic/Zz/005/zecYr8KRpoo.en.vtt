00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
which is an absolute plus where you

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.740

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
protection as well now this case is an

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.669 
protection as well now this case is an
absolutely<00:01:25.210> fun<00:01:25.600> case<00:01:25.869> I<00:01:26.140> mean<00:01:26.380> look<00:01:26.409> over
