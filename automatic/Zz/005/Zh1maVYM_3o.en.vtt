00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
repeaters here and we're going to put

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.420 
repeaters here and we're going to put
three<00:02:28.019> on<00:02:28.049> three<00:02:28.500> tix<00:02:29.239> like<00:02:30.239> so<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:32.310> was

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
three on three tix like so and that was

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.429 
three on three tix like so and that was
just<00:02:32.579> one<00:02:32.790> tick<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.930> one<00:02:34.140> we're<00:02:34.260> going<00:02:34.379> to

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
just one tick this one we're going to

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.490 
just one tick this one we're going to
run<00:02:34.560> from<00:02:35.280> here<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.750> go<00:02:36.900> this<00:02:37.230> one's<00:02:37.409> still

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
run from here and go this one's still

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.520 
run from here and go this one's still
too<00:02:37.829> wide<00:02:38.040> but<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.819> a<00:02:38.849> lot<00:02:39.209> neater<00:02:40.019> looking

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
too wide but it is a lot neater looking

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.039 
too wide but it is a lot neater looking
I<00:02:40.709> couldn't<00:02:41.430> get<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:42.060> one<00:02:42.540> wide<00:02:42.750> because

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
I couldn't get it to do one wide because

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.839 
I couldn't get it to do one wide because
it's<00:02:43.620> creating<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.099> loop<00:02:44.250> with<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.519> bud<00:02:44.670> switch

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
it's creating a loop with the bud switch

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.369 
it's creating a loop with the bud switch
but<00:02:45.480> so<00:02:46.049> be<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:47.629> alright<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:48.750> now<00:02:49.139> we<00:02:49.200> need

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
and then just run a line if you're

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.360 
and then just run a line if you're
familiar<00:04:03.599> with<00:04:03.900> redstone<00:04:04.379> this<00:04:04.769> portion

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
familiar with redstone this portion

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.559 
familiar with redstone this portion
should<00:04:05.609> be<00:04:05.760> really<00:04:06.030> easy<00:04:06.060> for<00:04:06.329> you<00:04:06.659> guys

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.780 

alright<00:04:12.499> awesome<00:04:12.680> while<00:04:13.099> you<00:04:13.249> can<00:04:13.400> test<00:04:13.579> it

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
alright awesome while you can test it

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.539 
alright awesome while you can test it
out<00:04:13.989> just<00:04:14.989> put<00:04:15.140> one<00:04:15.319> block<00:04:15.560> down<00:04:15.769> and<00:04:16.009> make

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
out just put one block down and make

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.150 
out just put one block down and make
sure<00:04:16.579> that<00:04:16.910> all<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.359> wall<00:04:17.600> goes<00:04:18.320> crazy<00:04:18.739> on<00:04:18.889> you

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
sure that all the wall goes crazy on you

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.090 
sure that all the wall goes crazy on you
all<00:04:19.820> right<00:04:20.030> beyond<00:04:20.630> that<00:04:20.870> I<00:04:21.109> you<00:04:21.620> know<00:04:21.739> got<00:04:21.949> it

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
all right beyond that I you know got it

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.890 
all right beyond that I you know got it
from<00:04:22.250> a<00:04:22.370> fellow<00:04:22.580> youtuber<00:04:23.120> who<00:04:23.389> watched<00:04:23.630> the

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
from a fellow youtuber who watched the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.420 
from a fellow youtuber who watched the
showcase<00:04:24.350> online<00:04:25.360> apparently<00:04:27.130> science<00:04:28.130> can

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
showcase online apparently science can

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.930 
showcase online apparently science can
hold<00:04:28.699> back<00:04:29.830> you<00:04:30.830> know<00:04:30.919> a<00:04:30.949> leaf<00:04:31.310> growth<00:04:31.550> it<00:04:31.789> like

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
hold back you know a leaf growth it like

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.150 
hold back you know a leaf growth it like
restricts<00:04:32.419> it<00:04:32.599> so<00:04:32.900> that<00:04:33.680> seems<00:04:33.889> to<00:04:34.039> work

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
restricts it so that seems to work

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.089 
restricts it so that seems to work
pretty<00:04:34.340> well<00:04:34.490> so<00:04:34.880> we'll<00:04:35.030> run<00:04:35.240> with<00:04:35.449> mr.<00:04:36.380> Walter

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:37.099 
pretty well so we'll run with mr. Walter

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.770 
pretty well so we'll run with mr. Walter
DS<00:04:37.509> theory<00:04:38.509> on<00:04:38.630> that<00:04:38.660> it<00:04:39.620> holds<00:04:39.830> up<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.789> on

here<00:04:42.169> what<00:04:42.440> I<00:04:42.470> added<00:04:43.130> now<00:04:43.699> is<00:04:44.110> actually<00:04:45.130> man<00:04:46.130> a

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
here what I added now is actually man a

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.999 
here what I added now is actually man a
normal<00:04:47.599> piston<00:04:47.990> one<00:04:48.710> of<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:48.889> main

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
normal piston one of the main

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.189 
normal piston one of the main
constraints<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:49.759> you<00:04:50.509> know<00:04:50.630> that<00:04:50.840> makes<00:04:51.080> the

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
constraints and you know that makes the

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.790 
constraints and you know that makes the
tree<00:04:51.380> scroll<00:04:51.710> on<00:04:51.940> slower<00:04:52.940> is<00:04:53.380> leaves<00:04:54.380> being

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
tree scroll on slower is leaves being

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.920 
tree scroll on slower is leaves being
directly<00:04:55.400> above<00:04:55.820> you<00:04:56.300> know<00:04:56.449> where<00:04:56.599> the<00:04:56.720> tree

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
directly above you know where the tree

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.260 
directly above you know where the tree
is<00:04:56.960> so<00:04:57.919> just<00:04:58.160> put<00:04:58.400> an<00:04:58.520> extra<00:04:58.729> piss<00:04:58.970> in<00:04:59.120> there

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
is so just put an extra piss in there

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.850 
is so just put an extra piss in there
it'll<00:04:59.389> push<00:04:59.630> the<00:04:59.660> leaves<00:04:59.990> out<00:05:00.229> it<00:05:00.500> just<00:05:00.530> kind

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
it'll push the leaves out it just kind

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.300 
it'll push the leaves out it just kind
of<00:05:00.919> saves<00:05:01.160> you<00:05:01.310> a<00:05:01.340> bit<00:05:01.490> of<00:05:01.520> time<00:05:02.889> so<00:05:03.889> yeah<00:05:04.039> from

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
of saves you a bit of time so yeah from

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.010 
of saves you a bit of time so yeah from
here<00:05:04.430> and<00:05:04.610> we're<00:05:04.729> going<00:05:04.849> to<00:05:04.910> just<00:05:05.090> connect

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
here and we're going to just connect

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.320 
here and we're going to just connect
these<00:05:06.229> I<00:05:07.270> normally<00:05:08.270> put<00:05:09.050> glow<00:05:09.979> stone<00:05:10.820> there

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
these I normally put glow stone there

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.689 
these I normally put glow stone there
I'll<00:05:12.199> put<00:05:12.470> water<00:05:12.710> flow<00:05:13.070> in<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:13.310> event<00:05:13.520> of

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
I'll put water flow in the event of

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.879 
I'll put water flow in the event of
saplings<00:05:14.090> which<00:05:14.599> if<00:05:14.840> you're<00:05:15.020> restricting<00:05:15.650> the

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
saplings which if you're restricting the

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.430 
saplings which if you're restricting the
leaves<00:05:16.669> from<00:05:16.789> growing<00:05:17.120> you're<00:05:17.930> not<00:05:18.110> gonna<00:05:18.229> get

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
leaves from growing you're not gonna get

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.920 
leaves from growing you're not gonna get
a<00:05:18.500> lot<00:05:18.800> of<00:05:18.830> saplings<00:05:19.280> so<00:05:19.820> that's<00:05:20.120> going<00:05:20.810> to<00:05:20.870> be

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
a lot of saplings so that's going to be

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.330 
a lot of saplings so that's going to be
up<00:05:21.080> to<00:05:21.110> you<00:05:21.320> guys<00:05:21.349> if<00:05:21.800> you<00:05:21.919> want<00:05:21.949> to<00:05:22.190> see<00:05:22.310> a

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
up to you guys if you want to see a

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.610 
up to you guys if you want to see a
return<00:05:22.550> on<00:05:22.820> a<00:05:23.080> resource<00:05:24.080> that<00:05:24.139> you're<00:05:24.380> using

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
return on a resource that you're using

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.040 
return on a resource that you're using
up<00:05:24.889> then<00:05:25.190> you<00:05:25.310> know<00:05:25.430> kind<00:05:25.849> of<00:05:25.970> snow<00:05:26.630> take<00:05:27.020> it

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
up then you know kind of snow take it

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.589 
up then you know kind of snow take it
easy<00:05:27.409> on<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:29.530> on<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:30.590> science<00:05:31.340> I<00:05:31.550> just<00:05:32.360> put<00:05:32.509> on

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
easy on the on the science I just put on

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:33.909 
easy on the on the science I just put on
them<00:05:32.750> here<00:05:32.960> though<00:05:33.139> like<00:05:33.530> on<00:05:33.740> the<00:05:33.889> inside

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
them here though like on the inside

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.879 
them here though like on the inside
portions<00:05:34.900> put<00:05:35.900> nothing<00:05:36.229> in<00:05:36.349> here<00:05:36.560> though<00:05:36.740> on

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
portions put nothing in here though on

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:38.560 
portions put nothing in here though on
these<00:05:37.130> walls<00:05:37.370> even<00:05:37.699> though<00:05:37.789> they<00:05:37.909> do<00:05:37.970> get

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
these walls even though they do get

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.230 
these walls even though they do get
leaves<00:05:39.470> up<00:05:39.770> there<00:05:39.949> just<00:05:40.159> don't<00:05:40.789> do<00:05:40.909> it<00:05:40.940> every

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
leaves up there just don't do it every

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.899 
leaves up there just don't do it every
stretch<00:05:41.479> the<00:05:41.630> tree<00:05:41.870> too<00:05:42.020> much<00:05:42.550> from<00:05:43.550> here<00:05:43.759> on

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
stretch the tree too much from here on

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:47.980 
stretch the tree too much from here on
you<00:05:45.610> can<00:05:46.610> put<00:05:46.880> the<00:05:46.970> signs<00:05:47.240> pretty<00:05:47.840> much

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
you can put the signs pretty much

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.520 
you can put the signs pretty much
anywhere<00:05:48.800> you<00:05:48.919> want<00:05:49.130> guys<00:05:50.080> you'll<00:05:51.080> see<00:05:51.289> leaves

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
anywhere you want guys you'll see leaves

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.659 
anywhere you want guys you'll see leaves
growing<00:05:51.830> everywhere<00:05:52.099> and<00:05:52.340> you<00:05:52.400> can<00:05:52.520> just

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
growing everywhere and you can just

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.969 
growing everywhere and you can just
place<00:05:52.940> them<00:05:53.120> everywhere<00:05:53.680> that's<00:05:54.680> going<00:05:54.830> to<00:05:54.889> be

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
place them everywhere that's going to be

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.670 
place them everywhere that's going to be
up<00:05:55.130> to<00:05:55.280> you<00:05:55.520> now<00:05:56.479> what<00:05:56.960> we'll<00:05:57.080> do<00:05:57.259> is<00:05:57.469> we'll

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
up to you now what we'll do is we'll

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.050 
up to you now what we'll do is we'll
simulate<00:05:58.250> a<00:05:58.460> full-blown<00:05:59.469> tree<00:06:01.060> situation

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
simulate a full-blown tree situation

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.839 
simulate a full-blown tree situation
only<00:06:02.630> works<00:06:03.050> with<00:06:03.229> oak<00:06:03.440> so<00:06:03.979> can<00:06:04.400> I<00:06:04.460> stress<00:06:04.820> that

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
only works with oak so can I stress that

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.360 
only works with oak so can I stress that
enough<00:06:05.030> and<00:06:05.449> honestly<00:06:05.780> I<00:06:06.080> don't<00:06:06.650> think<00:06:06.979> I<00:06:07.130> do<00:06:07.190> I

enough and honestly I don't think I do I

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.770 
enough and honestly I don't think I do I
probably<00:06:07.699> should<00:06:07.940> say<00:06:08.180> that<00:06:08.360> a<00:06:08.389> lot<00:06:08.539> more

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
probably should say that a lot more

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.700 
probably should say that a lot more
often<00:06:10.419> so<00:06:11.419> this<00:06:11.630> is<00:06:11.659> you<00:06:11.960> know<00:06:12.080> assuming<00:06:12.440> that

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
often so this is you know assuming that

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.170 
often so this is you know assuming that
you've<00:06:12.830> already<00:06:12.979> put<00:06:13.250> some<00:06:13.400> work<00:06:13.550> in<00:06:13.849> and

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
you've already put some work in and

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.120 
you've already put some work in and
you're<00:06:14.330> getting<00:06:14.479> a<00:06:14.830> good<00:06:15.830> role<00:06:16.099> of<00:06:16.219> them<00:06:16.340> going

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
you're getting a good role of them going

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.709 
you're getting a good role of them going
alright<00:06:19.130> and<00:06:19.400> let's<00:06:19.909> see<00:06:20.419> we're<00:06:20.539> going<00:06:20.659> to

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:20.719 
alright and let's see we're going to

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:22.780 
alright and let's see we're going to
need<00:06:20.779> to<00:06:20.840> grow<00:06:21.080> a<00:06:21.110> couple<00:06:21.440> of<00:06:21.529> trees

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.790 
need to grow a couple of trees

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.970 
need to grow a couple of trees
perfect<00:06:23.690> look<00:06:23.840> at<00:06:23.930> that<00:06:24.080> made<00:06:24.500> me<00:06:24.650> look<00:06:24.830> good

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
perfect look at that made me look good

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.630 
perfect look at that made me look good
for<00:06:25.220> the<00:06:25.250> video<00:06:25.700> right<00:06:26.570> on<00:06:26.690> the<00:06:26.810> first<00:06:26.990> one

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
for the video right on the first one

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.570 
for the video right on the first one
it's<00:06:28.640> not<00:06:28.850> always<00:06:29.090> like<00:06:29.240> a<00:06:29.420> one<00:06:29.690> hit<00:06:29.920> but<00:06:30.920> you

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
it's not always like a one hit but you

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.690 
it's not always like a one hit but you
know<00:06:31.700> it<00:06:31.990> can<00:06:32.990> be<00:06:33.050> it<00:06:33.980> just<00:06:34.220> depends<00:06:34.520> on<00:06:34.640> the

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
know it can be it just depends on the

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.170 
know it can be it just depends on the
tree<00:06:35.030> and<00:06:35.270> the<00:06:36.140> random<00:06:36.500> generation<00:06:37.000> but<00:06:38.000> there

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
tree and the random generation but there

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.810 
tree and the random generation but there
it<00:06:38.300> is<00:06:38.360> guys<00:06:39.010> see<00:06:40.010> the<00:06:40.130> leaves<00:06:40.310> you<00:06:40.550> can<00:06:40.670> put
