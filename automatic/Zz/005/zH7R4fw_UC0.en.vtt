 Parents of our shareholders but we invest in the schools now

 nevertheless hero 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.710
 back at school 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.170
 Every day the teachers discuss what they are taught 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.160
 high engagement expects the greater their success the higher their salary 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:32.819
 Loading times created wages are set by performance process or 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.659
 mobilize to find out how satisfied parents and students are with authorities 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:37.609
 are the teachers 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.589
 and not in the usual way, the students are determined and partly so 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:44.909

 Frederic Ã¶zdemir is the mentoring teacher television directly once 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.449
 during the week he has a conversation with his students 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:56.719
 with the so-called log book if the learning progress is planned individually 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.559
 Teacher is convinced of this system and believes that the competition between 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:03.849
 municipal and private schools can only have advantages 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.889
 Gauweiler wants the DRK out as if we were standing in constant competition 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.279
 The public schools must work together as well 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:16.180
 they are not threatened there are many good people but they have to be better 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.279
 Because there are more and more private schools the guests went to the students 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.159
 Hopefully that will hopefully lead to better schools for everyone in serious 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:24.620
 wise 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.789
 Herter the public see here it does not matter 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:32.000
 This is all about teaching the more individual the better 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.699
 you 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.669
 actually there is only one downside the students do not know each other so well 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.069
 If you only once a week learns together is the check 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:43.249
 but that takes down ten gardens of Karrer rockets
