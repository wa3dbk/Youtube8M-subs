00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:15.789
 the special counter 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.490
 ma but beware 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.999
 this hp 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.999
 a comic 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.099
 lisse negotiated 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.759
 in the West 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.759
 and let rights watch 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.650
 Like you said a hp project was on the hpx2 corner 14 and that criticism 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.630
 it represents ten stores 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.630
 from the screen 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.630
 and that the screen is namely 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.740
 they can too 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.200
 actually just use the screen to touch and 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.930
 and that the servants and that 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.480
 they can just get you at all 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.830
 buttons we know from and use dordtenaren but also those buttons are also 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.450
 on the ground on the keyboard 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.800
 like me here 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.800
 the last one use the erpse browsing 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.940
 and the home button 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.940
 just comes out taiz 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.620
 but just normal and by turning it off as we are used to 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.320
 of our phones and tablets 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.610
 we can also just use it to go to certain ebs and therefore also present 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.930
 just out of range 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.140
 and then they can also simply start the rotten application 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.719
 and therefore in leaves 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.020
 when we walk back at the club 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.980
 the look of it looks good with the screens to see this is not 29 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.350
 because there is a beautiful one 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.200
 perhaps one 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.220
 a 4 the process in which 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.659
 it is already a clock speed of daerden 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.080
 nick it is not yet the consensus that 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.090
 two children 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.370
 people and then there is a lot of ledger after that military connection 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.190
 their internal memory is the 64 gigabyte after being able to spray you stay 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.009
 micro sd card but of course also has double drive you collide 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:15.029
 so offer the storage medium 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:20.559
 the aguirre should not be short of you and the working memory is zwaby gigabyte 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:22.059
 it too 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:26.489
 the selling price and making of this editor want jesper one 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.470
 utrecht so he is somewhat close from the chrome out 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.910
 the chromebooks that is our d not the same as i have been using for a while 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:43.900
 Well of course it is interesting to know okay and some parents of and 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:47.879
 never came to use the laptop instead of the chrono just do book 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:53.419
 An interesting alternative to the EU's death tops 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:58.679
 certainly in terms of price it can also venture against each other functionality 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.249
 one the ice and becomes top 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:02.419
 can he do it already 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:04.449
 come along 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:09.849
 use the whole story en route and go when you go to college 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:10.790
 the the 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.920
 but use it to make your school assignments to know what's in it and being already 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.739
 hilal also shared the applications and are those that can go with all normal school work 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.860
 also do the band bright but we have all the angles 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.000
 also enough at the locations and that already a player can cook 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.709
 then you can watch the film scenario 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.230
 so it looks pretty nice and 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.200
 dumping device is to assist an attack can accept the liter price 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.390
 the 99 he will soon be in stores 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.870
 an additional cost of normal life 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.640
 enclosed and see if we can also use this in 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.900
 place our chrome in one place monza windows note 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:01.259
 and the studio that psv a little or next week from this app book 14
