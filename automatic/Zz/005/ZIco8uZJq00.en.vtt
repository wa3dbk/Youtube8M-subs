where your water shut off valve is mine
is<00:00:08.940> right<00:00:09.090> there<00:00:09.300> see<00:00:09.570> that<00:00:09.719> yellow<00:00:09.929> lever<00:00:10.230> if

is right there see that yellow lever if
I<00:00:10.920> turn<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.400> 90<00:00:11.969> degrees<00:00:12.000> it'll<00:00:12.540> shut<00:00:12.900> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
and also here is my valve to shut the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.509 
and also here is my valve to shut the
gas<00:00:24.930> off<00:00:25.760> now<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.599> manual<00:00:28.050> says<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.859> you

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
gas off now the manual says that you

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.170 
gas off now the manual says that you
should<00:00:29.849> shut<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> gas<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.500> water<00:00:31.740> off<00:00:32.180> to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
should shut the gas and the water off to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.209 
should shut the gas and the water off to
flush<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.719> that's<00:00:34.140> for<00:00:34.649> more<00:00:34.829> complete

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
flush it and that's for more complete

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.540 
flush it and that's for more complete
flush<00:00:36.050> but<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.260> an<00:00:37.620> older<00:00:37.950> tank<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.370> don't

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
flush but on an older tank I don't

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.970 
flush but on an older tank I don't
really<00:00:38.730> want<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.059> do<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.239> because<00:00:39.750> if<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
really want to do that because if I

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.160 
really want to do that because if I
drain<00:00:41.670> all<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.879> water<00:00:42.030> out<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.870> tank<00:00:43.079> is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
drain all the water out the tank is

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.720 
drain all the water out the tank is
going<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.379> be<00:00:43.469> hot<00:00:43.620> when<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.800> put<00:00:44.040> new<00:00:44.309> water<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
going to be hot when I put new water and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.880 
going to be hot when I put new water and
it's<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.149> really<00:00:45.750> cold<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.289> that

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
it's going to be really cold and that

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.090 
it's going to be really cold and that
temperature<00:00:47.399> change<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:48.090> cause<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.920> metal

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
temperature change can cause the metal

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.189 
temperature change can cause the metal
to<00:00:50.250> contract<00:00:51.170> quickly<00:00:52.170> which<00:00:52.440> could<00:00:54.199> lower

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
to contract quickly which could lower

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.889 
to contract quickly which could lower
the<00:00:55.410> life<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.250> there's<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:57.090> weak<00:00:57.510> metal

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the life of this if there's a weak metal

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.930 
the life of this if there's a weak metal
in<00:00:58.050> there<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.410> could<00:00:58.590> crack<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.460> would

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
in there it could crack it and I would

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.209 
in there it could crack it and I would
have<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> flood<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.690> I'm<00:01:01.530> not<00:01:01.680> going<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> do<00:01:02.039> that

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
have a flood so I'm not going to do that

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.549 
have a flood so I'm not going to do that
with<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.809> you<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:03.960> do<00:01:04.080> whatever<00:01:04.260> you

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
with this one you can do whatever you

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.520 
with this one you can do whatever you
want<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.159> want<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.489> shut<00:01:06.240> your<00:01:06.659> water<00:01:07.350> off

do<00:01:17.040> now<00:01:17.189> before<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.210> start<00:01:18.270> draining<00:01:18.960> you're

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
do now before you start draining you're

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.450 
do now before you start draining you're
going<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.290> need<00:01:19.470> somewhere<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.860> put<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.280> water

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.359 
and put it on pretty tight you should
have<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> rubber<00:01:48.560> o-ring<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.740> there<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.159> little

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
have a rubber o-ring in there a little

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.899 
have a rubber o-ring in there a little
gasket<00:01:52.220> now<00:01:53.220> there<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.680> idea<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:56.040> if<00:01:56.759> it

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
gasket now there is the idea of if it

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.060 
gasket now there is the idea of if it
ain't<00:01:57.060> broke<00:01:57.329> don't<00:01:57.600> fix<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.560> old<00:01:58.770> water

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
ain't broke don't fix it on old water

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.709 
ain't broke don't fix it on old water
heaters<00:01:59.520> it<00:02:00.299> might<00:02:00.509> be<00:02:00.719> worse<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:02.880> mess<00:02:03.509> around

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
heaters it might be worse to mess around

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.089 
heaters it might be worse to mess around
with<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.500> will<00:02:05.009> they<00:02:05.640> could<00:02:06.979> flushing<00:02:07.979> it

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
with it it will they could flushing it

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.430 
with it it will they could flushing it
could<00:02:08.250> cause<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.700> fail<00:02:08.970> earlier<00:02:09.479> but<00:02:10.050> on

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
could cause it to fail earlier but on

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.770 
could cause it to fail earlier but on
the<00:02:11.250> same<00:02:11.459> side<00:02:11.640> if<00:02:11.849> it's<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.209> close<00:02:12.510> to

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
the same side if it's that close to

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.940 
the same side if it's that close to
failing<00:02:13.080> wouldn't<00:02:13.590> you

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
failing wouldn't you

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.369 
failing wouldn't you
on<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.670> fail<00:02:14.910> when<00:02:15.209> it's<00:02:15.390> right<00:02:16.110> there<00:02:16.290> in

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
on it to fail when it's right there in

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.440 
on it to fail when it's right there in
front<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.950> rather<00:02:17.580> than<00:02:17.760> when<00:02:18.209> you're

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
front of you rather than when you're

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.540 
front of you rather than when you're
gone<00:02:19.440> out<00:02:19.709> of<00:02:19.739> your<00:02:19.920> house<00:02:20.099> or<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.370> vacation

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
gone out of your house or on vacation

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.050 
gone out of your house or on vacation
you<00:02:21.000> come<00:02:21.150> back<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.510> there's<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.720> big<00:02:21.870> flood<00:02:22.200> so

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
you come back and there's a big flood so

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.740 
you come back and there's a big flood so
anyway<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.599> decide<00:02:25.200> what<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.590> want<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.860> do

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
anyway you decide what you want to do

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.210 
anyway you decide what you want to do
okay<00:02:27.750> on<00:02:27.900> your<00:02:27.930> spigot<00:02:28.560> you're<00:02:28.860> going<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.099> have

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
okay on your spigot you're going to have

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.070 
okay on your spigot you're going to have
a<00:02:29.250> little<00:02:29.489> slot<00:02:29.819> most<00:02:30.180> likely<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:30.930> can

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
a little slot most likely and you can

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.930 
a little slot most likely and you can
use<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.290> flathead<00:02:31.620> screwdriver<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:32.430> open<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:32.849> up

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
use a flathead screwdriver to open it up

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.740 
use a flathead screwdriver to open it up
it's<00:02:33.150> just<00:02:33.209> like<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.540> garden<00:02:34.730> faucet<00:02:35.750> they'll

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
it's just like a garden faucet they'll

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.830 
it's just like a garden faucet they'll
turn<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.349> counterclockwise<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:39.810> a

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
turn it counterclockwise and I have a

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.990 
turn it counterclockwise and I have a
gallon<00:02:40.650> jug<00:02:40.950> here<00:02:41.220> I'm<00:02:41.340> going<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.580> fill<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.910> up

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
gallon jug here I'm going to fill it up

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.509 
gallon jug here I'm going to fill it up
so<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.209> can<00:02:42.330> see<00:02:42.540> what<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.680> looks<00:02:43.950> like<00:02:44.069> the

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
so you can see what it looks like the

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.690 
so you can see what it looks like the
water<00:02:44.730> coming<00:02:45.150> out<00:02:48.799> now<00:02:49.799> if<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.370> lot

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
water coming out now if you have a lot

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:00.229 
water coming out now if you have a lot
of<00:02:50.730> sediment<00:02:51.090> buildup<00:02:58.579> you<00:02:59.579> know<00:02:59.700> turn<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.090> off

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
of sediment buildup you know turn it off

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.330 
of sediment buildup you know turn it off
again<00:03:00.630> if<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.590> have<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.739> lot<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.010> sediment

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
again if you have a lot of sediment

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.390 
again if you have a lot of sediment
buildup<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.780> need<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.650> run<00:03:04.829> this<00:03:04.980> for<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.220> long

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
buildup you need to run this for a long

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.069 
buildup you need to run this for a long
time<00:03:05.670> now<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:06.900> looks<00:03:07.459> pretty<00:03:08.459> clean<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.360> think

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
time now this looks pretty clean I think

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.250 
time now this looks pretty clean I think
I<00:03:10.380> flushed<00:03:10.620> this<00:03:10.829> tank<00:03:11.099> once<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:12.840> you're

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
I flushed this tank once so you're

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.440 
I flushed this tank once so you're
supposed<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.560> do<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.769> maybe<00:03:13.950> once<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.310> year<00:03:14.450> look

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
supposed to do it maybe once a year look

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.360 
supposed to do it maybe once a year look
how<00:03:15.569> clean<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.260> let's<00:03:16.470> keep<00:03:16.650> going<00:03:17.160> let's

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
how clean that is let's keep going let's

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.509 
how clean that is let's keep going let's
see<00:03:17.519> what<00:03:17.670> we<00:03:17.819> can<00:03:17.970> get<00:03:18.090> out<00:03:18.150> of<00:03:18.299> here<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:20.370> know

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
see what we can get out of here you know

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.190 
see what we can get out of here you know
some<00:03:21.060> people<00:03:21.329> don't<00:03:21.510> have<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.690> drain<00:03:22.019> on<00:03:22.049> the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
some people don't have a drain on the

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.629 
some people don't have a drain on the
floor<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.709> might<00:03:22.889> want<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.190> put<00:03:23.400> your

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
floor and you might want to put your

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.270 
floor and you might want to put your
water<00:03:23.910> going<00:03:24.440> outside<00:03:25.440> don't<00:03:25.799> put<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.010> on<00:03:26.069> your

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
water going outside don't put it on your

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:38.350 
water going outside don't put it on your
plants<00:03:26.549> hot<00:03:27.239> water<00:03:27.569> is<00:03:27.840> bad<00:03:28.109> for<00:03:28.709> plants

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.810 

another<00:03:39.360> tip<00:03:40.010> because<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.160> water<00:03:41.460> is<00:03:41.670> going

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
another tip because this water is going

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.710 
another tip because this water is going
to<00:03:41.880> be<00:03:42.060> scalding<00:03:42.840> hot<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:44.000> if<00:03:45.000> you're<00:03:45.270> making<00:03:45.480> a

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
to be scalding hot so if you're making a

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.660 
to be scalding hot so if you're making a
mistake<00:03:45.860> you<00:03:46.860> don't<00:03:46.890> want<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.280> get<00:03:47.370> burned<00:03:47.550> now

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
mistake you don't want to get burned now

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.490 
mistake you don't want to get burned now
this<00:03:47.880> is<00:03:48.060> perfectly<00:03:48.600> clear<00:03:48.960> looking<00:03:49.200> water<00:03:49.350> I

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
this is perfectly clear looking water I

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.250 
this is perfectly clear looking water I
see<00:03:49.680> just<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.950> Connie<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.490> few<00:03:51.390> tiny<00:03:51.630> flecks<00:03:52.020> of

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
see just a Connie a few tiny flecks of

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.440 
see just a Connie a few tiny flecks of
stuff<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:52.860> I'm<00:03:53.370> not<00:03:53.550> getting<00:03:53.910> much<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.330> I'm

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
stuff so I'm not getting much so I'm

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.670 
stuff so I'm not getting much so I'm
just<00:03:54.630> going<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.840> dump<00:03:55.110> this<00:03:55.230> straight<00:03:55.500> down

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
just going to dump this straight down

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:42.740 
just going to dump this straight down
the<00:03:55.860> drain<00:03:55.890> let's<00:03:56.250> see<00:03:56.370> what<00:03:56.520> we<00:03:56.640> get

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.060 

all<00:04:43.750> right<00:04:43.870> well<00:04:43.960> I'm<00:04:44.080> getting<00:04:44.440> nothing<00:04:44.740> out

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
all right well I'm getting nothing out

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.120 
all right well I'm getting nothing out
of<00:04:45.130> this<00:04:45.430> so<00:04:45.850> I'm<00:04:46.180> thinking<00:04:46.780> this<00:04:46.930> is<00:04:47.200> good<00:04:47.830> and

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
of this so I'm thinking this is good and

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.700 
of this so I'm thinking this is good and
I'm<00:04:49.000> surprised<00:04:49.600> I<00:04:49.930> thought<00:04:50.110> I'd<00:04:50.260> get<00:04:50.440> a<00:04:50.500> lot

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
I'm surprised I thought I'd get a lot

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.290 
I'm surprised I thought I'd get a lot
more<00:04:50.740> sediment<00:04:51.340> so<00:04:51.640> this<00:04:51.820> must<00:04:52.000> be<00:04:52.120> a<00:04:52.150> pretty

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
more sediment so this must be a pretty

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.840 
more sediment so this must be a pretty
good<00:04:52.480> water<00:04:52.720> heater<00:04:54.330> one<00:04:55.330> and<00:04:56.850> something's

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
good water heater one and something's

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.790 
good water heater one and something's
something's<00:04:58.450> going<00:04:58.900> well<00:04:59.140> in<00:04:59.410> this<00:04:59.560> thing

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
something's going well in this thing

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.400 
something's going well in this thing
usually<00:05:00.250> I<00:05:00.400> mean<00:05:00.670> it's<00:05:01.330> been<00:05:01.570> probably<00:05:02.050> seven

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
usually I mean it's been probably seven

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.970 
usually I mean it's been probably seven
years<00:05:03.780> since<00:05:04.780> this<00:05:04.960> thing<00:05:05.200> is<00:05:05.260> flushed<00:05:05.710> and

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
years since this thing is flushed and

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.100 
years since this thing is flushed and
there<00:05:06.430> is<00:05:06.550> no<00:05:06.760> rust<00:05:07.030> anything<00:05:07.570> coming<00:05:07.780> out<00:05:07.960> of

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
there is no rust anything coming out of

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.400 
there is no rust anything coming out of
here

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
here

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.630 
here
that's<00:05:09.340> a<00:05:09.460> very<00:05:09.700> good<00:05:09.820> sign<00:05:11.490> normally<00:05:12.490> when

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
that's a very good sign normally when

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.490 
that's a very good sign normally when
the<00:05:12.730> water<00:05:12.880> comes<00:05:13.090> out<00:05:13.180> it's<00:05:13.390> all<00:05:13.540> you<00:05:14.380> know

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
the water comes out it's all you know

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.890 
the water comes out it's all you know
rusty<00:05:14.800> colored<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:15.550> you<00:05:15.760> know<00:05:16.330> Michael<00:05:16.540> clear

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
rusty colored and you know Michael clear

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.060 
rusty colored and you know Michael clear
for<00:05:17.110> a<00:05:17.170> little<00:05:17.350> bit<00:05:17.530> and<00:05:17.740> I'm<00:05:17.800> just<00:05:17.830> going<00:05:18.040> to

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
for a little bit and I'm just going to

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.760 
for a little bit and I'm just going to
go<00:05:18.220> rusty<00:05:18.460> looking<00:05:18.910> again<00:05:19.180> so<00:05:20.020> oh<00:05:20.380> by<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:20.620> way

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
go rusty looking again so oh by the way

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.540 
go rusty looking again so oh by the way
if<00:05:20.980> this<00:05:21.100> thing<00:05:21.370> drips<00:05:21.870> just<00:05:22.870> put<00:05:23.080> a<00:05:23.550> rather

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
if this thing drips just put a rather

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.570 
if this thing drips just put a rather
than<00:05:24.880> worry<00:05:25.150> about<00:05:25.270> it<00:05:25.690> I<00:05:25.870> just<00:05:26.200> put<00:05:26.410> a<00:05:26.470> cup<00:05:26.800> or

than worry about it I just put a cup or
something<00:05:27.760> down<00:05:28.090> below<00:05:28.390> to<00:05:28.450> catch<00:05:28.720> it<00:05:28.930> usually

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
something down below to catch it usually

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.560 
something down below to catch it usually
in<00:05:29.860> a<00:05:29.890> day<00:05:30.160> it'll<00:05:30.460> stop<00:05:30.730> dripping<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.270> day<00:05:31.420> or

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
in a day it'll stop dripping a day or

in a day it'll stop dripping a day or
two<00:05:31.750> maybe<00:05:31.990> a<00:05:32.110> week<00:05:33.000> so<00:05:34.050> rather<00:05:35.050> than<00:05:35.320> try<00:05:35.830> to

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
two maybe a week so rather than try to

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.250 
two maybe a week so rather than try to
worry<00:05:36.100> about<00:05:36.160> fixing<00:05:36.610> it<00:05:36.910> and<00:05:37.090> if<00:05:37.870> this<00:05:38.050> is

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
worry about fixing it and if this is

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.780 
worry about fixing it and if this is
leaking<00:05:38.740> a<00:05:38.800> lot<00:05:39.010> you<00:05:39.370> know<00:05:39.400> when<00:05:39.640> you're

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
leaking a lot you know when you're

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.550 
leaking a lot you know when you're
unscrewing<00:05:40.360> it<00:05:40.570> you<00:05:40.690> got<00:05:40.840> water<00:05:41.080> coming<00:05:41.470> out

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
unscrewing it you got water coming out

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.090 
unscrewing it you got water coming out
of<00:05:41.620> here

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
of here

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.810 
of here
just<00:05:42.520> tighten<00:05:42.820> this<00:05:43.120> on<00:05:43.360> top<00:05:43.930> and<00:05:44.290> that<00:05:44.320> should

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
just tighten this on top and that should

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.300 
just tighten this on top and that should
stop<00:05:45.820> it<00:05:45.970> from<00:05:46.120> leaking<00:05:46.300> out<00:05:46.570> but<00:05:47.020> a<00:05:47.410> few<00:05:48.100> drips

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
stop it from leaking out but a few drips

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.700 
stop it from leaking out but a few drips
down<00:05:48.580> here<00:05:48.820> is<00:05:48.910> normal<00:05:49.330> and<00:05:49.570> then<00:05:49.720> it'll<00:05:49.960> stop

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
down here is normal and then it'll stop

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.680 
down here is normal and then it'll stop
leaking<00:05:51.160> after<00:05:51.310> a<00:05:51.460> little<00:05:51.670> bit<00:05:51.850> so<00:05:52.210> I<00:05:52.240> wouldn't

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
leaking after a little bit so I wouldn't

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.210 
leaking after a little bit so I wouldn't
worry<00:05:52.870> about<00:05:52.930> it<00:05:53.670> um<00:05:55.260> anyway<00:05:56.260> yeah<00:05:56.680> again<00:05:57.040> I'm

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
worry about it um anyway yeah again I'm

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.100 
worry about it um anyway yeah again I'm
surprised<00:05:57.640> this<00:05:58.360> didn't<00:05:58.690> have<00:05:58.840> a<00:05:58.870> lot<00:05:59.080> more

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
surprised this didn't have a lot more

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.380 
surprised this didn't have a lot more
garbage<00:05:59.560> floating<00:06:00.010> around<00:06:00.250> rust<00:06:01.120> and

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
garbage floating around rust and

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.430 
garbage floating around rust and
deposits<00:06:02.290> so<00:06:02.440> it's<00:06:02.950> a<00:06:03.130> Rheem<00:06:03.430> brand<00:06:04.240> so<00:06:05.140> maybe

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
deposits so it's a Rheem brand so maybe

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.230 
deposits so it's a Rheem brand so maybe
they<00:06:05.590> make<00:06:05.710> a<00:06:05.740> great<00:06:06.040> water<00:06:06.370> heater<00:06:06.640> anyway<00:06:07.210> I

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
they make a great water heater anyway I

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.900 
they make a great water heater anyway I
