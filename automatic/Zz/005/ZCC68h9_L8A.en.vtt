00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:07.580
 Boo 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.580
 2 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.750
 Apply 1 solution of Extenso 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:28.530
 From the root 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:33.150
 There is also a natural volume is 5 centimeters this time 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:35.150
 We will make open a little root in to say and make the tile 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.940
 As a point of this time 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:44.699
 Pretty peter 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.300
 For example, if you paint in this way to paint a color, the boundary line between this part and this part 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.430
 Because it becomes easy to be able to say 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.220
 a little 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:56.770
 Is not clean out clearly line in anticipation or in whether dykes, such as blur in a zigzag 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.090
 It is better if you do 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.200
 You can make a straight nature while the volume comes out Of course the sound from the head volume 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.700
 When I want to drop it 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.710
 I think that it is good to go in the form of opening 1 cm 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.040
 And 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:16.530
 It is on duty as a point of this time 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:23.880
 2 cm from the dividing line to bake the surface part of this part 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:27.730
 Even though part of Masuko Yes take in the horseshoe I know God to come overlying the most surface 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:34.000
 I do not dare straight on this part 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:40.380
 In order to set the top not to be overwhelmed by leaving your own natural song 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.010
 Dare to leave the surface hair straight without leaving 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:51.210
 Curling of the hair by doing so 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:56.010
 Because the border line with the curl attached to the inner wrap of the hair is also slightly blurred with the paper coming over 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.610
 When such a straight is such a way when you make a natural straight 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.610
 I think it's good 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:10.060
 It is in the state where 1 liquid of EX War has been applied 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:15.760
 It's from here, but if it's a normal straight condition, I'll leave it this time, but this time it's a hair tip 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:18.830
 To get even softer 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.720
 Like this, with 12 rods 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.370
 In this state 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.819
 I will roll 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.749
 When finely wound 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.810
 Because it takes time to make a difference 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:36.710
 With a 12 mm rod 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:39.310
 In this way, the whole number of all six is â€‹â€‹also about six 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.310
 Sakutto 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:49.400
 One strand from the perspective of the panel 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:52.030
 In Japan, Mac was about the side in the image of about Mac in one 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.030
 is enough 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:03.340
 Make a straight state by straight something 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:07.349
 By softening the tip while curling the tip like this , 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.349
 Ekusutenso can make 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:20.459
 I did an intermediate flush with my finished hair 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.960
 And then blow dry and put on a straight iron . 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.450
 Want part 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:30.290
 in this way 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:34.610
 The hair tip is wound like drawing an are while putting it so as to slide 3 times 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:41.560
 The temperature is about 180 degrees 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.560
 You can leave the curl of the hair while you to Kotonipe straight to do so 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:49.240
 The middle from the base with the taken iron 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.240
 Hair tip while sliding 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.160
 Volume 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:58.210
 When we want to leave 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:02.110
 It is not going to put the One balanced objection to the place of 2 cm 3 cm 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:05.830
 When you want to close the volume of the root from the root 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:12.100
 I think it would be nice to go through the strand with a secure stem 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:14.319
 Since I do not want to drop the volume of the root so much this time, I opened about 4 cm at the root 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.790
 I will go straight from 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.790
 And I will wrap my hair 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.600
 Yes er once what was softened 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.070
 Intermediate flush 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:38.980
 After that is a state that has finished with a liquid and finished the ironing 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:40.930
 From little root than at the case of overall benefit two liquids are noticed slightly # 1 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.710
 In the form of overlapping 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.120
 If you turn on at the station please 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.570
 I will tighten the winding 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.570
 one time 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:05:01.950
 Wrapped in one panel from the state with a liquid to be ironed to another real hair destination one rotation and a half 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:07.230
 To go 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:10.750
 This large Yu' curled fixing of the was in a state in which with a liquid in by to do so 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.020
 Because it is possible to 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.050
 I will 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:18.340
 Not straight 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:23.879
 Will be rolled up after the solution is finished 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.879
 The whole is only four bags only 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:32.710
 Ekusutenso make a soft straight leisurely friendly straight even as it is 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:39.820
 I can do it 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:44.160
 In this way out catch-up tightening more of the hair curl by the use of these two technologies 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:49.449
 While it is straight to the middle of the root 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.790
 It will be possible to give a glossy texture 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:54.190
 like this 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:06:00.900
 Just one plus one 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:00.900
 I think that the usage of the extension is expanding one more 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:16.810
 It will be finished if you leave this as it is and let it go 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:19.950
 Yes it is the point of styling Ex 2 single phase care push 2 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.950
 Take in the palm 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.830
 And 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:33.100
 From the back of the hair 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:38.480
 Of course it's good to put it dry, but it's wet 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:42.580
 I think that it is good to finish also moist because you bath then put 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:46.270
 And to the hair that was able to blow dry inside 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:49.960
 I will be familiar with the whole wheel 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:53.729
 We will continue to adapt as to Komu massage 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.720
 The last remaining oil on the surface 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:07:02.920
 I will put on sour 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:05.260
 By doing so, the surface is fluffy and the hairy tip is moist and shiny and curls all day 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:08.070
 Can keep 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.070
 I feel like this 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.770
 Had 

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:30.190
 of 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.550
 Hm 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.819
 of 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.210
 Hmm 

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:40.860
 car 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.860
 Nn 

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:52.699
 Number 2
