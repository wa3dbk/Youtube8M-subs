00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.790
 It is not for the creation of the tiranosaurus rex I will start to create it and as you let me 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.400
 so that they fight if the other does not have a titan, then let's see right now 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.050

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.980

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.760

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.940
 round one 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.940
 I'm not seeing it, we're also requesting 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.020
 I will leave a 30 euros to turn it into titan 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.020
 but he is going to kill others to ha ha ha 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.910

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.789
 looking for 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.199
 searching 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:14.589
 There he is and he seems to want to attack attacks 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:18.079
 I hope tiranosaurus has already been created 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.879
 it's time to return to the national level 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.959

 Well, keep your eyes 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:33.839
 there says the spark plug comes but that generates equal 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:34.980
 good let's see 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.289
 fucking damn boat until they splash 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:40.539
 the battle they are rendering accounts 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.539

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:46.169
 fuck where are you going from the giants 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.389
 three fucking heads I think the south stayed on that occasionally 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:52.309
 after the low 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:55.629
 at the end of the fight fight fight fight fight fight fight fight fight previous 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:03:00.469
 borja hahaha how funny I am good this will last a lot but in the end they will be 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.459
 who the winner and the loser 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.139
 I already put the traumatic penalty and let's be this fight fight fight fight 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.629
 fight generalized fight fight fight fight hahahaha 3 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.379
 this fight fighters fight before I want to clarify something very important the titan 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.149
 has seven thousand of blood forgets how they want to say and the tiranosaurus just 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:20.339
 has five 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:23.339
 so the titan has more life than the hawks want 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:27.479
 only two thousand more hehe but still sees no one wins the fight 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:33.629
 for another intangible thing of attack 70 and the tiranosaurus only has 45 that is to say that 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.979
 the captain continues to win in life and strength 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:40.989
 well this is my civilization gathered first resources that walked 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.929
 Fucked the reds had it not been for this video hehe but I will not lie 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:48.249
 this scenario was mainly for that 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:52.799
 fuck I had forgotten to create other tiranosaurus so is another tyrant saurus 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.089
 but with a different model let's see how this continues 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.629
 until now the tiranosaurus is winning 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.519
 castro

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.800
 télam 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.529
 also has 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:07.259
 Colombia has 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:10.270
 1-2 min 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.580
 I wanted to say 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.580
 but that is not all true the extreme need 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.850
 you're almost dead one and I'll tell you which one while I think you can see outside 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.290
 worthy then well I will not tell you who wins 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.319
 they already saw it, well, it is a jury, all Jorge was kidnapped by 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.939
 indigenous and avenues 

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:41.599
 well, the tiranosaurus won the British believe what the Treasury 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:46.560
 George the Titan has seven thousand lives and the tiranosaurus only 5000 and he won 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.659
 of the tyrannosaur stayed with ten 

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:54.330
 1750 of life was shortly to die on Thursday 5 however it is rare 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.349
 since if the titan has more life I attacked that the tiranosaurus is weird that 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:01.439
 he has won this is the other tyrannosaur 

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:05.189
 the answer is that Tyrannosaurus have more resistance to shock 

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:08.000
 espadazos flecha its accurate 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.750
 miranda in the hand of a big dinosaur in the jurassic park movie is the 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.520
 same size that opens in the USA 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.069
