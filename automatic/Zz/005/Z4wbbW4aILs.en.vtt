00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.680
 to feel better both inside 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:08.230
 like outside in this section os 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.300
 we teach some good tricks to take care of 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.700
 your image but today we teach you 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.700
 some makeup beauty tricks 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.070
 We are already here in our section 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.020
 beauty I am vision to pedrosa and today os 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.300
 I will teach how to apply a base of 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.360
 makeup is very important that we know 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.770
 use every product that we have 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.410
 we always start the makeup with 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.570
 a good moisturizing base suitable for 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.850
 every skin type me in this case 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.370
 I use a foundation for 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.090
 Normal skins because she is a very girl 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.330
 young and we need a lot of hydration 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.390
 we always try to apply the cream 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:54.350
 up never down because already 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.300
 you know then the wrinkles come out 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.460
 once we have applied we have 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.350
 putting the moisturizer that is very 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.390
 important remember we go with the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.729
 corrector for example I have this 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.620
 pallet at home that you wonder why 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.960
 so many colors because each one has a 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.630
 meaning for example the green always 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.330
 will be to cover the granites and all the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.640
 redness that we have in the face the fair 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.350
 the white will be the illuminator then 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.409
 you have different correctors in 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.360
 tonalities depending on the good face 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.710
 of the face not of the skin of the person 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.980
 for example I am more dark than this 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.230
 girl 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.020
 the girl uses a lighter shade than the 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.970
 mine and then we have this rojito that the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.030
 red and I use it mostly for 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.060
 all the base of the eyecup that normally 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.310
 throw blacks or not because this we have to 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.980
 use once we have the proofreaders 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.030
 posts we would go to the illuminator always 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.010
 you have seen some magazines that 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.440
 girls take for example the eyelids 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.870
 more raised as they do is putting 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.570
 the clearest color we have in 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.030
 our palette of correctors right here 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.220
 over now we would have to put the base 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.680
 of makeup that you can apply 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.840
 I'm good at the supermarket you have the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.550
 typical sponges I'm not to put 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.530
 I do not know how to put a sponge 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.270
 the hands remember that they oppose with 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.670
 the hands you stay with the whole 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.800
 product in it and spend is double if 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.080
 you put it on the sponges that make the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.720
 chufa nuns is normal also spends 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.840
 it's more the brush will always leave all the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.630
 product you put little and always extend 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.430
 it will be better once we have finished the base 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.770
 of makeup we will have to put a 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.230
 dust base we have many dust 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.940
 ways we have bright powder by 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.420
 example or we have 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.150
 or in little balls and then there are people who 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.770
 uses translucent powder I'm going to 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.660
 put this first and then I'll 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.570
 put one of color and now let's go 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.570
 with the color powder is important not 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.460
 change color that if you do not notice 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.320
 much the difference and always make up 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.660
 by the neck also so that it does not look 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.820
 a cut and now to finish our base 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.350
 we will only need a good blusher part 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.020
 We are always going to look for something more 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.520
 pink or more orange in the case of 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.620
 she is going to put something more pink 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.850
 because you will see more little girl face and 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.650
 now that we have finished putting the 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.110
 blusher we already have our base 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.670
 finished with this you can go doing 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.380
 variations depending on whether it's from 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.640
 night or it is day but this we have it 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.440
 to see at another time because that we 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.390
 just time thank you very much I hope 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.140
 that you have learned something with me 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.140
 Thank you
