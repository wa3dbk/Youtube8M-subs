now<00:00:33.180> Samoa<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.410> just<00:00:34.710> never<00:00:34.890> know<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.610> know

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
now Samoa you just never know you know

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.040 
now Samoa you just never know you know
somehow<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.260> great<00:00:37.800> array<00:00:38.250> of

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
somehow I have this great array of

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.850 
somehow I have this great array of
potentiality<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.290> it's<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.559> matter<00:00:40.739> of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
potentiality but it's a matter of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.380 
potentiality but it's a matter of
whether<00:00:41.040> they<00:00:41.250> come<00:00:41.520> together<00:00:41.700> before<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
whether they come together before the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.600 
whether they come together before the
World<00:00:42.600> Cup<00:00:42.719> unite<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.920> if<00:00:44.010> they<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.250> they're

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
World Cup unite and if they do they're

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.299 
World Cup unite and if they do they're
very<00:00:44.910> powerful<00:00:45.180> team<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.930> USA<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.980> probably

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
very powerful team and USA is probably

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.400 
very powerful team and USA is probably
the<00:00:47.460> exact<00:00:47.789> opposite<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.360> Japan<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.350> know

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the exact opposite of Japan you know

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.860 
the exact opposite of Japan you know
they're<00:00:49.620> very<00:00:49.649> big<00:00:50.340> athletic<00:00:50.879> team<00:00:51.180> probably

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
they're very big athletic team probably

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.470 
they're very big athletic team probably
not<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> great<00:00:52.379> skillful<00:00:53.129> team<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.940> again<00:00:54.239> with

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
not a great skillful team but again with

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.029 
not a great skillful team but again with
the<00:00:54.510> three<00:00:54.780> months<00:00:55.140> preparation<00:00:55.710> before<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
the three months preparation before the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.860 
the three months preparation before the
World<00:00:56.309> Cup<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:57.120> imagine<00:00:57.510> they're<00:00:57.660> going<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
World Cup we imagine they're going to
improve<00:00:58.079> greatly<00:01:02.210> what's<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.680> fantastic<00:01:04.680> pool

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
improve greatly what's a fantastic pool

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.039 
improve greatly what's a fantastic pool
isn't<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.400> yeah<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.210> England<00:01:06.510> England<00:01:06.930> at

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
isn't it yeah the England England at

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.289 
isn't it yeah the England England at
home<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.770> go<00:01:07.920> through<00:01:08.250> yeah<00:01:09.000> they've<00:01:09.210> got

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
home have to go through yeah they've got

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.090 
home have to go through yeah they've got
a<00:01:09.360> good<00:01:09.630> strong<00:01:09.960> team<00:01:10.320> if<00:01:10.530> they<00:01:10.710> get<00:01:10.920> their

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
a good strong team if they get their

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.710 
a good strong team if they get their
selection<00:01:11.700> right<00:01:11.850> which<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.210> don't<00:01:12.450> think<00:01:12.630> they

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
selection right which I don't think they

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.780 
selection right which I don't think they
have<00:01:12.930> got<00:01:13.140> right<00:01:13.350> previously<00:01:14.070> they're<00:01:14.610> going

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
have got right previously they're going

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.550 
have got right previously they're going
to<00:01:14.850> be<00:01:14.909> very<00:01:15.060> hard<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.540> beat<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.110> then<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.290> think

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
to be very hard to beat and then I think

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.399 
to be very hard to beat and then I think
Australia<00:01:16.890> with<00:01:17.820> Michael<00:01:18.270> checkered<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.810> an

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
Australia with Michael checkered and an

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.030 
Australia with Michael checkered and an
array<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.070> talent<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> moment<00:01:22.040> should

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
array of talent at the moment should

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.520 
array of talent at the moment should
just<00:01:23.610> pit<00:01:23.970> Wales<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.810> Wales<00:01:25.049> were<00:01:25.259> pretty

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
just pit Wales the Wales were pretty

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.050 
just pit Wales the Wales were pretty
impressive<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> Six<00:01:26.430> Nations<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
impressive in the Six Nations and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.300 
impressive in the Six Nations and
probably<00:01:27.450> finished<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> Six<00:01:28.590> Nations<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
probably finished the Six Nations is the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.580 
probably finished the Six Nations is the
most<00:01:29.549> impressive<00:01:29.880> team<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.290> imagine

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
most impressive team but I imagine

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.580 
most impressive team but I imagine
Australia<00:01:32.250> England<00:01:32.400> will<00:01:32.670> go<00:01:32.790> through

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.440 

New<00:01:37.040> Zealand<00:01:37.400> will<00:01:37.520> definitely<00:01:37.940> go<00:01:38.090> through

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
New Zealand will definitely go through

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.250 
New Zealand will definitely go through
and<00:01:38.720> then<00:01:38.960> it'll<00:01:39.140> be<00:01:39.200> a<00:01:39.290> good<00:01:39.530> contest<00:01:40.070> between

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
and then it'll be a good contest between

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.930 
and then it'll be a good contest between
Argentina<00:01:42.260> Tonga<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:42.830> Georgia<00:01:43.310> now

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
Argentina Tonga and Georgia now

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.150 
Argentina Tonga and Georgia now
Georgia's<00:01:44.540> got<00:01:44.720> a<00:01:44.780> very<00:01:45.229> good<00:01:45.470> Ford<00:01:45.800> pact

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
Georgia's got a very good Ford pact

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.800 
Georgia's got a very good Ford pact
probably<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.610> best<00:01:46.820> scrum<00:01:47.090> in<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.330> world<00:01:47.570> and

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
probably the best scrum in the world and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.690 
probably the best scrum in the world and
again<00:01:48.620> they're<00:01:48.830> going<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.010> have<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:49.280> benefit

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
again they're going to have the benefit

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.190 
again they're going to have the benefit
of<00:01:49.790> having<00:01:49.940> those<00:01:50.210> players<00:01:50.570> together<00:01:50.810> for

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
of having those players together for

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.750 
of having those players together for
three<00:01:51.440> months<00:01:51.470> before<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.160> World<00:01:52.340> Cup<00:01:52.460> will

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
three months before the World Cup will

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.650 
three months before the World Cup will
be<00:01:52.790> very<00:01:53.119> fit

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
be very fit

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.200 
be very fit
yeah<00:01:54.110> Tonga<00:01:54.619> agains<00:01:54.950> a<00:01:55.100> bit<00:01:55.280> like<00:01:55.460> Samoa<00:01:55.910> if

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
yeah Tonga agains a bit like Samoa if
