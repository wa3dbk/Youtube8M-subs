00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
we have a face which inside the guitar

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.539 
we have a face which inside the guitar
which<00:01:04.170> again<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.739> reached<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.309> and

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
which again can be reached in and

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.450 
which again can be reached in and
switched<00:01:05.850> up<00:01:06.119> or<00:01:06.390> down<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:07.530> control<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.159> phase

of<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> guitar<00:01:09.570> now<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.780> sounds<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> little

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
of the guitar now it sounds a little

of the guitar now it sounds a little
complicated<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.070> not<00:01:11.340> what<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.270> means

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
complicated but it's not what that means

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.050 
complicated but it's not what that means
is<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:13.140> your<00:01:13.380> guitar<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.830> feeding<00:01:14.280> back<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.790> lot

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
is if your guitar is feeding back a lot

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.359 
is if your guitar is feeding back a lot
you<00:01:15.509> simply<00:01:15.900> reach<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.290> flick<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.979> switch<00:01:17.189> in
