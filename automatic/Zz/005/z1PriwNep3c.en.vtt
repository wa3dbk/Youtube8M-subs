00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Oh, what do youtubers wave this time? 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.020
 I bring a new video game so that 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.990
 Kill several hours of boredom with 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.690
 this weird and likeable game yes like 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.960
 they read in the title is the act that the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.790
 daily star full and in Spanish we do not lose 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.930
 time and let's start 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.930
 [Music] 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.289
 The first thing we have to do is go to 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.630
 my website that will be in the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.580
 description of the video once in my 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.879
 page we go to the section of 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.890
 games and here we will look for the octagonal 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.989
 to download it we will only click on 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.210
 the image that is on the server 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.460
 mega but I'll also leave a link 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.220
 alternative to download it from 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.800
 mediafire this des choose which they want 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.750
 once they download the file that 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.550
 by the way it's a torrent we'll open it 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.350
 with the torrent or bittorrent for 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.530
 start the download weigh 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.470
 approximately 700 or 800 megabytes 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.310
 well when the download ends 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.050
 leave a folder like this we open it 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.090
 inside the folder will come only these 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.340
 files what we should do is 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.580
 select only the rar files and 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.470
 then right click and extract here 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.310
 when they are removed, this one will leave us 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.770
 binder 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.320
 inside that folder will come all the 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.479
 files that make up the game should not 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.430
 delete anything for the game to work 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.310
 besides this game does not need 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.650
 installation that's the good thing well for 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.110
 to be able to play we must execute giving double 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.200
 click on the application called awning the 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.360
 issste cut exe and so will begin the 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.250
 game I should also clarify that if we 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.590
 we go to the magazine folder 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.900
 we will find two ex is one is the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.119
 direct 9 and the other is the create dist 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.070
 these serve to make it go a little better 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.740
 the game although sometimes they are not 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.400
 necessary but good not to install 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.380
