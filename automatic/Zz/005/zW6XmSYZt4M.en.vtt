 good and today we have met at the table 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.210
 to discuss one of the questions that the 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.130
 people do more to the developers 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.750
 of minecraft and I do not understand it because 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.720
 they ask us who are the 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.120
 that we know what is what things will bring 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.920
 minecraft in future updates is 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.420
 a very broad question that surely 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.630
 someone at the table wants to start 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.910
 answer I could rubén vos tenés 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.910
 eager to answer the question we 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.270
 like to answer the first answer 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:10.600
 I do not feel like answering that question 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.370
 good if you want to answer I want 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.159
 reply 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.440
 good quiet we are at a table to 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:21.280
 debate not to fight answer the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.709
 Good question me and my study 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.440
 electrical over electricity this 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.720
 I was thinking and I would like them to add 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.150
 some way to generate energy and 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.650
 transport transport it to well 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.500
 automate processes in the main craft 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.390
 good but one we would like a 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.020
 definition a little wider or to 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:48.840
 through that would distribute the energy 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:51.360
 what color cables would be red by 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.970
 course how my shirt would be great ah 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.630
 well never check yourself in the inventory 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.630
 of the red stone 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.790
 although this is good what happens 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.680
 enslave people and good someone 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.060
 more I want to contribute something 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.870
 from my point of view there would be no 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.599
 add objects but as subtle something 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.640
 scary black with violet eyes high 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.099
 skinny that you 're transported and with 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.799
 long arms or maybe something that explodes 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.440
 green and you will be surprised by the 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.150
 true that we could see pigs and cows 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.970
 because it's nothing exciting that 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.340
 let's say clearly what you mention is 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.340
 call sick and kripper and listen to me 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.690
 makes squeeze that escape go options and 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.030
 change the level because you have it in 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.730
 pickford ruben i would like to hear your 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.769
 answer to me I would like you to add 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.959
 new minerals new blocks that do not 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.849
 they can undermine that they have also 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.519
 integrated that can also be 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.980
 interact with the npc as for example 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:00.200
 some material of a precious stone 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:03.950
 that they would like to exchange for something 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.420
 well that's because the chains of the 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.090
 production should be tightening the 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.129
 blood that does not raise your brain because 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.140
 is commercial with npc a long time ago 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.790
 you can even though they are scammers even 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.310
 in a program let's talk without craft and 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.010
 rubén debated rubén I do not know if you 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.780
 you agree that we discuss this but 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.380
 good good, calm down, mind is 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.540
 also of illusion to you that you 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.130
 I wish I had minecraft 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.220
 we treat everyone at this table and we are 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.410
 everyone watching the impeccable graphics that 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.810
 has the minecraft the anatomy of 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.600
 our own bodies in minecraft is 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.760
 really impressive even if one 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.190
 pay attention to looks up 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.160
 when one inspires and expires as the 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.190
 chest according to bear is inflated when one 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.290
 breathes hair movement while running 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.570
 the blood when one is hurt with 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.520
 a sword the physics that have the 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.139
 arrows and the blocks that never 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.860
 remain in the air always falls the 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.530
 gravity 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.450
 everything is impeccable I would like it to 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.310
 the most humble people who do not have so 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.620
 good computers lowered him a little 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.470
 the graphics and be minecraft 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.720
 with less aesthetic a little more square 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.370
 and not so pretty I do not know if they understand me what 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.650
 what do i mean 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.440
 but then it would stop being a game of 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.110
 the fourth generation of the generation 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.330
 of the future of new graphics as 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.740
 it can be something like that or think again 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.479
 announcements but but think about the 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.220
 millions of people who get lost 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.250
 play this game that is lost from what 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.220
 otherwise it goes up well but 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.039
 they want if we are all first world 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.660
 What's the matter with me as a Venezuelan with my 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.510
 four computers gamer I feel that 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.210
 would it be an insult to me to have a 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.729
 minecraft that had so few graphics 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.500
 as the one who is suggesting your good to 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.770
 someone else has something to contribute to the 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.400
 discussion I do not know the truth that I 'm leaving 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.400
 but good 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.590
 good this 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.310
 good 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.310
 if we do production 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:13.549
 good but we ended up with the program 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:15.379
 Today, many thanks to the guests 

00:06:13.549 --> 00:06:17.899
 luciano that is still on the table to 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:21.169

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:24.199
 He already cashed the check, so it was already 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:26.569

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.830
 comments and we will resolve it in the future 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:35.259

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.259
