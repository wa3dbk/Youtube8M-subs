00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello avg up guys 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.349
 we are here just arrived in the office 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.389
 the nokia lumia 520 the entry level of 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.889
 nokia home 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.060
 this obviously you see in the version 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.289
 team with an operation is provided 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.340
 by the national team operator precisely 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:29.630
 with a contract for 5 euros a month for 24 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:32.040
 months then 120 euros for an entry level 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:37.290
 let's say quite performing let's move on 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:42.390
 immediately at the boxing we then have the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.969
 nokia lumia 520 very nice yellow 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.280
 this yellow we can a moment from 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.710
 part 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.379
 let's check what's in the box 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:01:00.600
 we have within the introduction manual 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:02.989
 in the long run the battery which is matri a 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.989
 nokia 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:15.680
 autofocus and at 1,430 milan per should 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.399
 guarantee an autonomy of 360 hours in 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.830
 stand by and in 576 minutes in 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.280
 conversation we have no longer stressed 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.990
 at most we don't know if 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.840
 indeed it will be so right with the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.119
 limbs we will insert in the mobile in the rest 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.479
 of the box we find stereo earphones 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:44.710
 charger and typical nokia format with 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.710
 micro usb and halter a micro usb 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:55.490
 let's put aside the boxes for a moment 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:02:00.049
 we immediately come to the attention of del 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.569
 520 the opening obviously sees need 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.750
 take off the back cover e 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:12.709
 simply insert the battery in 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:15.730
 this way we remove the film that there is 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.730
 will admire the 4-inch display 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.730
 ips 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:30.310
 while we hear you I'll show you 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:35.480
 the dimensions compared to an iphone 4s 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.850
 pretty cute in light hand a lot 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.260
 actually read also complete with 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.130
 battery 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.579
 obviously the materials are plastic 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:50.209
 you can talk about the 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:53.209
 processor that is a dual snapdragon 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.910
 1 gigahertz core and of course typical 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:00.410
 of this false for the entry level e 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.709
 windows phone 8 operating system 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.269
 as you can see already operational 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.440
 typical metro windows interface 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.450
 phone 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.120
 actually it is pretty enough 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.490
 the metro interface and above all maybe 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.410
 for those of you 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:20.630
 look out to the smartphone world from 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.620
 little so maybe the first time 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.080
 they are holding a touchscreen phone 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.310
 that maybe you can send a little 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.920
 confusion instead of interfacing 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.800
 I must say it is quite simple 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.320
 allow easy navigation e 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.550
 fast maximum camera shelter 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:45.530
 5 megapixel camera 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:46.850
 obviously without flash and it lacks 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.870
 front camera 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.930
 as you can see a choice of nokia 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:59.660
 which obviously allows to contain the 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:03.880
 price of 120 euros let's say I do 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:08.870
 see a little less than the typical menu of 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.740
 nokia windows phone with the list of 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.440
 app 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.250
 nokia has entered a good segment of 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.250
 own app 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.980
 very pretty it is quite functional 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.930
 type for example photosmart that allows 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.480
 to take a series of photos and then yes 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.690
 it was completely the best one 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.960
 or the hard drive gear maps allow 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.400
 navigation thanks to the integrated GPS 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.290
 etc 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:41.460
 windows phone and obviously as a browser 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.460
 main integrates and internet explorer is 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.420
 and office 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.070
 we have office we have a lot 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.740
 of applications actually 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.620
 owners who allow a quick 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.540
 fast transition to the world environment 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.180
 windows phone for example transfer never 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.890
 data allows you to transfer data from a 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.169
 any other cell phone we had in 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.390
 precedence therefore allows us a change 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.390
 easy especially all those 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.790
 people who have many contacts are 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.730
 accustomed is maybe they think they can't 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:24.010
 make a complete pass in a way 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:26.169
 simple and fast and I show you is one 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:30.640
 nice phone part more easily 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:32.110
 we are at the telephone keypad party 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.690
 numeric for calls 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:41.560
 obviously the soft touch button below with 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:43.780
 the back keys start and search we can 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.160
 for example, a moment on the key searches for that 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.590
 it allows us precisely to enter the 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.979
 bing screen the search engine of 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.979
 home microsoft 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.150
 we also say a certain 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:03.640
 voice assistant we can think of a 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:08.940
 moment to siri just press start e 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:12.580
 is activated for example up wakes up 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.940
 obviously he didn't understand me he doesn't 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.940
 anything 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:23.370
 let's go ahead I'll show you do 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.370
 see the camera 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.580
 in camera 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:40.590
 simple and minimal interface with 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.590
 then physical key to take pictures 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.610
 autofocus 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.610
 ok picture taken 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:52.309
 let's go but it's the camera roll yes 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:56.659
 we also show the application 

00:06:52.309 --> 00:07:01.039
 photo roll so we have ours 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:04.550
 photo touch sensitive enough the photo 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:08.479
 let's say it's in light conditions 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:12.399
 we say perfect so pretty good 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:16.879
 the photo and we are not complaining of course 

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:19.580
 for photos with low brightness we will have 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:27.139
 some problems given the lack of 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:31.669
 flash we have nothing else to say 

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:35.899
 we can only leave you with a vote 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:40.969
 final that for me of widgets is a bell 8 

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:44.930
 full on 10 as the report 

00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:46.159
 price quality is really good 

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.339
 for an entry level 

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:56.749
 to everything you need is also something 

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:58.089
