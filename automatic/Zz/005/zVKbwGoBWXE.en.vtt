now<00:01:59.350> that<00:01:59.470> we<00:01:59.590> found<00:01:59.799> the<00:02:00.010> five<00:02:00.430> fastest<00:02:01.330> bits

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
now that we found the five fastest bits

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.749 
now that we found the five fastest bits
of<00:02:01.689> kit<00:02:01.840> it's<00:02:02.320> time<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.650> whittle<00:02:02.950> them<00:02:03.040> down<00:02:03.280> to

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
of kit it's time to whittle them down to

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.940 
of kit it's time to whittle them down to
a<00:02:03.790> final<00:02:04.150> pair<00:02:04.540> so<00:02:04.900> we<00:02:05.110> thought<00:02:05.409> we'd<00:02:05.740> come<00:02:05.890> up

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
a final pair so we thought we'd come up

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.890 
a final pair so we thought we'd come up
with<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.189> little<00:02:06.430> test<00:02:06.700> to<00:02:07.240> find<00:02:07.420> out<00:02:07.600> how<00:02:07.869> easy

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
with a little test to find out how easy

make you want to look at it what about
ease<00:04:08.770> of<00:04:08.950> use<00:04:09.160> then<00:04:09.550> if<00:04:10.300> it<00:04:10.450> was<00:04:10.540> a<00:04:10.570> bumpy<00:04:11.140> road

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320

you<00:04:11.590> can<00:04:11.740> occasionally<00:04:12.100> knock<00:04:12.640> a<00:04:12.670> button<00:04:13.300> and

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
you can occasionally knock a button and

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.600 
you can occasionally knock a button and
maybe<00:04:13.990> terminate<00:04:14.710> the<00:04:14.890> call<00:04:15.130> when<00:04:15.370> you<00:04:15.400> were

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610
