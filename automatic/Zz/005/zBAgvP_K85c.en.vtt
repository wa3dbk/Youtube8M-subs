00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.240
 hi it 's sunday again so i have 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.549
 today video for you and it is this 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.579
 Cindy Kirby and yes he did to me 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:12.070
 you made yourself quite often but me 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:14.079
 have their own variation made so 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.459
 I thought that would be nice to share 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.500
 It is namely how you own one 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.620
 flower wreath can make it is the language 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.330
 inspired by spring and summer 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.310
 it is curious who would be a nice one 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.730
 floral color taste remains corner especially 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.150
 look 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.670
 what do you need for these villages themselves 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.920
 of course flowers of your choice and in this 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.960
 the flower wreath has an iron wire 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.960
 and I will use that later on the whole 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.149
 keep the flower wreath in shape but like 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.670
 you just have a street in the store 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.140
 I would definitely use that 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.940
 you can also use ribbon to everything 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.129
 to decorate but this is optional 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.929
 you need any rod and 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.489
 scissors also you have something of an old 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.859
 magazine you can work on 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.539
 without getting your desk or work surface dirty 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.859
 is becoming 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.870
 and finally a glue gun or 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.549
 just glue everything 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.559
 personally i go for glue gun i 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:04.210
 find it yourself more solid 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.610
 that was all you need let's 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.860
 to start 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.730
 I first start with the flower wreath in the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.770
 heart shape 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.770
 here first off all the flowers 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.729
 then also all the leaves off and on 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.600
 that was very easy because it was 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.600
 just a whole 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.490
 I do still own thread over and 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.200
 these mountains kimmel around so that the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.060
 fits my head naturally 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.100
 then we take all the flowers and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.210
 if needed cut meat off I have to 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.210
 just with a tooth 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.530
 also bought this package well 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.060
 I just feel the color and size 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.350
 very nice fit with the flowers 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.350
 wreath that I had in mind 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.070
 they were attached to an iron wire and this one 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.070
 I also removed with a pair of pliers 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.110
 also keep it out of the water off of something 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.110
 smaller flowers 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.890
 after that I prepare a magazine 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.090
 protect a desk against the line 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.740
 because we are now going to work with one 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.700
 glue gun 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.590
 if you have never been with a glue gun 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.100
 have definitely worked someone for help 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.630
 questions that do have experience with this 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.160
 first I glue the ice it comes on 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.460
 each other so that of course I am all around 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.460
 yep 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.770
 after this you can be completely free 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.730
 to stick the flour on it 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.730
 how jesus wants 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.620
 if you are happy with the result late 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.450
 then dry it up 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.100
 it doesn't have to be very long but it does 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.160
 just put everything in its place 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.160
 sit 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.540
 you can also make this block wreath fun 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.010
 decorate by some extra juice to be 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.010
 for example, add a ribbon 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.440
 I personally didn't like it that much 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.810
 stand than I thought 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.200
 so i didn't do that but like it 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.129
 you should definitely do that 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.129
 this is my result 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.000
 that that's how you make your own 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.080
 I think it is quite a flower wreath 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.610
 very nice 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.500
 it matches a lot of my outfits 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.390
 I don't usually wear that much 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.080
 bright colors I just wear most 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.150
 black and white and this flower class is only now 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.250
 really nice with always a kind 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.420
 you can simyo us for a statement 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.070

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.960

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.470

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.420
