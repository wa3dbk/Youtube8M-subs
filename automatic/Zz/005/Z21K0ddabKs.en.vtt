repeat<00:01:40.280> rabbit<00:01:41.030> a<00:01:41.210> review<00:01:42.910> um<00:01:43.910> there<00:01:44.900> are

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
repeat rabbit a review um there are

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.499 
repeat rabbit a review um there are
hundreds<00:01:45.290> if<00:01:45.410> sterilized<00:01:45.860> human<00:01:46.160> hair<00:01:46.369> so

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.910 

just<00:01:50.509> better<00:01:50.720> than<00:01:50.900> plastic<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.470> guess<00:01:51.650> you<00:01:51.800> can

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
just better than plastic I guess you can

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.560 
just better than plastic I guess you can
curl<00:01:52.160> them<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:55.520> can<00:01:55.700> reuse<00:01:55.970> them<00:01:56.330> up<00:01:56.479> to

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
curl them and you can reuse them up to

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.240 
curl them and you can reuse them up to
three<00:01:56.750> weeks<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:57.289> I<00:01:57.380> guess<00:01:57.619> their<00:01:57.860> meaning<00:01:58.160> if

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
three weeks and I guess their meaning if

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.550 
three weeks and I guess their meaning if
you<00:01:58.369> use<00:01:58.850> them<00:01:59.060> everyday<00:01:59.330> but<00:01:59.539> i<00:01:59.840> don't<00:02:00.200> so<00:02:00.470> you

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
you use them everyday but i don't so you

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.770 
you use them everyday but i don't so you
could<00:02:00.740> probably<00:02:00.950> keep<00:02:01.250> them<00:02:01.460> if<00:02:01.610> you<00:02:01.789> if<00:02:02.539> you

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
could probably keep them if you if you

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.990 
could probably keep them if you if you
like<00:02:03.740> after<00:02:03.920> every<00:02:04.190> use<00:02:04.310> if<00:02:04.520> you<00:02:04.610> peel<00:02:04.850> the

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
like after every use if you peel the

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.240 
like after every use if you peel the
glue<00:02:05.210> off<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.509> band<00:02:05.720> then<00:02:06.380> i'm<00:02:06.740> sure<00:02:06.770> that<00:02:07.130> you

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
glue off the band then i'm sure that you

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.660 
glue off the band then i'm sure that you
could<00:02:07.369> use<00:02:07.580> them<00:02:07.820> for<00:02:08.350> months<00:02:09.350> I<00:02:09.679> I<00:02:10.009> wouldn't<00:02:10.489> I

dollars<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:18.489> at<00:02:19.489> ulta<00:02:19.820> and<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:21.230> was<00:02:21.500> four

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.860 
dollars and at ulta and it was four
dollars<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.100> glue<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.370> think<00:02:22.670> that's<00:02:23.360> what

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
dollars the glue I think that's what

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.900 
dollars the glue I think that's what
they<00:02:23.989> look<00:02:24.200> like<00:02:24.310> see<00:02:25.420> hold<00:02:26.420> on

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.760 

as<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:29.630> can<00:02:29.690> see<00:02:29.840> it's<00:02:30.020> tapered<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.650> gets

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
as you can see it's tapered it gets

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.620 
as you can see it's tapered it gets
longer<00:02:30.980> at<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.490> end<00:02:31.610> it's<00:02:31.790> kind<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.030> wispy

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.260 

yeah<00:02:35.630> they're<00:02:36.500> black<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.460> supermom

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
yeah they're black and the supermom

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.730 
yeah they're black and the supermom
they're<00:02:38.510> like<00:02:38.720> they're<00:02:39.260> cut<00:02:39.410> different

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
they're like they're cut different

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.460 
they're like they're cut different
weight<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.250> looks<00:02:40.430> wispy<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.210> it's<00:02:41.660> really

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
weight so it looks wispy and it's really

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.020 
weight so it looks wispy and it's really
cute<00:02:42.860> it's<00:02:43.160> definitely<00:02:43.400> worth<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.850> purchase

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
cute it's definitely worth the purchase

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.760 
cute it's definitely worth the purchase
but<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.510> think<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:45.110> if<00:02:45.290> you're<00:02:45.440> going<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.620> wear

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
but I think that if you're going to wear

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.760 
but I think that if you're going to wear
them<00:02:45.980> um<00:02:46.360> you<00:02:47.360> know<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.570> school<00:02:47.930> or<00:02:48.230> like<00:02:48.590> to

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
them um you know to school or like to

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.050 
them um you know to school or like to
work<00:02:48.980> or<00:02:49.190> something<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.610> definitely<00:02:49.670> think

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
work or something I definitely think

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.510 
work or something I definitely think
that<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.360> should<00:02:50.540> get<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.660> smaller<00:02:51.160> pair<00:02:52.160> not

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
that you should get a smaller pair not

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.590 
that you should get a smaller pair not
not<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.360> one<00:02:53.660> Elevens<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.230> 111<00:02:54.680> czar<00:02:54.830> huge

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
not the one Elevens the 111 czar huge

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.930 
not the one Elevens the 111 czar huge
but<00:02:56.600> um<00:02:58.300> but<00:02:59.300> yeah<00:02:59.450> that's<00:03:00.020> my<00:03:00.320> eye<00:03:00.680> my<00:03:01.460> review
