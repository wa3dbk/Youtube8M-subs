but<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.600> depends<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.500> play<00:01:40.619> really<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.009> I

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
but it depends on you play really like I

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.639 
but it depends on you play really like I
prefer<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.530> defensive<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
prefer going a defensive and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.499 
prefer going a defensive and
counter-attack<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.670> didn't<00:01:45.090> do<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.270> with

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
counter-attack and I didn't do this with

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.700 
counter-attack and I didn't do this with
this<00:01:45.600> thing<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.869> might<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:46.110> why<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.290> struggle<00:01:46.680> a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
this thing it might be why I struggle a

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.030 
this thing it might be why I struggle a
little<00:01:46.770> bit<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.520> overall<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.780> think<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.860> he

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
little bit but overall I think that he

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.190 
little bit but overall I think that he
could<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.579> better<00:01:50.790> used<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.299> you're<00:01:51.780> more<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.140> a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
could be better used if you're more of a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.740 
could be better used if you're more of a
defensive<00:01:52.350> player<00:01:53.119> finish<00:01:54.119> off<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.360> defense

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
defensive player finish off this defense

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.539 
defensive player finish off this defense
