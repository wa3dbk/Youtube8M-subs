00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.840 
feel quite like a dirt bike it
definitely<00:02:05.890> doesn't<00:02:06.040> look<00:02:06.220> much<00:02:06.400> like<00:02:06.460> one

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
definitely doesn't look much like one

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.940

the<00:02:07.150> new<00:02:07.329> look<00:02:07.540> is<00:02:07.689> pretty<00:02:08.140> tough<00:02:08.409> I'm<00:02:08.619> asking

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
the new look is pretty tough I'm asking

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.250 
the new look is pretty tough I'm asking
at<00:02:09.069> that<00:02:09.220> but<00:02:09.459> it<00:02:10.299> doesn't<00:02:10.479> feel<00:02:10.750> it's<00:02:10.959> still<00:02:11.230> a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
at that but it doesn't feel it's still a

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.569 
at that but it doesn't feel it's still a
little<00:02:11.590> bit<00:02:11.799> intimidating<00:02:12.459> at<00:02:12.549> first

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
little bit intimidating at first

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.030 
little bit intimidating at first
obviously<00:02:13.349> until<00:02:14.349> you<00:02:14.410> actually<00:02:14.530> get<00:02:14.800> on<00:02:14.920> it

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
obviously until you actually get on it

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.220 
obviously until you actually get on it

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
nicely the new electronics are just just

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.210 
nicely the new electronics are just just
amazing<00:02:26.689> obviously<00:02:27.290> they<00:02:27.379> shared<00:02:27.860> with<00:02:28.010> the

be<00:02:36.379> carving<00:02:36.799> up<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.069> road<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.730> then<00:02:38.000> we'd

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
be carving up the road and then we'd

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.619 
be carving up the road and then we'd
head<00:02:38.659> off<00:02:38.750> into<00:02:38.959> some<00:02:39.200> sand<00:02:39.670> various<00:02:40.670> forms<00:02:41.540> of

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
bit of everything today and then we

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.160 
bit of everything today and then we
finished<00:02:45.950> up<00:02:46.069> with<00:02:46.390> on<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.510> beach<00:02:47.690> down<00:02:47.989> at

steering head angle is decreased due to

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.599 
steering head angle is decreased due to

let's you brief intro to the r1200gs
adventure<00:06:08.290> as<00:06:08.980> I<00:06:09.160> said<00:06:09.340> we're<00:06:09.430> only<00:06:09.550> in<00:06:09.730> day

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
adventure as I said we're only in day

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.270 
adventure as I said we're only in day
one<00:06:10.150> now<00:06:10.390> at<00:06:10.540> a<00:06:10.630> three-day<00:06:10.990> ride<00:06:11.280> it's

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
one now at a three-day ride it's

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.500 
one now at a three-day ride it's
obviously<00:06:12.550> much<00:06:12.730> improved<00:06:13.150> over<00:06:13.300> its

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
obviously much improved over its

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.200 
obviously much improved over its
predecessor<00:06:14.080> it's<00:06:14.310> the<00:06:15.310> biggest<00:06:15.640> leap<00:06:15.850> since

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
predecessor it's the biggest leap since

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.090 
predecessor it's the biggest leap since
I<00:06:16.660> think<00:06:16.900> woman's<00:06:17.170> last<00:06:17.470> big<00:06:17.620> leap<00:06:17.800> probably

I think woman's last big leap probably

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.600 
I think woman's last big leap probably
2004<00:06:19.020> was<00:06:20.020> so<00:06:20.170> huge<00:06:20.530> huge<00:06:20.710> leap<00:06:21.040> forward<00:06:21.310> and

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
2004 was so huge huge leap forward and

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.610 
2004 was so huge huge leap forward and
then<00:06:21.730> the<00:06:22.360> last<00:06:22.600> of<00:06:22.810> the<00:06:22.900> air<00:06:23.020> calls<00:06:23.230> were<00:06:23.380> also

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
then the last of the air calls were also

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.380 
then the last of the air calls were also
had<00:06:24.070> a<00:06:24.100> nice<00:06:24.310> leap<00:06:24.550> forward<00:06:24.850> with<00:06:24.940> the<00:06:25.090> engine

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390
