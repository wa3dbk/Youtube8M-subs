he's one of the best centre-backs i used

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.070 
he's one of the best centre-backs i used
on<00:03:42.750> this<00:03:42.990> game<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:44.360> there's<00:03:45.360> of<00:03:45.540> course<00:03:45.840> the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
team of the year version of him I think

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.890 
team of the year version of him I think
if<00:03:49.020> 89<00:03:49.500> overall<00:03:50.010> rated<00:03:50.400> has<00:03:51.270> a<00:03:51.540> little<00:03:51.720> bit

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
if 89 overall rated has a little bit

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.330 
if 89 overall rated has a little bit
higher<00:03:52.110> pace<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:52.620> then<00:03:52.740> of<00:03:52.860> cost<00:03:53.100> higher

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
higher pace and then of cost higher

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.120 
higher pace and then of cost higher
defending<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.060> heading<00:03:54.750> stead<00:03:55.020> as<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.530> 86

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.060 
defending and heading stead as the 86
rated<00:03:56.430> one<00:03:56.550> of<00:03:56.700> them<00:03:56.880> but<00:03:57.540> if<00:03:57.660> you've<00:03:57.860> not<00:03:58.860> got

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
rated one of them but if you've not got

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.710 
enough coins for the team of the year
version<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.080> think<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:02.310> T<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:03.030> second<00:04:03.390> in<00:04:03.480> form

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
version I think the T the second in form

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.280 
version I think the T the second in form
of<00:04:03.810> him<00:04:03.990> is<00:04:04.170> definitely<00:04:04.620> worth<00:04:04.830> it<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:06.170> it's<00:04:07.170> a

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
of him is definitely worth it and it's a

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.070 
of him is definitely worth it and it's a
very<00:04:07.470> good<00:04:07.530> defender<00:04:08.280> overall<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.660> two<00:04:09.810> full

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
very good defender overall the two full

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.770 
very good defender overall the two full
bags<00:04:10.260> are<00:04:10.470> pretty<00:04:10.680> solid<00:04:11.130> both<00:04:11.850> quite<00:04:12.450> Pacey

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
bags are pretty solid both quite Pacey

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.330 
bags are pretty solid both quite Pacey
especially<00:04:13.470> figure<00:04:13.709> roll<00:04:13.920> with<00:04:14.130> 86<00:04:14.610> pays<00:04:15.000> and

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
especially figure roll with 86 pays and

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.800 
especially figure roll with 86 pays and
just<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.430> complete<00:04:17.820> defense<00:04:18.030> in<00:04:18.390> my<00:04:18.510> opinion

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
just a complete defense in my opinion

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.950 
just a complete defense in my opinion
and<00:04:19.049> then<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.160> course<00:04:20.270> with<00:04:21.270> what<00:04:21.660> will<00:04:21.810> win

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
and then of course with what will win

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.380 
and then of course with what will win
your<00:04:22.109> games<00:04:22.350> are<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.680> two<00:04:23.250> centimeters<00:04:24.150> who

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
your games are the two centimeters who

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.600 
your games are the two centimeters who
just<00:04:24.750> asked<00:04:25.020> so<00:04:25.350> much<00:04:25.560> in<00:04:25.770> control<00:04:25.979> of<00:04:26.250> the

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
just asked so much in control of the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.210 
just asked so much in control of the
whole<00:04:26.760> game

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
whole game

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.490 
whole game
think<00:04:27.400> both<00:04:27.610> of<00:04:27.640> them<00:04:27.880> have<00:04:28.180> high<00:04:28.960> attacking

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
think both of them have high attacking

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.010 
think both of them have high attacking
and<00:04:29.680> high<00:04:29.980> defensive<00:04:30.610> workrate<00:04:31.120> which<00:04:31.900> is

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
and high defensive workrate which is

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.820 
and high defensive workrate which is
pretty<00:04:32.200> great<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:34.690> both<00:04:34.900> with<00:04:35.080> excellent

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
pretty great and you both with excellent

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.710 
pretty great and you both with excellent
shooting<00:04:36.190> excellent<00:04:36.790> passing<00:04:37.030> stats<00:04:37.420> both

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
shooting excellent passing stats both

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.720 
shooting excellent passing stats both
with<00:04:37.930> three<00:04:37.960> stars<00:04:38.470> few<00:04:38.710> moves<00:04:38.950> as<00:04:39.130> well<00:04:39.520> so

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
with three stars few moves as well so

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.210
