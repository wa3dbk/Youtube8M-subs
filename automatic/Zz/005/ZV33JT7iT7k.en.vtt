00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.780
 Good evening guys are schools through gold 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.990
 and young people among the 6 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.990
 How to put even a radio 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:12.759
 quickly their servers 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.189
 however they were all from the real see a tutorial 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.269
 he put him on a rifle 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.269
 only that there is a diffusion and 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.659
 fencing rifle 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.720
 she stopped working 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.720
 no longer partners and do not do this 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.080
 thame 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.920
 The episode is there to be done. 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.450
 fusion akira 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.740
 and not the solution 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.860
 Already 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.340
 but there's another radio for you guys to do the same to me 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.990
 already the first or I make the big night 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.980
 and confesses that it expedites 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.170
 second 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.570
 abreu 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.430
 I wrote 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.510
 radio 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.250
 the singer 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.470
 marcinho 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.780
 on the radio the singer turns off 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.760
 the encyclical challenge now is just to put a pressure here on the radio center beta 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.470
 the best way is radio from brazil the secretaries here first 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.300
 but you know you're going to keep us 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.300
 from here enter the site r7 click enter 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.300
 after entering 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.300
 If I go, do I mention the load? 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.610
 listen to the music 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.610
 bikers bikers here is the pleiades 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.590
 there I 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.570
 will be successful on these players 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.460
 who are the biggest customers 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.810
 and this little baby 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.810
 however I'll buy the two options 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.700
 we action on what went beyond 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.670
 It looks like the html 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.300
 only it has a but 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.840
 ping several colors aquino 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.439
 only here you here in casec orkut is how it goes green 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.189
 cop dark horse 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.499
 it goes here maybe we should polar that we will have a red one 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:17.779
 according to the site 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:20.389
 expertise zito these images 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:23.709
 dragged cast that included what even 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.149
 it's fine 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:30.149
 the idea is to use small-sized source code 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.559
 it is theirs resident here you will comply with the code 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.489
 there you coordinate what you did not only see did still 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.610
 the rivals said that with the white black blue pink and green the tide wolf 'big 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:48.549
 brother 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:49.899
 the world a drawing 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:53.859
 this world and won is a is a theme that streaming in 2006 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.629
 the goalkeeper's max exit 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.629
 but it's the last day here that I of that 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:06.019
 of 7,500 thousand from this moment of decision 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.690
 and I'll need you to stand out as best actor 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.749
 it's personal 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:13.969
 Santa Isabel, I think mine too. 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:18.209
 there lies the bing is to get things and guitar discharge 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.029
 so you do not do 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:24.089
 you will see which ones you like evoked that your email is dry khaki 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.709
 through the investee and that the correct one was until here is the tip of request 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.480

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.859
 at the 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.379
 but to represent the first time that Mario Quintana came after three 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:41.040
 DVD

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:51.779
 I'll put red here 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:55.999
 red 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.999
 the facility will close 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:03.119

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.570
 but that's it 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.969
 any doubt and is opposite and not 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:40.909
 the video comments 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:43.929
