else physically incredibly hard you just

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.240 
else physically incredibly hard you just
you<00:01:41.899> fighting<00:01:42.290> for<00:01:42.320> traction<00:01:42.619> all<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.040> time

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
you fighting for traction all the time

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.760 
you fighting for traction all the time
looking<00:01:44.180> for<00:01:44.300> the<00:01:44.390> easiest<00:01:44.930> lines<00:01:45.229> up<00:01:45.500> he

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
looking for the easiest lines up he

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.270 
looking for the easiest lines up he
roars<00:01:45.979> over<00:01:46.280> rocks<00:01:47.200> it's<00:01:48.200> just<00:01:48.410> just<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:49.009> really

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
roars over rocks it's just just a really

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.210 
roars over rocks it's just just a really
tough<00:01:49.520> sport<00:01:49.790> I<00:01:50.500> think<00:01:51.500> basically<00:01:51.680> it's<00:01:52.190> about

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
tough sport I think basically it's about

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.090 
tough sport I think basically it's about
taking<00:01:52.910> an<00:01:53.810> enjoyable<00:01:54.350> back<00:01:54.649> to<00:01:54.830> its<00:01:54.979> absolute

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
taking an enjoyable back to its absolute

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.249 
taking an enjoyable back to its absolute
limit<00:01:55.700> is<00:01:55.910> basically<00:01:56.420> going<00:01:56.600> over<00:01:56.899> sorcerer

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
limit is basically going over sorcerer

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.559 
limit is basically going over sorcerer
will<00:01:57.680> probably<00:01:58.009> be<00:01:58.130> more<00:01:58.580> suited<00:01:59.030> to<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.210> trials

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
will probably be more suited to a trials

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.900 
will probably be more suited to a trials
bike<00:01:59.600> in<00:01:59.959> a<00:02:00.380> lot<00:02:00.530> of<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.770> places<00:02:01.009> but<00:02:01.819> you're

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
bike in a lot of the places but you're

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.059 
bike in a lot of the places but you're
actually<00:02:02.030> taking<00:02:02.360> a<00:02:02.630> ninja<00:02:02.929> or<00:02:03.170> bike<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.740> them

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
actually taking a ninja or bike to them

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:05.980 
actually taking a ninja or bike to them
to<00:02:04.280> that<00:02:04.429> limit<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:04.910> which<00:02:05.090> in<00:02:05.509> turn<00:02:05.810> is

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
to that limit and which in turn is

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.600 
to that limit and which in turn is
taking<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.440> rider<00:02:06.649> to<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:07.009> limit<00:02:07.280> as<00:02:07.399> well

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
taking the rider to the limit as well

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.570 
taking the rider to the limit as well
it's<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.600> combination<00:02:08.899> of<00:02:09.410> probably<00:02:10.340> three<00:02:10.550> or

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
it's a combination of probably three or

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.699 
it's a combination of probably three or
four<00:02:10.670> different<00:02:11.060> sports<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:12.350> is<00:02:12.530> just
