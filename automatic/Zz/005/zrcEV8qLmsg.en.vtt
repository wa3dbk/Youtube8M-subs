00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
some people use and some people don't

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:58.020 
some people use and some people don't
use<00:00:50.989> I<00:00:51.470> prefer<00:00:52.430> using<00:00:52.640> this<00:00:55.390> so<00:00:56.390> let<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:56.930> soak

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
use I prefer using this so let the soak

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.590 
use I prefer using this so let the soak
for<00:00:59.440> 7-8<00:01:00.440> hours<00:01:01.180> and<00:01:02.829> also<00:01:03.829> the<00:01:04.159> rice<00:01:04.430> soak<00:01:05.390> it

for 7-8 hours and also the rice soak it
separately<00:01:06.350> for<00:01:06.829> 7-8<00:01:07.369> hours

okay<00:01:08.360> let's<00:01:08.689> train<00:01:09.200> for<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:11.290> EDA<00:01:12.290> and<00:01:12.320> those

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
okay let's train for the EDA and those

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.020 
okay let's train for the EDA and those
are<00:01:12.890> batter<00:01:13.130> first<00:01:14.030> I'm<00:01:14.509> going<00:01:15.049> to<00:01:15.139> grind

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
are batter first I'm going to grind

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.490 
are batter first I'm going to grind
or<00:01:17.510> a<00:01:17.570> dad<00:01:18.490> with<00:01:19.490> a<00:01:19.520> soak<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:20.090> water<00:01:20.300> it<00:01:21.290> has

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
or a dad with a soak to water it has

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.340 
or a dad with a soak to water it has
been<00:01:21.710> soaking<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.940> whole<00:01:23.180> night

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
been soaking the whole night

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
been soaking the whole night
I<00:01:24.380> think<00:01:25.130> it<00:01:26.000> soaked<00:01:26.330> for<00:01:26.810> around<00:01:27.550> seven<00:01:28.550> hours

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
I think it soaked for around seven hours

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.950 
I think it soaked for around seven hours
so<00:01:31.370> I'm<00:01:32.000> going<00:01:32.300> to<00:01:32.390> grind<00:01:32.660> it<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.630> smooth

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
so I'm going to grind it to a smooth

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.080 
so I'm going to grind it to a smooth
paste<00:01:36.850> add<00:01:37.850> water

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
paste add water

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.899 
paste add water
when<00:01:40.659> needed<00:01:41.350> I'm<00:01:41.950> adding<00:01:42.310> little<00:01:42.640> bit<00:01:42.790> of

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
when needed I'm adding little bit of

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.310 
when needed I'm adding little bit of
water

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
water

00:01:44.320 --> 00:02:09.440 
water
it<00:01:44.470> was<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.830> consistency

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.710 

think<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.989> must've<00:02:10.379> got<00:02:10.679> added<00:02:11.580> around<00:02:12.150> quarter

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
think I must've got added around quarter

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.460 
think I must've got added around quarter
cups<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.290> water<00:02:13.530> beam<00:02:14.840> along<00:02:15.840> with<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.230> water

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
cups of water beam along with the water

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:26.510 
cups of water beam along with the water
that<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:17.610> use<00:02:18.420> for<00:02:18.750> soaking

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.150 

it<00:02:27.520> has<00:02:28.180> been<00:02:28.420> raining<00:02:28.990> for<00:02:29.260> about<00:02:29.800> five

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
it has been raining for about five

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.010 
it has been raining for about five
minutes

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
minutes

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.220 
minutes
see

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.640 

let's<00:02:38.560> take<00:02:38.830> this<00:02:39.010> out<00:02:39.250> actually<00:02:39.970> my<00:02:40.930> my

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
let's take this out actually my my

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.770 
let's take this out actually my my
Grindr<00:02:42.190> is<00:02:42.220> better<00:02:42.700> fast

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
Grindr is better fast

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.280 
Grindr is better fast
I<00:02:43.930> drank<00:02:44.830> fast<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:46.269> might<00:02:46.569> take<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.930> little<00:02:47.110> bit

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
I drank fast it might take a little bit

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.119 
I drank fast it might take a little bit
longer<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:48.129> some<00:02:48.400> grinders<00:02:49.269> so<00:02:50.170> the

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
longer and some grinders so the

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.330 
longer and some grinders so the
consistency<00:02:51.549> is<00:02:52.120> important<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:52.870> sod

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
consistency is important that sod

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.970 
consistency is important that sod
sometimes<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:55.000> might<00:02:55.209> grow<00:02:55.590> grind<00:02:56.590> even

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
sometimes it might grow grind even

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.730 
sometimes it might grow grind even
faster<00:02:57.849> than<00:02:58.000> this

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
faster than this

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.339 
faster than this
this<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.520> approximately<00:03:00.390> five<00:03:00.630> six<00:03:00.900> minutes

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
this is approximately five six minutes

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.459 
this is approximately five six minutes
after<00:03:03.129> grinding<00:03:03.579> it<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.239> really<00:03:04.719> like<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:04.930> very

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:05.469 
after grinding it is really like a very

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:09.089 
after grinding it is really like a very
smooth<00:03:06.269> page

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
smooth page

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:39.730 
smooth page
so<00:03:09.459> let's<00:03:09.700> take<00:03:09.939> this<00:03:10.150> out

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:46.880 

let's<00:03:40.310> grind<00:03:40.670> this<00:03:41.030> rice

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.400 

now<00:03:47.890> this<00:03:48.220> rice<00:03:48.490> has<00:03:48.820> been<00:03:48.850> driving<00:03:49.420> for<00:03:49.900> about

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
now this rice has been driving for about

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.530 
now this rice has been driving for about
10<00:03:51.340> minutes<00:03:51.760> now<00:03:52.080> it's<00:03:53.080> a<00:03:53.290> smooth<00:03:53.680> paste<00:03:54.540> let's

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
10 minutes now it's a smooth paste let's

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.340 
10 minutes now it's a smooth paste let's
take<00:03:55.840> this<00:03:56.020> out<00:03:56.350> and<00:03:56.790> mix<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:57.940> with<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.350> or

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
take this out and mix it with the or

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.640 
take this out and mix it with the or
adult<00:04:00.180> now<00:04:01.180> I've<00:04:01.570> taken<00:04:01.870> out<00:04:02.140> both<00:04:02.440> the

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
adult now I've taken out both the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.150 
adult now I've taken out both the
batter's<00:04:03.130> breath<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.210> rice<00:04:06.270> to<00:04:07.270> this<00:04:08.160> I'm

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
batter's breath and rice to this I'm

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.710 
batter's breath and rice to this I'm
going<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.060> add<00:04:10.300> salt<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:11.230> mix<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:12.160> well<00:04:12.820> if

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
going to add salt and mix it well if

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.789 
going to add salt and mix it well if
needed<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:16.060> get<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:16.420> proper<00:04:16.750> consistency<00:04:17.110> I

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
needed to get the proper consistency I

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.840 
needed to get the proper consistency I
might<00:04:18.670> I<00:04:18.880> add<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.690> little<00:04:20.019> bit<00:04:20.290> of<00:04:20.380> water<00:04:20.650> so<00:04:21.489> let

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
might I add a little bit of water so let

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.790 
might I add a little bit of water so let
me<00:04:22.030> go<00:04:22.390> ahead<00:04:22.540> and<00:04:22.720> add<00:04:23.200> salt<00:04:25.620> this<00:04:26.620> is

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
me go ahead and add salt this is

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:34.800
