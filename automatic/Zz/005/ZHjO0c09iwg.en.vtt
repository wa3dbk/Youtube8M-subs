00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.230 

so<00:00:01.319> we<00:00:01.500> had<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.709> create<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.370> test<00:00:02.820> that<00:00:03.149> was

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
so we had to create a test that was

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.570 
so we had to create a test that was
going<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.480> be<00:00:03.659> exactly<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.799> same<00:00:04.830> for<00:00:05.339> each

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
going to be exactly the same for each

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.059 
going to be exactly the same for each
camera<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.629> first<00:00:06.930> thing<00:00:07.109> we<00:00:07.230> did<00:00:07.500> was<00:00:07.830> the

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
camera the first thing we did was the

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.220 
camera the first thing we did was the
lightest<00:00:08.460> set<00:00:08.639> that<00:00:08.849> had<00:00:09.030> some<00:00:09.330> really<00:00:09.660> hard

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
lightest set that had some really hard

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.220 
lightest set that had some really hard
challenges<00:00:10.889> for<00:00:11.040> cameras<00:00:11.460> at<00:00:11.580> us<00:00:11.759> we<00:00:12.420> created

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
challenges for cameras at us we created

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.950 
challenges for cameras at us we created
a<00:00:13.349> huge<00:00:13.620> dynamic<00:00:13.889> range<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:14.880> had<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.299> window

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
a huge dynamic range we had a window

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.630 
a huge dynamic range we had a window
that<00:00:16.139> was<00:00:16.320> really<00:00:16.590> really<00:00:16.770> bright<00:00:17.100> we<00:00:17.340> chose<00:00:17.609> a

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
that was really really bright we chose a

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.689 
that was really really bright we chose a
translate<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.510> had<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> white<00:00:19.020> house<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.740> we

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
translate that had a white house and we

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.080 
translate that had a white house and we
bought<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.869> person<00:00:22.560> into<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> very<00:00:23.430> kind<00:00:23.939> of

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
bought a person into a very kind of

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.470 
bought a person into a very kind of
shaded<00:00:24.570> low<00:00:24.810> key<00:00:25.050> area<00:00:25.560> with<00:00:25.740> practicals

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
shaded low key area with practicals

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.150 
shaded low key area with practicals
walking<00:00:27.480> through<00:00:27.720> almost<00:00:27.930> silhouetted<00:00:28.650> areas

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
walking through almost silhouetted areas

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.640 
walking through almost silhouetted areas
and<00:00:29.369> coming<00:00:29.730> coming<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.210> rest<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.720> really

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
and coming coming to rest and really

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.430 
and coming coming to rest and really
nice<00:00:31.830> facial<00:00:32.730> soft<00:00:33.000> light<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.630> had<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> huge

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
nice facial soft light so we had a huge

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.150 
nice facial soft light so we had a huge
range<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.950> challenges<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.320> ways<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.350> perceive

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
range of challenges and ways to perceive

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.389 
range of challenges and ways to perceive
a<00:00:38.190> camera<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.140> shot<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.649> design<00:00:41.070> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
a camera in the shot that we design and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.670 
a camera in the shot that we design and
then<00:00:41.969> apart<00:00:42.600> from<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> master<00:00:43.230> shot<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.559> had

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
then apart from the master shot we had

00:00:43.680 --> 00:01:38.990 
then apart from the master shot we had
two<00:00:44.180> puncheon's<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.570> do

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.940 

from<00:01:40.000> cheapest<00:01:40.600> to<00:01:40.780> most<00:01:40.990> expensive<00:01:41.590> the

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
from cheapest to most expensive the

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.410 
from cheapest to most expensive the
banding<00:01:42.430> seemed<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.790> decrease<00:01:43.150> way<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.170> f3

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
banding seemed to decrease way the f3

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.550 
banding seemed to decrease way the f3
you<00:01:46.420> know<00:01:46.540> held<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.900> gradation<00:01:47.380> the

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
you know held the gradation the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.070 
you know held the gradation the
highlights<00:01:47.950> particularly<00:01:48.400> in<00:01:48.490> that<00:01:48.640> that

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
highlights particularly in that that

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.270 
highlights particularly in that that
rear<00:01:50.430> practical<00:01:51.430> lamp<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:53.290> desk<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:54.250> you

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
rear practical lamp on the desk that you

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.960 
rear practical lamp on the desk that you
know<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.580> was<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:54.729> little<00:01:55.080> video<00:01:56.080> a<00:01:56.290> sharp<00:01:56.970> in

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
know it was a little video a sharp in

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.870 
know it was a little video a sharp in
the<00:01:58.149> overall<00:01:58.479> picture<00:01:58.690> but<00:01:59.050> the<00:01:59.880> highlights

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
the overall picture but the highlights

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.480 
the overall picture but the highlights
you<00:02:01.270> know<00:02:01.360> looked<00:02:01.540> really<00:02:01.720> nicely<00:02:01.960> on<00:02:02.770> every

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
you know looked really nicely on every

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.969 
you know looked really nicely on every
shot<00:02:03.820> my<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.270> kept<00:02:04.690> going<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.320> overexposed

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
shot my I kept going to the overexposed

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.190 
shot my I kept going to the overexposed
parts<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.610> large<00:02:07.030> picture<00:02:07.420> window<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.080> then

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
parts the large picture window and then

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.260 
parts the large picture window and then
when<00:02:08.350> she<00:02:08.500> opened<00:02:08.830> up<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.039> door<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.550> I<00:02:10.030> I

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
when she opened up the door and I I

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.940 
when she opened up the door and I I
think<00:02:10.720> that's<00:02:10.899> where<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.230> more<00:02:11.650> expensive

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
think that's where the more expensive

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.970 
think that's where the more expensive
cameras<00:02:12.640> really<00:02:13.060> shone<00:02:13.690> through<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:14.620> starts

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
cameras really shone through it starts

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.380 
cameras really shone through it starts
on<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.190> window<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:15.580> there's<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.940> woman<00:02:15.970> on

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
on the window and there's the woman on

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.479 
on the window and there's the woman on
the<00:02:16.420> right<00:02:16.750> with<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:16.989> striped<00:02:17.380> shirt<00:02:17.769> it<00:02:18.160> has

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
the right with the striped shirt it has

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.670 
the right with the striped shirt it has
the<00:02:18.519> light<00:02:18.910> coming<00:02:19.150> from<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.450> window<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:19.989> her

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
the light coming from the window and her

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.610 
the light coming from the window and her
shot<00:02:21.070> is<00:02:21.280> where<00:02:21.580> i<00:02:21.610> saw<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.350> cameras<00:02:23.350> either

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
shot is where i saw the cameras either

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.740 
shot is where i saw the cameras either
holding<00:02:24.190> detail<00:02:24.730> or<00:02:25.000> just<00:02:25.239> falling<00:02:25.660> apart

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
holding detail or just falling apart

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.199 
holding detail or just falling apart
really<00:02:26.290> fast<00:02:26.590> i<00:02:26.950> mean<00:02:27.280> i<00:02:27.340> was<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.489> very<00:02:27.910> telling

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
really fast i mean i was a very telling

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.120 
really fast i mean i was a very telling
no<00:02:28.660> usually<00:02:28.959> when<00:02:29.410> you're<00:02:29.530> creative<00:02:30.010> it's

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
no usually when you're creative it's

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.710 
no usually when you're creative it's
just<00:02:30.280> about<00:02:30.519> where<00:02:30.819> you<00:02:31.000> can<00:02:31.209> get<00:02:31.330> your<00:02:31.390> rhythm

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
just about where you can get your rhythm

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.290 
just about where you can get your rhythm
going<00:02:32.110> they're<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:32.980> close<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.670> then<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:34.090> make

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
going they're so close and then you make

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.780 
going they're so close and then you make
up<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.600> difference<00:02:34.750> with<00:02:35.140> what<00:02:35.170> you're<00:02:35.530> using

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
up the difference with what you're using

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.309 
up the difference with what you're using
you<00:02:36.790> know<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:36.940> empirical<00:02:37.450> round<00:02:37.660> i<00:02:37.989> was

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
you know the empirical round i was

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.800 
you know the empirical round i was
really<00:02:38.560> impressed<00:02:38.709> with<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.370> f3<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.720> was

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
really impressed with the f3 that was

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.600 
really impressed with the f3 that was
the<00:02:40.930> first<00:02:40.959> one<00:02:41.319> that<00:02:41.440> came<00:02:41.620> up<00:02:41.830> that<00:02:42.130> seemed

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
the first one that came up that seemed

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.100 
the first one that came up that seemed
to<00:02:42.730> handle<00:02:42.880> everything<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:43.570> had<00:02:43.690> detail

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
to handle everything that had detail

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.500 
to handle everything that had detail
outside<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.860> inside<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.579> you<00:02:46.209> know<00:02:46.299> had<00:02:46.480> some

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
outside and inside and you know had some

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.990 
outside and inside and you know had some
decent<00:02:46.780> range<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.530> my<00:02:47.980> first<00:02:48.280> week<00:02:48.610> animals
