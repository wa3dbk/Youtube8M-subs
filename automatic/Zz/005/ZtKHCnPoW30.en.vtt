take<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.530> look<00:02:13.770> at<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:13.950> one<00:02:14.130> right<00:02:14.280> here<00:02:14.520> it's

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
take a look at this one right here it's

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.090 
take a look at this one right here it's
a<00:02:14.700> little<00:02:14.820> bit<00:02:15.030> easier<00:02:17.240> and<00:02:18.560> we<00:02:19.560> zoom<00:02:19.770> on<00:02:19.950> it

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
a little bit easier and we zoom on it

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.400 
a little bit easier and we zoom on it
and<00:02:20.280> we<00:02:20.340> could<00:02:20.490> see<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.240> chart<00:02:21.810> that

there's a number of variety different
minerals<00:03:17.490> and<00:03:17.640> they<00:03:17.700> come<00:03:17.910> in<00:03:18.060> all<00:03:18.270> different

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
minerals and they come in all different

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.350 
minerals and they come in all different
colors<00:03:18.990> it's<00:03:19.560> pretty<00:03:19.860> amazing<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.730> just<00:03:21.120> how

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
colors it's pretty amazing and just how

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.280 
colors it's pretty amazing and just how
well<00:03:21.690> some<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.470> them<00:03:22.680> do<00:03:22.890> how<00:03:23.400> they<00:03:23.640> look<00:03:24.260> so<00:03:25.260> a

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
well some of them do how they look so a

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.880 
well some of them do how they look so a
common<00:03:25.710> colors<00:03:26.040> we<00:03:26.550> can<00:03:26.670> see<00:03:26.850> here<00:03:27.890> this

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
common colors we can see here this

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.970 
common colors we can see here this
column<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:30.410> what<00:03:31.410> we'll<00:03:31.530> notice<00:03:31.830> is<00:03:31.920> that

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
column and what we'll notice is that

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.890 
column and what we'll notice is that
some<00:03:32.460> minerals<00:03:32.820> have<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.030> bunch<00:03:33.360> of<00:03:33.510> different

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
some minerals have a bunch of different

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.590 
some minerals have a bunch of different
colors<00:03:34.200> so<00:03:35.100> sulfur<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.940> got<00:03:36.150> this<00:03:36.300> nice<00:03:36.570> and

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
colors so sulfur is got this nice and

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.220 
colors so sulfur is got this nice and
yellow<00:03:36.900> color<00:03:37.640> we<00:03:38.640> have<00:03:38.760> olivine<00:03:39.390> which<00:03:39.990> is

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
yellow color we have olivine which is

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.670 
yellow color we have olivine which is
green<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.490> it<00:03:41.550> is<00:03:42.180> named<00:03:42.540> after<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.959> lovely

these days amber looking colors all

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.750 
these days amber looking colors all
calcite<00:04:03.120> so<00:04:03.720> this<00:04:03.930> is<00:04:04.080> where<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:05.100> color<00:04:05.400> of<00:04:05.670> a

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
calcite so this is where the color of a

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.220 
calcite so this is where the color of a
mineral<00:04:06.000> lends<00:04:06.330> itself<00:04:06.630> to<00:04:06.720> some<00:04:06.990> issues

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.349 
about that wallboard earlier or that
drywall<00:04:18.049> calcite<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.580> quartz<00:04:20.580> these<00:04:21.030> are<00:04:21.209> all

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
drywall calcite and quartz these are all

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.420 
drywall calcite and quartz these are all
white<00:04:21.780> minerals<00:04:22.320> so<00:04:22.800> if<00:04:22.919> you're<00:04:23.070> just<00:04:23.100> going

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
white minerals so if you're just going

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.730 
white minerals so if you're just going
to<00:04:23.610> identify<00:04:23.910> mineral<00:04:24.540> on<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.900> basis<00:04:25.350> of<00:04:25.380> its

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
to identify mineral on the basis of its

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.610 
to identify mineral on the basis of its
color<00:04:26.070> along

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
color along

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.640 
color along
you<00:04:27.040> may<00:04:27.280> run<00:04:27.520> into<00:04:27.580> issues<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.290> color<00:04:31.650> of

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
you may run into issues so the color of

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:42.230 
you may run into issues so the color of
a<00:04:33.370> mineral<00:04:35.250> is<00:04:37.650> not<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:39.130> best<00:04:39.370> way<00:04:39.610> to

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.850 

identify<00:04:45.780> is<00:04:46.780> right<00:04:47.050> now<00:04:47.229> we're<00:04:47.530> looking<00:04:47.650> at

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
identify is right now we're looking at

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.189 
identify is right now we're looking at
just<00:04:47.889> four<00:04:48.340> minerals<00:04:48.729> that<00:04:48.880> are<00:04:48.940> all<00:04:49.180> white<00:04:49.510> so

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
just four minerals that are all white so

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.540 
just four minerals that are all white so
we<00:04:50.320> might<00:04:50.530> want<00:04:50.800> to<00:04:50.860> find<00:04:51.100> some<00:04:51.400> other

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
we might want to find some other

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.330 
we might want to find some other
properties<00:04:52.090> that<00:04:52.120> we<00:04:52.300> can<00:04:52.449> look<00:04:52.540> at<00:04:53.310> okay<00:04:54.310> so

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
properties that we can look at okay so

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.370 
properties that we can look at okay so
like<00:04:54.639> I<00:04:54.729> said<00:04:54.790> colors<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.690> easiest<00:04:56.229> way<00:04:56.350> to

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
like I said colors the easiest way to

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.010 
like I said colors the easiest way to
identify<00:04:56.590> minerals<00:04:57.190> but<00:04:57.610> it<00:04:57.850> is<00:04:58.000> not<00:04:58.479> the<00:04:58.810> best

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
identify minerals but it is not the best

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.400 
identify minerals but it is not the best
way<00:04:59.380> we<00:04:59.680> cannot<00:04:59.949> rely<00:05:00.310> on<00:05:00.340> color<00:05:00.729> alone<00:05:00.820> and

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
way we cannot rely on color alone and

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.810 
way we cannot rely on color alone and
some<00:05:02.410> colors<00:05:02.800> make<00:05:03.070> up<00:05:03.250> many<00:05:03.610> different

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
some colors make up many different

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.370 
some colors make up many different
minerals<00:05:05.789> streak<00:05:06.789> test<00:05:07.060> this<00:05:07.750> one<00:05:08.050> is

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
minerals streak test this one is

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.500 
minerals streak test this one is
definitely<00:05:08.680> a<00:05:08.889> little<00:05:09.070> bit<00:05:09.190> better<00:05:09.510> certain

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
definitely a little bit better certain

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.930 
definitely a little bit better certain
minerals<00:05:10.930> will<00:05:11.199> leave<00:05:11.440> behind<00:05:11.740> a<00:05:12.070> residue<00:05:12.699> on

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
minerals will leave behind a residue on

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.790 
minerals will leave behind a residue on
a<00:05:13.000> streak<00:05:13.419> plate<00:05:13.449> which<00:05:13.870> is<00:05:13.990> a<00:05:14.020> ceramic<00:05:14.410> tile

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
a streak plate which is a ceramic tile

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.150 
a streak plate which is a ceramic tile
that<00:05:15.400> will<00:05:15.520> help<00:05:15.760> us<00:05:15.880> identify<00:05:16.000> it<00:05:16.949> so<00:05:17.949> you<00:05:18.039> can

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
that will help us identify it so you can

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.100 
that will help us identify it so you can
see<00:05:18.340> here<00:05:18.760> these<00:05:19.300> two<00:05:19.570> minerals<00:05:19.810> been

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
see here these two minerals been

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.900 
see here these two minerals been
scratched<00:05:21.060> they<00:05:22.060> leave<00:05:22.360> these<00:05:22.570> marks<00:05:22.990> behind

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
scratched they leave these marks behind

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.640 
scratched they leave these marks behind
that<00:05:24.910> color<00:05:25.240> is<00:05:25.539> kind<00:05:25.810> of<00:05:25.900> like<00:05:26.020> a<00:05:26.050> signature

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
that color is kind of like a signature

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.460 
that color is kind of like a signature
to<00:05:26.919> each<00:05:27.300> different<00:05:28.300> mineral<00:05:28.630> we<00:05:28.720> test<00:05:28.990> but

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
to each different mineral we test but

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.020 
to each different mineral we test but
once<00:05:29.650> again<00:05:29.860> some<00:05:30.310> minerals<00:05:30.700> will<00:05:30.849> have<00:05:31.000> a

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
once again some minerals will have a

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.960 
once again some minerals will have a
similar<00:05:31.479> color<00:05:31.930> streak<00:05:32.550> but<00:05:33.550> it's<00:05:33.789> just

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
similar color streak but it's just

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.520 
similar color streak but it's just
another<00:05:34.210> thing<00:05:34.510> in<00:05:34.660> our<00:05:34.750> bag<00:05:34.960> of<00:05:34.990> tricks<00:05:35.110> to

another thing in our bag of tricks to
help<00:05:35.680> us<00:05:35.800> figure<00:05:35.979> it<00:05:36.190> out<00:05:37.349> okay<00:05:38.380> the<00:05:38.889> street<00:05:39.400> we

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
help us figure it out okay the street we

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.279 
help us figure it out okay the street we
can<00:05:39.940> find<00:05:40.360> in<00:05:40.599> our<00:05:40.690> distinguishing

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
can find in our distinguishing

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.219 
can find in our distinguishing
characteristic<00:05:41.860> calm<00:05:42.099> and<00:05:42.840> they'll<00:05:43.840> give<00:05:44.110> us

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
characteristic calm and they'll give us

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.800 
characteristic calm and they'll give us
a<00:05:44.349> number<00:05:44.530> of<00:05:44.680> different<00:05:45.130> streaks<00:05:46.030> if<00:05:46.300> it<00:05:46.599> does

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
a number of different streaks if it does

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.550 
a number of different streaks if it does
appear<00:05:47.229> they'll<00:05:47.440> give<00:05:47.800> us<00:05:47.919> the<00:05:48.039> color<00:05:49.110> and<00:05:50.110> if

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
appear they'll give us the color and if

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.640 
appear they'll give us the color and if
you<00:05:50.710> look<00:05:51.010> on<00:05:51.190> the<00:05:51.340> top<00:05:52.050> we<00:05:53.050> can<00:05:53.200> see<00:05:53.410> right

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
you look on the top we can see right

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.620 
you look on the top we can see right
here<00:05:54.039> it's<00:05:55.000> a<00:05:55.150> streak<00:05:55.630> or<00:05:56.440> ends<00:05:57.280> right<00:05:58.000> here<00:05:58.060> or

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
here it's a streak or ends right here or

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.070 
here it's a streak or ends right here or
red<00:05:59.169> brown<00:05:59.530> streak<00:06:00.039> so<00:06:00.910> the<00:06:01.180> hematite<00:06:01.599> so<00:06:01.930> it

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
red brown streak so the hematite so it

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.550 
red brown streak so the hematite so it
does<00:06:02.260> give<00:06:02.470> us<00:06:02.500> that<00:06:02.770> information<00:06:04.560> luster

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
does give us that information luster

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.300 
does give us that information luster
this<00:06:06.190> one<00:06:06.520> confuses<00:06:07.300> many<00:06:07.720> people<00:06:08.349> luster<00:06:09.190> is

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
this one confuses many people luster is

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.820 
this one confuses many people luster is

metallic<00:06:35.260> minerals<00:06:35.950> that<00:06:36.400> they<00:06:36.550> definitely

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
metallic minerals that they definitely

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.909 
metallic minerals that they definitely
have<00:06:37.000> a<00:06:37.030> different<00:06:37.180> Sheen<00:06:37.659> to<00:06:37.930> them<00:06:38.050> then

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
have a different Sheen to them then

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:40.269 
have a different Sheen to them then
something<00:06:39.250> that's<00:06:39.280> nonmetallic

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:40.279 
something that's nonmetallic

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:42.729 
something that's nonmetallic
we<00:06:40.699> can<00:06:40.849> take<00:06:41.089> nonmetallic<00:06:41.779> minerals<00:06:42.349> and

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:42.739 
we can take nonmetallic minerals and

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:46.149 
we can take nonmetallic minerals and
shine<00:06:43.369> them<00:06:43.639> up<00:06:43.759> but<00:06:44.509> they<00:06:44.749> do<00:06:45.439> not<00:06:45.649> have<00:06:45.679> a

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:46.159 
shine them up but they do not have a

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:50.609 
shine them up but they do not have a
metallic<00:06:46.759> luster<00:06:48.159> so<00:06:49.159> I<00:06:49.189> can<00:06:49.459> see<00:06:49.639> here<00:06:49.969> our

00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:50.619 
metallic luster so I can see here our

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:52.929 
metallic luster so I can see here our
earth<00:06:51.619> science<00:06:51.889> reference<00:06:52.099> table<00:06:52.519> is<00:06:52.609> broken

00:06:52.929 --> 00:06:52.939 
earth science reference table is broken

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:55.569 
earth science reference table is broken
up<00:06:53.149> top<00:06:53.719> and<00:06:53.929> bottom<00:06:54.289> between<00:06:54.499> nonmetallic

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:55.579 
up top and bottom between nonmetallic

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:58.329 
up top and bottom between nonmetallic
and<00:06:55.729> metallic<00:06:56.769> there's<00:06:57.769> a<00:06:57.859> dividing<00:06:58.189> line

00:06:58.329 --> 00:06:58.339 
and metallic there's a dividing line

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:01.569 
and metallic there's a dividing line
right<00:06:58.639> here<00:06:58.999> so<00:06:59.629> everything<00:06:59.989> up<00:07:00.409> is<00:07:00.979> metallic

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:01.579 
right here so everything up is metallic

00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:05.199 
right here so everything up is metallic
everything<00:07:02.089> down<00:07:02.299> nonmetallic<00:07:04.119> we<00:07:05.119> have

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:05.209 
everything down nonmetallic we have

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:08.739 
everything down nonmetallic we have
shiny<00:07:05.569> versus<00:07:06.109> dull<00:07:07.239> so<00:07:08.239> we<00:07:08.329> can<00:07:08.479> have<00:07:08.569> a<00:07:08.599> nice

00:07:08.739 --> 00:07:08.749 
shiny versus dull so we can have a nice

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:15.519 
shiny versus dull so we can have a nice
shiny<00:07:08.989> luster<00:07:09.529> here<00:07:09.799> or<00:07:09.949> dull<00:07:14.199> alright<00:07:15.199> ladies

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:15.529 
shiny luster here or dull alright ladies

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:17.769 
shiny luster here or dull alright ladies
and<00:07:15.819> gentlemen<00:07:16.819> we're<00:07:17.119> gonna<00:07:17.329> take<00:07:17.569> a<00:07:17.599> little

and gentlemen we're gonna take a little

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:19.749 
and gentlemen we're gonna take a little
break<00:07:18.049> here<00:07:18.499> before<00:07:19.129> we<00:07:19.219> get<00:07:19.309> into<00:07:19.489> the<00:07:19.579> Mohs

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 
break here before we get into the Mohs

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.189 
break here before we get into the Mohs
hardness<00:07:20.089> scale<00:07:20.329> this<00:07:20.659> is<00:07:20.839> uh<00:07:20.869> pretty

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 
hardness scale this is uh pretty

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:22.509 
hardness scale this is uh pretty
important<00:07:21.679> so<00:07:21.769> we'll<00:07:21.860> probably<00:07:21.979> dedicate<00:07:22.489> a

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:22.519 
important so we'll probably dedicate a

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:23.679 
important so we'll probably dedicate a

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:26.229 
little screencast to this one alone
that's<00:07:24.559> about<00:07:24.799> it<00:07:24.979> hope<00:07:25.309> you<00:07:25.489> enjoyed<00:07:25.759> it<00:07:25.939> take
