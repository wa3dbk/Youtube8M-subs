00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
you can twist the base we can have it up

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.440 
you can twist the base we can have it up
that<00:02:35.950> way<00:02:36.160> or<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.550> can<00:02:36.670> have<00:02:36.819> it<00:02:36.940> that<00:02:36.970> way<00:02:37.270> if

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
that way or you can have it that way if

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.110 
that way or you can have it that way if
you<00:02:37.569> have<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:37.989> way<00:02:38.170> usually<00:02:39.010> cut<00:02:39.520> off<00:02:39.730> or

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
you have it that way usually cut off or

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.050 
you have it that way usually cut off or
crate<00:02:40.450> or<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:41.319> can<00:02:41.530> flip<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:42.010> base<00:02:42.220> if<00:02:42.910> you

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
crate or you can flip the base if you

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.910 
crate or you can flip the base if you
play<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.450> way<00:02:43.510> but<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:43.989> push<00:02:44.230> it<00:02:44.410> forward

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
play it that way but you push it forward

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.250 
play it that way but you push it forward
so<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.790> is<00:02:45.970> where<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.300> dual<00:02:46.569> action

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
so that is where the dual action

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.170 
so that is where the dual action
crumbs<00:02:47.769> from<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.190> let's<00:02:48.340> haven't<00:02:48.730> have<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:48.940> look

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
crumbs from so let's haven't have a look

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.130 
crumbs from so let's haven't have a look
at<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:50.550> figures<00:02:51.550> that<00:02:51.580> we<00:02:51.760> have<00:02:52.090> in<00:02:52.420> this<00:02:52.810> set

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
at the figures that we have in this set

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.830 
at the figures that we have in this set
we<00:02:53.260> have<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.470> max<00:02:53.890> crunch<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:55.269> here<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.599> max

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
we have a max crunch so here is max

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.100 
we have a max crunch so here is max
crunches<00:02:56.380> base<00:02:56.709> we<00:02:57.310> do<00:02:57.459> get<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.730> points<00:02:58.239> on

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
crunches base we do get the points on

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.210 
crunches base we do get the points on
the<00:02:59.380> base<00:02:59.560> as<00:02:59.890> well<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:00.519> these<00:03:01.450> do<00:03:01.930> slot<00:03:02.350> into

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
the base as well and these do slot into

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.860 
the base as well and these do slot into
the<00:03:03.489> base<00:03:03.640> looks<00:03:03.910> like<00:03:04.090> he's<00:03:04.269> holding<00:03:04.480> a

the base looks like he's holding a
alloys<00:03:05.319> over<00:03:05.650> there<00:03:05.860> but<00:03:06.130> this<00:03:06.280> isn't<00:03:06.489> a

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
alloys over there but this isn't a

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.860 
alloys over there but this isn't a
pretty<00:03:07.980> funky<00:03:08.980> looking<00:03:09.519> character<00:03:09.970> one<00:03:10.840> of

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
slot it into the base there and twist

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.620 
slot it into the base there and twist
and<00:03:18.819> then<00:03:19.420> they<00:03:19.599> are<00:03:19.750> ready<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.500> go<00:03:20.890> so<00:03:21.420> next<00:03:22.420> we

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
base on the green base and here is the

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.720 
base on the green base and here is the
blue<00:03:30.549> toy<00:03:30.760> figure<00:03:31.440> he's<00:03:32.440> one<00:03:32.650> call<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.250> locking

so now all you have to do is click that
into<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.709> base<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.480> twist<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:47.410> is<00:03:47.620> all

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
into the base and twist and it is all

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.080 
into the base and twist and it is all
ready<00:03:48.130> to<00:03:48.549> go

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
ready to go

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.330

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
so when you are playing the game what

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.250 
so when you are playing the game what
you<00:03:51.370> have<00:03:51.579> to<00:03:51.700> do<00:03:51.850> is<00:03:52.030> take<00:03:52.269> the<00:03:52.420> crate<00:03:52.750> or<00:03:52.989> and

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
you have to do is take the crate or and

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.490 
you have to do is take the crate or and
push<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.400> on<00:03:54.639> the<00:03:54.760> back<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.569> push<00:03:55.780> your<00:03:56.019> figure

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
push it on the back to push your figure

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.160 
push it on the back to push your figure
forward<00:03:56.980> or<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:57.700> can<00:03:57.940> interchange<00:03:58.299> for<00:03:59.019> the

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
forward or you can interchange for the

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.090 
forward or you can interchange for the
dual<00:03:59.530> action<00:03:59.889> mode<00:04:00.700> and<00:04:01.269> you<00:04:02.170> clip<00:04:02.530> it<00:04:02.560> in<00:04:02.859> and

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
dual action mode and you clip it in and

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.210 
dual action mode and you clip it in and
they<00:04:03.370> do<00:04:03.430> sit<00:04:03.970> on<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.690> other<00:04:04.720> side<00:04:05.049> as<00:04:05.889> well

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
they do sit on the other side as well

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.120 
they do sit on the other side as well
and<00:04:06.430> then<00:04:07.060> you<00:04:07.480> can<00:04:07.720> flip<00:04:07.989> them<00:04:08.319> like<00:04:08.590> this<00:04:08.829> so

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
and then you can flip them like this so
