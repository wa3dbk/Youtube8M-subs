it gets kind of nasty but nothing like
the<00:01:10.700> horror<00:01:11.030> that<00:01:11.390> you'll<00:01:11.570> find<00:01:11.869> inside<00:01:12.350> the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
the horror that you'll find inside the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.109

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:40.430 

seats<00:02:28.600> do<00:02:28.780> fold<00:02:28.810> down

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.710 

and<00:02:41.010> third<00:02:41.370> row<00:02:41.550> seat<00:02:41.820> also<00:02:42.240> folds<00:02:42.570> down

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
electrically with these buttons right

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.050 
electrically with these buttons right
here

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.589 

these<00:02:50.720> high<00:02:50.840> dress<00:02:51.080> also<00:02:52.030> fold<00:02:53.030> down<00:02:53.120> so<00:02:53.510> they

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
these high dress also fold down so they

00:02:53.599 --> 00:03:01.290 
these high dress also fold down so they
don't<00:02:53.630> block<00:02:53.870> your<00:02:53.930> view

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:24.120 

little<00:03:02.300> compartment<00:03:02.870> there

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:55.750 

5.48

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.820 

as<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:58.010> 25

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.030 

a<00:04:02.860> little<00:04:03.190> bit<00:04:03.310> over<00:04:03.520> 25

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
a little bit over 25

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.089 
a little bit over 25

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.380 

so<00:04:09.430> when<00:04:09.610> you're<00:04:09.730> floored<00:04:10.000> you<00:04:10.090> can<00:04:10.239> get<00:04:10.360> a

so when you're floored you can get a

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.790 
so when you're floored you can get a
little<00:04:10.540> bit<00:04:10.719> past<00:04:10.930> it<00:04:11.140> but<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.379> goes<00:04:11.500> back<00:04:11.680> down

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:40.570 

I<00:04:15.660> can<00:04:16.660> squeeze<00:04:16.810> in<00:04:16.959> a<00:04:17.049> quick<00:04:17.230> exhaust<00:04:17.650> clip
