00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.219 

the<00:01:41.030> prediction<00:01:41.570> that<00:01:41.600> two<00:01:41.869> people<00:01:41.990> can

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.330 
happen without
and<00:01:45.540> ultimately<00:01:45.750> when<00:01:46.500> they<00:01:46.650> do<00:01:46.710> figure<00:01:47.190> out

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
and ultimately when they do figure out

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.859 
and ultimately when they do figure out
who<00:01:47.670> they<00:01:47.880> are<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.180> what<00:01:48.330> they<00:01:48.510> want<00:01:48.659> from

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
who they are and what they want from

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.950 
who they are and what they want from
life<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:50.060> basically<00:01:51.060> what<00:01:51.270> brings<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:51.780> two

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
life is basically what brings the two

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:03.480 
life is basically what brings the two
pieces<00:01:52.170> together

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:12.880
