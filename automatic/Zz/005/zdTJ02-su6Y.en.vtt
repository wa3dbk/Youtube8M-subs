00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.330
 talking about food 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.189
 what makes a bread with butter 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.189
 Here I tell you for free 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.750
 in adults they are always complaining 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.660
 for all my dad last night he complained 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.960
 because we had raised the rent and now 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.860
 it was not enough to pay the bills 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.040
 my mom my mom cried 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.619
 my brothers and I observed them from 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.930
 the stairs always complained about 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.990
 our poverty and our shortcomings 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.670
 I do not see that we lack anything we have a 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:46.970
 house a bed water and food said my 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.300
 brother which is true answered my 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.730
 easy white sister convinced of 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.100
 have the reason we went to the 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.120
 room we climbed the three to 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.340
 our only bed and we went to bed 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.150
 cold dry nothing through the cracks of the 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.460
 wooden walls but thank god 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.610
 together we warm each other up 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.250
 that was the good thing after it started raining 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.250
 and we had to put containers where 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.009
 the bottles were falling but thank god 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.280
 there were no leaks on our bed and 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.680
 that was good too 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.980
 the next morning we went down to 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.230
 have breakfast 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.080
 mom said there was only bread with 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.200
 butter she looked at me sadly 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.280
 and I asked him why are you sad 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.490
 mom because I would like to have something else for 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.430
 give them breakfast but if I 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.910
 love bread with butter mom she 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.060
 I smile sweetly and I ate it until 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.160
 the last crumb we went to school 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.350
 and we went through a puddle that had 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.780
 stayed out of the rain and we got the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.510
 water in our broken shoes that we 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.870
 we laughed nonchalantly and followed 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.760
 our way in the recess all the 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.630
 other children brought their fruits and 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:14.110
 sandwiches to eat us 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.060
 We did not have anything but what good because 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.610
 so we would be more hungry when we get to the 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.150
 house that we would eat all that mom 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.570
 we would leave school and we 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.620
 we went running home we had a lot 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.200
 hungry 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.170
 We come straight to the table after 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.570
 wash our hands mom then we 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.290
 said very sad that all he had 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.430
 to eat was bread with butter 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.909
 what a rich mom we said my brothers and I 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.620
 here we ate it happy and happy 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:50.349
 after we did the homework we left 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.140
 to play we had a lot of fun imagining 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.780
 that the puddles were great seas and the 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.439
 mud mountains that we climbed and lowered 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.260
 With ease came the time for dinner and 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:05.470
 I could see that mom cried when she served us 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.639
 bread with butter again 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.139
 so I said mom, do not be sad if 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.780
 we like bread with 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:16.269
 butter that my brothers nodded 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.299
 and tonight we ate our bread with 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.599
 butter with more desire than ever for 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:25.299
 that she could see how happy we were 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.700
 then after we went to bed and 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.159
 We thank God for that day as 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.840
 great and for the delicious bread with 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:35.230
 Butter 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.769
 whoever wants life as a child would 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.209
 less unhappy people on the planet 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.180
 we are immersed in a world so 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.709
 materialist that we are not happy if we do not 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.430
 we have what is announced in the 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.980
 TV 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.110
 we want to have the latest clothes 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.530
 we want last model car 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:57.370
 we want to have the latest technology 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:00.250
 greed we long for envy and we do not 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.090
 we give ourselves time to live and enjoy 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.280
 it really worth 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.310
 let's rediscover that joy of life of the 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.980
 childhood enjoying everything that God 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.040
 gives without thinking about what they have 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.639
 others learn to take only the good 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.639
 of life and savor it with that only 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.750
 let's have bread and butter to eat 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.610
 to us to turn it around 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.120
 a delicacy 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.160
 and raul 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.020
 not just fun 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.020
 It also makes you think
