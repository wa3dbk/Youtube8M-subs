hi<00:00:01.050> guys<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.680> Pokemon<00:00:02.250> Academy<00:00:02.669> here

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
hi guys this is Pokemon Academy here

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.840 
hi guys this is Pokemon Academy here
with<00:00:03.629> our<00:00:03.929> video<00:00:04.230> an<00:00:04.680> introduction<00:00:05.250> video<00:00:05.370> on

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
with our video an introduction video on

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.650 
with our video an introduction video on
what<00:00:06.569> are<00:00:06.810> individual<00:00:07.799> values<00:00:08.660> individual

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
what are individual values individual

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.959 
what are individual values individual
values<00:00:10.080> are<00:00:10.349> one<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.070> two<00:00:11.280> sets<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.700> hidden

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
values are one of two sets of hidden

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.600 
values are one of two sets of hidden
numbers<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:13.259> Pokemon<00:00:13.620> game<00:00:13.920> that

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
numbers in the Pokemon game that

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.970 
numbers in the Pokemon game that
influence<00:00:15.480> how<00:00:15.660> strong<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.139> Pokemon<00:00:16.800> will

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
influence how strong that Pokemon will

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.210 
influence how strong that Pokemon will
be<00:00:17.510> it's<00:00:18.510> pretty<00:00:18.750> important<00:00:19.230> for<00:00:19.680> competitive

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
be it's pretty important for competitive

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.179 
be it's pretty important for competitive
battling<00:00:20.760> because<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:22.199> really<00:00:22.470> want<00:00:22.500> maximum

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
battling because you really want maximum

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.529 
battling because you really want maximum
individual<00:00:23.640> values<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.210> each<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.480> your

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
individual values on each of your

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.910 
individual values on each of your
Pokemon<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.199> that'll<00:00:25.439> make<00:00:25.560> sense<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.859> a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
Pokemon and that'll make sense in a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.790 
Pokemon and that'll make sense in a
little<00:00:26.099> bit<00:00:26.630> because<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.900> just<00:00:28.380> makes<00:00:28.590> your

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
little bit because it just makes your

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.519 
little bit because it just makes your
Pokemon<00:00:29.130> inherently<00:00:29.730> stronger<00:00:30.269> faster<00:00:30.660> take

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
Pokemon inherently stronger faster take

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.580 
Pokemon inherently stronger faster take
more<00:00:31.740> hits<00:00:31.769> than<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.460> different<00:00:32.850> Pokemon<00:00:33.210> and

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
more hits than a different Pokemon and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.130 
more hits than a different Pokemon and
so<00:00:34.590> if<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.430> had<00:00:35.579> one<00:00:35.610> Caterpie<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.450> really

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
so if you had one Caterpie with really

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.650 
so if you had one Caterpie with really
terrible<00:00:37.469> IVs<00:00:37.969> versus<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> different<00:00:39.120> Caterpie

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
terrible IVs versus a different Caterpie

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.330 
terrible IVs versus a different Caterpie
with<00:00:39.780> really<00:00:40.020> good<00:00:40.110> IVs<00:00:40.469> even<00:00:40.890> if<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.250> know

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
with really good IVs even if you know

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.619 
with really good IVs even if you know
you<00:00:41.430> hadn't<00:00:41.940> trained<00:00:42.120> any<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.390> them<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
you hadn't trained any of them the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.360 
you hadn't trained any of them the
wallet<00:00:42.780> better<00:00:43.110> IVs<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.649> gonna<00:00:43.770> win<00:00:44.040> it's

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
wallet better IVs it's gonna win it's

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.040 
wallet better IVs it's gonna win it's
gonna<00:00:44.460> be<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:45.000> gonna<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.180> attacking<00:00:45.780> first

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
gonna be it's gonna be attacking first

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.020 
gonna be it's gonna be attacking first
it's<00:00:46.260> gonna<00:00:46.350> be<00:00:46.440> doing<00:00:46.620> more<00:00:46.770> damage<00:00:47.030> and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
it's gonna be doing more damage and

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.450 
it's gonna be doing more damage and
you'll<00:00:48.360> see<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.260> couple<00:00:49.410> slides<00:00:49.620> so

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
you'll see that in a couple slides so

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.170 
you'll see that in a couple slides so
let's<00:00:51.360> get<00:00:51.510> into<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> tutorial<00:00:53.180> individual

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
let's get into the tutorial individual

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.959 
let's get into the tutorial individual
values<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:55.350> lot<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.860> people<00:00:56.070> call<00:00:56.219> them<00:00:56.370> IVs

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
values a lot of people call them IVs

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.410 
values a lot of people call them IVs
because<00:00:57.390> yeah<00:00:57.690> individual<00:00:58.199> value<00:00:59.420> individual

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
because yeah individual value individual

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.779 
because yeah individual value individual
values<00:01:00.719> are<00:01:00.870> invisible<00:01:01.410> numbers<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.370> affect

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
values are invisible numbers that affect

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.660 
values are invisible numbers that affect
the<00:01:03.090> base<00:01:03.510> stats<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.170> Pokemon<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:05.070> makes<00:01:05.369> a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the base stats of Pokemon it makes a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.880 
the base stats of Pokemon it makes a
Pokemon<00:01:06.360> inherently<00:01:06.840> stronger<00:01:07.290> than<00:01:07.500> another

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
Pokemon inherently stronger than another

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.190 
Pokemon inherently stronger than another
one<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.310> same<00:01:08.490> species<00:01:09.080> because<00:01:10.080> of

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
one with the same species because of

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.020 
one with the same species because of
these<00:01:10.320> invisible<00:01:10.560> numbers<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.340> each<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
these invisible numbers on each of the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.840 
these invisible numbers on each of the
stats<00:01:12.920> okay<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.250> might<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.580> little<00:01:14.670> bit

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
stats okay that might be a little bit

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.370 
stats okay that might be a little bit
confusing<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.570> got<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.869> know<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:15.990> first

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
confusing but you got to know that first

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.140 
confusing but you got to know that first
and<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:17.159> really<00:01:17.400> not<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.549> hard<00:01:17.700> it's

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
and it's really not that hard it's

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.830 
and it's really not that hard it's
pretty<00:01:18.540> much<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.750> basic<00:01:19.200> basic<00:01:19.770> arithmetic

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
pretty much just basic basic arithmetic

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.429 
pretty much just basic basic arithmetic
and<00:01:21.840> I'll<00:01:22.140> show<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.380> how<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.340> what<00:01:23.670> IVs<00:01:24.060> are

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
and I'll show you how so what IVs are

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.530 
and I'll show you how so what IVs are
they<00:01:25.439> are<00:01:25.680> once<00:01:25.950> again<00:01:26.040> invisible<00:01:26.790> numbers

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
they are once again invisible numbers

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.870 
they are once again invisible numbers
attributed<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.380> each<00:01:28.530> stat<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.250> pokemon<00:01:29.700> has

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
attributed to each stat a pokemon has

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.270 
attributed to each stat a pokemon has
each<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.869> those<00:01:31.079> six<00:01:31.350> stats<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.770> Pokemon<00:01:32.130> has

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
each of those six stats the Pokemon has

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.850 
each of those six stats the Pokemon has
has<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.909> these<00:01:33.000> numbers<00:01:33.740> attributed<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
has one of these numbers attributed to

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.280 
has one of these numbers attributed to
it<00:01:34.979> now<00:01:35.970> each<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.180> these<00:01:36.360> numbers<00:01:36.540> range<00:01:37.110> in

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
it now each of these numbers range in

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.340 
it now each of these numbers range in
value<00:01:37.650> from<00:01:37.829> 0<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.340> 31<00:01:39.079> still<00:01:40.079> might<00:01:40.229> be<00:01:40.259> a

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
value from 0 to 31 still might be a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.690 
value from 0 to 31 still might be a
little<00:01:40.439> bit<00:01:40.590> confusing<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.159> trust<00:01:41.460> me<00:01:41.520> it's

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
little bit confusing but trust me it's

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.780 
little bit confusing but trust me it's
gonna<00:01:41.790> clear<00:01:42.119> up<00:01:42.150> right<00:01:42.659> now<00:01:43.130> ok<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.610> have

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
gonna clear up right now ok so you have

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
gonna clear up right now ok so you have

it<00:01:58.439> could<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.799> like<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> 7<00:01:59.430> an<00:01:59.520> HP<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.329> 31<00:02:01.320> an

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
it could have like a 7 an HP a 31 an

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.850 
it could have like a 7 an HP a 31 an
attack<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:02.130> 6<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.820> defense<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.600> 22<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.530> special

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
attack a 6 in defense a 22 and special

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.190 
attack a 6 in defense a 22 and special
attack<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.909> will<00:02:06.180> influence<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.869> into

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
attack and that will influence that into

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.710 
attack and that will influence that into
you<00:02:07.380> know<00:02:07.500> that's<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.360> individually<00:02:09.360> now

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
you know that's that individually now

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.100 
you know that's that individually now
they<00:02:09.899> aren't<00:02:10.050> correlated<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.709> one<00:02:10.860> another<00:02:11.099> so

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
they aren't correlated to one another so

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.850 
they aren't correlated to one another so
when<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.200> catch<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.590> they<00:02:13.680> can

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
when you catch it they can

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.920 
when you catch it they can
be<00:02:13.920> all<00:02:14.070> over<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.460> place<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.720> higher<00:02:15.900> it

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
be all over the place and the higher it

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.650 
be all over the place and the higher it
is<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.440> stronger<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.210> so<00:02:18.210> one<00:02:18.510> more<00:02:18.630> time

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
is the stronger it is so one more time

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.780 
is the stronger it is so one more time
what<00:02:19.020> IVs<00:02:19.320> are<00:02:19.560> they're<00:02:19.890> independent<00:02:20.580> from

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
what IVs are they're independent from

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.610 
what IVs are they're independent from
one<00:02:20.940> another<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.750> they're<00:02:21.930> not<00:02:22.020> influenced

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
one another so they're not influenced

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.740 
one another so they're not influenced
you<00:02:22.920> know<00:02:23.040> by<00:02:23.190> each<00:02:23.310> other<00:02:23.550> they<00:02:24.300> cannot<00:02:24.570> be

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
you know by each other they cannot be

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.630 
you know by each other they cannot be
changed<00:02:25.050> or<00:02:25.380> influenced<00:02:25.920> once<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.280> Pokemon

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
changed or influenced once the Pokemon

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.090 
changed or influenced once the Pokemon
is<00:02:26.760> generated<00:02:27.540> that's<00:02:28.440> pretty<00:02:28.680> important

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
is generated that's pretty important

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.190 
is generated that's pretty important
because<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.820> have<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.210> do<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.420> little<00:02:30.780> work<00:02:31.020> on

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
because you have to do a little work on

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.520 
because you have to do a little work on
the<00:02:31.770> front<00:02:32.700> end<00:02:32.940> before<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.690> go<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.170> get

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
the front end before you go and you get

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.080 
the front end before you go and you get
the<00:02:34.650> before<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.220> pokemons<00:02:35.520> generated<00:02:35.940> in

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
the before the pokemons generated in

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.500 
the before the pokemons generated in
order<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.630> capture<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.280> perfectly<00:02:38.280> which<00:02:38.820> I'll

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
order to capture it perfectly which I'll

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.940 
order to capture it perfectly which I'll
talk<00:02:39.810> about<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:40.080> little<00:02:40.110> bit<00:02:40.260> later<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:40.800> is

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
talk about a little bit later but is

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.170 
talk about a little bit later but is
mostly<00:02:41.310> for<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.520> different<00:02:41.760> video<00:02:41.820> because

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
mostly for a different video because

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.110 
mostly for a different video because
it's<00:02:42.300> pretty<00:02:42.450> difficult<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:44.130> at<00:02:44.459> level<00:02:44.790> 100

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
it's pretty difficult and at level 100

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.760 
it's pretty difficult and at level 100
each<00:02:45.959> single<00:02:46.620> IV<00:02:47.160> point<00:02:47.550> in<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.180> stat<00:02:48.770> equates

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
each single IV point in a stat equates

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.610 
each single IV point in a stat equates
to<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.160> step<00:02:50.459> being<00:02:50.790> one<00:02:51.450> point<00:02:51.810> higher<00:02:52.050> than

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
to that step being one point higher than

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.920 
to that step being one point higher than
it<00:02:52.739> would<00:02:52.860> be<00:02:52.920> otherwise

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
it would be otherwise

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.520 
it would be otherwise
so<00:02:54.930> one<00:02:55.290> IV<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.860> HP<00:02:56.330> makes<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:57.570> HP<00:02:58.020> stat<00:02:58.290> one

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
so one IV and HP makes that HP stat one

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.800 
so one IV and HP makes that HP stat one
point<00:02:58.770> higher<00:02:58.920> than<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.280> would<00:02:59.400> be<00:02:59.780> by<00:03:00.780> the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
point higher than it would be by the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.930 
point higher than it would be by the
time<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.320> gets<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.500> level<00:03:01.739> 100<00:03:01.860> then<00:03:02.250> something

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
time it gets to level 100 then something

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.540 
time it gets to level 100 then something
that<00:03:03.060> had<00:03:03.209> 0<00:03:03.570> HP<00:03:03.900> IVs<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.709> know<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.430> the

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
that had 0 HP IVs you know this of the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.920 
that had 0 HP IVs you know this of the
same<00:03:05.670> Pokemon<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.180> course<00:03:06.390> because<00:03:06.630> different

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
same Pokemon of course because different

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.770 
same Pokemon of course because different
Pokemon<00:03:07.320> have<00:03:07.470> different<00:03:07.739> base<00:03:07.890> stats<00:03:08.780> dad

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
Pokemon have different base stats dad

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.540 
Pokemon have different base stats dad
the<00:03:10.230> best<00:03:10.560> way<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.830> show<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.130> what<00:03:11.400> this

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
the best way to show you what this

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.490 
the best way to show you what this
really<00:03:11.760> means<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.180> through<00:03:12.360> an<00:03:12.450> example<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:13.470> I

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
really means is through an example so I

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.160 
really means is through an example so I
got<00:03:13.709> this<00:03:13.800> cool<00:03:14.010> example<00:03:14.520> thing<00:03:14.700> going<00:03:15.090> on<00:03:15.239> we

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
got this cool example thing going on we

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.430 
got this cool example thing going on we
have<00:03:16.290> three<00:03:16.440> caterpie's<00:03:16.890> all<00:03:17.820> at<00:03:18.030> level<00:03:18.269> 100

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
have three caterpie's all at level 100

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.470 
have three caterpie's all at level 100
and<00:03:19.440> just<00:03:19.799> for<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.459> sake<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.700> ease<00:03:21.000> pretend

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
and just for the sake of ease pretend

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.020 
and just for the sake of ease pretend
that<00:03:21.959> they<00:03:22.200> were<00:03:22.260> all<00:03:22.500> just<00:03:22.980> leveled<00:03:23.640> up<00:03:23.790> to

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
that they were all just leveled up to

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.300 
that they were all just leveled up to
level<00:03:24.360> hundred<00:03:24.780> using<00:03:25.049> rare<00:03:25.200> candy

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
level hundred using rare candy

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.550 
level hundred using rare candy
that<00:03:26.549> way<00:03:26.730> we<00:03:26.940> can<00:03:27.120> ignore<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:28.170> effects<00:03:28.440> of

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
that way we can ignore the effects of

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.900 
that way we can ignore the effects of
effort<00:03:28.890> values<00:03:29.280> if<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.459> don't<00:03:29.700> know<00:03:29.790> where

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
effort values if you don't know where

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.670 
effort values if you don't know where
that<00:03:30.000> is<00:03:30.180> don't<00:03:30.330> worry<00:03:30.570> about<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.989> it<00:03:31.500> actually

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
that is don't worry about it it actually

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.570 
that is don't worry about it it actually
clearer<00:03:32.370> for<00:03:32.549> you<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:33.660> we<00:03:34.410> just<00:03:34.650> leveled<00:03:35.489> these

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
clearer for you so we just leveled these

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.920 
clearer for you so we just leveled these
caterpie's<00:03:35.970> up<00:03:36.120> all<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.450> way<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.600> level<00:03:36.720> 100

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
caterpie's up all the way to level 100

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.990 
caterpie's up all the way to level 100
using<00:03:37.320> rare<00:03:37.470> candies<00:03:37.799> so<00:03:38.580> let's<00:03:38.760> say<00:03:38.880> we

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
using rare candies so let's say we

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.180 
using rare candies so let's say we
caught<00:03:39.209> we<00:03:39.540> have<00:03:39.630> quatre<00:03:39.840> PA<00:03:40.049> and<00:03:40.440> it's<00:03:40.830> IVs

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
caught we have quatre PA and it's IVs

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.020 
caught we have quatre PA and it's IVs
are<00:03:41.489> zeros<00:03:42.360> across<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.840> board<00:03:43.700> this<00:03:44.700> is<00:03:44.910> the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
are zeros across the board this is the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.300

effort<00:03:50.880> value<00:03:51.209> so<00:03:51.390> if<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.570> just<00:03:51.720> leveled<00:03:52.019> it

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
effort value so if you just leveled it

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.130 
effort value so if you just leveled it
up<00:03:52.200> with<00:03:52.320> your<00:03:52.470> candy<00:03:52.799> a<00:03:53.810> Caterpie<00:03:54.810> stats

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
up with your candy a Caterpie stats

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.920 
up with your candy a Caterpie stats
that's<00:03:55.620> what<00:03:55.890> it's<00:03:56.010> gonna<00:03:56.100> be<00:03:56.220> at<00:03:56.630> due<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.810> the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
that's what it's gonna be at due to the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.070 
that's what it's gonna be at due to the
zero<00:03:58.200> IVs<00:03:58.940> okay<00:03:59.940> let's<00:04:00.299> say<00:04:00.450> we<00:04:00.630> did<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.900> same

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
zero IVs okay let's say we did the same

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.539 
zero IVs okay let's say we did the same
exact<00:04:01.410> thing<00:04:01.530> with<00:04:01.560> Caterpie<00:04:02.040> B<00:04:02.190> we<00:04:02.370> just

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
exact thing with Caterpie B we just

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:03.860 
exact thing with Caterpie B we just
leveled<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:02.940> up<00:04:03.060> all<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.299> way<00:04:03.420> with<00:04:03.720> rare

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
leveled it up all the way with rare

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.340 
leveled it up all the way with rare
candies<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:05.510> these<00:04:06.510> are<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.780> stats<00:04:07.049> that<00:04:07.170> it

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
candies and these are the stats that it

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.130 
candies and these are the stats that it
has<00:04:07.500> inherently<00:04:07.950> okay<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.239> couple<00:04:09.690> similar

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
has inherently okay so a couple similar

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.750 
has inherently okay so a couple similar
numbers<00:04:10.470> here<00:04:10.650> you're<00:04:11.310> gonna<00:04:11.400> see<00:04:11.549> how<00:04:11.640> that

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
numbers here you're gonna see how that

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.210 
numbers here you're gonna see how that
affects<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.120> scatter<00:04:12.420> P<00:04:12.860> let's<00:04:13.860> just<00:04:14.040> take<00:04:14.190> a

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
affects the scatter P let's just take a

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.219 
affects the scatter P let's just take a
look<00:04:14.400> at<00:04:14.549> this<00:04:14.610> HP<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:15.090> attack<00:04:15.329> me<00:04:15.600> both<00:04:15.780> both

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
look at this HP and attack me both both

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.800 
look at this HP and attack me both both
of<00:04:16.380> these<00:04:16.470> guys<00:04:16.680> have<00:04:16.739> zero<00:04:17.190> IVs<00:04:17.579> okay<00:04:18.299> so<00:04:18.720> it

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
of these guys have zero IVs okay so it

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.000 
of these guys have zero IVs okay so it
makes<00:04:18.959> sense<00:04:19.019> that<00:04:19.200> their<00:04:19.380> stats<00:04:19.590> are<00:04:19.709> exactly

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
makes sense that their stats are exactly

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.400 
makes sense that their stats are exactly
the<00:04:20.160> same<00:04:20.190> even<00:04:20.970> though<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:22.080> rest<00:04:22.229> of<00:04:22.349> the

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
this that's how big on the numbers just

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.800 
this that's how big on the numbers just
come<00:05:01.620> with<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.800> stats<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:03.300> has<00:05:03.420> one<00:05:03.630> point

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
come with the stats and it has one point

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.450 
come with the stats and it has one point
higher<00:05:04.050> in<00:05:04.320> defense<00:05:04.650> and<00:05:04.770> then<00:05:04.950> Caterpie<00:05:05.430> a

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
higher in defense and then Caterpie a

higher in defense and then Caterpie a
does<00:05:06.560> see<00:05:07.560> just<00:05:07.890> one<00:05:08.130> point<00:05:08.340> gives<00:05:08.640> you<00:05:08.760> one

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
does see just one point gives you one

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.400 
does see just one point gives you one
extra<00:05:09.150> point<00:05:09.450> by<00:05:09.570> the<00:05:09.660> time<00:05:09.750> you<00:05:09.990> get<00:05:10.080> level

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
extra point by the time you get level

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.170 
extra point by the time you get level
100<00:05:10.770> special<00:05:11.610> attack<00:05:12.090> now<00:05:12.500> look<00:05:13.500> from<00:05:13.830> 0<00:05:14.100> at<00:05:14.610> 45

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
100 special attack now look from 0 at 45

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.450 
100 special attack now look from 0 at 45
the<00:05:15.840> two<00:05:16.050> IVs<00:05:16.380> get<00:05:16.650> you<00:05:16.740> 247

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
the two IVs get you 247

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.980 
the two IVs get you 247
pretty<00:05:17.910> simple<00:05:18.300> it's<00:05:18.420> just<00:05:18.450> pretty<00:05:18.900> much

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
pretty simple it's just pretty much

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.110 
pretty simple it's just pretty much
basic<00:05:19.500> arithmetic<00:05:19.950> here<00:05:20.190> you<00:05:20.730> can<00:05:20.880> just<00:05:21.030> look

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
basic arithmetic here you can just look

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.640 
basic arithmetic here you can just look
at<00:05:21.270> special<00:05:21.600> defense<00:05:21.840> and<00:05:22.050> speed<00:05:22.200> if<00:05:22.350> you<00:05:22.380> want

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
at special defense and speed if you want

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.440 
at special defense and speed if you want
so<00:05:22.860> it's<00:05:23.640> just<00:05:23.790> it's<00:05:24.090> a<00:05:24.120> one-for-one

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
so it's just it's a one-for-one

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.600 
so it's just it's a one-for-one
correlation<00:05:25.050> by<00:05:25.680> the<00:05:25.800> time<00:05:26.070> you<00:05:26.160> get<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.310> level

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
correlation by the time you get to level

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.180 
correlation by the time you get to level
100<00:05:26.760> you<00:05:27.180> can<00:05:28.020> see<00:05:28.230> the<00:05:28.380> effects<00:05:28.710> a<00:05:28.890> little<00:05:29.100> bit

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
100 you can see the effects a little bit

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.590 
100 you can see the effects a little bit
earlier<00:05:29.520> like<00:05:29.820> you<00:05:29.970> see<00:05:30.150> them<00:05:30.270> as<00:05:30.420> you're

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
earlier like you see them as you're

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.270 
earlier like you see them as you're
going<00:05:30.750> on<00:05:30.960> but<00:05:31.170> you<00:05:31.230> don't<00:05:31.410> realize<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:32.010> full

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
going on but you don't realize the full

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.980 
going on but you don't realize the full
effects<00:05:32.700> until<00:05:33.090> you<00:05:33.180> love<00:05:33.390> you<00:05:33.660> hit<00:05:33.870> level

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
effects until you love you hit level

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.740 
effects until you love you hit level
hundred<00:05:34.410> so<00:05:34.560> it'll<00:05:34.830> matter<00:05:34.980> a<00:05:35.340> level<00:05:36.030> fifty

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
hundred so it'll matter a level fifty

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.330 
hundred so it'll matter a level fifty
Caterpie<00:05:37.200> with<00:05:37.380> perfect<00:05:37.770> IVs<00:05:38.010> will<00:05:38.220> be

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
Caterpie with perfect IVs will be

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.100 
Caterpie with perfect IVs will be
substantially<00:05:38.940> higher<00:05:39.120> than<00:05:39.360> you<00:05:39.720> know<00:05:39.870> level

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
substantially higher than you know level

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.530 
substantially higher than you know level
fifty<00:05:40.290> Caterpie<00:05:40.590> without<00:05:40.800> any<00:05:40.980> IVs<00:05:41.340> but<00:05:41.760> you

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
fifty Caterpie without any IVs but you

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.360 
fifty Caterpie without any IVs but you
don't<00:05:42.720> get<00:05:42.810> every<00:05:43.290> single<00:05:43.470> stat<00:05:43.800> point<00:05:44.100> at

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
don't get every single stat point at

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.980 
don't get every single stat point at
level<00:05:44.790> 50<00:05:45.030> you<00:05:45.060> have<00:05:45.150> to<00:05:45.330> wait<00:05:45.450> she<00:05:45.570> gets<00:05:45.720> level

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
level 50 you have to wait she gets level

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.470 
level 50 you have to wait she gets level
hundred<00:05:46.340> so<00:05:47.340> now<00:05:47.580> let's<00:05:47.730> see<00:05:47.820> we<00:05:47.940> had<00:05:48.030> Caterpie

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
hundred so now let's see we had Caterpie

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.150 
hundred so now let's see we had Caterpie
C<00:05:48.690> and<00:05:48.990> I<00:05:49.200> just<00:05:49.440> really<00:05:49.710> wanted<00:05:49.890> to<00:05:49.950> show<00:05:50.100> you

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
C and I just really wanted to show you

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.580 
C and I just really wanted to show you
how<00:05:50.430> much<00:05:50.550> stronger<00:05:50.910> this<00:05:51.150> Caterpie<00:05:51.660> is<00:05:51.810> then

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
how much stronger this Caterpie is then

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.610 
how much stronger this Caterpie is then
Caterpie<00:05:53.070> a<00:05:53.240> so<00:05:54.240> this<00:05:54.780> Caterpie<00:05:55.260> is<00:05:55.320> gonna<00:05:55.500> be

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
Caterpie a so this Caterpie is gonna be

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.010 
Caterpie a so this Caterpie is gonna be
taking<00:05:55.980> more<00:05:56.190> hits<00:05:56.460> dealing<00:05:57.240> more<00:05:57.390> damage<00:05:57.450> and

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
taking more hits dealing more damage and

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.930 
taking more hits dealing more damage and
attacking<00:05:58.410> first<00:05:58.830> just<00:05:59.310> inherently<00:05:59.669> from

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
attacking first just inherently from

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.520 
attacking first just inherently from
having<00:06:00.210> more<00:06:00.360> IVs<00:06:00.750> even<00:06:01.230> if<00:06:01.350> they<00:06:01.470> were

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
having more IVs even if they were

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.190 
having more IVs even if they were
training<00:06:01.890> the<00:06:01.950> exact<00:06:02.370> same<00:06:02.610> way<00:06:02.820> you<00:06:03.060> know<00:06:03.330> so

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
training the exact same way you know so

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.790 
training the exact same way you know so
that's<00:06:04.860> why<00:06:05.040> it's<00:06:05.190> so<00:06:05.340> important<00:06:05.820> because<00:06:06.800> why

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
that's why it's so important because why

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.570 
that's why it's so important because why
would<00:06:08.010> you<00:06:08.040> want

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
would you want

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.370 
would you want
Caterpie<00:06:09.390> a<00:06:09.419> when<00:06:09.690> you<00:06:09.780> could<00:06:09.930> have<00:06:09.990> had<00:06:10.260> our

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
Caterpie a when you could have had our

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.750 
Caterpie a when you could have had our
PC<00:06:10.740> now<00:06:11.640> granted<00:06:12.150> is<00:06:12.530> difficult<00:06:13.530> to<00:06:13.980> line<00:06:14.580> up

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
PC now granted is difficult to line up

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.460 
PC now granted is difficult to line up
all<00:06:14.880> those<00:06:15.060> V's<00:06:15.390> like<00:06:15.570> that<00:06:15.750> especially<00:06:16.380> if

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
all those V's like that especially if

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.230 
all those V's like that especially if
they're<00:06:16.710> if<00:06:17.100> you're<00:06:17.310> just<00:06:17.460> roaming<00:06:18.060> around

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
they're if you're just roaming around

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.480 
they're if you're just roaming around
goofing<00:06:18.900> off<00:06:18.960> trying<00:06:19.380> to<00:06:19.500> just<00:06:19.710> capture

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
goofing off trying to just capture

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.310 
goofing off trying to just capture
something<00:06:20.820> in<00:06:21.000> the<00:06:21.090> wild<00:06:21.450> you're<00:06:22.020> looking<00:06:22.260> at

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
something in the wild you're looking at

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.380 
something in the wild you're looking at
like<00:06:22.410> a<00:06:22.440> one<00:06:23.100> in<00:06:23.220> eight<00:06:23.340> million<00:06:23.760> chance

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
like a one in eight million chance

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.650 
like a one in eight million chance
something<00:06:24.780> like<00:06:24.930> that<00:06:25.490> so<00:06:26.490> there's<00:06:27.360> there's<00:06:27.600> a

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
something like that so there's there's a

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.300 
something like that so there's there's a
way<00:06:27.720> to<00:06:27.780> influence<00:06:28.050> it<00:06:28.350> and<00:06:28.560> that'll<00:06:29.040> be<00:06:29.130> for<00:06:29.280> a

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
way to influence it and that'll be for a

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.790 
way to influence it and that'll be for a
different<00:06:29.580> video<00:06:29.669> but<00:06:29.990> so<00:06:30.990> once<00:06:31.260> a<00:06:31.320> Pokemon<00:06:31.680> is

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
different video but so once a Pokemon is

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.830 
different video but so once a Pokemon is
generated<00:06:32.370> it<00:06:32.520> cannot<00:06:32.790> change<00:06:33.030> his<00:06:33.180> IV<00:06:33.360> that's

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
generated it cannot change his IV that's

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.990 
generated it cannot change his IV that's
that's<00:06:34.290> that's<00:06:34.650> important<00:06:35.190> that<00:06:35.820> doesn't

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
that's that's important that doesn't

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.370 
that's that's important that doesn't
mean<00:06:36.090> you<00:06:36.150> can't<00:06:36.390> influence<00:06:36.690> them<00:06:36.960> like<00:06:37.110> I<00:06:37.260> was

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
mean you can't influence them like I was

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.529 
mean you can't influence them like I was
saying<00:06:37.620> and<00:06:37.890> if<00:06:38.370> you<00:06:38.490> if<00:06:38.970> you're<00:06:39.150> impatient

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 
saying and if you if you're impatient

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:41.450 
saying and if you if you're impatient
and<00:06:39.720> I<00:06:39.780> don't<00:06:39.840> have<00:06:40.020> a<00:06:40.080> video<00:06:40.229> up<00:06:40.470> yet<00:06:40.680> go

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
and I don't have a video up yet go

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.469 
and I don't have a video up yet go
google<00:06:41.789> rng<00:06:42.660> random<00:06:43.500> number<00:06:43.530> generated<00:06:44.479> for

google rng random number generated for

google rng random number generated for
pokemon<00:06:45.930> and<00:06:46.169> you'll<00:06:46.620> see<00:06:46.770> what<00:06:46.919> i<00:06:46.949> mean<00:06:47.009> it

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 
pokemon and you'll see what i mean it

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:49.400 
pokemon and you'll see what i mean it
allows<00:06:48.060> you<00:06:48.270> to<00:06:48.449> enter<00:06:48.750> the<00:06:48.870> game<00:06:49.050> at<00:06:49.289> a

allows you to enter the game at a

allows you to enter the game at a
certain<00:06:49.800> point<00:06:50.030> knowing<00:06:51.030> that<00:06:51.300> you're<00:06:51.599> going

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
certain point knowing that you're going

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.559 
certain point knowing that you're going
to<00:06:51.930> encounter<00:06:52.199> this<00:06:52.530> perfect<00:06:52.919> pokemon<00:06:53.340> but<00:06:54.330> it

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:54.569 
to encounter this perfect pokemon but it

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:57.379 
to encounter this perfect pokemon but it
is<00:06:54.690> a<00:06:54.720> little<00:06:54.900> bit<00:06:55.020> of<00:06:55.110> work<00:06:55.550> and<00:06:56.550> also<00:06:57.180> you've

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:57.389 
is a little bit of work and also you've

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:58.790 
is a little bit of work and also you've
got<00:06:57.419> to<00:06:57.630> remember<00:06:57.810> that<00:06:57.990> Ivy's<00:06:58.410> aren't<00:06:58.620> fully

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
got to remember that Ivy's aren't fully

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.740 
got to remember that Ivy's aren't fully
realized<00:06:59.190> until<00:06:59.340> they<00:06:59.580> hit<00:06:59.699> level<00:06:59.910> 100<00:07:00.479> but

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750 
realized until they hit level 100 but

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.480 
realized until they hit level 100 but
you'll<00:07:00.870> see<00:07:01.050> most<00:07:01.229> of<00:07:01.349> the<00:07:01.410> effects<00:07:01.710> anyway

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
you'll see most of the effects anyway

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.540 
you'll see most of the effects anyway
but<00:07:03.240> not<00:07:03.389> all<00:07:03.569> of<00:07:03.720> them<00:07:03.840> until<00:07:04.110> them<00:07:04.400> so<00:07:05.400> that's

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
but not all of them until them so that's

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.879 
but not all of them until them so that's
basically<00:07:05.910> all<00:07:06.120> individual<00:07:06.810> values<00:07:07.110> are<00:07:07.289> just

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:07.889 
basically all individual values are just

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:09.740 
basically all individual values are just
individual<00:07:08.430> numbers<00:07:08.759> attributed<00:07:09.479> to<00:07:09.630> each

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:09.750 
individual numbers attributed to each

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.159 
individual numbers attributed to each
stat<00:07:10.110> that<00:07:10.410> boost<00:07:11.370> your<00:07:11.580> stat<00:07:11.930> overall<00:07:12.930> just

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:13.169 
stat that boost your stat overall just

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:15.680 
stat that boost your stat overall just
by<00:07:13.289> having<00:07:13.470> that<00:07:13.770> number<00:07:13.889> so<00:07:14.669> it's<00:07:15.330> not<00:07:15.479> too

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:15.690 
by having that number so it's not too

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.749 
by having that number so it's not too
difficult<00:07:15.930> and<00:07:16.410> the<00:07:17.190> hardest<00:07:17.490> part<00:07:17.669> is

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 
difficult and the hardest part is

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:19.550 
difficult and the hardest part is
definitely<00:07:17.940> influencing<00:07:18.750> the<00:07:19.139> individual

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 
definitely influencing the individual

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.339 
definitely influencing the individual
values<00:07:20.270> but<00:07:21.270> besides<00:07:21.630> that<00:07:21.750> it's<00:07:22.139> pretty

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:22.349 
values but besides that it's pretty

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:24.560 
values but besides that it's pretty
simple<00:07:22.590> and<00:07:22.949> it's<00:07:23.639> really<00:07:23.910> important<00:07:24.419> because

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:24.570 
simple and it's really important because

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.570 
simple and it's really important because
I<00:07:25.020> would<00:07:25.410> much<00:07:25.560> rather<00:07:25.590> have<00:07:25.889> you<00:07:26.250> know<00:07:26.370> if<00:07:26.460> I'm

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 
I would much rather have you know if I'm

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.270 
I would much rather have you know if I'm
trying<00:07:26.759> to<00:07:26.849> find<00:07:27.090> it<00:07:27.300> a<00:07:27.389> machspeed<00:07:28.110> Latios<00:07:29.099> is

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 
trying to find it a machspeed Latios is

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.610 
trying to find it a machspeed Latios is
really<00:07:29.520> fast<00:07:29.729> right<00:07:30.000> so<00:07:30.030> like<00:07:30.449> everyone<00:07:31.289> runs

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 
really fast right so like everyone runs

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.920 
really fast right so like everyone runs
max<00:07:31.919> speed<00:07:32.160> Latios<00:07:32.550> so<00:07:32.669> they<00:07:32.759> all<00:07:32.909> put<00:07:33.090> 31<00:07:33.539> IVs

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:33.930 
max speed Latios so they all put 31 IVs

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.719 
max speed Latios so they all put 31 IVs
or<00:07:34.259> they<00:07:34.650> you<00:07:34.800> know<00:07:34.889> they<00:07:35.009> generated<00:07:35.430> a<00:07:35.490> lot<00:07:35.639> of

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:35.729 
or they you know they generated a lot of

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:39.080 
or they you know they generated a lot of
us<00:07:35.820> with<00:07:35.909> 31<00:07:36.270> IVs<00:07:37.190> rather<00:07:38.190> than<00:07:38.460> you<00:07:38.729> know<00:07:38.849> if<00:07:39.000> I

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.090 
us with 31 IVs rather than you know if I

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.309 
us with 31 IVs rather than you know if I
just<00:07:39.210> went<00:07:39.360> on<00:07:39.479> cuddle<00:07:39.750> adios<00:07:40.050> they're<00:07:40.229> all

00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 
just went on cuddle adios they're all

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:41.749 
just went on cuddle adios they're all
gonna<00:07:40.409> out<00:07:40.590> speed<00:07:40.800> me<00:07:40.949> and<00:07:41.069> kill<00:07:41.220> me<00:07:41.340> one<00:07:41.520> shot

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 
gonna out speed me and kill me one shot

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:44.180 
gonna out speed me and kill me one shot
so<00:07:42.000> it's<00:07:42.270> really<00:07:42.449> important<00:07:42.900> to<00:07:42.930> get<00:07:43.199> that<00:07:43.949> you

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:44.190 
so it's really important to get that you

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.950 
so it's really important to get that you
know<00:07:44.280> those<00:07:44.430> max<00:07:44.729> IVs<00:07:45.090> and<00:07:45.300> you<00:07:45.539> know<00:07:45.659> certain

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 
know those max IVs and you know certain

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.450 
know those max IVs and you know certain
stats<00:07:46.229> especially<00:07:46.770> if<00:07:46.830> you<00:07:46.889> need<00:07:46.979> to<00:07:47.039> hit<00:07:47.250> you

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.460 
stats especially if you need to hit you

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.010 
stats especially if you need to hit you
know<00:07:47.580> one<00:07:47.789> hit<00:07:47.940> Kos<00:07:48.240> and<00:07:48.419> stuff<00:07:48.659> like<00:07:48.840> that

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020 
know one hit Kos and stuff like that

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.540 
know one hit Kos and stuff like that
there<00:07:49.229> are<00:07:49.289> certain<00:07:49.560> statistics<00:07:50.340> that<00:07:50.460> you're

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:50.550 
there are certain statistics that you're

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.420 
there are certain statistics that you're
gonna<00:07:50.639> need<00:07:50.909> all<00:07:50.940> the<00:07:51.120> IV<00:07:51.539> points<00:07:51.840> you<00:07:51.900> can<00:07:52.050> get

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:52.430 
gonna need all the IV points you can get

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.610 
gonna need all the IV points you can get
so<00:07:53.430> but<00:07:54.270> other<00:07:54.360> than<00:07:54.449> that<00:07:54.620> understanding

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:55.620 
so but other than that understanding

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.379 
so but other than that understanding
what<00:07:55.830> IVs<00:07:56.220> are<00:07:56.400> isn't<00:07:56.699> any<00:07:56.789> that<00:07:56.940> difficult

00:07:57.379 --> 00:07:57.389 
what IVs are isn't any that difficult

00:07:57.389 --> 00:07:59.089 
what IVs are isn't any that difficult
and<00:07:57.630> it's<00:07:57.840> pretty<00:07:58.080> important<00:07:58.440> to<00:07:58.620> competitive

00:07:59.089 --> 00:07:59.099 
and it's pretty important to competitive
