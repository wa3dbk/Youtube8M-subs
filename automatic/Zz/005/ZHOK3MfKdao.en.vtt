 Reef neighborhood is the one that knew an area with a one way bar in Sao Sebastiao 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.980

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.479
 flooding houses and streets 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:18.250
 the water began to invade the houses and the 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.570
 about 10 o'clock last night which forced the fire department to 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.480

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.559
 You can not tie the night in jail. 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:33.830

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.990
 in broad than for already made clear that for almost half of the fair 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.950
 ten people were taken out of the house and seven children were 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.640

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.640
 eulalia waterfall 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.200
 the volume of water increases every minute 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.450
 and ended invading other batches then this year all of the needle that tricolor o 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.540
 floor 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.480
 like the pec of my dream I do not know if it irritated dominant sibutramine 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.650
 the situation became more worrisome at about one o'clock in the morning because 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.240
 it started raining hard around here 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.840
 and water that had already dripped increased the volume and look just now it starts to 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.100
 including the shacks that had hitherto been 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.200
 water as slow means to other residents will also be 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.680
 forced to leave their homes this woman and her children had to 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.470
 protect inside the fire department car 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.780
 since the house was completely flooded we did not score it is all 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.000

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.660
 he was granted field protection 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.010

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.130
 in several points 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.130
 is so much that it looked more like a waterfall 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.920
 in this case the four-meter-high wall collapsed 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.780
 and water dragged bricks and pieces of wood 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.030
 the water comes down descending the ramp that the actor each time with more speed 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.509

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.829
 crossing the street and look what Dona Maria would have to do to try 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.709
 prevent the water entering the bar can build this containment that 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.480
 of a meter dona Maria but of the water being able at any moment the corpse 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.989
 that already went into traffic and the first time 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:17.690
 who enters 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.769

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.570
