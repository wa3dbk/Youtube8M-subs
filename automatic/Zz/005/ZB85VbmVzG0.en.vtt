00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.570
 Welcome to my youtube 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.370
 channel 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.460
 Today I want to show you at the 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.160
 new samsung series how to get the 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.750
 edited or edited 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:29.140
 his favorite channels are moving 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.939
 and assigns the station 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.310
 We take the normal one 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.620
 remote control from samsung with it 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.380
 So it's not the smart touch control 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.920
 looked the normal and push on 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.739
 menu in the menu area we can 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.870
 actually change everything like picture sound 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.820
 network he add smart hub 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:54.429
 facility so internet access soda too 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:00.190
 we navigate with the cursor keys and 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:03.850
 confirm with ok so handle it then 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.809
 edit sender confirm the whole 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.809
 again with the ok button 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:16.600
 that takes that instant so then 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.780
 this is our channel list here we 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.920
 see here 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.580
 while the programs here first 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.150
 pre-sorted after the station search 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.300
 so now let's just show it 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.870
 as we here the sender different 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.120
 we can totally do it 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.160
 So we have three 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.150
 first only on the transmitter we 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:49.090
 just want to pick it up like that 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:50.770
 and then we bet with the ok 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.250
 here is a check mark that is called this 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.560
 sender is and that is a well-groomed 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.290
 has to be edited one can now 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.420
 then select multiple stations if the 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.290
 immediately taken away 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.980
 of course you have to send to every sender 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.180
 even okay can put a check mark to 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.390
 these three stations were also 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.849
 Program number one has since we 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.340
 phoenix will have marked first 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.360
 phoenix also first 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.180
 Programmplatz 1 are yes if we are 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.180
 want to do it individually and not anymore 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.040
 then okay okay so that the tick 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.230
 change so we want it phoenix though 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.790
 for two years so press now 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.360
 but only left and go up 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:44.050
 Change number then we confirm that 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:45.580
 Okay so now we have it up here 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.210
 Fall upwards fall down 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.070
 Here we come with the navigation 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.520
 with the cursor keys up and down the 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.160
 Move transmitter to them and 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.590
 bring desired place or place 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.210
 added directly to the main program 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.680
 example the 2 yes and move the whole 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.060
 confirm with OK 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.750
 first it on program slot two 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.580
 bound 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.900
 above and below are still the 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.820
 But that means he still can 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.740
 only to be navigated to the sender 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.150
 But space does not mean yet 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.890
 that he was dropped there 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.610
 if he should be stored there then 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.610
 we have to confirm again with ok 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.160
 so now he's filed now we have 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.750
 no arrows just up and down 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.769
 show he has filed 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:49.440
 So you can just stop the transmitter individually 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:54.549
 different perceive here servustv 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:57.340
 press ok go back to number 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:03.610
 change again confirm 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:07.420
 okay so and then you can go up 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.209
 move or program number 3 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:14.680
 to press 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:17.950
 ok and confirm it again 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.370
 it is now fixed on it 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:25.060
 normen look so far that recognizes then is 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:30.880
 the station is fixed on the station 3 where 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:35.020
 we wanted him to have filed there 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.850
 you get it so now there are more 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:42.490
 I took the transmitter shortly before that 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:45.520
 Let's say zdf kika and 3sat 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.190
 Everything is confirmed with ok what we 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.400
 want to take these three stations in 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:55.060
 this order rest program space 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.810
 One has such a tick are set now 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.410
 Let's go back to the left number 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:05.919
 to change 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:11.020
 ok so zdf plus two senders themselves 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:14.050
 we can still hook it 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:18.180
 turn with the cursor or 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.180
 press program number one directly 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:28.920
 and confirm the whole again with ok 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:31.080
 that jumped to the number 1 and 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:38.790
 We actually press off now 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:45.360
 okay again takes back moment until he 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:47.720
 stored is so and so how we 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:54.140
 have previously marked in the order 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.140
 are now the zdf kika and reisert 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.860
 That's actually the sender today 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.360
 and everything around you does not have to be anymore 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.030
 in addition somehow save everything 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.860
 or go somewhere on options but 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.960
 just for example the exit button 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.950
 press and all automatically 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:22.230
 when we are now the once 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:25.110
 then zdf what we get so comes 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:29.700
 had filed as 1 is already 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:33.330
 directly saved and one channel 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:37.260
 push up com kika and then would have to 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:39.870
 yes 3sat I think that's exactly how it was 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:43.850
 and so is that too firmly in the 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.850
 stored and stored transmitter list
