00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
the cat and humans can get it - it's

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.149 
the cat and humans can get it - it's
called<00:06:24.560> toxic<00:06:25.250> plasmosis<00:06:26.409> on<00:06:27.409> out<00:06:27.710> of<00:06:27.830> Sprint

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:28.159 
called toxic plasmosis on out of Sprint

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:32.070 
called toxic plasmosis on out of Sprint
and<00:06:28.449> you<00:06:29.449> can<00:06:29.629> get<00:06:29.779> it<00:06:29.870> from<00:06:30.020> cats<00:06:30.319> by

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
and you can get it from cats by

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.240 
and you can get it from cats by
basically<00:06:33.080> if<00:06:33.139> you<00:06:33.229> somehow<00:06:33.589> accidentally

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
basically if you somehow accidentally

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.040 
basically if you somehow accidentally
get<00:06:34.520> some<00:06:34.759> of<00:06:34.879> their<00:06:35.000> urine<00:06:35.330> or<00:06:35.509> fecal<00:06:35.719> matter

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
get some of their urine or fecal matter

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.499 
get some of their urine or fecal matter
and<00:06:36.169> consume<00:06:36.740> it<00:06:36.919> so<00:06:37.580> if<00:06:37.699> you<00:06:37.789> have<00:06:37.909> a<00:06:38.000> cat<00:06:38.210> you

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:38.509 
and consume it so if you have a cat you

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:40.779 
and consume it so if you have a cat you
might<00:06:38.719> already<00:06:38.960> have<00:06:39.110> toxic<00:06:39.770> plasmosis<00:06:39.800> and

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:40.789 
might already have toxic plasmosis and

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:43.119 
might already have toxic plasmosis and
the<00:06:41.389> symptoms<00:06:41.870> of<00:06:42.110> the<00:06:42.349> men<00:06:42.560> that<00:06:42.740> have<00:06:42.949> it

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:43.129 
the symptoms of the men that have it

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:45.610 
the symptoms of the men that have it
they're<00:06:44.089> more<00:06:44.360> aggressive<00:06:44.599> and<00:06:45.199> really

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
reckless they did a test and looked at a

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.570 
reckless they did a test and looked at a
whole<00:06:48.800> bunch<00:06:48.949> of<00:06:49.009> people<00:06:49.159> that<00:06:49.400> had<00:06:49.550> been
