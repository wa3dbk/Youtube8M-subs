cost a dollar twenty nine $4.99 $9.99

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.990 
cost a dollar twenty nine $4.99 $9.99
and<00:03:54.230> they<00:03:54.799> were<00:03:54.859> small<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:55.790> they<00:03:55.940> were

and they were small and they were

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.949 
and they were small and they were
lightweight<00:03:56.419> and<00:03:57.519> they<00:03:58.720> so<00:03:59.720> they<00:03:59.750> were

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
lightweight and they so they were
