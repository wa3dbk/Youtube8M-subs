00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.570 
this because if this is a recent
addition<00:03:11.440> it's<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:12.630> 4<00:03:13.630> volt<00:03:13.930> power<00:03:14.170> socket<00:03:14.710> this

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
addition it's a 4 volt power socket this

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.550 
addition it's a 4 volt power socket this
is<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.140> side<00:03:17.380> of<00:03:17.710> the<00:03:18.550> dash<00:03:19.050> now<00:03:20.050> no<00:03:20.260> Navy

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
is on the side of the dash now no Navy

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.880 
is on the side of the dash now no Navy
Thomas<00:03:21.040> has<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.730> think<00:03:22.720> it's<00:03:23.020> two<00:03:23.290> up<00:03:23.470> here<00:03:23.680> and

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
Thomas has I think it's two up here and

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.610 
Thomas has I think it's two up here and
he<00:03:23.950> had<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.190> put<00:03:24.370> like<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.270> black<00:03:25.660> piece<00:03:26.350> behind

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
he had to put like a black piece behind

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.230 
he had to put like a black piece behind
screen<00:03:27.190> so<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.460> don't<00:03:27.490> see<00:03:27.820> all<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.030> wiring

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
screen so you don't see all the wiring

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.600 
screen so you don't see all the wiring
and<00:03:28.450> all<00:03:28.540> that<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.920> thought<00:03:30.280> that<00:03:30.490> was<00:03:30.580> a

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
and all that and I thought that was a

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.490 
and all that and I thought that was a
good<00:03:30.700> idea<00:03:30.880> but<00:03:31.270> if<00:03:31.540> you<00:03:31.630> want<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:32.020> but<00:03:32.170> since<00:03:32.410> I

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
good idea but if you want to but since I

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.140 
good idea but if you want to but since I
only<00:03:32.620> wanted<00:03:32.890> one<00:03:33.070> and<00:03:33.190> I<00:03:33.280> wanted<00:03:33.490> to<00:03:33.760> screw<00:03:34.060> it

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
only wanted one and I wanted to screw it

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.970 
only wanted one and I wanted to screw it
in<00:03:34.210> didn't<00:03:34.870> know<00:03:34.930> how<00:03:35.020> to<00:03:35.050> screw<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.560> into<00:03:35.680> here

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
in didn't know how to screw it into here

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.290 
in didn't know how to screw it into here
for<00:03:36.700> this<00:03:36.820> particular<00:03:37.980> socket<00:03:38.980> I<00:03:39.250> just<00:03:39.880> ended

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
for this particular socket I just ended

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.050 
for this particular socket I just ended
up<00:03:41.220> screwing<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:42.400> straight<00:03:42.640> into<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.880> side

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
up screwing it straight into the side

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.390 
up screwing it straight into the side
there<00:03:43.330> it<00:03:43.510> works<00:03:43.690> well<00:03:43.990> works<00:03:44.530> really<00:03:44.890> really

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
there it works well works really really

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.970 
there it works well works really really
well

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
well

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.820 
well
yeah<00:03:47.980> but<00:03:48.430> 12<00:03:48.760> volt<00:03:49.000> there<00:03:49.270> and<00:03:50.230> then<00:03:50.590> over<00:03:50.800> a

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
yeah but 12 volt there and then over a

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.930 
yeah but 12 volt there and then over a
European<00:03:51.930> 12<00:03:52.930> volt<00:03:53.550> where<00:03:54.550> is<00:03:54.670> it<00:03:55.770> is<00:03:56.770> not<00:03:57.760> fun

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
European 12 volt where is it is not fun

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.330 
European 12 volt where is it is not fun
to<00:03:58.060> hear<00:03:58.440> that's<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.740> I<00:03:59.830> think<00:04:00.040> that's<00:04:00.220> the

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
to hear that's it I think that's the

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.960 
to hear that's it I think that's the
European<00:04:00.520> version<00:04:02.459> comes<00:04:03.459> with<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.760> bike

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
European version comes with the bike

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.280 
European version comes with the bike
when<00:04:04.209> you<00:04:04.300> buy<00:04:04.480> it<00:04:05.400> so<00:04:06.400> yeah<00:04:06.990> anyway<00:04:07.990> I'm<00:04:08.140> gonna
