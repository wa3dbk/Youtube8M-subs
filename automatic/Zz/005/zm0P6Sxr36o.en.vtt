00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.440
 w 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.439
 the 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:10.969
 Dr hope 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.699
 Sarah Brandner and Jeff Huber criticized 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:14.819
 we have one today 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:17.349
 special guest an old friend of mine 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.349
 the same instrument plays from Dusseldorf Robert a 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.699
 just wonder how long have examples 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.839
 and what a simple black says do not stop me 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:29.800
 Munich 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.800
 at the corner and quite a long time 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.610
 it connects us with a commonality 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.310
 So over the years you have met again and again 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.310
 it's just so players buy Macs 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.940
 kassel 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.190
 I just had to show coach Rheine 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.060
 like you with the German Open Weser as well as dual channel up hour for his 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.280
 Accompaniment of power 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.040
 For example, courts can percent of internal injured 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.980
 in the little dragon to get going again 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.980
 turn on 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.430
 at 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
 4 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
 Gold how can you do something has seen something 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.680
 that maybe we from it 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.500
 loud 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.440
 Red 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.430
 DAPD 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.430
 the weather will be better again 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
 thanks to another world until then will continue 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.130
 OK 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.340
 till 8 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.600
 Merck 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.710
 Dortmund 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.579
 Dr 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:58.630
 the enormous 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.630
 survey 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.630
 Red 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.959
 So I would spontaneously spoiled as 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:16.290
 the good thing was that it made a diet that the Landesbank 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.129
 the number of parking spaces 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.129
 which devices and so on Nikci 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.099
 Incoming control center 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:30.139
 The composer should follow too often 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.719
 In addition, writing requires stuff to the EU will be the cheapest 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.260
 hated ideas find the idea in your head 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.260
 and if you were too much about that beautiful 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:44.299
 Japan won with the raffle 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.579
 it depends on when I work as a producer as a music producer 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:49.510
 I dr 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.669
 conceptional 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:54.639
 that means I think about which function do I need with this song with the 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.840
 Sound so if I sometimes for TV advertising or produce others 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:58.569
 stuff 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.599
 this is a very different task than composing as a bassist now 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.849
 so if, as the boss of composing, I am very very spontaneous 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.619
 I take the first thing that comes to my mind 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.909
 I try out punk says the next over it so there you have to 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:11.669
 really too 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.379
 Kate Moss makes live 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.230
 Percents watch that when you log in that you really get involved with it 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.700
 to play yourself and not to be too committed, there are people playing the games 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:21.689
 this one is growing 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.990
 that can not happen because they just forgot 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.480
 yes ticket price is simply calendar I see him too early spring 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.839
 lucky enough to play with good people as well 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:35.979
 he said I'll see the term best comfort get out there 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.819
 means that percent is modular 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.459
 That means percent of drummer Steve Forrest is the bassist 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.879
 plays a phrase Dr guitarist and keyboardist games fall 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.079
 the important thing is that the first three four bars are repeated 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.749
 This immediately turns into a cumulative one and so you have to be one of them 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:56.179
 Company has these two bars to work with 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:59.670
 and there is the first jackpot I roll what's going on in the background 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.510
 That is why we only want this experience when our students come to the 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.390
 To entertain people 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.939
 Joy clouded 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:08.449
 At that time, the 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:12.519
 more is simply set up by the parents on the appearance and 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.419
 transfer 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:18.729
 the GieÃŸener Land there must have been more 37 '- so on and so on and on 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.249
 Sometimes it is also a matter of practice Oliver dashed 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:29.199
 The hand around it is both a matter of practice and a technical thing 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.020
 played different roles because of working in Bonn 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.300
 He and the old generation of Loeper, he is not the one yet 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.770
 Inability Gaby the new that means you really had enough Bentheim 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.650
 For example, Eberhard Weber and his pz-news came together at that time 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.800
 itself really percent 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.490
 the first one agree that really percent did that in shape as well 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.569
 Of course, most of the time we had the options most of the time these days 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.629
 Percent that the drummer on stage by the computer and way 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:59.490
 gets 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.839
 the same urge computer gives Bruckbauer Medicine command 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:06.879
 and percent by that I have at some point by my going on and ran the drama of 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:08.669
 Patient on I can change the pace 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.710
 In the case of the meeting I would like to use the banking crisis like that 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:20.309
 So that way I can count my mom on stage too 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:22.460
 supported by the countries 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.130
 the speed is determined and so on measure can be taken precisely 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.330
 eu plans predefined 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.580
 the advantage that you do not need extensive monitoring - damp 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.990
 Forests per cent but now also used the played shore 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.029
 percent 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:38.849
 confusing is rare to hear, too, should that ever be the case 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:39.650
 Ganso 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.600
 Euro 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.610
 Moser me after the last days of simply pushes and more he also put 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.520
 Again you hear too many thoughts 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.540
 he has stocks and I do not do that just fine 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.170
 Minute People had been there where the people think Mr. Bernhard Neidhart is doing 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.220
 via London this is also getting better October open us market like everything else 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.389
 others also the residents 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.999
 5 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:04.059
 Prof 

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:07.059
 hope so well so far now 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.150
 standing area is also the stoppage during 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:17.009
 so far in the top days by missing the Muslims with any kind 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:21.210
 from us infinitely beautiful so some people the something we had free 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.219
 bit different 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:25.720
 the address also everyone disgraces them but to the effects 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.630
 otherwise, the one or the other player decides otherwise 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.919
 Erasmus before that must be behind it 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.020
 the game more and more and in a sauce 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.580
 Interesting things just like you can leave something absolutely absurd 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.530
 the DAX had a lot of options these days over nines was too much 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.080
 So fat by digitizing it fit everything in a box 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.090
 In the past, Percent had a loan of 30 treadmills, in part so 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.969
 Guitarists from before 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:55.929
 I also only recommend if the trip was the system lost in Japan 

00:06:55.929 --> 00:06:59.169
 Thus, their purchase is not so easily declining 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:00.899
 Tourist group that one out 

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:03.809
 before you spend money again and again, so the industry is always 

00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:07.229
 interested in selling a lot which is good 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:10.219
 if people start running it would be a lot and we have for example 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:11.279
 Is it like this 

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:12.719
 we have a 

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:16.559
 uc4 in the garden and - what a flower pot more we have the buy 

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:19.979
 then has a device for 2000 Euro Bonus Migros Zurich 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:23.849
 and that's the problem i also started getting up early with the others too 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:24.960
 deal like me 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.159
 did not understand 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:28.580
 this is the topic of what makes this work 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.380
 there is, for example, when I errte consolidate 

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.360
 Project manager worked as a projectionist and there are the so-called persons 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.490
 Resonance was great 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.029
 and that's kind of 

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:42.020
 the harmonic Miko the LEDs one in the 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.509
 which can express in the length of the numbers 

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:47.639
 that means that could kill again to date as a small echo what ever 

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:48.490
 a little who goes 

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.790
 but when you see that our whole reduced at the same time in all 

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:52.590
 great concern
