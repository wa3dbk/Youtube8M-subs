direct<00:01:34.110> Mario<00:01:34.500> around<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.610> never

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
direct Mario around but it's never

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.340 
direct Mario around but it's never
something<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> think<00:01:36.509> about<00:01:36.780> it

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
something you have to think about it

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.620 
something you have to think about it
just<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.920> works<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.490> feels<00:01:38.670> good<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.180> I

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
just just works and it feels good and I

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.810 
just just works and it feels good and I
think<00:01:39.689> that's<00:01:39.900> why<00:01:40.350> galaxy<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.189> my<00:01:41.280> opinion<00:01:41.549> is

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
think that's why galaxy in my opinion is

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.859 
think that's why galaxy in my opinion is
is<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.210> game<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.659> demonstrates

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
is the game that really demonstrates

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.840 
is the game that really demonstrates
this<00:01:43.380> device<00:01:43.680> better<00:01:43.979> than<00:01:44.159> any<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.610> I

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
this device better than any of it I

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.859 
this device better than any of it I
don't<00:01:45.210> think<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.420> any<00:01:45.540> secret<00:01:45.570> that

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
don't think it's any secret that

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.050 
don't think it's any secret that
galaxies<00:01:46.470> my<00:01:46.590> game<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.950> show<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.310> was<00:01:47.850> drawn

is<00:02:52.260> just<00:02:52.530> going<00:02:52.650> all<00:02:52.830> over<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.099> place<00:02:53.160> too

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
is just going all over the place too

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.190 
is just going all over the place too
that's<00:02:54.060> because<00:02:54.269> I'm<00:02:54.360> moving<00:02:54.629> the<00:02:54.690> remote<00:02:54.959> all

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
that's because I'm moving the remote all

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.399 
that's because I'm moving the remote all
around<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.760> mean<00:02:56.760> while<00:02:56.940> some<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.019> standard

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
around I mean while some of the standard

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.080 
around I mean while some of the standard
Mario<00:02:58.709> stuff<00:02:58.980> still<00:02:59.250> applies<00:02:59.489> like<00:02:59.760> the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
Mario stuff still applies like the

running around basically a full 360

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.610 
running around basically a full 360
object<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:20.330> gravity<00:04:21.330> plays<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:21.570> part<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:22.500> can

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
object and gravity plays a part you can

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.930 
object and gravity plays a part you can
see<00:04:22.740> Mario<00:04:23.010> gets<00:04:23.190> farther<00:04:23.400> away<00:04:23.610> from<00:04:23.700> the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940

really see it but if I can pull that

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.050 
really see it but if I can pull that
triple<00:04:28.380> jump<00:04:28.880> alright<00:04:29.880> so<00:04:31.850> now<00:04:32.850> we're<00:04:32.970> gonna

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
triple jump alright so now we're gonna

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.439 
triple jump alright so now we're gonna
get<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.300> star<00:04:33.510> just<00:04:33.750> follow<00:04:33.960> me
