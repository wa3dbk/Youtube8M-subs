 ask because I really am not not 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.110
 click here engineer in circuits 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.570
 minecraft I only do it like I know how god 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.909

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.950
 and as you can see is a skewer I 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:46.100
 size click hole tech coyote then it 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.650
 he heard you culero and well that's a way of 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:54.530
 just start making your mine not 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:56.950
 they can put oxides of a dynamite and 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.040

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.080
 They pulled the and ready for a fucking 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.050
 lever already come and they have been their 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.270
 explosions to make it faster 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.100
 the excavation of his mine and I think that 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.100
 that was all for this mini video 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.100

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.570
 call mini guides and then let's start 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.310
 with this this will be the second the 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.260

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.170
 let's be explaining one thing 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.600
