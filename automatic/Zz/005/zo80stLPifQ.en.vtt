00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.070
 Device makes it very nice and compact 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.070

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.390

 without taxes and to tame and 375 euros Nokia has a further development 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.680
 until he presented a 70 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.430
 the Nokia the 55th 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.620
 the kind of lives are threatened the ceiling is small from the 71 as you can see though 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.280
 Hartmann 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.280
 but before you even fit the possibility to write emails 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.680
 and as you can see that is from Densmore that devices with the 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.460
 high quality materials 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.909
 there is one we might still have the apparatus 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.760
 technical data information 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.380
 could say something like that 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.500
 everything perfect 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.700
 the device should be supported 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.439
 at navigation- Sortie Kastrati Piester with bombast of Nokia Maps 3 2 0 on the 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.070
 devices 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.120
 Memory memory scratches 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.250
 May of Christ this is box 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.520
 with two gigabytes 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.170
 and he dedicated Mergler to 16 gigabytes 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.959
 then also Volvo and the St 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.849
 has to report then too 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.009
 the ECJ has the same lake 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.219
 which criterion oldest Pieck 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.679
 and also this year wireless LAN on the rescued 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:23.099
 And now, of course, comes the obligatory question when will that be 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.979
 Device should be available and help it should be the cost 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.979
 since the money of the available a second quarter 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.459
 Since this year and the device with Boehner taxes and live so Wendt the 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.509
 Postern Svane 75 Euro 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:40.000
 there is another money I have seen Arndt Nokia Maps 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.139
 the 6700 7a the culprit 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.370
 Maybe they also tell us a bit about what Dr 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.890
 because Alba Navigation is one of countries 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.890
 we can not dance out the new date with the device underneath 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:56.759
 counting at 67, next version march have three points op and there is 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:00.679
 of course very strong so-called pedestrian navigation in the foreground 

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:04.179
 and there we also indirectly effect it was so that means if you 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:07.869
 from pedestrian moves so you can better then percent the 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:09.769
 Use search functions 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.079
