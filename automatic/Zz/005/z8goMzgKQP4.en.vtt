00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
that they would have eighties probably

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.180 
that they would have eighties probably
didn't<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.149> kind<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:52.190> consistent

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.920 
Dragon around 84 85 but yeah Graham was
a<00:03:26.850> little<00:03:27.060> ahead<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.240> his<00:03:27.390> time<00:03:27.630> with<00:03:27.810> that

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.880 
a little ahead of his time with that
gimmick<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.350> think<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.650> was<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:28.800> whole

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
gimmick I think that was the whole

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.850 
gimmick I think that was the whole
problem<00:03:29.160> people<00:03:29.490> and<00:03:29.850> if<00:03:30.330> you<00:03:30.420> remember<00:03:30.860> he

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.500 
came out too and that was weird because
