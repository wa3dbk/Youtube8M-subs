00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.000
 there we can do something we can 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.180
 to make a beautiful city to sir the 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.180
 mayor 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.490
 so there everything has to be agreed we have 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.080
 a very good location is what you 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.000
 believe that it would be possible to 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.890
 specialize a bit in the game the 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.480
 leisure tourism for the index 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.670
 of happiness either is high enough that the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.309
 people come to my city it's a 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.750
 good strategy recreation and pleasures of the 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.090
 citizen is what you want us to 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.050
 throw and bah go let's go we can 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.440
 do is far from reaching their 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.020
 goals please we're going to 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.649
 put the island in the middle we go do 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.649
 that you can send it 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.450
 it takes a shot of bruz in the facade 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.950
 and in the momentum the foundations say that 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.879
 you have to get everything down to 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.510
 what are we going to do other 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.210
 thing that maintaining 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.070
 he wants more the mayor no he must 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.360
 do in fact I changed my mind and 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.970
 so what we will put in the place we go 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.729
 put a stadium know a stage where is 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.320
 what I mean is yes yes yes 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.450
 useless is what we can do 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.520
 casino balances please and the 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.209
 guys let's go down but casino 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.849
 his map and you go back a little bit of 

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:25.580
 voiceless class it should happen 

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:27.259
 yeah I do not get to take 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.590
 connection I think there is a problem of 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.569
 Wireless 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.860
 the site manager could ask 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:33.259
 the guy they not deviate that 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.929
 we will go down the casino yes I 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.250
 ask team that's me because in 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:49.160
 I would like casino in my 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:50.780
 city yes so I will explain to you 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.399
 because in the neighboring city 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.319
 they have already started to put two 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.569
 residential areas me what 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.410
 I would like to do is to recover the 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.780
 inhabitants of their residential areas 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.090
 specializing in hobbies and 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.679
 in the game so I also want to put a 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.459
 casino we chose this one look 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.280
 look 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:09.709
 that's what I would like if possible 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.260
 so here we finish for tonight's 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.640
 residences the two offices one does a 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.030
 mall and then just every 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.910
 Hobbies 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.050
 ok we can do that it's anti seismic 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.000
 men is anti seismic and anti 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.760
 seismic yes so yes but if there are 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.769
 comets it's the same thing that will change nothing 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.159
 there are comets would have to build a 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.629
 shield in adam a messiah no cannon 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.829
 it's not impossible but it costs 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.290
 a lot of steam cloud to tell you 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.909
 sir no no no no but 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.140
 let's go we will not do the shield 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.640
 it is not very serious 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.209
 can you put a false 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.140
 to tell me that if godzilla israel he 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.849
 go all the french is for me 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.319
 because that building there if he will try 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.360
 to mount on the other solution 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.010
 is to plant here the elected hunger 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.500
 here a buddy there that comes he will miss 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.970
 you are right but me the forest that me 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.250
 not because the forest pays off 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.900
 nothing so that maybe we can 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.970
 to install wind turbines 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.920
 really a great idea like that 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.659
 relates to getting energy 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.609
 and at the same time it corresponds to a 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.040
 index of happiness of the inhabitants one can 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:11.170
 do that I hold I give you that 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:18.459
 do it there you can cast it gomis 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:20.200
 open edit ah yes you hear me you make me 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.700
 get off the two wind turbines if you 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.310
 please 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.250
 nothing there is nothing there since your 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:32.319
 equie thalassa not to swing mg 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.319
 two wind turbines they are on demand 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:41.420
 of the league bc is mine and I wanted 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.219
 buy 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.659
 there are 5000 simflouz who left on 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:47.319
 the wind I clicked so now I 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:51.760
 just want her to go down 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:54.459
 we do it like you come to see hockey 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.870
 that offices there is heavy 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:01.040
 we want a little I want a little 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.269
 it's interesting we will do as a 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.769
 other mouth than what has elsewhere 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.739
 to the office area we're going to keep 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.359
 well go see to have that spirit there a 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.129
 fair mind let's lose the game is 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:13.239
 frankly you will not facilitate us the 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.239
 gameplay i tell you
