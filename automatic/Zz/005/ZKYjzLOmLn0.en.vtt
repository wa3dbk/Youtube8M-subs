00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 under certain circumstances it can be a bit longer 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.009
 take in minecraft from one point to 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.440
 to arrive next 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.360
 but with the help of the never portal system 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.179
 This can be accelerated a little 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.190
 in this tutorial from 10.07 it goes 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.330
 the basics to the never portal system 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.039
 in minecraft to all he plays the number 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.170
 1024 an important role for each 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.600
 Portal in the normal world in the distance 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.390
 from 1024 blocks to the very first 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.960
 built in the same portal in 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.390
 the hell 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.850
 a second portal in the network is created 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.610
 now automatically if the associated 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.620
 portal in the upper world more than 1000 24 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.719
 blocks from the first created in the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.640
 super world is removed you build now 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.340
 for example, two portals with one 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.260
 lesser distance than 1024 blocks in 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.570
 the upperworld you can if you in the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.180
 one goes in and then in the net 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.340
 how the portal enters the second 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.559
 come out of this picture makes the whole 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.120
 once again a little clearer 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.309
 Something is different in hell 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.199
 instead of in the upper world are the ways 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.830
 are practically shortened to be exact 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.510
 She's eight times shorter than she is 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.180
 128 blocks and then returns to the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.310
 Oberwelt is practically there 1024 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.650
 blocks are removed from the starting point 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.630
 can travel very very fast around 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.759
 now the portals in the upper world with 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.770
 those in the level must specifically connect 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.170
 you look at the iks and the z coordinates 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.180
 of the portal in the upper world and record 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.250
 divide by eight then build one 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.590
 at exactly these coordinates in the never one 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.450
 portal and you are connected 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.310
 By the way, there are still some multiplayer games 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.619
 Another option is the portals 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.630
 to exploit first of all, two new 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.939
 Portals are set in the upper world 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.470
 One can now be entered now 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.450
 however, there will be a second player 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.579
 requires a player disabled this 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.560
 never portals hell the second 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.700
 enters through the second portal in the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.950
 Oberwelt the helper 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.470
 This forms a second portal 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.360
 in hell to now two portals 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.579
 You must be able to use the first 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.229
 portal will be reactivated, I hope 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.689
 that was agreed to that extent and you 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.650
 now know portals can do more than just in 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.510
 the hell 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.640
 Write down who more now 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.320
 wants to see the last minecraft news 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.180
 edition which was very expensive was good 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.770
 advise or you want more about 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.420
 portal then we have one 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.060
 tutorial made to portal cities 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.620
 practically another form of portal 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.120
 that was something of this video 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.580
