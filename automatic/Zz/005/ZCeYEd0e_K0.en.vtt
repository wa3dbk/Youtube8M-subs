00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.920
 so high and hannover again today 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.029
 I 'm on strange thread namely today 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:21.099
 it goes into my video about shoes but 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:27.430
 around men's sports shoes because the always 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:29.560
 have cycling more often and run 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:36.910
 me so-called sports shoes 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:38.340
 We can also say socks shoes 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.440
 to 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.440
 why that explains itself 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.390
 pretty soft from a material 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:55.110
 Of course I show that here 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.110
 below everything 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.189
 I see a drawback already and that 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.729
 the bad ones are the shoelaces 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.210
 pretty thin will last long 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.210
 you will see it 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.700
 but as you can see, they are not to blame 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.760
 stiffening which are really nice soft 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.330
 if they join in now if 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.780
 So I'm going to test now 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.780
 equal 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.330
 so the shoes really do all 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.390
 Movements with them are also astrein 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.210
 Conveniently now you drive to you if you like that 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.800
 Socks shoes always bought 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.240
 up to two numbers larger 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.450
 I advise you as you see it does too 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.759
 no wide foot and really any 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.759
 movement makes it happen 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:16.070
 So then to the next and watch
