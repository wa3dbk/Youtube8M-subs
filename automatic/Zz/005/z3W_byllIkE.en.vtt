00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
 Hi, I'm Carlos Andres Galician and I'm 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.429
 here and as promised on facebook 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.969
 this is my breakfast I am going to present 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.240
 everything we put into the green juice of 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.099
 what I eat I do not breakfast with rice 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.320
 no scrambled egg nor toast 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:25.590
 sausage none of that this is a meal 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.570
 that gives me a lot but a lot of energy on 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.279
 everything in the part of the brain we achieve 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.010
 we quickly use this this honey is a 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.769
 organic honey here is the seal of 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.730
 organic this is the best food of the 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:43.409
 world is called pollen pollen is the best 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.860
 food has everything the body 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:49.660
 need we use this is a green 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.840
 is one of the best companies that we 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.570
 you can find here doctor don koll 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.030
 see is also organic this has of 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.950
 all will not detail exactly what 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.250
 it is but have an idea you can get 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.290
 something very similar there is with everything 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.680
 that this has 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.560
 this is a vitamin that I eat 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.840
 also stirred to the juice that we are going to 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.210
 make it critical in the part of here and with 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.900
 this helps the power very much 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.610
 has arginine has is more than everything 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.369
 help for blood circulation 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.720
 remember that the body needs to have 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.240
 good circulation and especially the 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.940
 brain that is to generate energy that 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.480
 it is an activator of the atp where it is produced 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.350
 energy 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.940
 this is flaxseed ok there it is ground because 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.460
 We buy it in school 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.520
 let's ground flaxseed 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.040
 these are dogs there are dogs 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.110
 we try to make everything organic 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.360
 can what is more organic or what 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.090
 be previously organic is what we're going 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.250
 to always use not as powerful as 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.980
 material greater quantity of nutrients what 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.660
 organic this is I do not know how to say 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.250
 in Spanish but have an idea more or 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:06.890
 less than this helps a lot too 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.040
 for blood and for energy and a 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.370
 organic apple an organic apple and 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.220
 we add this protein is also 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.360
 organic as you can see here organic and 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.810
 it's a protein 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.510
 herbal is not milk- based 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.349
 Most proteins are 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.870
 with milk, but this is 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.970
 specifically a protein filled with 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.760
 pure vegetable all that extracted from 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.569
 vegetable and it's all organic or that today 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.569
 let's see the preparation 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.910
 let's use a device called 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.880
 nourish bullets 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.340
 we have here the water or can see is the 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.300
 amount of water that we use 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.570
 also a special water we have water 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.480
 that goes that we use is a water that is expensive 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.710
 but it's worth that kind of water is the 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.930
 I also recommend if they want 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.000
 buy this water or buy something 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.120
 related to that you can go to 123 of 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.170
 dotcom energy there I buy all the 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.580
 vitamins and here is the protein we are going to 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.580
 see how we revolve how we do 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.780
 let's use here cojemos 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.780
 and we miss him 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.990
 ok we put him in the water and we throw him the 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.530
 Apple 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.160
 then we are going to throw 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.160
 he created 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.849
 remember that we also take 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.499
 we throw parsley in this case not 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.510
 we have parsley but we can make a 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:47.670
 combination and that's why that stain does not 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.739
 watercress but milk that is instead of 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.749
 watercress we would throw parsley but if not 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.459
 you have parsley you throw watercress there are 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:56.340
 the watercress one of the two 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.530
 ok just replace remember that this 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.780
 we have done for years if every time what 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.389
 we have improved it we have polished it as 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.019
 added we have made modifications 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.019
 based on 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.040
 to a friend that we have that is a 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.410
 shareholder and everything we have read has 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.680
 said to the protein can see a 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.680
 vegetable protein now let's flaxseed 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.080
 hills is ground we read ground 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.620
 previously it does not have much omega 3 and 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.620
 as well 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.479
 has a lot of fiber fiber is for 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.030
 keep the organism clean on 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.009
 small intestine and clean there you 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.470
 we throw the atp that little white thing in the 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:41.139
 atp now we are going to take the 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.390
 cardiovascular is another protein for 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.700
 clean 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.900
 and proteins do not supplement to clean 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.470
 the veins 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.470
 there it goes 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.690
 a little 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.690
 we are not going to throw this 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:02.280
 it's a green supplement there is it looks 

00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:07.910
 as a bus 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:10.190
 as ugly but its pure protect or pure 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.590
 food 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.350
 I call this whole food that 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.470
 food of immortals 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.620
 there is pollen something only the best 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.540
 food of the world is the pollen I bought in 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.980
 the best cop you can have choice 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:30.650
 with honey to sweeten organic honey 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.600
 the best honey that you can find us in 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.430
 the apple we have only picked one 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.640
 little bit of the apple towards the middle of 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:41.380
 the apple we take this practical to 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.630
 make it easy and we put 1 2 3 4 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.670
 and now we are going to stir all this with 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.500
 this device does not have to be that can 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:52.700
 be a blender but the apparatus for 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.700
 you can see there we will see it 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.950
 i 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:31.830
 and there's the juice and that's what I put 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.830
 so we take together
