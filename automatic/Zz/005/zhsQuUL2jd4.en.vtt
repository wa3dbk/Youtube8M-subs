00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:00.930
 No. 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.380
 Oh, sorry, you want to hear more? Ok then. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.640
 Hi, this is Emily from Bite Size Vegan. Welcome to another "vegan nugget". 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.279
 If you ever lead a longer conversation about veganism, or some not too long, 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.820
 there are two topics that will surely come out. 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.009
 Bacon and Hitler. 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.189
 Although "bacon from Hitler" would be a novelty. 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.019
 You know, the argument practically starts like this: "You know, Hitler was a vegetarian." 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.509
 And ... well, that's all. 

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:42.979
 I will talk about the validity of this argument after I mention its value. 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:46.609
 Let's say Hitler was a vegetarian or even vegan. 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.809
 And what? How about all those crazy people who weren't vegans or vegetarians? 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.309
 This means that anyone who consumes animal products is the same as Stalin, 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.360
 Osama bin Laden, Jeffrey Dahmer ( <i>American serial killer</i> ) and other carnivorous sociopaths across history? 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.420
 By the way - including Hitler, as we will soon discover. 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.720
 It's just not a valid argument, actually, no argument at all. 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.160
 So let's throw on the facts, right? 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.630
 Hitler was far from being a vegetarian, yet there are reasons why people believe he was. 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.159
 According to historian Robert Payn, "The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler" was Hitler's Vegetarianism 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.140
 more or less just a PR campaign created by Goebbels, propaganda minister. 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.589
 Payne says that "Hitler's asceticism played an essential role in the projection of his image in Germany. 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:40.169
 According to a widely accepted legend, he did not smoke, drink, eat meat, or deal with women. 

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:44.199
 Only the first was true. His asceticism was Goebbels' fiction, which 

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:49.769
 he was to emphasize his devotion, self-control, and chasm that divided him from other men. 

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:54.759
 By showing asceticism outwardly, he could claim to have been committed to the service of his nation 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.230
 in fact, Payne writes that Hitler was "remarkably hedonistic and did not abound by any." 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.978
 a sense of aesthetics. "Beyond this PR campaign showing Hitler as 

00:02:01.978 --> 00:02:07.408
 a master of self-control there is some credible evidence that he has occasionally avoided mass. 

00:02:07.408 --> 00:02:11.020
 In the breathtaking text "Eternal Treblinka: We are all Nazis in relation to animals" 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.590
 Charles Patterson depicts some of Hitler's 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.470
 somewhat uglier indispositions and says Hitler "suffered from digestive problems, intermittent 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.769
 stomach pains that have plagued him since adolescence, as well as excessive bloating and 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:29.080
 with uncontrollable sweating ... He found that when he reduced his meat intake he didn't swallow so much and had fewer stains on his underwear. " 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.740
 Apparently he also believed that increased vegetable intake would improve the smell of his farts. 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.130
 I'm not making this up, people. Check out the blog link in the video description for everyone 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.840
 quotes and links. 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.669
 Regardless of his health, Hitler never gave up his favorite meat dishes 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:52.560
 Dr. Fritz Redlich in "The Diagnosis of the Destructive Prophet" was Bavarian sausages, liver dumplings and stuffed game. 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.759
 Not only was Hitler not a vegetarian, he was even strongly opposed to vegetarianism. 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:03.329
 James Patterson writes that when Hitler "came to power in 1933, he banned all vegetarians." 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.529
 associations in Germany, arrested their leadership and had the main vegetarian magazine canceled 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:11.279
 published in Frankfurt ... During the war, Nazi Germany banned all vegetarians 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:16.219
 organizations in the territory they occupied, although vegetarianism would help alleviate the shortage 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:17.410
 food as a result of the war. 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.980
 And a huge part of veganism - and not just diet, but real 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.760
 veganism is compassion for animals. Hitler's treatment of animals was very similar to his 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.709
 style of treatment: blunt, violent and cruel. Apparently Hitler often wore a whip on dogs 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.010
 and viciously hitting his dog in public. His biographer Ian Kershaw writes that 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.029
 every relationship of Hitler, whether with his dog or with people, was based on the subordination of his domination. " 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:46.470
 Hitler based his treatment of Jews in slaughterhouses with assembly lines in the United States. 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.490
 Hitler idolized Henry Ford, whose own inspiration for revolutionary assembly lines came from 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:58.110
 visits to a Chicago slaughterhouse in adolescence. Hitler basically built his own slaughter lines and swapped animals 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.370
 for human beings. 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.110
 As Gary Yourofsky says - it's enough to swap animals for humans in today's slaughterhouses and create them again 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.629
 Dachau or Auschwitz. 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.800
 It is evident that Hitler was as far away from vegetarianism as anyone can get. 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.919
