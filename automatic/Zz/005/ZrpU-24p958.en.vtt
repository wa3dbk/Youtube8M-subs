00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
big step today yeah it was logic

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.210 
big step today yeah it was logic
starting<00:04:25.820> this<00:04:26.000> operation<00:04:26.630> first<00:04:27.530> base

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
starting this operation first base

allowing<00:04:28.760> like<00:04:29.150> to<00:04:29.360> color<00:04:30.460> so<00:04:31.479> we<00:04:33.039> open

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
horizon is wide for multicolor and so we

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:52.389 
horizon is wide for multicolor and so we
