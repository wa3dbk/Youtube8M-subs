00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 yes hello we for this reason this 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.870
 tinker funny animals can show that 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.870
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.430
 this france is to tinker 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.720
 dead easy 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:28.130
 you need doubts about glue 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.640
 short stable cardboard wobble eyes 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.640
 scissors 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.530
 I think I prepared a template 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.440
 I can tell anyway 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.879
 you connect 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.430
 We are the templates for the frog 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.239
 this goes on the cardboard and cuts 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.239
 this then off 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.719
 for the middle I use a sharp 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.379
 scissors was cutting that out 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.379
 easier to fall 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.940
 we need one from this pub circle 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.940
 second 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.820
 you need some of the little pub circles 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.840
 breakfast we start with the frog 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.939
 body 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.689
 For that we take the wool and lay yours 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.579
 twice or as I often do here 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.710
 annually the expert groups each other and 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:46.390
 takes you loop of woolen threads and 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.390
 put this through the hole 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.240
 then you pull your wool through the 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.650
 bend and pull the whole thing tight 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.100
 you have to pay attention that the 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:02.080
 knot is down then you can with 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.080
 start the wrap in the dotzheimer sense 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.950
 if you need a new wool thread 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.950
 you cut off the ends 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.740
 take a new ball jumped and stuck 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.230
 the bend again through the middle of the 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.850
 template 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.980
 He is careful that the 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.120
 cut woolen threads behind with the 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.120
 hold on to fingers 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.080
 the wool and pull it so tight that 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:12.640
 the new wolf against the cut off 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.860
 fix the knot of the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.570
 You should follow that up again 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.450
 slide down then you take the role 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.460
 and put this through the first 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.160
 Wrapped should you again to 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.340
 Pay attention that the rear threads are fixed 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.910
 We thus you can not later 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.910
 dissolve 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.730
 you should really so much wanted to 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.730
 middle hole is no longer visible 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.720
 then he gets cut out 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.640
 while you should be careful that you 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.920
 the gap between the two dad 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.520
 Thus, the reward will be cut 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.200
 whole thing 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.200
 cut in the middle 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.819
 Now you put in the templates 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.880
 A little start takes a wool thread 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.519
 and puts again between two dad 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.329
 reward 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.189
 are in her 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.189
 all have then takes the thread twice 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.030
 it makes a knot and pulls 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.560
 the whole thing, then he does one 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.560
 second knot behind 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.020
 Now only the cardboard needs to be removed 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.539
 you're cutting into it for that 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.719
 template in and bar dad easy 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:58.319
 from then on the banks will be in shape 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:58.319
 sliced 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.560
 then strengthen the small templates 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.560
 two small break 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.990
 take the filmstrip and cut 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:22.220
 I already have the mouth for it 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.220
 the stencil made 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:35.740

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.740

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.970

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.970
