spreading it around as best I can while

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.040 
spreading it around as best I can while
keeping<00:01:25.920> surface<00:01:26.580> area<00:01:26.880> because<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.870> will

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
keeping surface area because this will

take<00:01:28.230> a<00:01:28.290> spark<00:01:28.740> which<00:01:29.610> I'll<00:01:29.850> show<00:01:30.150> after<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.570> get

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
take a spark which I'll show after I get

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.260 
take a spark which I'll show after I get
it<00:01:30.900> processed<00:01:31.080> and<00:01:31.610> in<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.760> more<00:01:32.910> surface

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
it processed and in the more surface

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.770 
it processed and in the more surface
area<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.720> better<00:01:33.900> chance<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.830> have<00:01:34.890> of

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
area the better chance you have of

almost reminds me of a Salt Lake but
this<00:03:12.719> will<00:03:12.900> take<00:03:13.079> a<00:03:13.459> flame<00:03:14.459> right<00:03:14.639> away<00:03:14.849> and

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
this will take a flame right away and

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.819 
this will take a flame right away and
just<00:03:15.150> burn<00:03:15.389> as<00:03:15.659> a<00:03:15.689> whole<00:03:15.959> cube<00:03:16.260> or<00:03:16.469> you<00:03:16.620> can

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
just burn as a whole cube or you can

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.729 
just burn as a whole cube or you can
take<00:03:17.040> shavings<00:03:17.519> off<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.879> it<00:03:18.049> and<00:03:19.049> get<00:03:19.530> little

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
take shavings off of it and get little

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:29.970 
take shavings off of it and get little
piles<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.189> reuse<00:03:20.519> this<00:03:20.670> more<00:03:20.939> than<00:03:20.969> once

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.740 

and<00:03:30.430> this<00:03:30.760> will<00:03:30.879> hold<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.120> flame<00:03:31.330> for<00:03:31.569> a<00:03:31.599> while

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
and this will hold a flame for a while

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.080 
and this will hold a flame for a while
as<00:03:31.930> well<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:33.250> this<00:03:33.310> will<00:03:33.489> actually<00:03:33.610> burn<00:03:33.849> in

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
as well and this will actually burn in

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.229 
as well and this will actually burn in
water<00:03:34.330> to<00:03:34.569> floating<00:03:34.989> water<00:03:38.760> I'll<00:03:39.760> try<00:03:39.940> see<00:03:40.209> if

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
water to floating water I'll try see if

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.180 
water to floating water I'll try see if
it'll<00:03:40.450> take<00:03:40.599> a<00:03:40.629> spark<00:03:40.959> really<00:03:41.230> quick<00:03:41.440> I<00:03:41.680> think

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
it'll take a spark really quick I think

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:55.130 
it'll take a spark really quick I think
it<00:03:42.310> might<00:03:42.720> not<00:03:43.720> sure

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:15.920 

spider<00:03:55.980> on

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.260 

maybe<00:04:16.930> not<00:04:17.140> but<00:04:17.950> anyways<00:04:18.280> I'll<00:04:18.850> show<00:04:19.090> what<00:04:19.239> I

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
maybe not but anyways I'll show what I

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:25.470 
maybe not but anyways I'll show what I
