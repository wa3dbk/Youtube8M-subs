00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.059 
necessarily the bigger man it is nice
and<00:03:21.810> he's<00:03:22.170> character<00:03:22.500> models<00:03:22.739> pretty<00:03:22.920> good

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
and he's character models pretty good

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.440 
and he's character models pretty good
like<00:03:23.310> they<00:03:23.400> were<00:03:23.459> good<00:03:23.700> more<00:03:23.819> guys<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:24.060> did

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
like they were good more guys that did

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.880 
like they were good more guys that did
though<00:03:24.629> I<00:03:26.030> really<00:03:27.030> did<00:03:27.180> two<00:03:27.300> packs<00:03:27.569> or<00:03:27.890> was

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
though I really did two packs or was

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.440 
though I really did two packs or was
about<00:03:29.250> three<00:03:29.519> I<00:03:29.550> think<00:03:29.880> because<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.269> initial

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
about three I think because the initial

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.680 
about three I think because the initial
then<00:03:30.870> there<00:03:30.989> was<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.489> outsiders<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:32.640> NWO<00:03:33.450> he

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
then there was the outsiders and NWO he

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.660 
then there was the outsiders and NWO he
was<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.900> final<00:03:34.230> one<00:03:34.319> so<00:03:35.180> three<00:03:36.180> waves<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:37.670> lot

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
was the final one so three waves a lot

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.650 
was the final one so three waves a lot
more<00:03:38.819> they<00:03:38.910> could<00:03:39.030> have<00:03:39.150> dog<00:03:39.299> though<00:03:39.510> because

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
more they could have dog though because

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.550 
more they could have dog though because
I<00:03:39.780> needed<00:03:39.930> hit<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.470> reversal<00:03:40.890> mania<00:03:41.750> well<00:03:42.750> put

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
all the other duo in it probably depends

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.370 
all the other duo in it probably depends
on<00:03:45.299> how<00:03:45.390> much<00:03:45.510> money<00:03:45.750> they're<00:03:45.900> making<00:03:45.930> you

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
think I did the fish like Barrett

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.670 
think I did the fish like Barrett
because<00:05:04.130> it<00:05:04.430> so<00:05:04.580> I'm<00:05:04.700> start<00:05:05.060> right<00:05:05.690> and<00:05:06.440> then

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
because it so I'm start right and then

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.310 
because it so I'm start right and then
they<00:05:06.860> kind<00:05:07.070> understand<00:05:07.520> that<00:05:07.990> they<00:05:08.990> screwed
