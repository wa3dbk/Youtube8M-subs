00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
alright there's a lot of debate whether

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.500 
alright there's a lot of debate whether
you<00:00:02.760> should<00:00:02.820> build<00:00:03.240> your<00:00:03.389> own<00:00:03.419> custom

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
you should build your own custom

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.390 
you should build your own custom
computers<00:00:04.410> or<00:00:04.560> just<00:00:04.830> buy<00:00:04.980> it<00:00:05.040> off<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.250> shelf

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
computers or just buy it off the shelf

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.240 
computers or just buy it off the shelf
I'm<00:00:06.270> going<00:00:06.480> to<00:00:06.569> tell<00:00:06.750> you<00:00:06.779> why<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.440> like<00:00:08.010> to

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
I'm going to tell you why I like to

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.190 
I'm going to tell you why I like to
build<00:00:08.429> my<00:00:08.610> own<00:00:08.639> custom<00:00:09.030> computers<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:09.929> why

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
build my own custom computers and why

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.810 
build my own custom computers and why
someone<00:00:10.650> like<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:11.010> might<00:00:11.250> just<00:00:11.400> want<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.700> buy

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
someone like you might just want to buy

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.879 
someone like you might just want to buy
it<00:00:11.880> off<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.059> shelf<00:00:12.240> there's<00:00:13.110> pros<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.500> cons

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
it off the shelf there's pros and cons

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.160 
it off the shelf there's pros and cons
to<00:00:14.160> both<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.820> really<00:00:15.450> depends<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:16.109> your

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
to both it really depends on your

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.050 
to both it really depends on your
situation<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.160> there's<00:00:17.340> no<00:00:17.520> right<00:00:17.760> or<00:00:17.789> wrong

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
situation and there's no right or wrong

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.900 
situation and there's no right or wrong
all<00:00:19.020> right<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.619> reason<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.189> like<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.699> build

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
all right so the reason I like to build

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.870 
all right so the reason I like to build
my<00:00:21.150> own<00:00:21.180> computers<00:00:21.869> one<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.680> because<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.340> like

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
my own computers one is because I like

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.779 
my own computers one is because I like
to<00:00:23.910> control<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.650> type<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.039> parts<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.640> go

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
to control the type of parts that go

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.540 
to control the type of parts that go
into<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.990> buy<00:00:28.230> one<00:00:28.500> off<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.800> shelf<00:00:28.830> then

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
into it if I buy one off the shelf then

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.179 
into it if I buy one off the shelf then
they<00:00:29.789> might<00:00:30.000> have<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.590> processor<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.800> want

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
they might have a processor that I want

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.490 
they might have a processor that I want
one<00:00:32.520> upgrade<00:00:32.790> later<00:00:33.239> anyway<00:00:33.840> or<00:00:34.140> maybe<00:00:34.320> it's

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
one upgrade later anyway or maybe it's

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.590 
one upgrade later anyway or maybe it's
just<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:34.800> powerful<00:00:35.340> enough<00:00:35.670> for<00:00:35.880> my<00:00:36.120> tastes

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
just not powerful enough for my tastes

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.650 
just not powerful enough for my tastes
and<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:37.170> goes<00:00:37.380> for<00:00:37.649> any<00:00:37.829> component<00:00:38.660> another

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
and that goes for any component another

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.510 
and that goes for any component another
reason<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.140> enjoy<00:00:40.590> doing<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.160> think<00:00:41.219> it's

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
reason is I enjoy doing it I think it's

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.180 
reason is I enjoy doing it I think it's
fun<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.149> watch<00:00:42.480> my<00:00:42.780> computer<00:00:43.170> being<00:00:43.379> built<00:00:43.680> by

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
fun to watch my computer being built by

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.459 
fun to watch my computer being built by
my<00:00:44.430> own<00:00:44.579> self<00:00:44.969> instead<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:46.020> buying<00:00:46.230> it

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
my own self instead of just buying it

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.979 
my own self instead of just buying it
off<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.710> shelf<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.640> maybe<00:00:48.210> put<00:00:48.660> my<00:00:48.840> own

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
off the shelf I like to maybe put my own

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.439 
off the shelf I like to maybe put my own
heart<00:00:49.230> into<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.950> say<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:51.180> third

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
heart into it as to say and the third

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.290 
heart into it as to say and the third
reason<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.020> typically<00:00:52.770> it's<00:00:53.640> easier<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
reason is that typically it's easier to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.380 
reason is that typically it's easier to
upgrade<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:55.699> computer<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.120> build

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
upgrade a computer that you build

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.529 
upgrade a computer that you build
yourself<00:00:57.539> because<00:00:58.469> most<00:00:59.539> store-bought

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
yourself because most store-bought

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.470 
yourself because most store-bought
computers<00:01:01.260> are<00:01:01.590> pretty<00:01:02.129> much<00:01:02.340> locked<00:01:03.120> down

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
computers are pretty much locked down

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.080 
computers are pretty much locked down
they<00:01:03.719> make<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.049> hard<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.650> upgrade<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.549> replace

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
they make it hard to upgrade and replace

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.200 
they make it hard to upgrade and replace
parts<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.590> those<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.010> my<00:01:08.280> three<00:01:08.610> reasons<00:01:09.119> why

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
parts so those are my three reasons why

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.200 
parts so those are my three reasons why
I<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.200> build<00:01:10.710> my<00:01:10.950> own<00:01:10.979> computer<00:01:11.180> now<00:01:12.180> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
I like to build my own computer now a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.510 
I like to build my own computer now a
reason<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.840> might<00:01:13.020> want<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.560> buy<00:01:13.920> your<00:01:14.460> own

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
reason you might want to buy your own

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.310 
reason you might want to buy your own
computer<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.299> right<00:01:15.509> off<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.810> shelf<00:01:16.110> is

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
computer just right off the shelf is

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.219 
computer just right off the shelf is
what<00:01:16.890> mainly<00:01:17.369> because<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.479> easier<00:01:19.020> if

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
what mainly because it's easier if

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.870 
what mainly because it's easier if
you're<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:19.920> someone<00:01:20.280> who's<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.790> be

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
you're not someone who's going to be

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.670 
you're not someone who's going to be
doing<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.270> lot<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.450> gaming<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.049> need<00:01:22.200> super

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
doing a lot of gaming and you need super

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.070 
doing a lot of gaming and you need super
high<00:01:22.860> power<00:01:23.369> processors<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.390> video<00:01:24.630> cards

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
high power processors and video cards

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.870 
high power processors and video cards
and<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.740> are<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.220> doing<00:01:26.340> basic

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and you just are going to be doing basic

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.030 
and you just are going to be doing basic
stuff<00:01:27.119> by<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:27.930> means<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.500> should<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.829> buy

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
stuff by all means you should just buy

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.380 
stuff by all means you should just buy
it<00:01:29.100> off<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.340> shelf<00:01:29.520> you're<00:01:29.970> not<00:01:30.119> going<00:01:30.329> to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
it off the shelf you're not going to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.560 
it off the shelf you're not going to
need<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:31.200> custom<00:01:32.070> pick<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:32.729> your<00:01:33.240> components

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
need to custom pick all your components

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.340 
need to custom pick all your components
specifically<00:01:34.439> for<00:01:35.220> your<00:01:35.340> purposes<00:01:36.020> also<00:01:37.020> if

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
specifically for your purposes also if

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.960 
specifically for your purposes also if
you<00:01:37.380> buy<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> computer<00:01:37.890> off<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.430> shelf<00:01:38.700> it's

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
you buy a computer off the shelf it's

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.030 
you buy a computer off the shelf it's
generally<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:40.049> cheaper<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.770> isn't

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
generally going to be cheaper this isn't

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.590 
generally going to be cheaper this isn't
always<00:01:41.159> true<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.090> true<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.570> general

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
always true but it is true in general

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.960 
always true but it is true in general
and<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.829> third<00:01:44.070> reason<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.610> when<00:01:44.880> you

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
and the third reason is that when you

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.700 
and the third reason is that when you

whenever something goes wrong with my

computer I generally have to fix it

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.410 
computer I generally have to fix it
myself<00:02:09.539> now<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:10.830> hardly<00:02:11.280> ever<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.790> hardware

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
myself now it's hardly ever a hardware

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.760 
myself now it's hardly ever a hardware
issue<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:12.900> usually<00:02:13.230> software

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
issue it's usually software

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.410 
issue it's usually software
which<00:02:13.950> I'm<00:02:14.130> good<00:02:14.370> at<00:02:14.490> fixing<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.090> it's<00:02:15.240> not<00:02:15.390> a

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
which I'm good at fixing so it's not a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.390 
which I'm good at fixing so it's not a
problem<00:02:15.750> but<00:02:16.560> if<00:02:16.710> you're<00:02:16.890> not<00:02:17.010> really

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
problem but if you're not really

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.190 
problem but if you're not really
familiar<00:02:17.580> with<00:02:17.850> computers<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.660> highly

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
familiar with computers I highly

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.450 
familiar with computers I highly
recommend<00:02:19.320> just<00:02:19.770> buying<00:02:19.980> one<00:02:20.130> off<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.430> shelf

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
recommend just buying one off the shelf

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.400 
recommend just buying one off the shelf
because<00:02:20.940> it's<00:02:21.180> definitely<00:02:21.630> going<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.990> be<00:02:22.050> good

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
because it's definitely going to be good

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.320 
because it's definitely going to be good
