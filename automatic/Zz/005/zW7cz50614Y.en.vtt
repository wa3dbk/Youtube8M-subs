00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.700
 after the appearance on the network of these 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.410
 images in which you see some of 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.879
 the endearing characters of the 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.610

 half-naked is édgar vivar who 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.860
 condemns this type of situations 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:29.650
 I felt bad I felt bad for 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.970
 to see what they are doing with the 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.820
 work of so many years in a 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.879
 clean trajectory and with a trajectory 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.920
 familiar and with the innocuous trajectory and 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.110
 that have to contaminate what this 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.870
 way but then it's the risk is so 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.150
 great that there is not having a frame 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.860
 legal support has been able to comment 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.400
 this kind of situation with some of 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.260
 his peers who leave even is the 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.470
 first time I do it in front of the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.840
 means I do not want to abound on that anymore 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.420
 because it is giving more handle to something that does not 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.580
 it 's worth it on the other hand he told us the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.710
 reason why his great friend rubén 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.869
 aguirre could not be present in the 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.320

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.420
 complicated to move up here also everything 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.070
 this was done very fast with a quick 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.740
 the determination was made I think it makes 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.869
 15 real days and since we were talking about 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.820

 I respect it is a personal decision 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.230
 in my particular case I dispensed with 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.900
 keep doing the characters of 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.390
