 the 8 and 17 here did not appear anything you 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:38.429
 they will have to close their cable and 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.429
 put it back 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.280

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.450
 I on your mobile 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:53.229
 you go in settings and design the 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:58.470
 My screen does not need to go in 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:04.390
 settings because when you first 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:07.950
 places if this application is placed can 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.680
 be allow projection natel and telma 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.100
 then you will automatically be 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.040
 projected on your computer screen as 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.600
 I'm showing here let's make a 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.600
 basic test 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.500
 over others 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.080
 about this I will not take one 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.080
 a little 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.709
 this was not the ideal would be that without 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.849
 teachers are updating their 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.670
 Paris 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.670
 You can see that the ranking 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.670
 stock 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:36.590
 the goal of the bugs 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.970
 very gameplay of the game on my phone 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:01.870
 many people use this app 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:04.920
 showing is a game because if you 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.960
 not like it if this app you 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.350
 ended up leaving the finger in front of the screen 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.230
 and this causes a lot of confusion at the time 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.410
 of the video that sometimes I do not like 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.410
 very 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:47.470
 remember 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:48.580
 this and this application to project on 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.259
 screen 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:56.910
 it can be projected on the monitor 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:05:03.340
 in case the computer can be designed 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:08.639
 on the television and can project on the screen 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.639

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:16.710
