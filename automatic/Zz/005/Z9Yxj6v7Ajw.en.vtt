00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:05.740
 welcome again with an unboxing 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.410
 useless at beijing from a small one 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.419
 accessories from manfrotto I am currently at 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.579
 test by different tripods because 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.499
 my little one is here for the euro 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.940
 broken used like 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.620
 So far, this education has been happily used 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.050
 they have not always fulfilled their day 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.310
 are easy if you are with and are 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.540
 actually quite practical I have here 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.550
 One more thing that was not quite so 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.990
 nice I have from kohlmann the 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.340
 I also did not find piccolino ordered 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.470
 so beautiful from the processing ago 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.690
 I still have this from cullmann 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.820
 strong male copter ordered here 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.320
 that's pretty hard and I'll show you 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.539
 later in another video why 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.789
 I feel like I could recover 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.219
 like the manfrotto but also that one 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.569
 photo fix ii is definitely on 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.550
 my list that he likes me 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:47.440
 billionaire wanted to look and 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.300
 Just ordered and I'll try it 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.769
 like this on the back is here 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.940
 that's a bit like you 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.079
 it can be used at one 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.399
 use a small camera or with a camera 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.370
 bigger i still have energy here 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.049
 Two of Panasonic, for example, also weighs 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.389
 under a kilogram and I believe so 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.069
 You can also do 15 kilograms here 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:04.390
 but will it stand still 

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:08.020
 rausstellen and the whole way 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.350
 design the ether because I believe the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.080
 company is also from Italy and the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.850
 packaging is was one of those 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.350
 usually quite frustrating 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.080
 packaging but here are in the 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.970
 left and top two corners like this 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.050
 So openings where you go to the club 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.970
 Can and I have it a bit 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.130
 you can hear the clacking all over here 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.380
 so to speak simply tear open at the back too 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.360
 without scissors even if mine already here 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.370
 is ready so you can speak so to speak 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.870
 pull down and I do now too 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.130
 not at all anymore I think so 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.600
 war the thing is so now 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.310
 just out once a thick roll 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.230
 Paper is here a bit below 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.330
 Of course we still have advertising 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.850
 what I could to me that all of 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.850
 Buy a photo here and then here again 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.820
 a few technical data resp 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:00.040
 that one gram more than 650 it 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:02.110
 should set bird 85 mm and maximum 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.640
 total payload 1 kilogram you have yes 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.870
 exactly the camera should not be more than 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.400
 Weigh 56 grams 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.400
 there are only five years warranty 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.480
 and when transporting you should open it 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.510
 make every case 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.800
 just as much to the one photo fix ii 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.660
 Let's take out the packaging 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.920
 By the way, no light bread is 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.720
 I think I used a lot of metal 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.910
 but it feels good because of it 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.500
 here rather deep has anywhere outside 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.140
 is interesting interesting 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.250
 I can open it all the time 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.710
 pretty easy 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.410
 and then does it say again that is 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:42.630
 mt pixi m patent pending design theory 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.130
 has small rubber feet here so it will 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.680
 not on the table now either 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.020
 and you can slip the angle 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.330
 Freely set, so to speak, are relative 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.040
 smooth but the legs of 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.620
 therefore I would always believe that 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.900
 maximum maximum here so 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.920
 open the now times as a 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.060
 packaging and then you see also 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.000
 something like that from scotland 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:11.490
 stands and I look up here like 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.120
 you can easily move the whole thing 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.120
 not okay 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.819
 you can turn it and if I have it 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.950
 Impressions then you can tourists 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.000
 So you have to press in and then you can 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.190
 to move up here 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.340
 that's pretty hard but is synonymous 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:38.780
 a metal on metal head here around the 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.610
 you just move so to speak and you can 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.500
 that can turn up here too or you can 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.970
 only the part of the turn over well problem 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.590
 Just turn my camera on it 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.220
 to stick or turn on trans 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.360
 By the way, also very handy if you 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.640
 one films, as it were, here , so to speak 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.690
 a small extension with the one the 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.319
 It can always hold a camera 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:04.280
 more comfortable so just gh2 on it 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.110
 stable is definitely so i can 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.379
 Do not move it a bit when I do that 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:13.220
 things are not pure, that is unstable 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.420
 It can not turn up here 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.379
 I have been with the camera now though 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.780
 not on it anymore I actually have to 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.799
 always press the button very much 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.410
 can push hard to clean 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.820
 and then I can do the camera here 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.639
 move relatively well 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.010
 But you hear something like that all the time 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.500
 The metal is bad I think 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.389
 not quite so nice and it's on everyone 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.190
 Do not be as easy as I feel 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.870
 but I would have expected that too 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.430
 already read in several forums 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.960
 maybe I have to do a bit though 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.410
 I think that would not be the purpose of 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.090
 cause because then that holds the thing here 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.349
 In general, not me anymore 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.460
 a little bit of a year to do that 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.200
 from close to watch 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.520
 or I have to go here now 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.930
 sometimes refocus short so and so 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.120
 Do you really see this button here? 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.320
 normally photographed then you move 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.030
 is that the button as far out is 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.530
 but that is already relatively far out 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.190
 and I really have to half 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.229
 push in 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.060
 you can see I do not war the way only 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.650
 partially with my right thumb 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.930
 Under goes you can really maximum 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.690
 push so far and then I can 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.260
 relatively easy even up here 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.240
 move 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.349
 but just now what else 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.139
 Of course, a little bit heavier surfaces have to be done 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:20.090
 something to be discussed here and 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.289
 to be oiled but you have to 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.460
 in fact I always want to be as well 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.080
 much so that one push in the here 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.330
 can move up as soon as you enter 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.159
 let go of that then you then 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.500
 Immediately fix what I do not like 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:31.620
 for example, many others 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.770
 stativen we have such a small front 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:38.080
 excavation here too and at the coleman 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.880
 Mini thing here also means I can the 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.620
 synonymous cameras so synonymous stand up 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.390
 can also do photos that goes here 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.360
 not because it's really all around 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.700
 Everywhere the same built means I can the 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.170
 camera really maximum we have 45 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.480
 degree angle maybe put down if 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.740
 that over 45 degrees are so high 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.460
 Photos are not possible here 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.870
 except, of course, a third has behind 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.790
 down to it with the whole one then 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.610
 corresponding edgewise info screw 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:07.000
 could and yes what you also 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.230
 photo fix ii say i compare that 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.669
 still times briefly even though I 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.060
 will still make separate video 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:15.850
 in addition to the man kullmann 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.810
 that one photo and we sink that is one 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.430
 a bit smaller 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.410
 but why this is better here, I show 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.500
 you later and that was, so to speak 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.270
 I'm here with the pixi until 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.620
 next time my pascal is unfair 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.620
 not to come in here again
