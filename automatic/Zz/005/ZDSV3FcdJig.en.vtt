plate<00:02:20.390> that<00:02:21.390> has<00:02:21.569> been<00:02:21.780> put<00:02:22.020> into<00:02:22.140> this

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
plate that has been put into this

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.890 
plate that has been put into this
instrument<00:02:22.860> for<00:02:22.980> easy<00:02:23.190> cleanup<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:27.480> machine

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
instrument for easy cleanup the machine

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.960 
instrument for easy cleanup the machine
typically<00:02:28.470> runs<00:02:28.739> on<00:02:31.280> two<00:02:32.280> different<00:02:32.700> settings

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
typically runs on two different settings

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.990 
typically runs on two different settings
you<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:34.349> either<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:35.250> four<00:02:35.550> meters<00:02:35.879> per

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
you have either the four meters per

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.910 
you have either the four meters per
second<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.840> goes<00:02:36.989> all<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.230> way<00:02:37.440> up<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.680> six

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
second and it goes all the way up to six

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.600 
second and it goes all the way up to six
meters<00:02:38.250> per<00:02:38.370> second<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:40.160> then<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.400> have<00:02:41.580> a

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
meters per second and then you have a

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.729 
meters per second and then you have a
time<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.480> can<00:02:42.629> go<00:02:42.750> anywhere<00:02:42.930> between<00:02:43.170> 20

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
time so it can go anywhere between 20

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.430 
time so it can go anywhere between 20
seconds<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.370> 60<00:02:44.760> seconds<00:02:45.209> most<00:02:45.750> samples<00:02:46.260> are

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
seconds and 60 seconds most samples are

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.830 
seconds and 60 seconds most samples are
completely<00:02:46.890> lysed<00:02:47.190> within<00:02:47.819> 20<00:02:48.180> seconds<00:02:48.599> but

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
completely lysed within 20 seconds but

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.320 
completely lysed within 20 seconds but
you<00:02:48.930> can<00:02:49.200> choose<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.800> lyse<00:02:49.950> them<00:02:50.250> more<00:02:50.550> than

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
you can choose to lyse them more than

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.930 
you can choose to lyse them more than
that<00:02:51.690> um<00:02:51.989> definitely<00:02:52.860> forty<00:02:53.459> seconds<00:02:53.849> and

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
that um definitely forty seconds and

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.570 
that um definitely forty seconds and
this<00:02:54.000> instrument<00:02:54.330> is<00:02:54.569> much<00:02:54.840> quieter<00:02:55.489> so<00:02:56.489> you

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
this instrument is much quieter so you

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.110 
this instrument is much quieter so you
can<00:02:57.120> add<00:02:57.739> this<00:02:58.739> as<00:02:58.890> lycée<00:02:59.129> matrix<00:02:59.640> and<00:03:00.060> it

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
can add this as lycée matrix and it

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.949 
can add this as lycée matrix and it
contains<00:03:00.510> garnet<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:02.160> sphere<00:03:02.700> all<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.629> did

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
contains garnet and a sphere all I did

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.699 
contains garnet and a sphere all I did
was<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.410> just<00:03:04.500> put<00:03:05.400> some<00:03:05.879> waxy<00:03:06.390> plant<00:03:06.720> into<00:03:07.200> this

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
was I just put some waxy plant into this

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.800

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
doesn't have to be specific size just

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.090 
doesn't have to be specific size just
enough<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.200> fit<00:03:10.380> in<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.560> tomb<00:03:10.770> l2

enough to fit in the tomb l2

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.080 
enough to fit in the tomb l2
it<00:03:12.820> does<00:03:13.270> not<00:03:13.450> have<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.840> be<00:03:13.960> balanced<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:15.090> then

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
it does not have to be balanced and then

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.180 
it does not have to be balanced and then
you're<00:03:16.300> just<00:03:16.480> going<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.900> move<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:17.860> that<00:03:18.070> it

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
you're just going to move it so that it

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.330 
you're just going to move it so that it
covers<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.580> top<00:03:19.530> place<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.740> back<00:03:20.920> into<00:03:21.190> the

covers the top place it back into the
instrument<00:03:23.220> you're<00:03:24.220> going<00:03:24.490> to<00:03:24.640> make<00:03:24.850> sure

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
instrument you're going to make sure

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.440 
instrument you're going to make sure
that<00:03:25.240> it<00:03:25.390> closes<00:03:25.900> until<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.680> hear<00:03:26.830> it<00:03:26.860> click

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
that it closes until you hear it click

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.570 
that it closes until you hear it click
that's<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.770> I'm<00:03:29.770> going<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:30.010> go<00:03:30.310> ahead<00:03:30.400> and

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
that's it I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.000 
that's it I'm going to go ahead and
close<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.150> top<00:03:31.410> there<00:03:32.410> are<00:03:32.530> two<00:03:32.710> emergency

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
close the top there are two emergency

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.370 
close the top there are two emergency
safeties<00:03:33.880> on<00:03:34.150> this<00:03:34.450> instrument<00:03:34.780> there's<00:03:35.110> one

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
safeties on this instrument there's one

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.680 
safeties on this instrument there's one
at<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.530> close<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.280> there's<00:03:36.550> also<00:03:36.760> a<00:03:37.180> button

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
at the close and there's also a button

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.330 
at the close and there's also a button
at<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.900> very<00:03:38.020> front<00:03:38.350> in<00:03:38.590> case<00:03:38.740> you<00:03:39.010> need<00:03:39.190> to

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
at the very front in case you need to

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.390 
at the very front in case you need to
stop<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.880> sample<00:03:40.270> but<00:03:41.080> if<00:03:41.200> you<00:03:41.320> do<00:03:41.620> go<00:03:42.310> ahead

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
stop the sample but if you do go ahead

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.310 
stop the sample but if you do go ahead
and<00:03:42.610> open<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:43.030> top<00:03:43.240> at<00:03:43.420> any<00:03:43.540> time<00:03:43.840> it's<00:03:44.110> going

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
and open the top at any time it's going

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.530 
and open the top at any time it's going

to immediately shut off I'm going to run

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.780 
to immediately shut off I'm going to run
my<00:03:47.130> sample<00:03:48.130> at<00:03:48.220> four<00:03:48.580> meters<00:03:48.970> per<00:03:49.000> second<00:03:50.790> I'm

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
my sample at four meters per second I'm

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.490 
my sample at four meters per second I'm
going<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.030> run<00:03:52.120> my<00:03:52.270> time<00:03:52.510> at<00:03:52.660> twenty<00:03:52.990> seconds

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
going to run my time at twenty seconds

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.330 
going to run my time at twenty seconds
and<00:03:53.740> all<00:03:54.610> I<00:03:54.640> do<00:03:54.790> is<00:03:55.030> hit<00:03:55.150> run<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:57.040> asked<00:03:57.190> me

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
and all I do is hit run and it asked me

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.670 
and all I do is hit run and it asked me
if<00:03:57.430> I'm<00:03:57.520> sure<00:03:57.790> it's<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.180> safety<00:03:58.390> feature

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680

you<00:04:04.069> can<00:04:04.190> see<00:04:04.340> it's<00:04:04.459> very<00:04:04.640> quiet<00:04:04.989> when<00:04:05.989> the

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
you can see it's very quiet when the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.660 
you can see it's very quiet when the
