00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:05.020
 Hello and welcome to Ronald Barnabas breast of Grossmann I am 

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:07.759
 the Vorburg Blatter in these companies and I want them today 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.580
 like to bring some glory and show them what we bring to our breasts 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.390
 and that's the workplace of n-ports man 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.750
 the largest circus in Europe with 400 employees a culprit over 5000 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.150
 Spectators and a lawnmower on 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 they have a new location every week 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.359
 behind it is a huge logistical effort nevertheless the 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.699
 last performance runs Olaf Velte rounds already dismantled I way in question 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.620
 first would have to 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.370
 Hoffmann and his coworkers are led for four years that each of the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.070
 300 wagons tractors and trailers are kept in good shape 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.440
 his workshop is a converted circus trailer with all sorts of important ones 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.309
 paraphernalia 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.940
 He should also be sold 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.300
 a so-called locksmith's for all repair work 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.750
 Welding and so on are responsible 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.830
 We also do the entire technical area here 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.960
 the most important little things 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.750
 Of course you have it immediately 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.680
 Werner, for example, various screws of all sizes but words we are to 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.820
 For example, sometimes very big in home use, of course not in 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.050
 question 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.060
 So these are very special things 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.330
 there we will for example 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
 the mirror attitude which was just changed with the luggage in the vehicle 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.800
 Percent is here several parts of it you can possibly even further 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.570
 toughen 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.440
 on a caravan with repel or an outdated Schweich close to 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.870
 Löwenkäfig her and Ratzmann and renovation no longer parry all text 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.100
 I no longer stand the old Spaniard tractor engine market 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.420
 a workshop does not exist in the square next to the circus tent so will be in the 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.490
 Club screwed and the entire engine simply expanded without further ado 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.300
 that just too old 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.070
 the mileage 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.060
 by far Russell 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.620
 With nearly two million kilometers he has achieved his lessons 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.620
 enough vehicles to be slaughtered November is a software will 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.620
 Of course, the old summer will not be easily thrown away 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.399
 and there we will get parts of it we want 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.099
 the old engine is now loaded on a pallet with the wheel loader 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.129
 and then comes to the junkyard the tractor is also after two 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.799
 Millions of kilometers not sorted out 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:19.499
 rise 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:23.059
 what is a new engine from a scrapped tractor 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.599
 has been expanded and now holds a second life 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.970
 Technology boss despite man is meanwhile again on the way back in his 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.049
 Workshop 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.469
 his previous job with a freight forwarder if not at all 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.729
 He loves to improvise again and again 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.789
 you always meet new people 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:42.159
 it's a new challenge for me 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.749
 For example, this is the case if we have any spare parts 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.170
 he needs to press his phone and the cash register is with the company 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.289
 the spare part gets connected 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:55.099
 Jörg is quite different you have to watch first where I get that was 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.199
 Plant a Nippon that costas as quickly crashed 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.979
 So that's quite exactly under Sachir as if you're somewhere 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:03.979
 constantly 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:05.519
 has the same job 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.650
 For ten years he has exchanged every sammer for his small apartment in Munich 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.950
 against the caravan and live in the small drive the start 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.040
 There is nothing of the kind in the circus 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.940
 whether transportable boxes for the horses ticket booths or lions 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.410
 Cages everything is custom made by partners and his men 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.870
 and lovingly maintained so too the money is of it 300 vehicles 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.260
 a 31 year old Mercedes Benz 608 d is currently being used as an office mobile 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.400
 Total end so far only a mileage of 120000 kilometers 

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:42.730
 Varel 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.020
 Annual mileage at six to eight thousand kilometers more 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:48.999
 we do not do that 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:52.969
 but also 6000 kilometers are six times the distance of 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:55.309
 garmisch-patenkirchen to Flensburg 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:58.650
 while Bernd Hoffmann has to go back to old Skarn's engine 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.810
 Reiner Austermann the Spaniards are artists of the afternoon performance 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.239
 5000 spectators fit in the tent and also for the technology there what you 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.329
 Responsible «Today everything worked out and so the TU Munich in the back 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.109
 do not pick up the phone 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.329
 sometimes the fleet manager also works in the circus, asking questions 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.810
 TV and internet 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.060
 the fascination of circus though he has not lost in over 100 years 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:35.960
 on 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.960
 on Monday 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:45.480
