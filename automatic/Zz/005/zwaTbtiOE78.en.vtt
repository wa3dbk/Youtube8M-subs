00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
lengthwise being very careful not just

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.540 
lengthwise being very careful not just
let<00:00:23.760> me<00:00:23.850> cut<00:00:24.000> your<00:00:24.060> fingers<00:00:25.250> then<00:00:26.250> once<00:00:26.430> you've

cut it in half lengthwise once then you

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.279 
cut it in half lengthwise once then you
will<00:00:29.640> cut<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.910> lengthwise<00:00:30.119> one<00:00:30.570> more<00:00:30.720> time<00:00:30.869> you

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
will cut it lengthwise one more time you

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.100 
will cut it lengthwise one more time you
can<00:00:31.380> either<00:00:31.529> go<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.890> way<00:00:31.949> or<00:00:32.899> from<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> other

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
can either go this way or from the other

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.200 
can either go this way or from the other
direction<00:00:34.290> although<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.610> first<00:00:35.820> way<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:35.969> do

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
direction although the first way to do

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.110 
direction although the first way to do
that<00:00:36.329> you're<00:00:36.540> less<00:00:36.690> likely<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.989> cut<00:00:37.170> yourself

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
that you're less likely to cut yourself

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.090 
that you're less likely to cut yourself
okay<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.450> now<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:39.870> fourths<00:00:40.410> it's

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
okay and now that you have fourths it's

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.220 
okay and now that you have fourths it's
very<00:00:41.340> easy<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.730> remove<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.149> seeds<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.660> how

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
very easy to remove the seeds and how

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.510 
very easy to remove the seeds and how
you<00:00:43.290> remove<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> seeds<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.070> you'll<00:00:44.190> take<00:00:44.309> each

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
you remove the seeds is you'll take each

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.180 
you remove the seeds is you'll take each
fourth<00:00:44.850> lay<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.899> knife<00:00:46.020> almost<00:00:46.260> flat<00:00:46.710> but

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
fourth lay the knife almost flat but

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.069 
fourth lay the knife almost flat but
just<00:00:47.340> at<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> slight<00:00:47.820> maybe<00:00:48.210> 15<00:00:48.570> or<00:00:48.690> 20<00:00:48.899> degree

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
just at a slight maybe 15 or 20 degree

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.670 
just at a slight maybe 15 or 20 degree
angle<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.890> slice<00:00:50.670> along<00:00:50.820> yeah<00:00:51.600> once<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.530> get

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
angle and slice along yeah once you get

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.680 
angle and slice along yeah once you get
to<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.920> end<00:00:53.160> or<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.000> see<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> end<00:00:54.329> sticking

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
to the end or you see the end sticking

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.729 
to the end or you see the end sticking
out<00:00:54.840> then<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.079> want<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.230> grab<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.410> with<00:00:55.649> your

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
out then you want to grab that with your

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.180 
out then you want to grab that with your
finger<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.219> slice<00:00:56.789> away<00:00:57.030> from<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.190> then

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
finger and slice away from you and then

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.830 
finger and slice away from you and then
you<00:00:59.340> remove<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.820> seeds<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.539> clean<00:01:00.750> up

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
you remove the seeds you can clean up

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.340 
you remove the seeds you can clean up
any<00:01:00.989> little<00:01:01.320> extra<00:01:01.739> bits<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:03.350> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
any little extra bits that you have and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.520 
any little extra bits that you have and
the<00:01:05.339> reason<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:06.080> recipes<00:01:07.080> will<00:01:07.200> often<00:01:07.409> say

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the reason that recipes will often say

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.080 
the reason that recipes will often say
to<00:01:07.560> take<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.830> seeds<00:01:08.040> out<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.369> jalapeno<00:01:08.909> is

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
to take the seeds out of a jalapeno is

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.289 
to take the seeds out of a jalapeno is
that<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.420> how<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.630> regulate<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.229> heat<00:01:10.409> so

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
that it's how you regulate the heat so

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.850 
that it's how you regulate the heat so
the<00:01:12.299> seeds<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.780> then<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.049> pithy<00:01:13.439> membranous

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
the seeds and then this pithy membranous

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.350 
the seeds and then this pithy membranous
part<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.369> later<00:01:14.670> colored<00:01:15.000> part<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
part this later colored part in the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.910 
part this later colored part in the
middle<00:01:15.600> are<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.290> hottest<00:01:16.500> part<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
middle are the hottest part of the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.219 
middle are the hottest part of the
jalapeno<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.689> green<00:01:18.840> part<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.140> actually

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
jalapeno the the green part is actually

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.560 
jalapeno the the green part is actually
where<00:01:19.530> most<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> flavor<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:21.450> you

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
where most of the flavor is so if you

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.570 
where most of the flavor is so if you
want<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:22.140> lot<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.710> flavor<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.189> little<00:01:23.400> heat

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
want a lot of flavor just a little heat

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.609 
want a lot of flavor just a little heat
and<00:01:23.759> not<00:01:24.030> much<00:01:24.240> then<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.990> would<00:01:25.140> remove<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
and not much then you would remove the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.640 
and not much then you would remove the
pith<00:01:25.799> out<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.369> all<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.869> quarters<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
pith out of all of the quarters of the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.280 
pith out of all of the quarters of the
jalapeno<00:01:28.979> if<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.909> want<00:01:30.030> half<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.630> heat<00:01:30.960> then

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
jalapeno if you want half the heat then

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.050 
jalapeno if you want half the heat then
obviously<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:31.950> leave<00:01:32.040> happen<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
obviously you can leave happen if you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.090 
obviously you can leave happen if you
want<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.390> little<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.930> you're<00:01:34.799> cutting<00:01:34.950> at

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
want just a little and you're cutting at

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.440 
want just a little and you're cutting at
multiple<00:01:35.430> jalapenos<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.270> leave

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
multiple jalapenos you can just leave

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.740 
multiple jalapenos you can just leave
the<00:01:36.570> seeds<00:01:36.780> from<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.990> quarter<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:38.750> I'm
