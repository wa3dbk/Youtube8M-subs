you<00:01:03.870> never<00:01:03.989> heard<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.530> that's<00:01:04.739> right

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you never heard of it that's right

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.410 
you never heard of it that's right
because<00:01:05.100> he<00:01:05.369> had<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> pump<00:01:05.820> before<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.299> was

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
because he had a pump before that was
