00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.949

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.779
 we are here they consumed an interview 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.070
 and good 8 - are prepared interviewed 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.779

 come on what is your favorite song 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.910
 good my favorite song right now 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.600
 because I have many but I do not know 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.260
 I'm listening to the enough that is 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.100
 very fashionable is that of the bag was that 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.840
 that good 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.829
 sometimes he also listens to reggaeton and 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:52.510
 you must say it but but it's good the voice 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.899
 if you had a pet which one would you choose 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.270
 it may be from a dog but it does 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.920
 I would always like to have a horse 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.290
 well I learned to ride a horse and 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.640
 I love horses 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.700
 what is your goal on youtube 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.010
 paprika youtube is what has been 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.680
 reached a number of writers 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.720
 big enough to get to the million is like 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.300
 any dream is not the dream that I have 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.810
 what is entered from those who have 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.280
 your assets that support me in all 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.979
 videos and good now that I do not complain one 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.759
 at the moment I have that I hope to grow a lot 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.040
 plus 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.000
 if you have to take between youtube and you 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.460
 life I would choose 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.520
 to see obviously in my life because I 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.150
 this authority on youtube and I have nothing 4 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.340
 200 months 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.290
 and although I love that also 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.810
 disconnected a little bit of real life and 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.180
 all that but I would not change anything to my 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.300
 friends to the people who are there in the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.190
 Real life does not go for you what is your best 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.350
 tour of your channel 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.510
 Well, I think it's clear that the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.920
 better trolleys let's say the one that visits the most 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.780
 has the one that has made my most famous 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.550
 channel is the 15 to wells 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.260
 the rat child on youtube 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.940
 and that I think would be better though 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.560
 for me, I enjoyed myself more 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.869
 another three times because he still did not speak 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.030
 I taught him the voice and then later I would 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.650
 oil paintings made with the voice I think 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.780
 which has been better but good with say 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.740
 that has been the one we marked 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.830
 you have in mind to do in fact in your 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.950
 channel Yes I have thought about it like 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.870
 the face is worth eight thousand 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.850
 new and have subscribers teach it 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.830
 also in a live the tweet I have 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.530
 thought of direct areas in tweets in 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.090
 youtube and if I plan to do it happens 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.680
 I have to learn how to make them 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.580
 because I still have no idea the truth 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:43.270
 ok and your favorite food and why 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.550
 I love seafood 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.060
 because because I come from living in a 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.480
 sea ​​coast area of ​​the uex I like 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.030
 much the seafood some funny memory 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.590
 of your childhood 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.500
 I still remember that that day I was the 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.730
 typical child that the typical book of the 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:10.130
 class 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:12.200
 I from since elementary school and put me there 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.850
 three kids to three girls and I would get 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.480
 to kiss her 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.900
 all that 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.980
 and the truth that I remember now and 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.790
 none of them was doing that anymore 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.790
