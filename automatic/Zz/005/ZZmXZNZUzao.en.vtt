heart that was with the total price you

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:19.720 
heart that was with the total price you
know<00:02:18.230> why<00:02:18.379> cuz<00:02:18.920> that<00:02:19.010> shrunk<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.549> price

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
know why cuz that shrunk the price

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.429 
know why cuz that shrunk the price
difference<00:02:20.000> much<00:02:20.599> smaller<00:02:20.810> smaller<00:02:21.049> and

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
difference much smaller smaller and

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.750 
difference much smaller smaller and
smaller<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:22.010> he<00:02:22.099> didn't<00:02:22.250> want<00:02:22.370> put<00:02:22.489> them<00:02:22.640> in

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
in the power slide maybe I'll look yes

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.319 
in the power slide maybe I'll look yes
but<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.769> can<00:02:31.159> build<00:02:31.340> an<00:02:31.459> ass-kicking<00:02:31.970> system

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
but I can build an ass-kicking system

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.490 
but I can build an ass-kicking system
for<00:02:32.480> right<00:02:32.629> around<00:02:32.659> I<00:02:33.049> can<00:02:33.200> build<00:02:33.379> an

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
for right around I can build an

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.289 
for right around I can build an
ass-kicking<00:02:34.040> system<00:02:34.430> but<00:02:34.609> the<00:02:34.790> one<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.030> just

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
ass-kicking system but the one I just

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:36.729 
ass-kicking system but the one I just
built<00:02:35.510> with<00:02:35.720> ass<00:02:35.870> chicken<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.379> was<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.620> ass

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
built with ass chicken so was it ass

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.170 
built with ass chicken so was it ass
kickin<00:02:37.069> or<00:02:37.189> not<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.489> said<00:02:37.609> it<00:02:37.730> would<00:02:37.849> kick<00:02:38.060> the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
kickin or not you said it would kick the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.720 
kickin or not you said it would kick the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
 out of a Mac imac 27-inch and now

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.979 
 out of a Mac imac 27-inch and now
you're<00:02:40.909> saying<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.209> can<00:02:41.420> build<00:02:41.659> a<00:02:41.810> kick-ass

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:45.469 
chick ass system why are you talking

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:48.670 
chick ass system why are you talking
about<00:02:46.299> grand<00:02:47.299> even<00:02:47.599> and<00:02:47.959> that<00:02:48.079> includes<00:02:48.439> the
