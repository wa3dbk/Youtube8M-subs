 in the world everything except that it's a financial ransom 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.909
 incredibly long because there are piles of material and it is drawn 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:30.189

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.500
 to control his nerves 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.750
 it's a bit boring

 and in addition I find it hard to hide everything small it is true that marine around 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.720
 two 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.370
 obligatorily if she enters a box knows that she is defined small and 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.230
 that young people are even smaller around 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.230

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.590
 I do not define myself as an actor so yes obviously 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.750

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.920
 too much the waves 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.410
 but playing we'll say that anyway and in love with stopping eight ringing 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.640

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.210

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.320
 so so burgundy too a big back folder and a big empty 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.440
 that's what surrounds us thank you an hour ago 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.100
 and that was at 14 years old and with what I was doing in the 300 members all 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.719
 weekends 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.979
 so yes to already young I started to roll and then after 16 years 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.580

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.620
 all traffic and with an old peugeot cahors of the war with a group to 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.980
 the rear 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.270
 and two mandanda forks that were welded together that made a 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.160
 fun stuff were supporting 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.420

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.390
 nothing this side enemy its share the euro to profit 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.769
 dentists the war bikes with clutch tank sound speeds 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.299
 wet so like that 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.129

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.829
 night battery at all 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.829
 I keep it in my garage how we would keep an old painting 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.280
 we can marvel at looking at the same table every day me a 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:30.950
 harley it's the same ccl 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.950

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:40.139
 water for that vague motorcycles see where she came back on motorcycle mag a little bit 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.139
 like that just for the release of the album of the album 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.349
 to come back to the sources is true that I started my career with 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:51.290
 was at the time called the pavement in the pond so much of the magazine 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:52.969
 who became a motorcycle mag 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.959
 that's it and at the time well yeah I had my little side of where they got them 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.289
 helped it's true that I was already relegated 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:01.909
 and at the time I was working in baker magazines that had packed with 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.789
 mail car very dreamy to oxea and our sector with its land 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:10.229
 and yeah my little side of the shin and that's in this brothel magazine art the 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.609
 things and bakers who drink who smoke who rolled without a helmet 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.089
 and after when I was working, obviously the mutual bikers 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:20.369
 land and pavement in the pond it was necessarily full face helmet 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:24.959
 on a harley it was obligatorily him in the approved jacket 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.569
 here it is, but hey it's a little bit of security too mixed but by 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.929
 example my bike I kiffais workers ben it's my security is not 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:35.229
 to piss off and god just knows that places they do not hear when they 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:38.809
 are at their car suddenly accelerate a little bit forci have not seen my 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.249
 a dream heard I push 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:44.680

 and she swung titin with the next number behind but I never 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.559
 done because it's seriously 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:04:00.769
 and so the pond 13140 springer revealed that sonnex obviously not 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.079
 need to mark the mark it is seen immediately not need that is a logo 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.129
 somewhere 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.169
 and so that 13140 springer but to climb anyway better than the help of 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:10.449
 38 see the afp 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.079

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.149

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.110
