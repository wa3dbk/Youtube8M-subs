extremely<00:02:44.310> extremely<00:02:44.910> fascinating<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.630> don't

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
extremely extremely fascinating I don't

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.760

demonstration not demonstration it's

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.250 
demonstration not demonstration it's
faster<00:02:49.709> than<00:02:49.800> that<00:02:49.980> but<00:02:50.640> up<00:02:50.910> so<00:02:51.209> this<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:52.080> was

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
faster than that but up so this this was

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.840 
faster than that but up so this this was
