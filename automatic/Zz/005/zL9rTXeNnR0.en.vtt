00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.950
 not so often games appear on Evraz 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.290
 who take and do not let go but the very 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.209
 the moment when the screen appear 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:12.660
 the final credits and in one of these cyber i 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.190
 and want to talk to you right now 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.910
 My name is or Cossack 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.910
 and we start 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.680
 in Yerevan 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.870
 in the world train km 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.160
 5 May 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.010
 I think the property 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.400
 attention but us 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.060
 2 seen 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.060
 with 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.830
 in Samara, defenders are neglected 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.840
 however, as the saying goes 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.110
 I killed 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.030
 in the field of migration 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.150
 total amount 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.130
 In general, I immediately want to start with the fact that 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.290
 games like up to 8 5 I just did not see 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.049
 passage 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.799
 ask birds and racing 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.569
 all sorts of variations already seated 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:16.560
 liver farm 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.570
 it's all there 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.380
 but Claire stands also co-respondents 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.040
 graphics and at least excellent 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.460
 exciting fini linear plot 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.689
 as it was not here 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.619
 yes it's time zombies so tired but something all 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.779
 still prompted me to load and load 

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:30.310
 appstore 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.210
 and not a dime of those five spent 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.689
 dollars I did not regret really difficult 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.630
 talk about this game and show 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.500
 the actual gameplay itself 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.730
 the plot of the game is so strong that the slightest 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.020
 spoiler spoil you all points of view 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.640
 so we only look at 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.799
 first scene first episode one-sided g 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.000
 core games on Robert Comics 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.140
 kirkman maybe even watched 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.950
 eponymous series but now we are all the same 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.180
 let's talk about I'm afraid of the game 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.150
 action of the first episode up to 8 years 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.170
 starts with the main characters 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.140
 black man by name and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.080
 with deep voice and focused 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.229
 facial expression rides in a police car 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.610
 to serve his sentence 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.540
 crime 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.390
 the details of what he did you can 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.240
 find out by no longer gonna spoil you 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.440
 impression if you decide 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.589
 purchase a game 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:16.839
 however during the trip 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.449
 tied up with a cop 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:20.119
 conversations happen unexpected 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.889
 fascinated by chatter cop gets in 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.979
 traffic accident beating down 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:26.740
 man standing on the road 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.540
 and only by that we know that it was in the hay 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.540
 man and the real zombie with 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.520
 of this moment your begins 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.340
 active participation in the development of the plot 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.330
 the line is burning as befits any game 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.580
 ringing the bebeshko diacats of the dead here 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.190
 not done but worth noting that shooting 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.240
 coachman wife cleaned the floor on cotton and 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.580
 the charge of a rotten zombie is not 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.970
 task players fine-tuning mdm vice versa 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.790
 meeting stone deaths and so much 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.550
 communication comes to the fore 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.290
 protagonist relationship with 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.730
 other game characters and 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.000
 most often what you say with these 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.150
 characters do not forget that 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.850
 the result affects the development of the plot in 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.269
 further 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.370
 This is the game that holds the player in 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.040
 voltage almost every second even 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.219
 if you just peacefully communicate with few 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.269
 survivors in the plan need to watch out for 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.090
 language player yourself understand that 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.400
 turned up in a police car 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.769
 not at all by chance and probably about it 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.189
 better not to spread 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:25.090
 although your rights are overwhelming 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.709
 most dialogue with the game character 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.540
 there are three or four answer choices and you 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.430
 can choose the one that suits you 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.069
 more than one thing but your english should 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.279
 be quite good without 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:37.519
 his knowledge will be very problematic 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.519
 deal with what is happening on the screen 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:44.009
 outwardly paint player stylized as 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:45.889
 comics I mentioned earlier 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.409
 bring up it looks great 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:49.969
 true after a few minutes of play 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.089
 May third generation 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:54.389
 perceptibly heated like a game 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.279
 uses resource devices to the maximum 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:59.239
 and it shows the graphics of the game can be set 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.839
 solid top five the same goes for and 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:03.939
 sound all the characters voiced by different 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.259
 actors and has its own character what for 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:07.739
 watering sigre agree 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.300
 interesting enough 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.970
 although all the same justice 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.140
 It is worth noting that the game is a port 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.140
 glasses 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.039
 up to 8 years old honestly reminded the north and 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.610
 although of course the plot to last 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.400
 can not 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.470
 but what we have is worthy now 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.070
 to go scratch thoughtfully nape and 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.680
 get everything inside the game 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.430
 the remaining episodes dvorkin g is the most 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.550
 real fascinating 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.229
 interactive movies in which there were children on 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.370
 how events will develop 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.830
 episodes from second to fifth last bye 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.650
 unavailable can be bought for 15 bucks or 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.210
 individually each for $ 5 at the end 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.860
 each episode by the way you will see 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.930
 short teaser for the scuds of the next 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:55.510
 parts 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.670
 after the passage of the first episode with me 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.620
 no doubt about that 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.539
 whether to buy the rest or not 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.659
 and I advise you to try and on this 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.869
 all subscribe to the finger bet channel
