00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 who knows if the serious ones in front of 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.170
 you don't know all the elements 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.500
 would like to know why i don't believe in 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.870
 fatigue I think kg are things that 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.900
 he could not stand morally not 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.050
 so it is difficult to descend to evaluate not 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.750
 they have their elements of ciapÃ  

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.580
 everyone talks but nobody really knows a 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.039
 chicken and who says what he wrote 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.820
 no one has ever, if anything, perished of no 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.399
 however, he will make an argument and the other must 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.620
 these days in sanremo sanremo why 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.250
 you are never given to sanremo you do not tell me 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.840
 that we invited him turns out that vi 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.730
 they invited but you always say no 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.730
 but because we feel inadequate 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.969
 another kind of strength to face 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.789
 we will need to talk about current events 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.250
 in a ridiculous manner what it involves 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.809
 at that moment people are not us 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.080
 capable of taking things from me 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.880
 but the word comes back into fashion 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.290
 nanny who you think those are 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.750
 that historically have in Sanremo 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.020
 worked better before and come on 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.060
 benin in absolute that forces of the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.250
 nature among other things this year there is a 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.990
 your friend sanremo 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.030
 in the end I want to say that there is in 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.900
 different then does not tell us what they are 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.300
 our 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:33.690
 which I am I of her resident 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.200
 away for those who know him of theirs 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.960
 but perhaps for the first three months 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:45.080
 euro giacomino however and then I can say 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.080
 which is that I made my dependencies 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.950
 which were not paid directly 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.290
 maybe it's not so much you maybe had been 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.320
 you paid for it does not even ve 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.800
 185 I was village chief in a 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.460
 village in sardinia and he was me 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.070
 presented this Mr Poretti and the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.580
 lighting technician to do it 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.310
 show him lentuli timidly 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.950
 it operated 23 screens then after 23 days 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.880
 he said no but I would also have a 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.420
 musical group but did not believe it 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.209
 nobody 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.920
 this is true because in those months in those 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.750
 years the phenomenon of the roads was born 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.730
 around him to live at the beginning with 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.190
 like all of us did these 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.549
 odd jobs wasn't as good as 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.430
 no technician is much better as 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:42.600
 singer line and then where you have it 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.120
 met again well but milan zelig that 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.299
 real they also hung out with 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.430
 the environment, a frequent visitor to the premises 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.560
 or botanical what is therefore in the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.060
 early evening everything that is in his first of 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.820
 he has had great success what is the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.310
 secret of and sculptures that do not 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.190
 takes seriously 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.310
 gironi is certainly then the technique 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.290
 of the music their good name was I have 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.350
 great musicians look like scoundrels 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.480
 but in reality the high musical quality 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.200
 of great musical quality and then the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.120
 presence and it is to remove irony on the 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.490
 popular song goes with 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.760
 graduated in flute in one of the 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.730
 90 Stefano Belisari all seem to be 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.040
 stupid but is a cultured person in certain 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.490
 studies except that the technician of the 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.580
 home lighting and indeed the death was mounted 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:42.240
 sanctioning net fighter 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:45.040
 have fans and we know it littizzetto 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.080
 check what to cross when we have 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.900
 done something with an appearance 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.170
 decision is really so much fun 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.390
 because he is very improvised as 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.650
 so he too catches the things that 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:02.950
 which are born on the fly so it is a very one 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.020
 funny and very nice louis 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.240
 people write good morning now 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.040
 used to seeing them always together 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.440
 but outside the scenes you are bound by a 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.440
 really friendship relationship everyone goes 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.049
 on his way 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.230
 well it depends on doing things together 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.200
 also for example special trips 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.230
 now then they were very close to each other 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.940
 now they are just family, but they do 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.060
 we always do things together 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.750
 of journeys more than one put in 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.510
 Iceland 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.400
 together we were at general apple for 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.180
 a round that of the round follows 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.570
 however, he likes to travel not me 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.850
 if you were running we would say that while they 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.669
 they do the half I do 10 kilometers 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.620
 no more because I can't stand more for 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.800
 now i like to run so i 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:58.600
 take advantage the company is nice for 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.880
 which it is right to abide I still write on 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.810
 my world is the intellectual of 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.000
 group everyone has their things 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.590
 they say that in Padua while washing them 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.220
 on tour just a few days ago 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.290
 as he ran not know what 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.270
 I made tornadoes for antiquarian books 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:21.060
 yes yes yes it is so 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.440
 get to the news to believe that the 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:29.320
 journalism function to let a 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:30.760
 sea always reduce digital where ever it is 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.040
 then never that her 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.440
 a curiosity you did this book 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.320
 that you presented together 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.380
 for example from fazio etcetera 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.810
 but this fact that he writes him 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.760
 your eyes look the same 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.420
 what it means if it is so the idea that if 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.129
 put this intellectualistic screen 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:56.869
 it will be necessary to pay well 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:06:00.610
 him for some time that in this vein then 

00:05:56.869 --> 00:06:04.339
 in the sense that it has already begun 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.319
 I started writing scale writing 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:09.289
 a little bit already at the time of theater coffee 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:11.869
 that I remember it was something that 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:13.969
 he liked it very much he always had it then 

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:16.159
 I discovered one thing that most 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:19.069
 part did not find that his 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:22.879
 book read backwards and equal then 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:24.289
 it was really dance not yet 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:27.229
 in the are still understood how much it is 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:28.279
 palindrome palindrome is never heard 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:34.129
 in reverse 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:36.110
 drills is, however, does not seem to know 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:37.550
 no now they need fulvio says 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.979
 let's talk about serious things 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.319
 what was your first thought 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:44.059
 when did you hear that balotelli 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:46.459
 would have passed to the inter and that uses the 

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:46.939
 direct to Milan with you Milan to 

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:48.439
 milan 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:50.419
 the writer this is not a 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:53.029
 optional but he still loves the happy 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:54.649
 where it is clear that a slip would be 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:57.199
 passed to Milan and what you would say to him 

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:59.689
 executive now we were at lunch 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:01.909
 together I don't know a colleague of yours given one 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:05.059
 what sense goods would be ugly 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:07.459
 without aldo the aldo urine was passed 

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:09.979
 mourinho ie large also do not deny 

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:12.889
 the platini you explain then that 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:16.789
 they seem to be warm to the game we were 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:19.369
 at lunch with several top days on 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:21.349
 newspapers to the press and marco castelnuovo 

00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:22.999
 here it is great Interista great notes 

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:26.419
 journalist but this comes later 

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:28.099
 cited work I thought risks that 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:33.700
 is that the only source asked him badly 

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:36.310
 what excuse me now but you 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.610
 what do you think of balotelli at least from 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.980
 I would be worried if zanetti 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:46.530
 he had a very great response that leads me 

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.530
 There are always two flags in the teams
