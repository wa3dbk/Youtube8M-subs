all-in-ones

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.700

for anybody that might not know what an
all-in-one<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.369> it's<00:00:17.670> essentially<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
all-in-one is it's essentially the

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.410 
all-in-one is it's essentially the
monitor<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.470> computer<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.279> desktop<00:00:20.420> computer

with<00:00:21.930> everything<00:00:22.439> else<00:00:22.560> built-in<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.310> there's

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
with everything else built-in so there's

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.820 
with everything else built-in so there's
no<00:00:23.580> need<00:00:23.760> for<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:24.000> tower<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.630> tens<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.650> tens

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
no need for a tower and tens and tens

to<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:30.990> accessories<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:31.800> that's<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.250> much

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
to the accessories it's that's a much

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.450 
to the accessories it's that's a much
simpler<00:00:32.850> way<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.800> making<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.890> desktop<00:00:35.280> computer

simpler way of making a desktop computer
so<00:00:36.300> Dells<00:00:36.750> got<00:00:37.020> one<00:00:37.230> HP's<00:00:37.739> got<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.190> Lenovo

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
so Dells got one HP's got one Lenovo

so Dells got one HP's got one Lenovo
apples<00:00:39.270> had<00:00:39.450> one<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.809> long<00:00:39.989> time

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469

Asus Acer we don't have time to look at
everyone's<00:00:43.020> different<00:00:43.410> model<00:00:43.739> today<00:00:43.920> but

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
everyone's different model today but

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.819 
everyone's different model today but
this<00:00:45.000> video<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.710> that's

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
this video do you think that that's

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.889 
this video do you think that that's
going<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.190> take<00:00:47.309> over<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.149> traditional<00:00:48.300> tower

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
going to take over the traditional tower

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.100 
going to take over the traditional tower
and<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.649> monitor<00:00:49.980> setup<00:00:50.780> we're<00:00:51.780> not<00:00:51.870> really

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
and the monitor setup we're not really

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.569 
and the monitor setup we're not really
going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> talk<00:00:52.440> about<00:00:52.559> touch<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.250> really

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
going to talk about touch here I really

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.330 
going to talk about touch here I really
don't<00:00:53.789> think<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.090> touch<00:00:54.530> as<00:00:55.530> Apple<00:00:56.070> put<00:00:56.250> it

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
don't think that touch as Apple put it

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.150 
don't think that touch as Apple put it
in<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.760> vertical<00:00:57.149> position<00:00:57.620> is<00:00:58.620> going<00:00:59.100> to

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
in the vertical position is going to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.549 
in the vertical position is going to
take<00:00:59.340> off<00:00:59.550> touch<00:01:00.210> as<00:01:00.449> they<00:01:00.660> said<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.170> they're

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
take off touch as they said and they're

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.869 
take off touch as they said and they're
really<00:01:01.680> quite<00:01:01.859> right<00:01:02.129> needs<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.670> remain

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
really quite right needs to remain

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.579 
really quite right needs to remain
horizontally<00:01:03.629> hence<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.140> Magic<00:01:04.439> Trackpad

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
horizontally hence the Magic Trackpad

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.950 
horizontally hence the Magic Trackpad
even<00:01:05.100> though<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.549> not<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.960> perfect

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
even though that is not a perfect

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.960 
even though that is not a perfect
product<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.560> could<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.130> here<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.700> Dell

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
product that it could be so here on Dell

than<00:01:20.670> regular<00:01:21.119> computers<00:01:21.810> at<00:01:22.680> first<00:01:22.979> they

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
than regular computers at first they

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.649 
than regular computers at first they
weren't<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:23.670> powerful<00:01:24.150> they<00:01:24.360> were<00:01:24.390> much<00:01:24.630> more

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
weren't as powerful they were much more

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.539 
weren't as powerful they were much more
expensive<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.470> was<00:01:25.530> really<00:01:25.799> kind<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.250> check

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
expensive it was really kind of a check

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.660 
expensive it was really kind of a check
this<00:01:26.700> out<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.240> new<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.950> now<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.430> really

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
this out this is new and now it's really

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.289 
this out this is new and now it's really
becoming<00:01:30.680> not<00:01:31.680> new<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.400> mean<00:01:32.700> they're<00:01:33.030> all<00:01:33.119> over

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
becoming not new I mean they're all over

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.330 
becoming not new I mean they're all over
the<00:01:33.360> place<00:01:33.420> now<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.170> Dell<00:01:34.590> has<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.130> here

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
the place now and Dell has this one here

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.440 
the place now and Dell has this one here
the<00:01:35.460> Inspiron<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:37.369> just<00:01:38.369> had<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> number<00:01:38.880> but

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the Inspiron one I just had a number but

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.609 
the Inspiron one I just had a number but
it<00:01:39.509> looks<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:39.750> they've<00:01:39.900> got<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> couple<00:01:40.259> here

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
it looks like they've got a couple here

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.889 
it looks like they've got a couple here
and<00:01:41.180> they're<00:01:42.180> definitely<00:01:42.299> more<00:01:42.720> expensive

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
and they're definitely more expensive

who they are the essential idea center

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.030 
who they are the essential idea center

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
and then the think center thinks that

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.979 
and then the think center thinks that
are<00:03:24.130> being<00:03:24.280> for<00:03:24.459> business<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.239> idea<00:03:25.269> center

you're<00:05:11.320> stuck<00:05:11.650> with<00:05:11.830> the<00:05:11.920> specs<00:05:12.190> that<00:05:12.310> you

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
you're stuck with the specs that you

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.750 
you're stuck with the specs that you
have<00:05:12.700> and<00:05:12.910> I<00:05:12.940> realized<00:05:13.330> that<00:05:13.770> for<00:05:14.770> me<00:05:14.920> you<00:05:15.640> know

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
have and I realized that for me you know

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.580 
have and I realized that for me you know
getting<00:05:16.180> a<00:05:16.240> new<00:05:16.360> computer<00:05:16.480> every<00:05:16.900> few<00:05:17.080> years<00:05:17.380> I

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
getting a new computer every few years I

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.560 
getting a new computer every few years I
would<00:05:17.890> probably<00:05:18.100> go<00:05:18.490> with<00:05:18.520> an<00:05:18.790> iMac<00:05:19.120> or<00:05:19.390> if<00:05:19.480> I

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
would probably go with an iMac or if I

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.660 
would probably go with an iMac or if I
went<00:05:19.750> back<00:05:19.780> to<00:05:19.900> PCs<00:05:20.410> Lenovo<00:05:21.100> probably<00:05:21.550> not

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
went back to PCs Lenovo probably not

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.760 
went back to PCs Lenovo probably not
Dell<00:05:21.940> probably<00:05:22.930> not<00:05:23.050> even<00:05:23.140> HP<00:05:23.500> I'd<00:05:23.590> probably

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
Dell probably not even HP I'd probably

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.090 
Dell probably not even HP I'd probably
go<00:05:23.980> with<00:05:24.040> that<00:05:24.130> Lenovo<00:05:24.520> IDs<00:05:24.940> Center<00:05:25.210> so<00:05:26.200> it

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
go with that Lenovo IDs Center so it

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.260 
go with that Lenovo IDs Center so it
