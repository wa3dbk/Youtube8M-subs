00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.219 
SkyDrive and then you want to go to your
computer<00:01:38.369> which<00:01:39.030> I'll<00:01:39.270> do<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.570> let<00:01:40.110> this

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
computer which I'll do this let this

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.740 
computer which I'll do this let this
happen<00:01:40.409> quickly<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.040> it'll<00:01:41.430> upload<00:01:42.240> so

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
happen quickly so it'll upload so

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.539 
happen quickly so it'll upload so
depending<00:01:43.649> on<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:43.799> upload<00:01:44.100> speed<00:01:44.130> this

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
depending on your upload speed this

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.170 
depending on your upload speed this
could<00:01:44.729> take<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.939> lot<00:01:45.270> longer<00:01:45.479> than<00:01:46.850> like<00:01:47.850> then

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
could take a lot longer than like then

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.889 
could take a lot longer than like then
normal<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.649> that's<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.189> going<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.720> slow<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
normal so that's just going to slow the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.130 
normal so that's just going to slow the
upload<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.530> then<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.430> your<00:01:53.610> computer<00:01:54.140> you've

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.340 
and I'm pretty sure the video if I just
double<00:02:54.540> check<00:02:54.840> oh<00:02:56.630> one<00:02:57.630> second<00:02:58.050> minimize

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
double check oh one second minimize

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.490 
double check oh one second minimize
minimize<00:02:59.269> I'll<00:03:00.269> just<00:03:00.780> look<00:03:00.870> at<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.140> one<00:03:01.319> I

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
minimize I'll just look at this one I

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.020 
minimize I'll just look at this one I
think<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:02.220> records<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:04.400> details<00:03:05.400> yeah<00:03:05.910> it
