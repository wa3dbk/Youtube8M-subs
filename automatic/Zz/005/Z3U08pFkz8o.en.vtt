performance<00:00:18.769> face<00:00:19.060> we've<00:00:20.060> talked<00:00:20.390> about<00:00:20.689> the

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
performance face we've talked about the

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.519 
performance face we've talked about the
five<00:00:21.050> degree<00:00:21.410> groove<00:00:22.060> but<00:00:23.060> on<00:00:23.240> top<00:00:23.449> of<00:00:23.509> that<00:00:23.689> we

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
five degree groove but on top of that we

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.439 
five degree groove but on top of that we
have<00:00:24.560> a<00:00:24.710> sandblast<00:00:25.369> it's<00:00:25.669> very<00:00:25.880> aggressive

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
have a sandblast it's very aggressive

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.540 
have a sandblast it's very aggressive
and<00:00:26.599> on<00:00:27.109> top<00:00:27.320> of<00:00:27.470> the<00:00:27.529> sand<00:00:27.769> blast<00:00:28.099> we<00:00:28.369> have<00:00:28.400> a

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
and on top of the sand blast we have a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.060 
and on top of the sand blast we have a
laser<00:00:28.849> etch<00:00:29.320> right<00:00:30.320> to<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:30.650> maximum

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
laser etch right to the maximum

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.330 
laser etch right to the maximum
allowable<00:00:31.550> by<00:00:32.060> the<00:00:32.119> USGA<00:00:32.689> all<00:00:33.440> this<00:00:33.860> adds<00:00:34.100> up

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
allowable by the USGA all this adds up

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.709 
allowable by the USGA all this adds up
to<00:00:34.610> control<00:00:35.300> spin<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:36.410> better<00:00:37.309> shots<00:00:37.719> like

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
to control spin and better shots like

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
shot over a bunker which always

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.560 
shot over a bunker which always
intimidates<00:00:58.070> everybody<00:00:58.519> so<00:00:58.820> top<00:00:59.030> shaw<00:00:59.239> I<00:00:59.390> got

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
intimidates everybody so top shaw I got

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.709 
intimidates everybody so top shaw I got
a<00:00:59.600> tight<00:00:59.870> flag<00:01:00.199> over<00:01:00.679> a<00:01:00.710> bunker<00:01:01.190> but<00:01:01.940> with<00:01:02.570> the

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
a tight flag over a bunker but with the

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.600 
a tight flag over a bunker but with the
grooves<00:01:03.019> that<00:01:03.199> we<00:01:03.469> have<00:01:03.710> in<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.370> face

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
grooves that we have in the face

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.640 
grooves that we have in the face
roughness<00:01:05.180> by<00:01:05.449> way<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:05.660> the<00:01:05.930> laser<00:01:06.140> etching

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
roughness by way of the laser etching

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.160 
roughness by way of the laser etching
and<00:01:07.360> sandblast<00:01:08.360> I<00:01:08.600> think<00:01:08.810> you're<00:01:08.930> going<00:01:09.080> to

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
and sandblast I think you're going to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.690 
and sandblast I think you're going to
control<00:01:09.500> this<00:01:09.650> that<00:01:10.010> gives<00:01:10.250> you<00:01:10.340> your<00:01:10.460> best

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
control this that gives you your best

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.580 
control this that gives you your best
chance<00:01:10.940> you<00:01:11.180> got<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.420> best<00:01:11.570> opportunity<00:01:12.320> that

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
chance you got the best opportunity that

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.930 
chance you got the best opportunity that
and<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:12.740> little<00:01:12.980> technique<00:01:13.340> but<00:01:13.610> yeah<00:01:13.760> with

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
and a little technique but yeah with

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.760 
and a little technique but yeah with
this<00:01:14.090> face<00:01:14.270> technology<00:01:14.900> we<00:01:15.050> got<00:01:15.230> a<00:01:15.260> great<00:01:15.560> job

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
this face technology we got a great job

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.680 
this face technology we got a great job
making<00:01:16.190> this<00:01:16.430> pulling<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:16.910> shot<00:01:17.120> off<00:01:17.330> so

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
making this pulling the shot off so

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.210 
making this pulling the shot off so
what's<00:01:17.870> the<00:01:17.990> technique<00:01:18.170> what<00:01:18.560> do<00:01:18.620> you<00:01:18.680> do<00:01:18.830> well

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
what's the technique what do you do well

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.100 
what's the technique what do you do well
this<00:01:19.520> shot<00:01:19.730> is<00:01:19.970> one<00:01:20.150> of<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.300> rare<00:01:20.570> shots<00:01:20.900> and

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
this shot is one of the rare shots and

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.690 
this shot is one of the rare shots and
golf<00:01:21.230> in<00:01:21.380> fact<00:01:21.620> probably<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:22.010> only<00:01:22.130> time<00:01:22.460> you

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
golf in fact probably the only time you

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.970 
golf in fact probably the only time you
set<00:01:23.270> up<00:01:23.450> with<00:01:23.900> your<00:01:24.080> weight<00:01:24.290> back<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.650> little

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
set up with your weight back a little

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.560 
set up with your weight back a little
bit<00:01:25.220> you<00:01:25.640> actually<00:01:25.940> move<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.210> ball<00:01:26.360> forward

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
bit you actually move the ball forward

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.390 
bit you actually move the ball forward
and<00:01:26.810> lean<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.080> handle<00:01:27.470> slightly<00:01:27.890> back<00:01:28.130> and

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
and lean the handle slightly back and

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.740 
and lean the handle slightly back and
this<00:01:28.460> is<00:01:28.520> about<00:01:28.730> the<00:01:28.970> only<00:01:29.000> shot<00:01:29.480> where<00:01:29.660> you

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
this is about the only shot where you

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.450 
this is about the only shot where you
ever<00:01:29.870> really<00:01:30.230> do<00:01:30.440> that<00:01:30.680> most<00:01:31.130> of<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.280> time

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
ever really do that most of the time

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.770 
ever really do that most of the time
when<00:01:31.550> you<00:01:31.640> hit<00:01:31.760> the<00:01:31.880> ball<00:01:32.000> you're<00:01:32.480> trying<00:01:32.720> to

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
when you hit the ball you're trying to

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.390 
when you hit the ball you're trying to
get<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:33.020> shaft<00:01:33.230> to<00:01:33.410> lean<00:01:33.560> forward<00:01:33.590> at<00:01:34.100> impact

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
get the shaft to lean forward at impact

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.680 
get the shaft to lean forward at impact
so<00:01:34.550> you<00:01:34.640> can<00:01:34.760> trap<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.150> ball<00:01:35.270> but<00:01:35.420> in<00:01:35.540> this

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
so you can trap the ball but in this

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.570 
so you can trap the ball but in this
shot<00:01:35.930> you<00:01:36.410> actually<00:01:36.710> want<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:36.980> club<00:01:37.220> head<00:01:37.400> to

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
shot you actually want the club head to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.640 
shot you actually want the club head to
outrace<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:37.970> handle<00:01:38.570> because<00:01:39.020> dynamically

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
outrace the handle because dynamically

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.110 
outrace the handle because dynamically
you're<00:01:39.860> trying<00:01:40.070> to<00:01:40.160> increase<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.700> loft<00:01:40.910> so

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
you're trying to increase the loft so

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.730 
you're trying to increase the loft so
you<00:01:41.210> can<00:01:41.330> hit<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.570> ball<00:01:41.600> up<00:01:41.840> in<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:41.990> air<00:01:42.080> so

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
you can hit the ball up in the air so

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.320 
you can hit the ball up in the air so
you<00:01:42.800> need<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:42.980> little<00:01:43.190> bit<00:01:43.370> bigger<00:01:43.580> swaying<00:01:44.000> a

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
you need a little bit bigger swaying a

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.480 
you need a little bit bigger swaying a
little<00:01:44.540> bit<00:01:44.900> slower<00:01:45.200> swing<00:01:45.620> because<00:01:45.860> you<00:01:46.340> need

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
little bit slower swing because you need

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.400 
little bit slower swing because you need
more<00:01:46.670> speed<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.420> create<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.870> trajectory<00:01:48.290> to

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
more speed to create the trajectory to

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.170 
more speed to create the trajectory to
get<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.650> ball<00:01:48.770> up<00:01:48.830> in<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.100> air<00:01:49.190> I've<00:01:49.700> seen<00:01:50.030> the

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
get the ball up in the air I've seen the

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.330 
get the ball up in the air I've seen the
many<00:01:50.720> people<00:01:51.080> take<00:01:51.470> their<00:01:51.650> shot<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.100> hit<00:01:52.220> it
