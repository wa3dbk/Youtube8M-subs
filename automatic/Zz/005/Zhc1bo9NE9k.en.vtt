00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
alright so in this tutorial we're going

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.450 
alright so in this tutorial we're going
to<00:00:02.730> learn<00:00:02.879> how<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.179> make<00:00:03.480> one<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:04.140> these<00:00:04.529> kind

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
to learn how to make one of these kind

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.160 
to learn how to make one of these kind
of<00:00:05.580> things<00:00:05.640> really<00:00:06.120> simple<00:00:06.450> one<00:00:06.810> that<00:00:07.020> will

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
of things really simple one that will

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.440 
of things really simple one that will
show<00:00:07.350> what<00:00:07.649> kind<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:08.130> operating<00:00:09.090> system

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
show what kind of operating system

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.970 
show what kind of operating system
you're<00:00:09.570> running<00:00:10.250> so<00:00:11.250> first<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:11.790> need<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.980> make

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
you're running so first we need to make

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.090 
you're running so first we need to make
a<00:00:14.009> gadget<00:00:14.940> folder<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.260> do<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.410> we<00:00:16.770> can<00:00:16.920> go

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
a gadget folder so to do that we can go

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.730 
a gadget folder so to do that we can go
to<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:18.500> run

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.109 

and<00:00:22.300> type<00:00:23.300> in<00:00:23.539> this<00:00:24.340> I'll<00:00:25.340> put<00:00:25.550> it<00:00:25.670> in<00:00:25.789> the<00:00:25.910> side

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
and type in this I'll put it in the side

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.920 
and type in this I'll put it in the side
and<00:00:26.420> the<00:00:27.230> a<00:00:27.260> more<00:00:27.619> info<00:00:28.090> so<00:00:29.090> you<00:00:29.150> can<00:00:29.420> copy<00:00:29.810> it

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
and the a more info so you can copy it

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.089 
and the a more info so you can copy it
down<00:00:29.990> or<00:00:30.200> you<00:00:30.259> can<00:00:30.349> just<00:00:30.410> copy<00:00:30.619> it<00:00:30.740> down<00:00:30.800> real

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
down or you can just copy it down real

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.760 
down or you can just copy it down real
fast<00:00:32.230> so<00:00:33.230> that's<00:00:33.440> it<00:00:33.650> they're<00:00:33.980> all<00:00:34.730> right

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
fast so that's it they're all right

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.540 
fast so that's it they're all right
and<00:00:35.890> then<00:00:36.370> you<00:00:36.550> have<00:00:36.670> to<00:00:36.940> create<00:00:37.450> a<00:00:37.570> folder<00:00:38.550> now

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
and then you have to create a folder now

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.670 
and then you have to create a folder now
for<00:00:39.790> this<00:00:39.880> one<00:00:40.120> it<00:00:40.360> has<00:00:40.630> to<00:00:40.810> be<00:00:40.840> called<00:00:41.140> my

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
for this one it has to be called my

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.640 
for this one it has to be called my
first<00:00:42.070> let's<00:00:42.550> do<00:00:42.700> my<00:00:42.850> first<00:00:43.060> gadget<00:00:43.570> and<00:00:43.780> in

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
first let's do my first gadget and in

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.380 
first let's do my first gadget and in
there<00:00:44.890> you<00:00:45.070> create<00:00:45.460> a<00:00:46.560> gadget<00:00:47.560> XML<00:00:48.460> file<00:00:48.940> and

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
there you create a gadget XML file and

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.340 
there you create a gadget XML file and
an<00:00:49.690> HTML<00:00:50.320> file<00:00:50.620> called<00:00:51.510> my<00:00:52.510> first<00:00:52.780> gadget<00:00:53.230> on

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
an HTML file called my first gadget on

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.660 
an HTML file called my first gadget on
HTML

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
HTML

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.579

now<00:00:55.210> once<00:00:55.390> you<00:00:55.510> have<00:00:55.600> those<00:00:55.780> open<00:00:56.260> them<00:00:56.379> both

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
now once you have those open them both

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.399 
now once you have those open them both
in<00:00:56.829> a<00:00:56.980> text<00:00:57.730> editor<00:00:57.940> notepad<00:00:58.690> works<00:00:58.989> but<00:00:59.379> I

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
in a text editor notepad works but I

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.919 
in a text editor notepad works but I
have<00:00:59.769> notepad<00:01:00.370> plus<00:01:00.579> plus<00:01:00.699> this<00:01:01.269> color<00:01:01.510> coded
