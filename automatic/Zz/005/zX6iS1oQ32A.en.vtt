 her soundproof box made of plexiglas 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.380
 that was a pity we could at least 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.210
 hardly the emotions of the players 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.800
 However, was witnessed by the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.860
 host of the American professional league 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.630
 mlb is so prescribed be it because 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.550
 At first it looked really good at sk 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.440
 gaming kiwi already caught up after a few 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.060
 Minutes a foursome killstreak and his 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.220
 team forced the opponent to freedom 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.930
 his playing style on the germans 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.430
 generally became a darling of the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.979
 Moderators, however, had theirs 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.300
 problems mode lightning was played 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.080
 namely a so-called best of five 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.790
 system 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.620
 The first card is always one 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.540
 nomination people the second search 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.820
 and destroy and the third one partie 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.600
 lightning three points difference need for 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.280
 a victory 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.200
 it does not stand after these games 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.240
 3 to 0 is in the extension 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.130
 therefore again search &amp; destroy in 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.530
 the fourth and lightning in the fifth 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.570
 played during sk strong search &amp; 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.400
 They let themselves be left with destroy 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.610
 regularly in the flash the butter from the bread 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.590
 take and divorced in the eighth-final 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.600
 but this is not surprising the us 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.640
 professional players live from the spot 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.250
 Germans, on the other hand, are in normal employment 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.720
 after and play only in their free time 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.760
 the second german participant killer 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.380

 Qualification for Los Angeles for the first 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.050
 times at a tournament from face to face 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.050
 met face 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.019
 but what does actually happen 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.510
 professional players and what tips tricks 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.700
 And there are tricks around in call of duty 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.080
 Goes to get better and surprise 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.909
 the professionals sometimes even the developers 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.409
 from infinity we were there at 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:07.530
 Senior Cards Designer Joe Scott 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:10.319
 I have seen something today 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.599
 I have never experienced on 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.879
 ok has a player on the first floor on b 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.620
 specifically turned around and then through 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.959
 the building on the other side 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.060
 fired an enemy at c that was 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.890
 pretty cool but most impressed 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.720
 not the enormous level of teamplay 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.269
 it's not just a really good one 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.849
 but all they know where their 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.959
 Teammates are they anticipating where 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.959
 the enemy is coming 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.180
 With 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.570
 That's why we invite some 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.490
 professional player to our studio 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.330
 to test new features we currently have 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.330
 to prepare 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.110
 this week will be our winner 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.110
 of the tournament give visitors and feedback 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.990
 we have a whole book about the 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.990
 strategies of our opponents 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.510
 and what do the big usprofiklub say 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.880
 explains Andrew Crew Captain Raver 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:36.490
 Lucia's ultimately with his clan 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:38.410
 in the end managed my personal 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.090
 The biggest rival is optics gaming because of the 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.030
 have just thrown me out there 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.350
 I want to take a little laugh 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.830
 says jo di luca in the game 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.830
 notice 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.840
 who has now licked blood donated 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.340
 lead multiplayer map designer joe still 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:16.479
 a few special strategies to the 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:18.819
 tournament cards on ok nomination 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.319
 every case up on the roof at b from here 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:26.889
 from you can very well this point 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:28.120
 Defend and get some kills 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.190
 cries a lightning there is a very 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.960
 cool route at the of a window 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.580
 to join the next and then 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.590
 jump directly into the portal can strike 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.449
 son is a very close card in the 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.970
 nomination mode you have to permanently in 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:44.889
 movement remain constantly rotate 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.050
 best teams get to their two points 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.300
 and then practice permanent pressure on the 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.970
 opponents do not let him breathe 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.949
 and press the opponent into the spot at b 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.949
 The building has few exits 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:07.059
 on severin many clans are playing in 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:09.709
 search and destroy the bulldog tactics 

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:11.869
 they are lying on top of the bomb and they have 

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:13.819
 one of the stairs blocked and everyone 

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:16.629
 Turned off the couple's steady hand 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.629
 for that practical 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.670
 the latter is a tactic on 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.320
 complex that played out and itself 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.800
 ultimately with excellent team play 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.600
 clear 3 0 against three us secured the 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.840
 relied too much on their star 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.310
 Eminem Purple tried again and again 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.420
 the oar with his art as 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.210
 sniper or fast 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.410
 flank runs around 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.150
 His team could not quite keep up 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.830
 complexity ultimately provided the 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.510
 clearly convincing performance from and 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.270
 took highly deserved and under 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.050
 confit the check over 400,000 US 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.340
 dollar against 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.290
 It was a really exciting tournament 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.450
 and fascinating event but activision 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.700
 still has a lot to do when you call of 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.160
 Duty to do brushing shooter of the world 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.560
 the location was too small fast only 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.210
 around 400 fans also came the emotions 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.230
 through the glass boxes came over here 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.790
 you should be in appropriate 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.760
 Microphone technology for transmission to 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.230
 Outside, invest the prize money to the 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.750
 the world still has the highest 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.610
 watch and eminem you had 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.350
 every year more than one brand 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.760
 a billion dollars in sales generated 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.830
 also like to get on the stage 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.250
 the rap can finally get the ghost 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.250
 title song
