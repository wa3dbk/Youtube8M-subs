00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
show us how it works

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.849 
show us how it works
so<00:00:38.940> there<00:00:39.929> you<00:00:39.960> go<00:00:40.050> now<00:00:40.289> these<00:00:40.499> things<00:00:40.710> are

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
so there you go now these things are

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.259 
so there you go now these things are
fantastic<00:00:40.979> and<00:00:41.489> if<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.670> get<00:00:41.819> stuck<00:00:42.120> out<00:00:42.239> in

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
fantastic and if you get stuck out in

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:43.459 
fantastic and if you get stuck out in
the<00:00:42.389> middle<00:00:42.449> of<00:00:42.690> nowhere<00:00:43.019> with<00:00:43.139> a<00:00:43.170> storm

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the middle of nowhere with a storm

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.779 
the middle of nowhere with a storm
shelter<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.129> they<00:00:44.280> make<00:00:44.429> these<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.699> all

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
shelter and they make these in all

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:45.799 
shelter and they make these in all
different<00:00:45.030> sizes<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.479> this<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
different sizes so this is the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.540 
different sizes so this is the
two-person<00:00:46.229> one<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.859> they<00:00:47.069> do<00:00:47.129> them<00:00:47.339> up<00:00:47.429> too

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
two-person one and they do them up too

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.029 
two-person one and they do them up too
so<00:00:47.670> if<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.879> eats<00:00:48.030> 1012<00:00:48.899> people<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.379> it's

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
so if it eats 1012 people and it's

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.590 
so if it eats 1012 people and it's
basically<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.579> group<00:00:50.789> shelter<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.420> can

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
basically a group shelter that you can

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.539 
basically a group shelter that you can
huddle<00:00:51.899> inside<00:00:52.409> and<00:00:52.799> it<00:00:52.889> keeps<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> wind<00:00:53.309> off

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:53.549 
huddle inside and it keeps the wind off

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:54.860

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
moment so these are a really good way of

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.880 
moment so these are a really good way of
staying<00:01:56.330> warm<00:01:56.510> it<00:01:56.840> keeps<00:01:57.230> the<00:01:57.380> wind<00:01:57.500> off<00:01:57.740> which

staying warm it keeps the wind off which

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.020 
staying warm it keeps the wind off which
is<00:01:58.010> the<00:01:58.070> main<00:01:58.250> thing<00:01:58.280> that's<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.730> biggest

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
is the main thing that's the biggest

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.220 
is the main thing that's the biggest
killer<00:01:59.240> that's<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.660> thing<00:01:59.810> that<00:01:59.930> really

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
killer that's the thing that really

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.750 
killer that's the thing that really
reduces<00:02:00.710> your<00:02:00.830> call<00:02:00.980> body<00:02:01.190> temperature<00:02:01.610> more

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
reduces your call body temperature more

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.430 
reduces your call body temperature more
than<00:02:01.910> anything<00:02:02.060> else<00:02:02.300> so<00:02:02.510> by<00:02:02.960> putting<00:02:03.140> up<00:02:03.290> one

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
than anything else so by putting up one

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.810 
than anything else so by putting up one
