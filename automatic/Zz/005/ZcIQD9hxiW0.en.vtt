00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.870
 yes 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.619
 hello how are you and welcome to this 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.910
 tutorial side of photoshop lightroom in 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.610
 the one that we are going to learn to perform the 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.869
 Effect shown on the screen 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.640
 let's start and I'll restore the 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:34.480
 image and we go straight to detail 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.340
 here in quantity I will put 25 the radio 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.370
 he left it at 10 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.710
 the detail I'm going to put it in 11 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.230
 and the mask I leave it like this 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.100
 now in noise reduction 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.620
 Illuminance I'm going to put 36 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.309
 in detail I put it in 34 and the contrast 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.309
 I leave it at zero 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.879
 now I'm going to divide all 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.560
 and in the tone of the illuminations I'm going to 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.640
 put 48 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.370
 the saturation 44 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.120
 the balance left it at zero and in the 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:16.930
 shade of the shadows I'm going to put 240 and the 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.300
 saturation in 37 we remember that the 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.520
 saturation in the intensity with which 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.840
 the tone will influence the image 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.270
 now I'm going to basic 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.560
 and exhibition the 40 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:37.170
 in contrast I'm going to put 50 in 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:44.340
 Illuminations I will also put 50 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:46.370
 in shades 50 in whites minus 54 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.900
 and blacks 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.900
 - 79 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.850
 hello in clarity I will put 100 in the 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.450
 intensity left it at 0 and saturation 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.380
 I'm going to change it 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.380
 amen to 100 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.660
 now I'm going to effects 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:20.800
 and here in bullets I'm going to put 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.930
 in quantity minus 29 and we leave it as 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.890
 is 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.250
 good now to save the effect 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.860
 we go to preset settings here there 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.270
 a little button we click and we 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.040
 this window will appear you have to look 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.220
 that everything we have 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.959
 configured is marked and we put the 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.959
 name that we want and we give to create 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.840
 Well this effect is very good can be 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.569
 use as well as on screen or you also 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.420
 You can use it by combining it with another effect 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.019
 that we had previously learned 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.019
 I'm going to show you 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.890
 I'm going to restore the image 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.730
 first we have to put the effect of 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.730
 tutorial number 3 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.540
 then effect just 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.879
 create and we're going to get this result 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.860
 that we are seeing and also if they want 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.420
 save them also have to go adjustments 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.780
 preset and you click on this 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.670
