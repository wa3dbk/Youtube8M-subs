00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.690
 welcome to the continuation of the cycle 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.010
 guides on the texture this time like me and 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.719
 promised we will build our first 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.010
 research center before us 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.840
 need a production line 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.430
 red and green qty first 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.050
 let me tell you what I already 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.450
 did for this and why so and not otherwise 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.220
 let's start from the beginning as we remember about i 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:30.020
 I hope you remember the first guide and if 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:31.099
 no, now look at it last time 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.530
 we built a processing line 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.120
 Metals Power Station for Methyl 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.860
 of course but power stations for 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.510
 the production of the plant we need flasks 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.010
 it takes a lot of iron therefore 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.930
 let me show you what has changed already 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.250
 existing line to increase 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.720
 metal products I set 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.190
 extra step but for stove 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.910
 naturally stopped coping with 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.829
 in such volume 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.630
 I increase the amount accordingly 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.800
 after all these actions I saved up metal 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.970
 to craft enough 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.890
 production materials and 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.450
 automatic cycles to start assembly 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.070
 factories for the manufacture of schools and 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.870
 parallel studied all the necessary 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.880
 technology and so let's tell what 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.560
 we will need to build factories in 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.479
 first you must study labs 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.009
 following electronics technology 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.659
 she allows us to create smart 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.850
 manipulators that have a property 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.409
 distinguish what im brothers what no you are easy 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.060
 understand the settings you need only 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.190
 choose the thing you need in one of the five 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.530
 windows and after that the manipulator will start 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.420
 play and the conveyor only ignoring it 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.610
 everything else is automation second 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.290
 level help and and we will be able to create in 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.760
 production of second-tier machines 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.290
 production recipe machines 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.580
 able to craft any item 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.530
 auto mode 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.420
 it only ingredients needed electricity 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.130
 however production machines first 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.350
 level able to do difficult things 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.299
 they are needed to create green 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.130
 count and so I decided to build a factory 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.840
 exclusively on the shops of the second level 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.460
 especially since the speed of their production 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.260
 one and a half times higher than normal 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.150
 of course you can build first 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.520
 the production of reds they can 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.530
 collect sugar level 1 but after can 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.000
 having problems with location 2 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.920
 production module which will 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.119
 create a green circle also studied 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.920
 optics but this is not necessary for you 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.869
 because it makes it possible to build 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.700
 outdoor lighting which is now me 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.560
 necessary to show you at night 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.869
 consider for all these technologies 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.939
 it is necessary to study the automation of the first 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.590
 level and logistics what we did in 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.420
 last guide so let's start 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.870
 building a red plant 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.220
 and green 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.110
 squash as you see me 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.000
 prudently all already crafted for 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.560
 built our factories stay only 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.780
 collect the first thing to do 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.159
 choose a place for our factory i think 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.349
 to the left of our main base will be 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.180
 perfectly keep in mind that most likely you 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.010
 need more energy 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.110
 to ensure all this business therefore 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.150
 be prepared to increase the amount 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.620
 generators this in turn is possible 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.540
 will lead to attacks on you by 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.310
 the locals have a bug that is not very 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.230
 love the noise and smoke see the area 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.150
 disturbances that create your base you 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.190
 You can by clicking on it note 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.109
 all this is different when they attack can 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.940
 be here we will come back to this before 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.709
 the launch of our factory now proceed 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.420
 for construction I recommend you 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.530
 initially plan how will 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.510
 look your factory 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.280
 and where that will be and for more 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.379
 efficiency, I decided to make a separate 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.180
 ore mining specially for passing we start with 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.489
 location of the laboratory where you are 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.470
 go to school the more of them the faster 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.480
 goes researcher so think 4 for 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.400
 start on someone in front of the feed line i 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.900
 I recommend to put the boxes on both types 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.120
 count this is done in order to 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.099
 prevent the conveyor from stopping due to 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.930
 their abundance at a simple laboratory 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.519
 Now we will deal with the factories on the eve 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.500
 making this video my friend and I 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.209
 discussed what the scheme of submission of materials 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.099
 will be the most effective why in 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.989
 finally decided that the simplest scheme 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.790
 will be cyclical ie all materials and 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.900
 things required to create something 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.900
 will follow one line 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.569
 it is quite risky because they can 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.430
 traffic jams occur if production 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.230
 will outpace consumption so i 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.239
 I do unloading modules on the most 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.069
 quickly created thing these modules 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.109
 will allow us to streamline presence 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.819
 of an object on our line 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.269
 The case is the gears of the IC and 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.269
 the wire 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.800
 With such a scheme, be sure to take into account 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.660
 an excess of iron and copper materials themselves and 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.520
 make them the reverse of where they are 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.200
 will be able to return if they go to the second 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.200
 circle on our production ring 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.350
 at the beginning of the line I think the most effective 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.030
 produce the simplest things like 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.440
 gears and wires given that 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.120
 gear production speed 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.120
 pretty high and leave it hope 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.639
 in the end, we get such a factory 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.129
 to create the first two ingredients 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.960
 to study further you will need more 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.430
 2 frets of them you will find yourself 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.349
 otherwise itâ€™s not interesting 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.409
 let's start the mechanisms let's see how everything is 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:57.409
 works 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.160
 I think this guy we can complete 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.110
 ruler teaching for beginners however 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.790
 if you have questions ask them either 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.680
 in the commentary or in the project group all 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.220
 links in the description thanks for watching and 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.220
 good luck to you
