00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 I always wanted to be in the movie. 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.000
 I guess you'd tell me I'm a real romantic. 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.000
 Yeah, I had a lot of dreams. 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.500
 But when I met Selby Wall, only one appeared. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 BASED ON A REAL EVENT 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 You got something against us, you bastard? 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.500
 Cheers! 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.900
 She's a friend. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.500
 I hope not like the last guy you almost choked on. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Are you a prostitute? 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 - I loved her. - I thought you weren't for girls. 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.800
 I love you. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 I believed in her. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 This is an opportunity that will meet you once in a lifetime. 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.000
 You'll never meet anyone like me again. Go on! 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.800
 - You'll take care of me, right? - I've been looking for you since I was 13 years old. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.800
 The truth is, I don't want to. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.400
 EVERY CHANCE ... 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.000
 I'm trying to make order in life, you know, to live well. 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.400
 ... EVERY RISK ... 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.000
 This is big! 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.500
 - Where did you get the car? - I borrowed it. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 - You want money? - My God, are you serious? 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.000
 ... EVERYTHING WHAT HAS BEEN ... 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.000
 You know why? Because I knew I'd be back home with you. 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.000
 ... He's done for love 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.900
 Come on, Selby, now. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.500
 EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.000
 Who killed the man? 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.500
 I did everything you didn't need to hear about them. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 AS A NATURAL POWER, ROLLING STONE 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 - You can't kill people. - Who says that? 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 I'm fine with God. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 THERON SHOWS THE MOST IMPORTANT GAME PERFORMANCE OF THE YEAR 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.000

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.000

 CHARLIZE THERON CHRISTINA RICCI 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.000
