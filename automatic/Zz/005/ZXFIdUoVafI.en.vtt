00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
that's really hardcore and I did not

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.170 
that's really hardcore and I did not
have<00:04:50.640> time<00:04:50.790> to<00:04:51.560> break<00:04:52.560> it<00:04:52.770> in<00:04:52.860> half<00:04:53.070> take<00:04:54.000> the

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
have time to break it in half take the

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:02.900 
have time to break it in half take the
half<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:57.229> stuff<00:04:58.229> in<00:04:58.470> his<00:04:58.740> mouth<00:04:58.770> oh<00:05:01.729> it<00:05:02.729> looks

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
half and stuff in his mouth oh it looks

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.180 
half and stuff in his mouth oh it looks
like<00:05:03.060> he's<00:05:03.210> eating<00:05:03.390> it

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
like he's eating it

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.580 
like he's eating it
I<00:05:05.570> think<00:05:06.570> this<00:05:06.660> one<00:05:06.780> might<00:05:06.900> be<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:07.080> bit<00:05:07.229> too<00:05:07.410> big

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
I think this one might be a bit too big

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.760 
I think this one might be a bit too big
for<00:05:07.950> this<00:05:08.729> cupcake

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.469 

a<00:05:12.000> smaller<00:05:13.000> piece<00:05:14.759> if<00:05:15.759> it's<00:05:15.970> not<00:05:16.120> sticking

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
a smaller piece if it's not sticking

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.450 
a smaller piece if it's not sticking
then<00:05:16.780> I<00:05:17.020> would<00:05:17.379> suggest<00:05:17.560> maybe<00:05:18.039> doing<00:05:18.310> the

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
then I would suggest maybe doing the

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.760 
then I would suggest maybe doing the
honey<00:05:18.669> thing<00:05:18.910> again<00:05:19.150> or<00:05:19.389> taking<00:05:19.720> like<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:20.080> bit

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
honey thing again or taking like a bit

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.149 
honey thing again or taking like a bit
of<00:05:20.919> icing<00:05:21.520> and<00:05:21.729> just<00:05:22.199> kind<00:05:23.199> of<00:05:23.319> using<00:05:23.800> it<00:05:24.039> as

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:24.159 
of icing and just kind of using it as

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:33.600 
of icing and just kind of using it as
glue<00:05:24.780> on<00:05:25.780> the<00:05:25.960> edge<00:05:26.050> of<00:05:26.169> the<00:05:26.259> cookie<00:05:29.729> and<00:05:32.610> there

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
glue on the edge of the cookie and there

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:40.680 
glue on the edge of the cookie and there
you<00:05:33.819> have<00:05:33.849> a<00:05:35.400> cookie<00:05:36.400> monster<00:05:36.550> cupcake<00:05:39.690> over

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690
