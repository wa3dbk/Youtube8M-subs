DSLR video com and today I'm reviewing

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.639 
DSLR video com and today I'm reviewing
the<00:00:04.440> impact<00:00:05.040> five<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.210> one<00:00:06.390> oval<00:00:06.930> reflector

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
the impact five and one oval reflector

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.560 
the impact five and one oval reflector
sometimes<00:00:08.490> you<00:00:08.610> need<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.790> reflector<00:00:09.330> that's

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
sometimes you need a reflector that's

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.360 
sometimes you need a reflector that's
just<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.139> bit<00:00:10.290> bigger<00:00:10.530> than<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.920> one<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.250> use

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
just a bit bigger than the one you use

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.249 
just a bit bigger than the one you use
per<00:00:11.580> photography<00:00:12.269> it's<00:00:12.780> really<00:00:12.990> well<00:00:13.230> made

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
per photography it's really well made

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.210 
per photography it's really well made
and<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:14.370> can<00:00:14.670> take<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.940> lot<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.240> abuse<00:00:16.039> it<00:00:17.039> has<00:00:17.190> a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
and it can take a lot of abuse it has a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.590 
and it can take a lot of abuse it has a
silver<00:00:17.580> side<00:00:18.230> and<00:00:19.230> also<00:00:19.350> has<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.680> white<00:00:20.010> side

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
silver side and also has a white side

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.480 
silver side and also has a white side
then<00:00:21.600> if<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.840> remove<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.350> silk<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:23.189> shine<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
then if you remove the silk to shine the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.460 
then if you remove the silk to shine the
light<00:00:23.880> through<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.359> or<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.840> Sun<00:00:25.050> through<00:00:25.320> it

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
light through it or the Sun through it

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.820 
light through it or the Sun through it
to<00:00:26.160> diffuse<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.490> light<00:00:27.109> then<00:00:28.109> if<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.410> reverse

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
to diffuse the light then if you reverse

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.220 
to diffuse the light then if you reverse
it<00:00:28.859> which<00:00:29.789> can<00:00:30.119> sometimes<00:00:30.300> take<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.929> few

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
it which can sometimes take a few

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.229 
it which can sometimes take a few
seconds<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.859> your<00:00:32.340> clients<00:00:32.759> kind<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.000> looking

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
seconds and your clients kind of looking

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.900 
seconds and your clients kind of looking
at<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:33.750> come<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:34.140> let's<00:00:34.559> get<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:35.130> you

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
at you like come on let's get going you

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.220 
at you like come on let's get going you
have<00:00:36.030> gold<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.510> one<00:00:36.780> side<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:38.989> black<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
have gold on one side and black on the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.049 
have gold on one side and black on the
other<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.129> black<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.670> use<00:00:41.850> as<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
other and the black you can use as a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:51.590 
other and the black you can use as a
flag<00:00:49.550> you<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.730> mount<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> reflector<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
flag you can mount the reflector on a

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.470 
flag you can mount the reflector on a
light<00:00:51.899> stand<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.309> has<00:00:53.460> clips

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.240 

this<00:00:57.480> light<00:00:57.719> stand<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.140> also<00:00:58.410> made<00:00:58.620> by<00:00:58.770> impact

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
this light stand is also made by impact

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
this light stand is also made by impact
as<00:00:59.520> well<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.120> i'll<00:01:00.239> put<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.449> link<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
as well and i'll put a link to it in the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.860 
as well and i'll put a link to it in the
show<00:01:01.410> notes<00:01:02.180> just<00:01:03.180> make<00:01:03.359> sure<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.600> use<00:01:03.750> a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
show notes just make sure you use a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.350 
show notes just make sure you use a
sandbag<00:01:04.530> because<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> reflector<00:01:05.939> does<00:01:06.119> have

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
sandbag because the reflector does have

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.700 
sandbag because the reflector does have
some<00:01:06.570> weight<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.780> it'll<00:01:07.049> definitely<00:01:07.350> tip

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
some weight and it'll definitely tip

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.250 
some weight and it'll definitely tip
over<00:01:08.040> one<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> most<00:01:08.939> common<00:01:09.420> uses<00:01:09.659> i<00:01:09.990> like

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
over one of the most common uses i like

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.310 
over one of the most common uses i like
to<00:01:10.409> use<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.070> diffusion<00:01:11.939> outside<00:01:12.479> since

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
to use it for is diffusion outside since

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.440 
to use it for is diffusion outside since
it's<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.650> big<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.520> your<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:15.150> gives<00:01:15.360> your

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
it's so big and your it gives your

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.929 
it's so big and your it gives your
talent<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.990> little<00:01:16.229> bit<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.439> wiggle<00:01:16.619> room

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
talent a little bit of wiggle room

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.120 
talent a little bit of wiggle room
compared<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> small<00:01:18.540> reflector<00:01:19.320> because<00:01:19.979> if

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
compared to a small reflector because if

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.530 
compared to a small reflector because if
you're<00:01:20.250> using<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.580> small<00:01:20.850> reflector<00:01:21.360> that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
you're using a small reflector that

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.149 
you're using a small reflector that
can't<00:01:21.780> move<00:01:21.960> very<00:01:21.990> far<00:01:22.380> before<00:01:22.590> they<00:01:22.890> get<00:01:23.009> out

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
can't move very far before they get out

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.580 
can't move very far before they get out
of<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.340> reflected<00:01:23.580> light<00:01:23.880> or<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.960> diffuse

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
of the reflected light or the diffuse

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.530 
of the reflected light or the diffuse
light<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.220> seems<00:01:26.490> pretty<00:01:26.700> durable<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.330> can

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
light it seems pretty durable and can

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.929 
light it seems pretty durable and can
take<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> lot<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.020> abuse<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:29.310> zipper<00:01:29.640> seems<00:01:29.880> to

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
take a lot of abuse the zipper seems to

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.580 
take a lot of abuse the zipper seems to
be<00:01:30.060> well<00:01:30.240> made<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> three<00:01:31.320> months

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
be well made and of the three months

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.499 
be well made and of the three months
that<00:01:31.619> I've<00:01:31.799> been<00:01:31.829> using<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.549> I've<00:01:33.000> never<00:01:33.270> had

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
that I've been using it I've never had

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.600 
that I've been using it I've never had
the<00:01:33.659> zippers<00:01:34.020> go<00:01:34.170> off<00:01:34.350> track<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.950> course<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
the zippers go off track of course the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.050 
the zippers go off track of course the
small<00:01:35.759> ones<00:01:36.119> collapse<00:01:36.540> really<00:01:36.900> easily<00:01:38.060> but

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
small ones collapse really easily but

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.999 
small ones collapse really easily but
this<00:01:39.240> one<00:01:39.479> can<00:01:39.689> take<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.900> few<00:01:40.020> tries<00:01:40.409> before<00:01:40.710> you

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
this one can take a few tries before you

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:54.400 
this one can take a few tries before you
can<00:01:41.130> get<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.400> back<00:01:41.579> into<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> bag

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.630 

so<00:01:55.410> I<00:01:55.440> can<00:01:55.560> say<00:01:55.770> I'm<00:01:55.890> pretty<00:01:56.040> impressed<00:01:56.160> with

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
so I can say I'm pretty impressed with

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.730 
so I can say I'm pretty impressed with
the<00:01:56.730> impact<00:01:57.120> brand<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.840> I've<00:01:57.990> used<00:01:58.140> for<00:01:58.440> so

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
the impact brand that I've used for so

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.620 
the impact brand that I've used for so
far<00:01:58.950> from<00:01:59.280> lighting<00:01:59.550> stands<00:01:59.820> reflectors<00:02:00.540> and

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
far from lighting stands reflectors and

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.290 
far from lighting stands reflectors and
stuff<00:02:00.900> like<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.400> but<00:02:02.400> definitely<00:02:02.790> reflector

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
stuff like that but definitely reflector

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.910 
stuff like that but definitely reflector
is<00:02:03.450> probably<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.900> most<00:02:03.930> cost<00:02:04.470> effective

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
is probably the most cost effective
