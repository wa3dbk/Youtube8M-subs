00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
build a grinder on the bottom so i can

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.150 
build a grinder on the bottom so i can
get<00:00:26.310> some<00:00:26.460> experience<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.800> this<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.920> my<00:00:29.070> actual

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160

Skyblock<00:00:29.760> mouth<00:00:29.970> over<00:00:30.420> there<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.660> where<00:00:30.750> my

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
Skyblock mouth over there is where my

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.179 
Skyblock mouth over there is where my
enchantment<00:00:31.230> table<00:00:31.349> would<00:00:31.650> be<00:00:31.830> if<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.009> was

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
enchantment table would be if this was

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.139 
enchantment table would be if this was
Skyblock<00:00:32.640> think<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.510> i<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.570> enchant<00:00:33.780> things

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
upon to of course going to be a bit more

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.539 
upon to of course going to be a bit more
of<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.840> faff<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.409> anyone<00:02:04.619> doing<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:04.979> in

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
of a faff for anyone doing this in

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.029 
of a faff for anyone doing this in
vanilla<00:02:06.149> but<00:02:06.630> get<00:02:06.899> rid<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.140> this

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
vanilla but get rid of this

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.330 
vanilla but get rid of this
right<00:02:08.610> next<00:02:08.849> step<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.269> to<00:02:09.299> wrap<00:02:09.780> around<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.340> in

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
right next step is to wrap around it in

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.250 
right next step is to wrap around it in
whatever<00:02:11.579> material<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.209> want<00:02:12.390> social

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
whatever material you want social

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.780 
whatever material you want social
strategy<00:02:13.650> don't<00:02:13.829> have<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.069> use<00:02:14.189> materials

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
strategy don't have to use materials

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.699 
strategy don't have to use materials
I've<00:02:14.939> used<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.269> just<00:02:15.510> use<00:02:15.780> those<00:02:15.959> materials<00:02:16.260> for

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
I've used I just use those materials for

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.099 
I've used I just use those materials for
fun<00:02:17.359> because<00:02:18.359> I<00:02:18.420> think<00:02:18.599> they<00:02:18.659> look<00:02:18.870> good<00:02:19.019> you

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
fun because I think they look good you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
standing zone there you go now I'd say

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.580 
standing zone there you go now I'd say
wrap<00:02:38.459> around<00:02:38.819> it<00:02:39.000> once<00:02:39.239> more<00:02:39.540> wavy<00:02:40.379> with<00:02:40.500> the

these eight bits all the way up to the

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.149 
these eight bits all the way up to the
hole<00:03:53.729> I'm<00:03:54.329> gonna<00:03:54.449> take<00:03:54.599> a<00:03:54.629> bit<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.810> time<00:03:54.930> but

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
we go all the way up to the tivity tip

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.869 
we go all the way up to the tivity tip
top<00:04:01.560> now<00:04:01.859> we<00:04:01.919> get<00:04:02.340> rid<00:04:02.519> of<00:04:02.579> most<00:04:03.449> of<00:04:03.870> this

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
top now we get rid of most of this

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:10.759 
top now we get rid of most of this
definitely<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:06.000> corner<00:04:06.389> ones<00:04:06.599> and<00:04:06.930> one<00:04:09.769> per

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
definitely the corner ones and one per

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.240 
definitely the corner ones and one per
to<00:04:11.189> hear<00:04:11.609> you<00:04:12.329> know<00:04:12.449> that<00:04:12.720> sort<00:04:13.049> of<00:04:13.169> sequence

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
to hear you know that sort of sequence

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.039 
to hear you know that sort of sequence
that's<00:04:15.400> because<00:04:15.730> if<00:04:15.910> you<00:04:16.060> leave<00:04:16.269> nothing<00:04:16.870> here

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
that's because if you leave nothing here

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.009 
that's because if you leave nothing here
spiders<00:04:17.650> will<00:04:17.799> just<00:04:18.010> run<00:04:19.000> right<00:04:19.299> out<00:04:19.359> there<00:04:19.480> as

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
spiders will just run right out there as

they please leap at you and you will be

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.360 
they please leap at you and you will be
attacked<00:04:25.350> can<00:04:26.350> probably<00:04:26.620> defend<00:04:26.890> off<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.100> few

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
attacked can probably defend off a few

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.830 
attacked can probably defend off a few
but<00:04:27.520> once<00:04:27.640> about<00:04:27.850> five<00:04:28.150> do<00:04:28.420> it<00:04:28.510> you<00:04:28.600> start

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
but once about five do it you start

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.780 
but once about five do it you start
going<00:04:28.990> right<00:04:29.320> it's<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.590> bit<00:04:29.740> ridiculous<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.670> of

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
going right it's a bit ridiculous and of

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.250 
going right it's a bit ridiculous and of
course<00:04:30.850> importantly<00:04:31.660> you<00:04:31.780> want<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:32.020> light

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
course importantly you want to light

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.140 
course importantly you want to light
this<00:04:32.440> up<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.920> stop<00:04:33.130> mobs<00:04:33.430> just<00:04:33.730> spawning

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
this up to stop mobs just spawning

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.600 
this up to stop mobs just spawning
directly<00:04:34.720> into<00:04:34.960> their<00:04:37.140> there<00:04:38.140> you<00:04:38.200> go<00:04:38.610> it's

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
directly into their there you go it's

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.280 
directly into their there you go it's
also<00:04:39.730> worth<00:04:39.940> saying<00:04:40.240> light<00:04:40.480> up<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.810> walkways

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
also worth saying light up the walkways

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.960 
also worth saying light up the walkways
as<00:04:41.470> well<00:04:41.620> just<00:04:41.830> so<00:04:41.980> mobs<00:04:42.190> don't<00:04:42.430> spawn<00:04:42.760> on

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
as well just so mobs don't spawn on

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.890 
as well just so mobs don't spawn on
there<00:04:43.180> either<00:04:45.030> just<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.090> be<00:04:46.180> safe<00:04:48.750> yeah<00:04:49.750> why

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
there either just to be safe yeah why
