00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.930

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.210

 difficult to a friend of mine started the 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.130
 business is given to me to think that in 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.670
 reality what you're going through is that 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.460
 takes the hostile climate and introject it not 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.910

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.820
 to feel that they always interrupt him 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.840
 is somatizing 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.990
 what happens is that I had a very 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.820
