00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.890
 hey what's up how coach should experience 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.710
 I welcome to my video 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.480
 for the muscle triceps yes I have here 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.410
 today again quite basic a few 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.210
 Exercises taken out 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.580
 I very much enjoy spending my 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.730
 Small tricks routine is not much 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.500
 I am a very active tricep myself 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.779
 makes a lot of train pushing a lot 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.779
 with chery presses many tips 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.519
 therefore I do not do it anymore 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.470
 a lot extra on exercises or 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.730
 isolated exercise for the triceps, the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.240
 I would never go to anyone 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.219
 recommend 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.040
 none of my customers leaves here now 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.050
 just makes something isolated 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.480
 Alliance is now down here but 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.730
 is just working a lot about head 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.559
 soon back makes probably other great 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.920
 Things dress a lot of fun and hard 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.989
 are 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.710
 one remembers the triceps volatile from 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.660
 several more heads and mostly 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.190
 from white muscle fibers if you know 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.079
 also the post off or researched and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.090
 know by now that you do have to 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.390
 fit and very happy to heavy 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.149
 weight and little repeat 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.220
 That's the only thing I need says 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.659
 against the people called to pump 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.430
 Of course you can then one more 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.510
 to work in but a little bit 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.580
 The team finally left the end effect 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.470
 looks like that is then again 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.130
 genetically conditioned is just like mine 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.930
 abdominals 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.140
 no matter if I was my thigh in front of it 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.420
 short talk is about it anyway 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.090
 that was okay that is different for everyone 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.420
 I do not know if you know them 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.180
 be his favorite animal to his jersey 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.400
 legendary but unbelievably the same exercise 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.560
 everyone does it and that's exactly what he does 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.420
 is agile just like that 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.150
 my ego the eighth in the training of the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.070
 caps that you did not find film 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.530
 it must be exactly like that, but 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.970
 just go ahead and then 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.870
 flows it will just look like 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.210
 hold yours 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.910
 sid enough blabbing here are the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.740
 Exercises like fun 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.150
 so wants to start pushing over triceps 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.100
 always grabbed by cable 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.810
 I always loved picking up or 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.760
 all the time on the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.260
 muscular hate and here it is important 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.270
 that one holds the elbows of one side 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.680
 yes and then just a straight one 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.590
 way down only does the bottom ones 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.030
 moving subject this, the formed 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.770
 things like that for her example 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.790
 people like me at first to swing and 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.980
 so on 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.450
 Please do not include it 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.170
 continue to work it was the mother's hand 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.670
 on the cable 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.660
 if you do that you will meet more 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.090
 longer head where and how does he do that 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.640
 again, to be exact no matter if you 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:35.940
 weight is actually in astor 80 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.700
 kilo or so thank you here again 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.930
 a painter fritz and mocking critic Beck 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.450
 You can underestimate our night 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.280
 so many believe me so much kilo 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.170
 Elbow is not far up anymore 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.000
 sink and powerful after 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.510
 back by pressing that all off 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.700
 bronze 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.470
 after tries to work or after 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.540
 break workout yes me too 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.760
 all the basin's it 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.400
 these are my favorite exercise for the 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.830
 Triceps and I actually hold it 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.459
 In the meantime, really school is the one 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.610
 the whole time 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.620
 I do what already exists and 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.660
 do not think anything new 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.140
 manier the ninth time you do about it 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.510
 this is also the question where it is called the 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.860
 suspension for latics or cross altogether 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.480
 honest i think a lot of things 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.890
 to move people from sofa 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.650
 to get up and do it 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.010
 but you always have to watch what follows 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.350
 I pursue the goal later with relax 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.030
 So much with level of can you then 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.080
 Unfortunately I can forget you the bdv 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.150
 I can pull right away 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.310
 so if somebody just go out 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.840
 would like to do a lot of sports and there 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.180
 can use any things 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.550
 he likes to do that in the basics and 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.950
 to build the muscles or 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.080
 nature build beautiful musculature 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.220
 build rich since not only the 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.050
 basics and I just 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.790
 actually shown and they should too 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.870
 then a mine works 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.490
 I also like favorite flowers 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.430
 Apply to each image at the 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.900
 protection of this imprint is traffic lights 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.150
 following that I will say something okay 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.400
 I work like the heaviest weight 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.110
 on after the 5 repetition ten 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.930
 Seconds rest sets the next weight 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.040
 so everyone is a bit lighter and 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.420
 then do five repetitions of that 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.820
 I do that until I do not 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:15.130
 problems get a very short break 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:18.170
 in between and that's really good 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.060
 he has nothing to watch with ton 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.580
 after which jumping muscles you adjust 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.640
 really hurt the field so at native 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.470
 deep deep tips diligently band and 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.300
 then that should help too 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.280
 crisis to grow there because 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.440
 uniform whole evening one thinks 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.330
 at the arabic to two thirds out 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.790
 Triceps is not just like them 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.590
 train and have his opponent but 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.480
 the thick one best promotes by one 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.260
 really bad 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.990
 diligently create and try out 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.130
 the fold ok i hope i could 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.770
 of course help 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.169
 and if you have questions write 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.510
 but in our comments if you 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.710
 I finally got interested in 14 teams 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.390
 Of course a lot of that in the body 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.890
 but would like to make videos 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.510
 but of course I want to go further 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.790
 because I do not want to worry about it 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.880
 if I talk now pineapple me this or 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.100
 Other things are not the point 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.960
 summer is coming make you fit i 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.180
 have uploaded again for now 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.890
 breast for construction and also for the whole 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.290
 Body meanwhile looks at you like that 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.760
 Diversity makes less with wrinkles 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.770
 other nutrition or should it 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.240
 so do not go crazy 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.160
 the first sunbeams shine and 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.400
 You can already see strong girls 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.940
 hot pants to run 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.650
 types of shorts is quite cool we are looking forward to 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.490
 us on it if it means we are 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.250
 it on the beach or in the swimming pool the whole 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.470
 It's cool to be fit for the year 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:44.660
 yes we will make the commitments a lot of fun and 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.660
 imitate valkyrie until next time
