00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
counterclockwise then I'm going to take

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.990 
counterclockwise then I'm going to take
the<00:01:16.560> other<00:01:16.680> strand<00:01:17.009> place<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.490> over<00:01:17.610> that

older tutorials keep in mind that if you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.670 
older tutorials keep in mind that if you
twist<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> same<00:01:36.930> direction<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.530> you're

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
twist in the same direction that you're

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.830 
twist in the same direction that you're
folding<00:01:38.009> over<00:01:38.100> then<00:01:38.700> ultimately<00:01:38.909> your<00:01:39.540> twist

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
folding over then ultimately your twist

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.889 
folding over then ultimately your twist
is<00:01:39.990> going<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.380> unravel<00:01:41.090> use<00:01:42.090> an<00:01:42.210> elastic<00:01:42.659> band

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
is going to unravel use an elastic band

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.520 
is going to unravel use an elastic band
and<00:01:43.140> tie<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.409> twist<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.950> place

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.420 

when<00:01:48.530> you're<00:01:48.650> done<00:01:48.890> it<00:01:49.040> should<00:01:49.070> look<00:01:49.370> like

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
when you're done it should look like

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.050 
when you're done it should look like
this<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:50.000> it<00:01:50.210> shouldn't<00:01:50.510> come<00:01:50.690> undone<00:01:52.060> going

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
this and it shouldn't come undone going

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.060 
this and it shouldn't come undone going
to<00:01:53.210> release<00:01:53.510> another<00:01:53.810> section<00:01:54.290> of<00:01:54.470> hair<00:01:54.800> and

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
to release another section of hair and

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
good at this you can actually do it

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.000 
faster by twisting the strands together
at<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.270> same<00:02:29.480> time<00:02:29.780> that's<00:02:30.200> how<00:02:30.350> I<00:02:30.380> usually<00:02:30.680> do

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
at the same time that's how I usually do

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.130 
at the same time that's how I usually do
it<00:02:31.160> but<00:02:31.640> for<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.000> sake<00:02:32.180> of<00:02:32.300> this<00:02:32.450> tutorial<00:02:32.600> I'm

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
it but for the sake of this tutorial I'm

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.450 
it but for the sake of this tutorial I'm
doing<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:33.560> way<00:02:33.620> because<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:34.130> find<00:02:34.370> that

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
doing it this way because I find that

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.270 
doing it this way because I find that
it's<00:02:34.640> better<00:02:34.880> for<00:02:35.000> beginners

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
it's better for beginners
