00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.010
 also in this 3 we just saw 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.050
 obviously the announcements of the consoles 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.119
 strong but we also saw something very 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.689
 curious what is the competition could we 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.980
 go direct from william which is 11 is this 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.919
 new console that are presenting 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.220
 right here on the e3 in the west hall that 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.349
 is a tablet a gaming console and 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.989
 also a way to make your 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.600
 televisions smrtv in given case that no 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.890
 count on this service what's interesting 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.140
 June - is the name that becomes 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.480
 universal or that everything is universal 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.120
 putting all together all the 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.920
 elements to make this new console 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.010
 what is so good the console itself is 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.120
 this 7-inch tablet which has 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.770
 intel core quad processor 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.460
 obviously the power is touch screen 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.290
 comes with android 4.2 and how interesting 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.689
 of this is that besides that it can be 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.060
 everything a tablet could do 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.320
 if you do not have a smart tv 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.780
 well, good 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.329
 they put it in this little doc connect it 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.020
 on television and automatically then 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.450
 can browse 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.219
 network watch youtube do practically the 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.649
 activities that would be left in a tablet 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:23.049
 only that on his television comes with two 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.159
 very interesting devices that are 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.710
 the ones that I'm going to 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.750
 show is this remote that 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.210
 it works practically like a control 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.189
 of normal television where you can 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.560
 turn on change channels or the 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.740
 accessories but if you turn it around 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.579
 comes with a comes with now yes with a 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.069
 keyboard so you can do 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:45.159
 practically put them to your mail 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:48.220
 write emails what you need and for 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.899
 last this control this control as 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.459
 can see is what comes with 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.640
 bluetooth comes with its home button 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:57.489
 comes with batteries charge bless come with 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.099
 with rechargeable batteries and comes with 

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:03.369
 usb connection to be loaded very 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:04.929
 similar to what we have seen in their 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.689
 competitors in terms of design is 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:11.110
 refers with two anal with two in something in 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.970
 this side the type of buttons and trigger 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.879
 from this side they can access the store 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.769
 of google play and download all the data or 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.940
 all the games that you want from this 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.820
 store 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.740
 now very important if you want 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.950
 download our other games 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.250
 there is going to be a special store of one 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.140
 that is going to be that is going to be optimal and 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.620
 optimized with the games of this 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.570
 console the point is that it sells in two 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.030
 versions and theoretically will be 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.360
 available in summer of this year a 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.080
 version includes the tablet the dock and the 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.080
 remote control and it costs 199 dollars 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.180
 while the complete edition the 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.640
 gamer edition includes the tablet the dock 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.170
 the remote control and this command or this 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.660
 control costs $ 249 as last 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:06.850
 point you can connect up to four 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.100
 controls simultaneously is horrible is 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.080
 that the game runs slow and play in the 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.250
 tablet a game of this type is 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.020
 horrible 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.160
 is that you can not start it because 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.569
 I have to go back 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.819
 home 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.780
 and I do not know how the game comes because I 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.030
 I wanted to chat 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.030
 I am going to explain to you how is is what 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.530
 the only thing that I think this shows us 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.269
 is that the android market is 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.930
 blooming with new consoles like 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.230
 weather 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.120
 here we have one in particular no no 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.650
 that is, what I love because 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.000
 I have always said it if there is good offer 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.530
 of games because they are going to be sold but if 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.629
 there's nothing that was google play 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.989
 less in side and a store then good 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:51.379
 we obviously have to see yes and if 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:54.769
 I also say 199 you already have tablet already 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:59.810
 I have stable because I do not 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:01.880
 necessarily the normality the two 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.960
 idem versions I think it follows 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.880
 trying to play 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.880
 but it is that I already managed to learn 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:16.240
 but I think it does not work I do not know how 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.240
 it does not matter, I do not care
