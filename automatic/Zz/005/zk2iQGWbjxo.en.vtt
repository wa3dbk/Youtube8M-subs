00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
of the edges to the line do not cut past

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.580 
of the edges to the line do not cut past
the<00:02:14.560> line<00:02:14.800> you<00:02:15.100> only<00:02:15.340> cut<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.300> line<00:02:18.209> cut<00:02:19.209> on

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
the line you only cut to the line cut on

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.060 
the line you only cut to the line cut on
the<00:02:20.590> folds<00:02:21.269> now<00:02:22.269> what<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:22.780> do<00:02:22.989> next<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.680> you

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
the folds now what you do next is you

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.790 
the folds now what you do next is you
design<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.760> paper<00:02:28.170> right<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.970> made<00:02:30.970> mine

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
design the paper right I made mine

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.020 
design the paper right I made mine
earlier<00:02:32.800> today<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.180> have<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.840> all<00:02:35.230> prepared

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
earlier today so I have it all prepared

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.070 
earlier today so I have it all prepared
now<00:02:37.030> we<00:02:37.840> make<00:02:38.700> TARDIS<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:40.600> TARDIS<00:02:40.930> is

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
now we make TARDIS the TARDIS is

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.680 
now we make TARDIS the TARDIS is
structure<00:02:41.560> what<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.519> like<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.970> do<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.239> flip<00:02:43.569> it

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
structure what I like to do is flip it

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.320 
structure what I like to do is flip it
over<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:44.019> the<00:02:44.110> blank<00:02:44.380> side<00:02:44.650> then<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.819> take

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
over to the blank side then you take

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.770 
over to the blank side then you take
these<00:02:46.600> two<00:02:46.840> corners<00:02:47.280> put<00:02:48.280> them<00:02:48.430> together<00:02:48.780> then

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
these two corners put them together then

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.330 
these two corners put them together then
you<00:02:49.989> reach<00:02:50.350> over<00:02:50.620> take<00:02:51.130> your<00:02:51.160> piece<00:02:51.579> tape<00:02:53.340> tape

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
you reach over take your piece tape tape

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.960 
you reach over take your piece tape tape
it<00:02:54.549> together<00:02:55.209> like<00:02:55.570> that<00:02:59.160> then<00:03:00.160> you<00:03:00.459> do<00:03:00.790> this

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
it together like that then you do this

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:13.860 
it together like that then you do this
same<00:03:03.000> thing<00:03:04.920> all<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.370> other<00:03:06.519> corners

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.310 

you<00:03:14.870> see<00:03:15.610> just<00:03:16.610> like<00:03:17.270> that

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
you see just like that

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.920 
you see just like that
then<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.400> gotta<00:03:19.640> do<00:03:19.910> it<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.120> your<00:03:20.240> top<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:23.690> do

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
then you gotta do it to your top you do

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.770 
then you gotta do it to your top you do
the<00:03:24.230> exact<00:03:25.190> same<00:03:27.250> thing<00:03:28.250> you<00:03:28.910> put<00:03:29.270> the<00:03:29.720> two

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
the exact same thing you put the two

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.820 
the exact same thing you put the two
overlapping<00:03:33.190> corners<00:03:34.190> together<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:35.830> you've

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
overlapping corners together and you've

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.210 
overlapping corners together and you've
tape<00:03:37.430> in<00:03:37.670> there<00:03:40.540> now<00:03:41.540> since<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.290> bottom<00:03:42.710> is

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
tape in there now since the bottom is

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.630 
tape in there now since the bottom is
already<00:03:43.790> taped<00:03:44.210> this<00:03:44.680> taping<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:45.920> top<00:03:46.250> can

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
already taped this taping that top can

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.310 
already taped this taping that top can
get<00:03:46.850> a<00:03:46.880> little<00:03:47.510> tricky<00:03:47.870> cuz<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:50.320> can't

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
get a little tricky cuz you can't

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.600 
get a little tricky cuz you can't
exactly<00:03:53.080> press<00:03:54.080> it<00:03:54.320> together<00:03:54.530> with<00:03:55.460> the

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
exactly press it together with the

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:02.730 
exactly press it together with the
papers<00:03:56.150> you're<00:03:56.600> gonna<00:03:56.720> have<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:57.020> do<00:03:57.260> your<00:03:57.440> best
