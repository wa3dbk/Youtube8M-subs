so<00:00:13.540> in<00:00:13.660> our<00:00:13.720> last<00:00:13.870> segment<00:00:14.380> we<00:00:14.440> looked<00:00:14.620> at<00:00:14.740> our

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
so in our last segment we looked at our

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.370 
so in our last segment we looked at our
first<00:00:15.130> chord<00:00:15.490> which<00:00:15.640> is<00:00:15.670> an<00:00:15.940> E<00:00:16.180> major<00:00:16.390> chord<00:00:16.600> we

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
first chord which is an E major chord we

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.960 
first chord which is an E major chord we
talked<00:00:17.590> about<00:00:17.710> how<00:00:17.890> to<00:00:17.920> have<00:00:18.190> the<00:00:18.370> fingers<00:00:18.760> and

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
talked about how to have the fingers and

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.850 
talked about how to have the fingers and
then<00:00:19.240> listening<00:00:19.600> for<00:00:19.810> potential<00:00:20.230> problems<00:00:20.650> as

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
then listening for potential problems as

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.310 
then listening for potential problems as
we<00:00:20.950> play<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.250> chord<00:00:21.490> one<00:00:21.670> note<00:00:21.880> at<00:00:22.029> a<00:00:22.090> time

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
we play the chord one note at a time

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.420 
we play the chord one note at a time
let's<00:00:23.320> talk<00:00:23.470> about<00:00:23.529> what<00:00:23.800> those<00:00:23.920> potential

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
let's talk about what those potential

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.600 
let's talk about what those potential
problems<00:00:24.880> are<00:00:25.090> and<00:00:25.240> how<00:00:25.330> we<00:00:25.390> can<00:00:25.600> solve<00:00:25.840> them

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
problems are and how we can solve them

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.430 
problems are and how we can solve them
one<00:00:27.610> problem<00:00:28.029> if<00:00:28.150> we're<00:00:28.300> having<00:00:28.420> a<00:00:28.690> buzzing

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.440 
one problem if we're having a buzzing

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.339 
one problem if we're having a buzzing
note<00:00:29.650> or<00:00:29.890> a<00:00:29.950> dead<00:00:30.340> note<00:00:30.550> can<00:00:31.270> be<00:00:31.300> not<00:00:32.020> pressing

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
note or a dead note can be not pressing

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.869 
note or a dead note can be not pressing
down<00:00:32.590> with<00:00:32.620> the<00:00:32.860> tip<00:00:33.040> of<00:00:33.129> the<00:00:33.250> finger<00:00:33.280> so<00:00:33.790> if

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
down with the tip of the finger so if

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:35.760 
down with the tip of the finger so if
we're<00:00:34.030> getting<00:00:34.090> a<00:00:34.510> bad<00:00:35.050> note<00:00:35.290> let's<00:00:35.470> say<00:00:35.620> the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
we're getting a bad note let's say the

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.229 
we're getting a bad note let's say the
sixth<00:00:36.100> string<00:00:36.340> on<00:00:36.489> this<00:00:36.640> chord<00:00:36.940> is<00:00:37.059> ringing

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
sixth string on this chord is ringing

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.500 
sixth string on this chord is ringing
just<00:00:37.540> fine<00:00:37.750> and<00:00:37.930> I<00:00:37.960> get<00:00:38.110> to<00:00:38.199> the<00:00:38.290> fifth<00:00:38.470> string

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
just fine and I get to the fifth string

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.790 
just fine and I get to the fifth string
it<00:00:40.510> can<00:00:40.600> be<00:00:40.870> that<00:00:40.960> I'm<00:00:41.080> not<00:00:41.260> pressing<00:00:41.500> it<00:00:41.739> down

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
it can be that I'm not pressing it down

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.450 
it can be that I'm not pressing it down
with<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.190> tip<00:00:42.309> of<00:00:42.430> my<00:00:42.489> finger

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
with the tip of my finger

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.389 
with the tip of my finger
or<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.020> I'm<00:00:46.500> too<00:00:46.739> far<00:00:46.980> back<00:00:47.160> on

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
or it can be that I'm too far back on

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.020 
or it can be that I'm too far back on
the<00:00:47.430> fret<00:00:48.290> and<00:00:49.290> just<00:00:50.190> sliding<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.640> forward

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the fret and just sliding that forward

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.270 
the fret and just sliding that forward
will<00:00:51.180> fix<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.620> those<00:00:52.769> are<00:00:52.920> things<00:00:53.100> that

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
will fix that so those are things that

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.569 
will fix that so those are things that
you<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.760> usually<00:00:53.940> fix<00:00:54.480> fairly<00:00:55.470> quickly<00:00:55.739> but

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
you can usually fix fairly quickly but

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.639 
you can usually fix fairly quickly but
getting<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.269> long-term<00:00:57.750> solution<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.500> can

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
getting a long-term solution to it can

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.259 
getting a long-term solution to it can
mean<00:00:58.829> building<00:00:59.250> up<00:00:59.399> some<00:00:59.610> muscle<00:00:59.820> memory<00:01:00.239> by

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
mean building up some muscle memory by

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:01.640 
mean building up some muscle memory by
trying<00:01:00.720> it<00:01:00.839> over<00:01:01.110> and<00:01:01.230> over

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
trying it over and over

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.649 
trying it over and over
putting<00:01:02.159> the<00:01:02.250> cord<00:01:02.489> down<00:01:02.730> making<00:01:03.360> sure<00:01:03.540> that

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
putting the cord down making sure that

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.980 
putting the cord down making sure that
each<00:01:03.809> finger<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.559> string<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.070> sounding<00:01:05.369> good

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
each finger and string is sounding good

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.820 
each finger and string is sounding good
let's<00:01:06.990> say<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.320> you're<00:01:07.409> playing<00:01:07.649> through

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
let's say that you're playing through

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.050 
let's say that you're playing through
the<00:01:07.979> cord<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:11.190> get<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> dead<00:01:11.610> string

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the cord and you get a dead string

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.760 
the cord and you get a dead string
that's<00:01:12.300> an<00:01:12.420> open<00:01:12.630> string<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.470> supposed

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that's an open string it's not supposed

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.100 
that's an open string it's not supposed
to<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:14.009> any<00:01:14.159> fingers<00:01:14.550> on<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.729> period<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.780> this

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
to have any fingers on it period in this

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.249 
to have any fingers on it period in this
case<00:01:16.170> my<00:01:16.560> second<00:01:16.979> string<00:01:17.250> isn't<00:01:18.030> ringing<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
case my second string isn't ringing the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.590 
case my second string isn't ringing the
problem<00:01:19.679> here<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.580> my<00:01:20.910> first<00:01:21.119> finger<00:01:21.390> is

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
problem here is that my first finger is

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.550 
problem here is that my first finger is
leaning<00:01:21.929> back<00:01:22.140> too<00:01:22.170> far<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:25.170> it's

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
leaning back too far and so it's

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.830 
leaning back too far and so it's
deadening<00:01:26.160> this<00:01:26.369> open<00:01:26.789> second<00:01:27.210> string<00:01:29.840> so

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
deadening this open second string so

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.749 
deadening this open second string so
what<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.020> need<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.289> do<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.770> arch<00:01:32.160> my<00:01:32.399> fingers<00:01:32.729> a

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
what I need to do is arch my fingers a

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.100 
what I need to do is arch my fingers a
little<00:01:32.820> bit<00:01:32.970> more<00:01:33.210> maybe<00:01:33.390> bring<00:01:33.690> my<00:01:33.869> thumb

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
little bit more maybe bring my thumb

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.820 
little bit more maybe bring my thumb
back<00:01:34.289> behind<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.860> little<00:01:34.979> bit<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.619> can

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
back behind a little bit so that I can

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.859 
back behind a little bit so that I can
allow<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.190> first<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.240> second<00:01:39.630> string<00:01:39.840> to

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
allow that first that second string to

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.770 
allow that first that second string to
ring<00:01:40.140> open<00:01:40.940> so<00:01:41.940> that<00:01:42.000> was<00:01:42.149> just<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.450> matter<00:01:42.659> of

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
ring open so that was just a matter of

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.809 
ring open so that was just a matter of
straightening<00:01:43.590> up<00:01:43.920> my<00:01:44.069> fingers<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.670> they

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
straightening up my fingers that they

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.849 
straightening up my fingers that they
came<00:01:45.030> down<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.390> more<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.600> an<00:01:45.690> arched<00:01:45.960> fashion

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.130 

so<00:01:50.859> those<00:01:51.460> are<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.939> basic<00:01:52.329> two<00:01:52.479> problems<00:01:52.929> that

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
so those are the basic two problems that

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.260 
so those are the basic two problems that
you<00:01:53.229> can<00:01:53.409> run<00:01:53.530> into<00:01:53.710> so<00:01:54.549> we've<00:01:54.670> looked<00:01:54.909> at<00:01:55.000> an<00:01:55.119> E

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
you can run into so we've looked at an E

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.969 
you can run into so we've looked at an E
major<00:01:55.479> we're<00:01:55.840> strumming<00:01:56.200> all<00:01:56.320> six<00:01:56.649> strings

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
major we're strumming all six strings

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.389 
major we're strumming all six strings
for<00:01:57.219> that<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.619> next<00:01:59.859> chord<00:02:00.069> let's<00:02:00.189> take<00:02:00.369> a

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
for that the next chord let's take a

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.510 
for that the next chord let's take a
look<00:02:00.640> at<00:02:00.759> is<00:02:00.969> AG<00:02:01.960> major<00:02:01.990> chord<00:02:02.520> there's

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
look at is AG major chord there's

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.039 
look at is AG major chord there's
several<00:02:04.090> different<00:02:04.210> ways<00:02:04.509> you'll<00:02:04.750> see<00:02:04.929> people

several different ways you'll see people
finger<00:02:05.560> this<00:02:05.740> and<00:02:06.069> a<00:02:06.429> lot<00:02:06.579> of<00:02:06.670> times<00:02:06.880> chords

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
finger this and a lot of times chords

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:08.969 
finger this and a lot of times chords
can<00:02:07.810> have<00:02:08.049> what's<00:02:08.289> called<00:02:08.440> different

can have what's called different

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.919 
can have what's called different
voicings<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:09.849> that's<00:02:10.299> where<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.599> can<00:02:10.750> use

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
voicings and that's where you can use

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.690 
voicings and that's where you can use
multiple<00:02:11.140> fingerings<00:02:11.769> for<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.069> same<00:02:12.280> chord
