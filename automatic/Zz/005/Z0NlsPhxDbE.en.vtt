basically you just need a iron ingots in

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.259 
basically you just need a iron ingots in
like<00:03:44.690> this<00:03:44.870> shape<00:03:45.079> so<00:03:45.950> that's<00:03:46.310> seven<00:03:46.669> iron<00:03:47.120> in

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
like this shape so that's seven iron in

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.240 
like this shape so that's seven iron in
God's<00:03:47.450> like<00:03:47.840> this<00:03:47.989> shape<00:03:48.230> like<00:03:48.530> it's<00:03:48.709> there's

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
God's like this shape like it's there's

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.699 
God's like this shape like it's there's
a<00:03:49.310> chunk<00:03:49.669> eat<00:03:49.880> it<00:03:50.060> out<00:03:50.180> of<00:03:50.269> it<00:03:50.389> and<00:03:50.569> Apple<00:03:51.440> Apple

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
a chunk eat it out of it and Apple Apple

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.800 
a chunk eat it out of it and Apple Apple
that's<00:03:52.220> kind<00:03:52.370> of<00:03:52.400> cool<00:03:52.549> glass<00:03:53.239> I<00:03:53.450> will<00:03:53.599> cover

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
that's kind of cool glass I will cover

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.080 
that's kind of cool glass I will cover
it<00:03:53.930> with<00:03:54.019> glass<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.560> rotten<00:03:55.400> apple<00:03:55.669> cover<00:03:55.849> it

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
it with glass and rotten apple cover it

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.690 
it with glass and rotten apple cover it
with<00:03:56.239> rotten<00:03:56.750> flesh<00:03:56.930> now<00:03:57.889> the<00:03:58.069> last<00:03:58.220> one<00:03:58.489> is<00:03:58.669> a

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
with rotten flesh now the last one is a

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.270 
with rotten flesh now the last one is a
new<00:03:58.940> item<00:03:59.299> called<00:03:59.569> the<00:03:59.720> rainbow<00:04:00.200> orb<00:04:00.440> and<00:04:00.650> are

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
new item called the rainbow orb and are

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.589 
new item called the rainbow orb and are
basically<00:04:01.549> unit<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:01.940> a<00:04:02.000> pearl<00:04:02.180> in<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.359> middle

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
basically unit and a pearl in the middle

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.270 
basically unit and a pearl in the middle
and<00:04:02.720> then<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:02.870> need<00:04:03.019> red<00:04:03.290> orange<00:04:03.980> yellow

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
and then you need red orange yellow

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.170 
and then you need red orange yellow
green<00:04:04.879> blue<00:04:05.410> dark<00:04:06.410> blue<00:04:06.500> purple<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.609> bone

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
green blue dark blue purple and bone

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.890 
green blue dark blue purple and bone
meal<00:04:08.209> die<00:04:09.079> all<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.680> way<00:04:09.799> around<00:04:09.829> and<00:04:10.690> at<00:04:11.690> first

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
meal die all the way around and at first

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.000 
meal die all the way around and at first
I<00:04:12.109> thought<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.319> wouldn't<00:04:12.590> matter<00:04:12.709> which

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
I thought I wouldn't matter which

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.439 
I thought I wouldn't matter which
combination<00:04:13.639> is<00:04:13.760> but<00:04:14.000> then<00:04:14.120> I<00:04:14.150> kind<00:04:14.419> of

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:14.449 
combination is but then I kind of

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:15.879 
combination is but then I kind of
realized<00:04:14.780> it<00:04:14.900> is<00:04:15.049> because<00:04:15.349> it<00:04:15.500> kind<00:04:15.680> of<00:04:15.739> goes

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
realized it is because it kind of goes

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.979 
realized it is because it kind of goes
down<00:04:16.160> in<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:16.370> rainbow<00:04:16.760> in<00:04:17.209> this<00:04:17.539> correlation

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
down in the rainbow in this correlation

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.289 
down in the rainbow in this correlation
like<00:04:18.260> red<00:04:18.530> orange<00:04:19.190> yellow<00:04:19.280> green<00:04:19.519> so<00:04:19.940> it<00:04:20.120> kind

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
like red orange yellow green so it kind

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.219 
like red orange yellow green so it kind
of<00:04:20.359> yeah<00:04:20.539> so<00:04:20.810> I<00:04:21.019> think<00:04:21.620> it<00:04:21.709> has<00:04:21.799> to<00:04:22.010> be<00:04:22.180> sat

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
of yeah so I think it has to be sat

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.140 
of yeah so I think it has to be sat
combination<00:04:24.229> so<00:04:24.500> that<00:04:25.250> crafting<00:04:25.610> recipes<00:04:25.940> so

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
combination so that crafting recipes so

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.060 
combination so that crafting recipes so
yeah<00:04:26.479> it's<00:04:26.690> just<00:04:26.870> do<00:04:27.500> that<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.860> get<00:04:27.950> these

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
yeah it's just do that you get these

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.620 
yeah it's just do that you get these
rainbow<00:04:28.370> herbs<00:04:28.669> and

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
rainbow herbs and

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.780 
rainbow herbs and
then<00:04:29.780> you<00:04:30.620> can<00:04:30.740> cover<00:04:31.010> these<00:04:31.130> rainbow<00:04:31.430> orbs<00:04:31.700> to

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
then you can cover these rainbow orbs to

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.150 
then you can cover these rainbow orbs to
make<00:04:31.910> a<00:04:31.940> rainbow<00:04:32.210> apple<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:32.780> a<00:04:33.410> rainbow<00:04:33.830> Apple

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
make a rainbow apple and a rainbow Apple

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.200 
make a rainbow apple and a rainbow Apple
Apple<00:04:34.310> which<00:04:34.910> is<00:04:35.120> kind<00:04:35.720> of<00:04:35.780> cool<00:04:36.100> yeah<00:04:37.100> so<00:04:37.210> now

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
Apple which is kind of cool yeah so now

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.150 
Apple which is kind of cool yeah so now
we're<00:04:38.450> going<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:38.600> go<00:04:38.720> into<00:04:38.750> what<00:04:39.560> these<00:04:39.710> do<00:04:39.920> and

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
we're going to go into what these do and

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.770 
we're going to go into what these do and
I<00:04:40.340> got<00:04:40.490> my<00:04:40.610> little<00:04:40.820> book<00:04:41.120> that<00:04:41.420> I<00:04:41.450> broke<00:04:41.720> down

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
I got my little book that I broke down

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.350 
I got my little book that I broke down
and<00:04:42.200> just<00:04:43.190> looking<00:04:43.550> at<00:04:43.640> these<00:04:43.760> to<00:04:44.090> make<00:04:44.240> it

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
and just looking at these to make it

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.990 
and just looking at these to make it
easier<00:04:44.660> so<00:04:45.320> all<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.740> meaty<00:04:45.950> ones<00:04:46.310> can<00:04:46.700> be<00:04:46.820> fed

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
easier so all the meaty ones can be fed

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.530 
easier so all the meaty ones can be fed
to<00:04:47.030> your<00:04:47.240> wolf<00:04:47.480> and<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:47.990> heals<00:04:48.200> more<00:04:48.590> hearts
