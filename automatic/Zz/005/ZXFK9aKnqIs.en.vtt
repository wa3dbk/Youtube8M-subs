there<00:00:00.539> are<00:00:00.630> several<00:00:00.930> stages<00:00:01.199> in<00:00:01.469> making<00:00:01.800> a

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
there are several stages in making a

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.059 
there are several stages in making a
puppet<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.760> first<00:00:03.060> is<00:00:03.410> of<00:00:04.410> course<00:00:04.529> what<00:00:04.950> is

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
puppet the first is of course what is

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.369 
puppet the first is of course what is
the<00:00:05.220> character<00:00:05.670> it<00:00:05.819> has<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:06.180> be<00:00:06.330> then<00:00:07.080> what

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
the character it has to be then what

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.350 
the character it has to be then what
does<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:07.529> have<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.950> do<00:00:08.130> how<00:00:08.760> does<00:00:08.910> it<00:00:09.059> have<00:00:09.210> to

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
does it have to do how does it have to

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.280 
does it have to do how does it have to
move<00:00:10.580> for<00:00:11.580> me<00:00:11.759> it's<00:00:12.059> very<00:00:12.210> important<00:00:13.110> to

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
move for me it's very important to

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.530 
move for me it's very important to
understand<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.429> movement<00:00:14.910> required<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
understand the movement required of the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.170 
understand the movement required of the
figure<00:00:15.870> what<00:00:16.740> role<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.190> has<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.369> play<00:00:17.520> what

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
figure what role it has to play what

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.630 
figure what role it has to play what
space<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.869> has<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.199> occupy<00:00:19.710> on<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.369> stage

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
space it has to occupy on the stage

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.290 
space it has to occupy on the stage
because<00:00:21.529> the<00:00:22.580> barriers<00:00:23.580> behind<00:00:24.029> which<00:00:24.269> you

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
because the barriers behind which you

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.720 
because the barriers behind which you
manipulate<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.439> or<00:00:25.590> whether<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.220> manipulate

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
constructed so the knowledge of what its

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.280 
constructed so the knowledge of what its
movement<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.910> vital<00:00:37.160> then<00:00:39.020> knowing<00:00:40.020> what<00:00:40.050> it

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
horse job was to go to the Natural

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.279 
horse job was to go to the Natural
History<00:00:50.610> Museum<00:00:50.910> here<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.719> look<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
History Museum here and look at the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.770 
History Museum here and look at the
skeleton<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.340> horse<00:00:53.370> which<00:00:54.120> has<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> skin<00:00:54.750> on

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
skeleton of a horse which has a skin on

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.540 
skeleton of a horse which has a skin on
one<00:00:55.170> side<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> skeleton<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.340> other

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
one side and the skeleton on the other

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.670 
one side and the skeleton on the other
side<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.239> see<00:00:57.690> where<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> bones<00:00:58.170> fit<00:00:58.530> into

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
side so you see where the bones fit into

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.720 
side so you see where the bones fit into
the<00:00:58.920> skin<00:00:59.250> then<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> reduce<00:01:00.690> that

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
the skin then you have to reduce that

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.789 
the skin then you have to reduce that
fabulous<00:01:02.730> movement<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.449> real<00:01:03.629> horse<00:01:03.930> into

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
fabulous movement of a real horse into

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.940 
fabulous movement of a real horse into
what<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.460> achieved<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.950> manipulating

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
what can be achieved with a manipulating

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.840 
what can be achieved with a manipulating
inside<00:01:09.530> where<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.590> case<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.010> horses<00:01:11.369> we

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
inside where the case of the horses we

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.480 
inside where the case of the horses we
tried<00:01:12.390> out<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.930> paper<00:01:13.590> version<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.280> horse

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
tried out a paper version of a horse

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.480 
tried out a paper version of a horse
then<00:01:15.420> we<00:01:15.570> tried<00:01:15.810> out<00:01:16.110> whether<00:01:16.439> somebody<00:01:17.130> could

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
then we tried out whether somebody could

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.270 
then we tried out whether somebody could
actually<00:01:17.520> sit<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.170> two<00:01:19.170> manipulators<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.159> we

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
actually sit on two manipulators so we

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.580 
actually sit on two manipulators so we
constructed<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.299> ladder<00:01:21.630> between<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
constructed a little ladder between the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.770 
constructed a little ladder between the
shoulders<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.159> two<00:01:23.340> people<00:01:23.700> had<00:01:24.150> somebody<00:01:24.390> sit

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
shoulders of two people had somebody sit

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.719 
shoulders of two people had somebody sit
on<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> leather<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> middle<00:01:25.740> realized<00:01:26.549> it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
on the leather in the middle realized it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.050 
on the leather in the middle realized it
was<00:01:26.909> possible<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.659> not<00:01:28.049> too<00:01:28.290> heavy<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.880> that

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
was possible and not too heavy so that

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.890 
was possible and not too heavy so that
we<00:01:30.240> already<00:01:30.420> had<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.380> potentials<00:01:32.009> of

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
we already had the the potentials of

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.030 
we already had the the potentials of
over<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.079> manipulate<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> horse<00:01:36.020> there<00:01:37.040> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
over to manipulate a horse there the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.749 
over to manipulate a horse there the
design<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.329> puppet<00:01:40.310> how<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.670> to

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
design of the puppet how it's going to

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.499 
design of the puppet how it's going to
look<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.409> often<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:44.189> determined<00:01:44.729> by<00:01:45.270> what

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
look it can often be determined by what

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.810 
look it can often be determined by what
it<00:01:45.630> has<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> case<00:01:47.640> of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
it has to do with the in the case of

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.440 
it has to do with the in the case of
these<00:01:47.970> horses<00:01:49.549> knowing<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.700> anatomy<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.240> the

all of these mechanical needs of the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.390 
all of these mechanical needs of the
horse<00:02:24.349> determined<00:02:25.349> that<00:02:25.469> it<00:02:26.040> had<00:02:26.159> to<00:02:26.280> have<00:02:26.370> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
horse determined that it had to have a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.360 
horse determined that it had to have a
flexible<00:02:26.670> material<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.450> cane<00:02:27.719> was<00:02:27.900> 2,000<00:02:28.739> you

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
flexible material so cane was 2,000 you

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.709 
flexible material so cane was 2,000 you
couldn't<00:02:29.639> have<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> solid<00:02:30.120> head<00:02:30.329> because<00:02:30.599> at

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:30.719 
couldn't have a solid head because at

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.720 
couldn't have a solid head because at
the<00:02:30.810> end<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:31.079> a<00:02:31.200> meter<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.040> half<00:02:32.069> long<00:02:32.250> Nick

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
the end of a meter and a half long Nick

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.940 
the end of a meter and a half long Nick
or<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.239> meter<00:02:33.540> long<00:02:33.659> Nick<00:02:34.019> anything<00:02:34.469> is<00:02:34.709> heavy

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
or a meter long Nick anything is heavy

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.780 
or a meter long Nick anything is heavy
so<00:02:35.489> it<00:02:35.579> also<00:02:35.760> had<00:02:35.969> to<00:02:36.090> be<00:02:36.120> cane<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.959> cloth<00:02:37.790> and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
so it also had to be cane and cloth and

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.920 
so it also had to be cane and cloth and
then<00:02:40.249> knowing<00:02:41.249> that<00:02:41.370> these<00:02:41.999> were<00:02:42.209> kind<00:02:42.749> of<00:02:42.870> the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
then knowing that these were kind of the

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.280 
then knowing that these were kind of the
restrictions<00:02:43.620> with<00:02:43.859> which<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.219> build<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.549> horse

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
restrictions with which to build a horse

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.860 
restrictions with which to build a horse
some<00:02:46.290> kind<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.620> graphic<00:02:47.310> quality<00:02:47.939> needed<00:02:48.659> to

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
some kind of graphic quality needed to

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.720 
some kind of graphic quality needed to
be<00:02:49.019> incorporated<00:02:49.859> into<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.250> look<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:52.730> the

be incorporated into the look and the
guy<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.269> I<00:02:54.359> was<00:02:54.510> working<00:02:54.930> with<00:02:55.879> developed<00:02:56.879> a

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:56.969 
guy that I was working with developed a

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.929 
guy that I was working with developed a

system of sewing came around plywood

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:06.199 
system of sewing came around plywood
shapes<00:03:01.400> which<00:03:04.219> gave<00:03:05.219> the<00:03:05.430> form<00:03:05.699> of<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.000> horse

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
shapes which gave the form of the horse

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.589 
shapes which gave the form of the horse
but<00:03:06.870> also<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:07.889> flex<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.939> the<00:03:09.090> cane<00:03:09.329> so

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
but also the flex of the cane so

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.030 
but also the flex of the cane so
incredibly<00:03:12.599> detailed<00:03:12.870> plans<00:03:13.439> of<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.739> horses

incredibly detailed plans of the horses

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.740 
incredibly detailed plans of the horses
were<00:03:14.189> drawn<00:03:14.400> up<00:03:14.430> these<00:03:15.060> were<00:03:15.239> blown<00:03:15.419> up<00:03:15.449> to

cane was in shaped and dried in these

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.349 
cane was in shaped and dried in these
forms<00:03:28.530> when<00:03:29.099> they<00:03:29.609> were<00:03:29.759> dry<00:03:29.970> they<00:03:30.180> were<00:03:30.269> all

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
forms when they were dry they were all

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.749 
forms when they were dry they were all
sewn<00:03:30.659> together<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.650> bit<00:03:31.949> by<00:03:31.979> bit<00:03:32.189> every

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:32.759 
sewn together so bit by bit every

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.399 
sewn together so bit by bit every
element<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.389> horse<00:03:33.569> came<00:03:33.840> together<00:03:34.049> in

element of the horse came together in
the<00:03:34.739> in<00:03:34.919> that<00:03:35.099> way<00:03:35.280> -<00:03:35.340> that's<00:03:36.000> why<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.269> took<00:03:36.419> so

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
the in that way - that's why it took so

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.750 
the in that way - that's why it took so
long
