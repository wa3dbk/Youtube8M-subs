better dungeons and guys if you didn't

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.390 
better dungeons and guys if you didn't
know<00:00:18.720> better<00:00:18.900> dungeons<00:00:19.500> actually<00:00:19.890> added<00:00:20.130> two

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
know better dungeons actually added two

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.150 
know better dungeons actually added two
brand<00:00:20.789> new<00:00:20.880> bosses<00:00:21.240> one<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.350> Triton<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
brand new bosses one is the Triton and

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.910 
brand new bosses one is the Triton and
other<00:00:23.430> one<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.910> Goblin<00:00:24.420> shaman<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.710> think

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
other one the Goblin shaman and I think

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.560 
other one the Goblin shaman and I think
really<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.310> most<00:00:26.490> exciting<00:00:27.060> one<00:00:27.240> was<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
really the most exciting one was the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.480 
really the most exciting one was the
Triton<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.320> figured<00:00:28.679> he'd<00:00:28.769> toss<00:00:28.980> him<00:00:29.160> into<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
Triton so I figured he'd toss him into a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.550 
Triton so I figured he'd toss him into a
battle<00:00:29.849> today<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.390> he<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.990> gonna<00:00:31.140> be<00:00:31.230> going

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
battle today and he is gonna be going

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.710 
battle today and he is gonna be going

I<00:01:21.480> love<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.290> move<00:01:22.530> helix<00:01:23.100> pins<00:01:23.430> around<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
I love that move helix pins around in a

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.290 
I love that move helix pins around in a
circle<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:24.870> owns<00:01:25.590> everything<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:27.270> I

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
circle and just owns everything so I

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.120 
circle and just owns everything so I
imagine<00:01:27.540> he<00:01:27.810> could<00:01:27.930> probably<00:01:28.200> kill<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> lot<00:01:29.010> of

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
imagine he could probably kill a lot of

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.580 
imagine he could probably kill a lot of
mobs<00:01:29.340> at<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> same<00:01:29.790> time<00:01:30.030> he<00:01:30.900> only<00:01:31.080> took<00:01:31.290> ten

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.790 
mobs at the same time he only took ten
damage<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.280> feel<00:01:32.970> bad<00:01:33.210> now<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.780> since<00:01:34.620> he

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
damage I feel bad now and since he

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.800 
damage I feel bad now and since he
didn't<00:01:35.010> take<00:01:35.100> much<00:01:35.310> guys<00:01:35.550> I<00:01:35.730> figured<00:01:36.210> why<00:01:36.659> not

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
didn't take much guys I figured why not

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.180

right<00:05:49.709> so<00:05:49.829> I<00:05:49.860> guess<00:05:50.069> the<00:05:50.219> Triton<00:05:50.579> is

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
right so I guess the Triton is

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.509 
right so I guess the Triton is
definitely<00:05:51.509> beating<00:05:52.499> the<00:05:52.649> Titan<00:05:53.129> really

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:53.519 
definitely beating the Titan really

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.540 
definitely beating the Titan really
badly<00:05:54.589> with<00:05:55.589> the<00:05:55.619> way<00:05:55.800> this<00:05:55.949> is<00:05:56.009> going<00:05:56.309> I'm

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
badly with the way this is going I'm

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.920 
badly with the way this is going I'm
thinking<00:05:56.909> that<00:05:57.029> right<00:05:57.300> on<00:05:57.479> might<00:05:57.719> actually

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
thinking that right on might actually

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.019 
thinking that right on might actually
have<00:05:58.199> a<00:05:58.259> chance<00:05:58.589> against<00:05:59.009> the<00:05:59.159> Walker<00:05:59.339> King<00:05:59.699> I

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:00.029 
have a chance against the Walker King I

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:02.059 
have a chance against the Walker King I
try<00:06:00.599> to<00:06:00.659> put<00:06:00.839> like<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.079> last<00:06:01.349> one<00:06:01.740> for<00:06:01.979> the

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 
try to put like the last one for the

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.669 
try to put like the last one for the
battle<00:06:02.429> really<00:06:02.909> difficult<00:06:03.479> and<00:06:04.259> I'm<00:06:04.379> thinking

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:04.679 
battle really difficult and I'm thinking

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:05.779 
battle really difficult and I'm thinking
he<00:06:04.769> might<00:06:04.800> win<00:06:05.009> this<00:06:05.249> I<00:06:05.399> don't<00:06:05.610> know<00:06:05.669> guys

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
he might win this I don't know guys

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.579 
he might win this I don't know guys
we're<00:06:05.969> gonna<00:06:06.089> find<00:06:06.360> out<00:06:06.539> in<00:06:06.689> one<00:06:06.899> second<00:06:07.409> and

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:07.589 
we're gonna find out in one second and

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:08.449 
we're gonna find out in one second and
let<00:06:07.829> the<00:06:07.919> battle<00:06:08.069> begin

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:08.459 
let the battle begin

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:11.329 
let the battle begin
you<00:06:09.389> got<00:06:09.509> to<00:06:09.599> spin<00:06:09.869> like<00:06:09.990> a<00:06:10.050> psycho<00:06:10.559> all<00:06:11.219> right

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:11.339 
you got to spin like a psycho all right

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:12.589 
you got to spin like a psycho all right
maybe<00:06:11.490> not<00:06:11.550> he's<00:06:11.879> going<00:06:12.029> down<00:06:12.209> pretty<00:06:12.419> quick

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
maybe not he's going down pretty quick

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.749 
maybe not he's going down pretty quick
isn't<00:06:12.779> he<00:06:12.990> I<00:06:13.199> think<00:06:13.769> his<00:06:13.889> defense<00:06:14.399> might<00:06:14.610> be

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
isn't he I think his defense might be

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.779 
isn't he I think his defense might be
too<00:06:15.029> low<00:06:15.269> for<00:06:15.479> the<00:06:15.569> Walker<00:06:15.779> King<00:06:16.699> alright<00:06:17.699> the

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:17.789 
too low for the Walker King alright the

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:19.759 
too low for the Walker King alright the
Troy<00:06:17.969> Todd<00:06:18.179> is<00:06:18.329> down<00:06:18.479> to<00:06:18.569> 42<00:06:18.869> Walker<00:06:19.319> King

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:19.769 
Troy Todd is down to 42 Walker King

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:23.149 
Troy Todd is down to 42 Walker King
still<00:06:20.399> at<00:06:20.639> like<00:06:20.849> 200<00:06:21.689> this<00:06:22.319> defense<00:06:22.979> is

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:23.159 
still at like 200 this defense is

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:25.040 
still at like 200 this defense is

King<00:06:55.229> gets<00:06:55.380> low<00:06:55.530> on<00:06:55.680> health<00:06:55.830> his<00:06:56.009> armor<00:06:56.340> does

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
King gets low on health his armor does

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.040 
King gets low on health his armor does
break<00:06:56.910> and<00:06:57.060> he<00:06:57.120> starts<00:06:57.360> to<00:06:57.419> take<00:06:57.600> more<00:06:57.840> damage

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
break and he starts to take more damage

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.770 
break and he starts to take more damage
and<00:06:58.500> that's<00:06:58.770> probably<00:06:59.250> their<00:07:00.030> best<00:07:00.330> chance<00:07:00.449> at
