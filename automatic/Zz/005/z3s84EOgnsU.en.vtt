00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.260 
Bryan getting injured but now they're
kind<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.219> fixing<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.430> track<00:00:32.820> where<00:00:33.120> they're

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
kind of fixing that track where they're

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.130 
kind of fixing that track where they're
gonna<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.690> Cena<00:00:34.520> versus<00:00:35.520> Brock<00:00:35.790> again<00:00:36.270> at

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
gonna have Cena versus Brock again at

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.490 
gonna have Cena versus Brock again at
SummerSlam<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.160> from<00:00:39.149> there<00:00:39.469> obviously<00:00:40.469> I

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
SummerSlam and from there obviously I

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.840 
SummerSlam and from there obviously I
think<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:40.860> pretty<00:00:41.040> evident<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.610> Brock

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
think it's pretty evident that Brock

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.030 
think it's pretty evident that Brock
buzzer<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.270> gonna<00:00:42.420> win<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> title<00:00:43.040> Bryan's

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
buzzer is gonna win the title Bryan's

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.889 
buzzer is gonna win the title Bryan's
gonna<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.370> us<00:00:44.489> come<00:00:44.730> back<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.180> then<00:00:45.600> Brian's

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
gonna have us come back and then Brian's

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.200 
gonna have us come back and then Brian's
going<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.079> regain<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> title<00:00:46.680> maybe<00:00:47.340> maybe

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
going to regain the title maybe maybe

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.850 
going to regain the title maybe maybe
there'll<00:00:48.480> be<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.600> swerve<00:00:48.899> along<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> way<00:00:49.530> where

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
there'll be a swerve along the way where

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.619 
there'll be a swerve along the way where
maybe<00:00:50.160> Brock<00:00:50.489> keeps<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.910> title<00:00:51.239> for<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> while

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
maybe Brock keeps a title for a while

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.860 
maybe Brock keeps a title for a while
but<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:53.219> by<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.149> way<00:00:54.360> things<00:00:54.420> are<00:00:54.840> going

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
but I think by the way things are going

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.590 
but I think by the way things are going
and<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.340> elevate<00:00:56.730> Brian<00:00:57.030> from<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.420> up

and just to elevate Brian from like up

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.750 
and just to elevate Brian from like up

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
have he's gonna beat Brock Lesnar when

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.889 
have he's gonna beat Brock Lesnar when
you<00:01:01.890> put<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.280> into<00:01:02.489> perspective<00:01:02.719> who<00:01:03.719> else

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
you put that into perspective who else

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.570 
you put that into perspective who else
would<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.140> really<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.470> win<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.280> Money<00:01:05.519> in

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
would you really have win that Money in

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.910 
would you really have win that Money in
the<00:01:05.670> Bank<00:01:05.729> ladder<00:01:06.000> match<00:01:06.299> yesterday<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.830> know

the Bank ladder match yesterday you know

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.649 
the Bank ladder match yesterday you know
you<00:01:08.010> could<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.189> given<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.549> Sheamus<00:01:08.970> but

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
you could have given to Sheamus but

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.210 
you could have given to Sheamus but
Sheamus<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.500> early<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.770> United<00:01:11.070> States

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220

Champion and him verse Brock Lesnar

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.469 
Champion and him verse Brock Lesnar
obviously<00:01:13.890> doesn't<00:01:14.159> make<00:01:14.250> sense<00:01:14.430> cuz<00:01:14.820> Brock's

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
obviously doesn't make sense cuz Brock's

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.149 
obviously doesn't make sense cuz Brock's
appear<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.110> then<00:01:16.200> Sheamus<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.740> kind<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.040> down

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.780 
Rio's a healed Brock's a heel so and
just<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> believability<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.520> just

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
just the believability and that is just

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.070 
just the believability and that is just
way<00:01:24.390> over<00:01:24.420> everyone's<00:01:25.049> head<00:01:25.520> Cesaro<00:01:27.080> although

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
way over everyone's head Cesaro although

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.600 
way over everyone's head Cesaro although
I<00:01:28.110> think<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.619> lot<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.770> people<00:01:28.890> wanted<00:01:29.369> him<00:01:29.490> to

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.510 
that little time period where was like
punk<00:03:15.510> Del<00:03:15.870> Rio<00:03:16.080> back<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.680> Punk<00:03:16.920> back<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.310> seeing

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
punk Del Rio back to Punk back to seeing

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.340 
punk Del Rio back to Punk back to seeing
a<00:03:17.610> backdoor<00:03:18.030> Rio<00:03:18.210> nut<00:03:18.480> back<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.870> punk<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.320> then

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
a backdoor Rio nut back to punk and then

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.850 
a backdoor Rio nut back to punk and then
punk<00:03:19.620> had<00:03:19.800> that<00:03:19.920> long<00:03:20.130> title<00:03:20.640> reign<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.540> a

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
punk had that long title reign so a

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.080 
punk had that long title reign so a
flip-flop<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.100> championship<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:23.910> not<00:03:24.060> a

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
flip-flop of the championship is not a

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.760 
flip-flop of the championship is not a
big<00:03:24.300> deal<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.630> look<00:03:24.750> at<00:03:24.900> Bryan<00:03:25.050> Bryan<00:03:25.410> had<00:03:25.680> the

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
big deal and look at Bryan Bryan had the

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.740 
big deal and look at Bryan Bryan had the
title<00:03:26.070> for<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.250> month<00:03:26.460> and<00:03:26.670> quite<00:03:27.180> possibly<00:03:27.210> the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
title for a month and quite possibly the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.810 
title for a month and quite possibly the
worst<00:03:27.990> WWE<00:03:28.740> title<00:03:29.040> reign<00:03:29.130> in<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.370> long<00:03:29.580> long

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
worst WWE title reign in a long long

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.380
