00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.770
 No use: the day-to-day running always disturbs our routines and plans, 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.650
 leaves us with too much work and less time for other important things. 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.100
 And when people least expect it, 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.100
 it is quite possible to end up with an empty house refrigerator for lack of time to go to the market. 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.300
 But if the rhythm of the modern everyday messes up on the one hand, 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.140
 technology always comes from the other to save us with some very practical solution. 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.300
 For Paulistas, for example, it has now become even easier to refill the refrigerator: 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.820
 on the way from home to work or vice versa, just take advantage of the waiting time 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.320
 in some subway stations of the city to already make their purchases and to supply the kitchen 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.940
 Just a smartphone in hand and one of these panels with virtual supermarket shelves, 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.180
 installed by the Mercode startup at the Faria Lima and ButantÃ£ stations of Linha-4 Amarela. 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.980
 "This is the second time that we do this action, we launched it during the World Cup, 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.480
 last year, 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.690
 both times we noticed a very large increase, more than 200% in the application downloads. 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.200
 So what is very common is the person being passing by the subway, she sees a panel, she lowers the application, 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.580
 starts your shopping here and ends inside the train, or when you arrive at work, or at home " 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.610
 The process is quite simple: first just download the service application, available for Android or iOS, 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.750
 and create an account, registering address and credit card. 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.200
 When facing the dashboard, place the zip code from the delivery location. 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.800
 There the service will show all partner markets that are in the same region. 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.700
 So, just start shopping: just line up the smartphone with the QR code of the chosen product, 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.940
 confirm the desired quantity and add to cart. 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.040
 When the purchases are finished, just pay through the smartphone itself and you're done! 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.780
 The first part is already resolved. 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.760
 Now just wait: the chosen market will receive your grocery list, 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.180
 through the application system, and you can begin packaging. 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.500
 The delivery time varies according to the market and the chosen products: 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.300
 Common products like soft drinks and crackers are faster, 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.420
 but specialty products may take longer to arrive. 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.020
 But in general, delivery happens within 24 hours and has a freight value that does not exceed $ 15. 

00:02:01.134 --> 00:02:03.134
 With little more than a year and a half of existence, 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.780
 Mercode works by providing all online sales logistics for small and medium businesses 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.740
 - companies that want to sell online, but do not have an infrastructure dedicated to it. 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.500
 "These are stores that want to open an online channel, many of them already deliver, 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.380
 but do not have, or do not want, 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.860
 the job of opening a store and leaving specialized staff for it. 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.800
 So we open the store for them, manage all that order entry, 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.320
 the question of prices, the stock, the whole online part of the sale, 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.160
 while the partner goes and delivers it to the end customer. " 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:37.089
 Despite being temporary, the system caught the attention and the company already plans to install 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:39.309
 new panels in other stations. 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.580
 The idea is that the initiative is itinerant and can reach different types of users in different regions. 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.580
 But for now, the creators have not yet talked about where the next batch of panels will be. 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.400
