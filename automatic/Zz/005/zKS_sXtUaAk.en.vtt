00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
of his game I thought the first goal on

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.019 
of his game I thought the first goal on
Saturday<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.890> first<00:00:05.100> goal<00:00:05.310> at<00:00:05.430> Madrid<00:00:05.670> scored

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
really have got to be concentrated at

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.080 
really have got to be concentrated at
all<00:01:09.869> time<00:01:10.080> because<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> second<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.520> EC's<00:01:11.909> him

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
all time because the second the EC's him

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.660 
all time because the second the EC's him
come<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.390> he<00:01:12.570> spins<00:01:12.900> him<00:01:13.080> behind<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:14.460> he's

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
come in he spins him behind and he's

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.039 
come in he spins him behind and he's
left<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:14.970> dead<00:01:15.180> he's<00:01:15.360> left<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.600> center<00:01:15.840> back

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
left for dead he's left the center back

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.109 
left for dead he's left the center back
and<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> right<00:01:16.560> back<00:01:16.799> he<00:01:17.280> green<00:01:17.520> plays<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.880> mean

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and the right back he green plays I mean

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.690 
and the right back he green plays I mean
it's<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.330> wonderful<00:01:18.689> pass<00:01:19.310> assist<00:01:20.310> for<00:01:20.549> his

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
it's a wonderful pass assist for his

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.340 
it's a wonderful pass assist for his
teammate<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.540> scrappy<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> end<00:01:22.200> but

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
teammate so it's scrappy in the end but

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.710 
teammate so it's scrappy in the end but
Benzema<00:01:22.770> scores<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.119> second<00:01:24.540> goal<00:01:24.689> I

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
Benzema scores on this second goal I

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.120 
Benzema scores on this second goal I
think<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.200> particularly<00:01:25.500> poignant<00:01:25.770> for

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
think this is particularly poignant for

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.350 
think this is particularly poignant for
tonight<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.580> mean<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> position<00:01:27.299> that

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
tonight I mean this is a position that

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.359 
tonight I mean this is a position that
you<00:01:27.479> could<00:01:27.630> see<00:01:27.810> United<00:01:28.229> being<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.829> many

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
you could see United being in on many
