stores it's just a felt bottom and

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.190 
stores it's just a felt bottom and
normally<00:01:39.530> these<00:01:40.530> would<00:01:40.829> go<00:01:40.979> on<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.750> bottom<00:01:43.079> of

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
normally these would go on the bottom of

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.130 
normally these would go on the bottom of
the<00:01:43.320> door<00:01:43.469> like<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.219> hang<00:01:44.460> down<00:01:45.140> that's

the door like that and hang down that's

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.510 
the door like that and hang down that's
not<00:01:46.259> how<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.649> do<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:48.710> what<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:49.829> do<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.159> we<00:01:50.250> figure

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
not how we do it what we do is we figure

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.330 
not how we do it what we do is we figure
out<00:01:50.640> which<00:01:50.759> way<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:50.969> door<00:01:51.270> closes<00:01:51.929> and<00:01:52.439> it

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
out which way the door closes and it

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.270 
out which way the door closes and it
goes<00:01:53.490> on

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.310 

the<00:01:56.850> bottom<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.900> this<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:00.900> got<00:02:01.080> to<00:02:01.230> go

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the bottom like this and it's got to go

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.680 
the bottom like this and it's got to go
with<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.530> whole<00:02:01.710> length<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.880> door<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.450> it

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
with a whole length of the door and it

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.850 
with a whole length of the door and it
needs<00:02:06.900> to<00:02:07.080> go<00:02:07.230> more<00:02:07.650> to<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.340> outside<00:02:09.560> than<00:02:10.560> to

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
needs to go more to the outside than to

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.810 
needs to go more to the outside than to
the<00:02:10.979> inside<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.090> other<00:02:12.210> words<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.690> needs<00:02:12.720> to

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
the inside so in other words it needs to

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.720 
the inside so in other words it needs to
go<00:02:14.820> down<00:02:14.850> pretty<00:02:15.720> much<00:02:16.220> pretty<00:02:17.220> close<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.640> the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
go down pretty much pretty close to the

going<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:48.350> beat<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:49.560> down<00:02:49.830> flat<00:02:56.030> all<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.209> way

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
going to beat this down flat all the way

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:05.890 
going to beat this down flat all the way
across

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.000 

and<00:03:06.900> we<00:03:07.020> got<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.170> little<00:03:07.440> left<00:03:07.560> over<00:03:07.710> we're

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
and we got a little left over we're

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.110 
and we got a little left over we're
going<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.190> have<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:10.700> probably<00:03:11.700> gonna<00:03:11.910> end<00:03:12.000> up

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
going to have to probably gonna end up

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.580 
going to have to probably gonna end up
having<00:03:12.240> to<00:03:12.360> cut<00:03:12.600> this<00:03:12.720> edge<00:03:12.960> off<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.350> don't<00:03:13.410> know

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
having to cut this edge off I don't know

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.810 
having to cut this edge off I don't know
we'll<00:03:13.770> put<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.010> door<00:03:14.190> on<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.580> then<00:03:14.670> we'll

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
we'll put the door on and then we'll

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.450 
we'll put the door on and then we'll
figure<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.240> out<00:03:15.300> from<00:03:15.660> there<00:03:16.220> okay<00:03:17.220> we've

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
figure that out from there okay we've

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.430 
figure that out from there okay we've
got<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.790> door<00:03:17.970> bottom<00:03:18.420> cut<00:03:18.690> we<00:03:18.990> got<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.260> door

got the door bottom cut we got the door
bottom<00:03:19.860> honed<00:03:20.480> got<00:03:21.480> our<00:03:21.630> threshold<00:03:22.140> in<00:03:22.380> now<00:03:22.800> we

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
bottom honed got our threshold in now we

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.720 
bottom honed got our threshold in now we
put<00:03:23.190> our<00:03:24.590> piece<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:25.860> uh<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:26.310> can<00:03:26.430> get<00:03:26.550> some

you have the door bottom run on the your
wooden<00:03:41.340> threshold<00:03:42.330> eventually<00:03:42.870> it's<00:03:42.990> just

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
wooden threshold eventually it's just

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:50.290 
wooden threshold eventually it's just
going<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.760> wear<00:03:44.760> off<00:03:44.970> your<00:03:48.650> stain<00:03:49.650> or<00:03:49.890> whatever

but in any case okay now we've got that

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:01.880 
but in any case okay now we've got that
up<00:03:57.050> okay<00:03:59.690> now<00:04:00.690> don't<00:04:00.840> worry<00:04:01.080> about<00:04:01.470> this<00:04:01.650> the

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
up okay now don't worry about this the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.650 
up okay now don't worry about this the
edge<00:04:02.070> over<00:04:02.370> here<00:04:02.490> let's<00:04:03.030> just<00:04:03.239> worry<00:04:03.450> just

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
edge over here let's just worry just

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.990 
edge over here let's just worry just
about<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.050> bottom<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:07.670> we're<00:04:08.670> gonna<00:04:08.850> run

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
about the bottom and we're gonna run

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.780 
about the bottom and we're gonna run
across<00:04:09.120> here<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:09.959> we<00:04:10.080> see<00:04:10.320> a<00:04:10.350> an<00:04:11.220> area<00:04:11.580> right

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
across here and we see a an area right

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.190 
across here and we see a an area right
there<00:04:12.030> but<00:04:12.239> see<00:04:12.390> that's<00:04:12.540> on<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.810> other<00:04:12.959> side

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
there but see that's on the other side

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.170 
there but see that's on the other side
so<00:04:13.440> that's<00:04:14.370> what<00:04:14.550> I<00:04:14.640> was<00:04:14.730> going<00:04:14.880> to<00:04:14.940> show<00:04:15.120> you

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
so that's what I was going to show you

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.670 
so that's what I was going to show you
because<00:04:15.390> you<00:04:15.660> can't<00:04:15.840> see<00:04:16.049> it<00:04:16.080> setting<00:04:16.470> up<00:04:16.530> on

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
because you can't see it setting up on

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.539 
because you can't see it setting up on
the<00:04:16.799> sawhorses

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
the sawhorses

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.830 
the sawhorses
that<00:04:18.060> you'll<00:04:18.239> have<00:04:18.390> to<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:19.680> metal<00:04:19.979> edge

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
that you'll have to the metal edge

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.010 
that you'll have to the metal edge
of<00:04:21.840> this<00:04:22.260> door<00:04:22.530> bottom<00:04:23.720> on<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.840> outside

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
of this door bottom on the outside

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.240 
of this door bottom on the outside
that's<00:04:28.020> why<00:04:28.169> you<00:04:28.229> wanted<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:28.710> close<00:04:28.919> to<00:04:29.130> the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
that's why you wanted it close to the

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.040 
that's why you wanted it close to the
outside<00:04:29.400> of<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.030> doors<00:04:30.240> you<00:04:30.600> get<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.930> it

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
outside of the doors you get to it

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.590 
outside of the doors you get to it
pretty<00:04:31.320> easy<00:04:31.470> because<00:04:31.740> if<00:04:31.890> it's<00:04:32.419> if<00:04:33.419> it's

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
pretty easy because if it's if it's

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.000 
pretty easy because if it's if it's
farther<00:04:33.840> in<00:04:34.110> you<00:04:34.260> can't<00:04:34.440> hardly<00:04:34.620> get<00:04:34.770> to<00:04:34.800> it

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
farther in you can't hardly get to it

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.980 
farther in you can't hardly get to it
with<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.160> carving<00:04:35.550> yet<00:04:35.729> all<00:04:36.570> right<00:04:36.630> but<00:04:36.840> now<00:04:36.960> I

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
with a carving yet all right but now I

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.270 
with a carving yet all right but now I
want<00:04:37.229> to<00:04:37.260> show<00:04:37.410> you<00:04:37.470> how<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.710> adjust<00:04:38.190> this<00:04:40.280> to

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
want to show you how to adjust this to

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.510 
want to show you how to adjust this to
this<00:04:41.490> let's<00:04:42.000> get<00:04:42.090> over<00:04:42.270> here<00:04:42.419> to<00:04:42.570> an<00:04:42.690> area<00:04:46.520> what

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
this let's get over here to an area what

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.830 
this let's get over here to an area what
you<00:04:47.669> do<00:04:47.850> now<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.150> you've<00:04:48.450> got<00:04:48.630> this

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
you do now that you've got this

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.450 
you do now that you've got this
