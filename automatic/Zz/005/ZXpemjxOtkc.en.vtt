00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.080
 Hello everyone, today I want you 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.789
 share one funny concept well and 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.829
 at the same time again on the topic 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:15.259
 command blocks this is a keypad 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:17.870
 completely silent 100 cable and 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.120
 the status of the button is determined by the unit and 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.500
 days more precisely the block under the buttons shows 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.360
 what state is our 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.730
 switch accordingly all the buttons 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.650
 whatever scheme is completely 100 cable on 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.539
 and let's try to figure out how 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.490
 This scheme works on the form she 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.130
 fairly simple here are 3 command 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.550
 block sizes well, if you do not take into account here 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.280
 of this 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.810
 three blocks in height 6 blocks in length and 1 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.230
 block wide then there is a circuit with so 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.150
 abundantly 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.130
 let's see when we click on 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.200
 this button works for us 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.329
 command block it contains a command 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.770
 fu block test this command checks 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.079
 the presence of a specific block in 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.170
 a certain place first place with us 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.070
 there are three coordinates x and y and z that here 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.320
 It should be noted 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.000
 if instead of the coordinates but it is worth and ice 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.860
 This means that it is used. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.510
 corresponding command coordinate 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.540
 unit in this case we will have 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.100
 x offset by -1 and on the toy and under 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.140
 this will be used coordinate 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.810
 command block that is also in height 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.820
 also in depth and minus one this here 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.729
 this unit in this place we check 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.100
 having an orange pole and 35 is wool and 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.659
 complement the conformation one is orange 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.580
 wool is here with us 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.680
 else-block orange tanaka wool 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.869
 rotary signal appears it is transmitted 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.090
 here on the block extinguishes the torch and 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.830
 accordingly this one works 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.150
 team this team we have 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.280
 installs a block 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.770
 plain white wool ie 35 is 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.570
 wool 0 is the white coordinates here 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.020
 several others again relatively 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.720
 that is, by their vanity minus 3 1 2 3 by 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.700
 igru it is plus 1 on 1 up and z 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.590
 still coordinate with us invariably 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.540
 that is, instead of our block, we are here 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.340
 put a block of white wool and 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.380
 accordingly, do we have a check not 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.299
 passed then the torch lights up and 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.710
 triggered top command block in 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.409
 which again is relative 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.720
 coordinates we are on -5 moving over there 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.640
 drop by 1 that is again 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.130
 select our block under the button and 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.660
 set there block orange wool 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.369
 Well, of course with a torch and we can 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.800
 take a signal that will show 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.550
 the state of our button here in general 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.530
 all when 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.990
 click on the button work out the conditions 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.880
 and the team blocks change the block under our 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.650
 button main feature in this scheme 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.240
 it is of course use 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.890
 relative coordinates by 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.230
 using relative coordinates we 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.240
 can very easily expand our scheme 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.730
 let's say we want to add more 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.890
 one button let's set it up 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.260
 command block and just copy from 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.570
 previous command block command here 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.310
 here it will also work because 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.140
 there is a countdown regarding this 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.080
 command block then everything will work 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.060
 already here with this block they are with the previous one 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.880
 Well, and so on, that is, a pair of couple 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.090
 bottom block command again copy our 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.180
 here we insert the block 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.580
 here the red torch yet another unit 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.400
 command block here also copy 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.470
 command from the previous one 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.680
 of course we need our way out that is 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.560
 block and repeater at the moment is necessary 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.660
 reset the scheme in install the button 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.190
 push the button off let's also 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.190
 put the lamp to see the state 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.959
 of our button like this we press the button 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.000
 included that is simple copying 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.040
 manually or with help 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.110
 funds you can expand this 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.360
 The design of course this scheme in the first 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.700
 queue will be useful to owners 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.680
 servers as usual to creators but not 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.000
 less for her example i hope you could 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.280
 deal with how it works 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.330
 regarding positioning coordinates 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.550
 by command block 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.290
 Well, on this for today, I hope that 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.560
 scheme you liked do not forget 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.790
