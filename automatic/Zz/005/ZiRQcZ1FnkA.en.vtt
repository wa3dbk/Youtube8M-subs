as you can see that the water droplets
actually<00:04:21.630> will<00:04:21.900> activate<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:23.150> capacitance

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
actually will activate the capacitance

into the water I can take underwater
photos<00:04:51.020> perfectly<00:04:52.020> so<00:04:52.920> let<00:04:53.370> me<00:04:53.400> try<00:04:53.790> that

photos perfectly so let me try that
where<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.390> water<00:04:54.690> is<00:04:56.390> deep<00:04:57.390> enough<00:04:57.540> okay<00:04:58.440> so

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
where the water is deep enough okay so

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.090 
where the water is deep enough okay so
right<00:04:59.490> now<00:04:59.520> I<00:04:59.910> put<00:05:00.480> my<00:05:00.630> phone<00:05:00.930> in<00:05:01.110> here<00:05:01.470> okay
