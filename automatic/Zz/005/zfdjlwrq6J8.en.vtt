boom a series I'm sorry in the did the
UM<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.920> series<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.900> 1000<00:00:19.619> grit

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
UM a series and this is the 1000 grit

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.939 
UM a series and this is the 1000 grit
stone<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.490> I'm<00:00:21.420> introducing<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.260> third<00:00:22.710> of

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
stone and I'm introducing the third of

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.599 
stone and I'm introducing the third of
these<00:00:23.720> almost<00:00:24.720> identical<00:00:25.380> stones<00:00:25.650> except<00:00:26.580> for

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
these almost identical stones except for

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.060 
these almost identical stones except for
the<00:00:26.849> hardness<00:00:27.359> difference<00:00:28.199> between<00:00:28.590> them<00:00:28.859> I

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the hardness difference between them I

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.150 
the hardness difference between them I
had<00:00:29.910> just<00:00:29.939> finished<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.410> previous<00:00:31.769> video

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
had just finished in a previous video

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.870 
had just finished in a previous video
and<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.600> hard<00:00:34.320> stone<00:00:34.770> as<00:00:35.370> opposed<00:00:35.760> to

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
and this is the hard stone as opposed to

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.750 
and this is the hard stone as opposed to
the<00:00:35.969> regular<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:37.399> wanted<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.489> make<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the regular one and wanted to make the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.090 
the regular one and wanted to make the
additional<00:00:39.149> comment<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.079> porosity<00:00:40.739> of

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
additional comment that the porosity of

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.450 
additional comment that the porosity of
the<00:00:41.250> stone<00:00:41.670> after<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.719> very<00:00:42.989> brief<00:00:43.250> amount<00:00:44.250> of

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the stone after a very brief amount of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.229 
the stone after a very brief amount of
soaking<00:00:45.559> seems<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.860> absorb<00:00:47.100> water<00:00:47.640> even

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
soaking seems to absorb water even

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.709 
soaking seems to absorb water even
slower<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.250> this<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.460> finer<00:00:50.820> grit<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.449> I

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
slower and this is a finer grit and I

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.139 
slower and this is a finer grit and I
had<00:00:51.960> finished<00:00:52.260> doing<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.370> addition<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.969> this

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
had finished doing in addition to this

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.139 
had finished doing in addition to this
mo<00:00:54.449> kimono<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.800> front<00:00:56.309> bevel<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> macomb

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
mo kimono the front bevel of the macomb

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.020 
mo kimono the front bevel of the macomb
oh<00:00:57.270> no<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.600> had<00:00:57.750> done<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.050> front<00:00:58.489> devil<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.760> this

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
oh no I had done the front devil of this

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.110 
oh no I had done the front devil of this
Japanese<00:01:00.840> chisel<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.859> I'm<00:01:02.250> going<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.579> go<00:01:02.850> on

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
Japanese chisel so I'm going to go on

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.060 
Japanese chisel so I'm going to go on
from<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.260> stone<00:01:04.970> to<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.409> extra<00:01:07.409> hard<00:01:07.590> stone

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
from this stone to the extra hard stone

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.880 
from this stone to the extra hard stone
and<00:01:08.430> we're<00:01:08.820> going<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.570> back<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
and we're going to do the back of the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.300 
and we're going to do the back of the
chisel<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.270> again<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.229> extra<00:01:14.040> hard

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
chisel so again this is the extra hard

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.990 
chisel so again this is the extra hard
stone<00:01:15.439> and<00:01:16.439> we're<00:01:17.159> going<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.369> give<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.729> try

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
stone and we're going to give this a try

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.940 
stone and we're going to give this a try
now<00:01:18.330> let's<00:01:18.689> see<00:01:18.930> how<00:01:19.110> how<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.310> works<00:01:20.580> out<00:01:21.950> it

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
now let's see how how this works out it

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.950 
now let's see how how this works out it
was<00:01:23.070> quite<00:01:23.310> pleased<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:25.380> hard<00:01:25.740> one

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
was quite pleased with the the hard one

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.960 
was quite pleased with the the hard one
again<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.979> bit<00:01:29.159> more<00:01:29.340> shaft<00:01:29.700> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
again it's it's a bit more shaft and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.460 
again it's it's a bit more shaft and
like<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.600> more<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:32.659> less<00:01:33.659> porous<00:01:34.049> stone

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
like and more of a less porous stone

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.640 
like and more of a less porous stone
extremely<00:01:35.460> fine<00:01:35.759> abrasive<00:01:36.650> particulate

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
extremely fine abrasive particulate

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.819 
extremely fine abrasive particulate
nearly<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> hundred<00:01:38.369> percent<00:01:38.670> swarf<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.140> let's

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
nearly a hundred percent swarf so let's

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.560 
nearly a hundred percent swarf so let's
see<00:01:41.009> how<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.189> do<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:44.180> again<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.360> is

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
see how we do with this again this is

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.200 
see how we do with this again this is
the<00:01:45.720> extra<00:01:46.229> hard<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:48.950> okay<00:01:49.950> let's<00:01:50.880> give<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.119> a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the extra hard one okay let's give it a

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.279 
the extra hard one okay let's give it a
little<00:01:51.360> more<00:01:52.280> water<00:01:53.280> exposure

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.910 

here's<00:01:58.289> maybe<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.429> seems<00:01:59.700> to<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.920> even

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
here's maybe that this seems to be even

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:14.000 
here's maybe that this seems to be even
less<00:02:02.100> porous<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:12.989> particular<00:02:13.470> version

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
less porous so this particular version

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.780 
less porous so this particular version
the<00:02:14.519> extra<00:02:15.090> hard<00:02:15.360> version<00:02:16.220> will<00:02:17.220> appeal<00:02:17.580> to

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
the extra hard version will appeal to

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.289 
the extra hard version will appeal to
two<00:02:18.000> groups<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.629> people<00:02:19.310> people<00:02:20.310> who<00:02:20.700> prefer

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
two groups of people people who prefer

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.509 
two groups of people people who prefer
very<00:02:21.599> hard<00:02:21.870> stones<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.910> people<00:02:23.910> who<00:02:25.519> have

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
very hard stones and people who have

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.289 
very hard stones and people who have
particular<00:02:26.940> needs<00:02:27.500> such<00:02:28.500> as<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:29.610> backs<00:02:30.060> of

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
particular needs such as the backs of

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.990 
particular needs such as the backs of
chisels<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.560> Japanese<00:02:32.099> chisels<00:02:32.579> that<00:02:32.760> are<00:02:32.849> all

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
chisels of Japanese chisels that are all

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.650 
chisels of Japanese chisels that are all
very<00:02:33.269> hard<00:02:33.630> steel<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.819> need<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.360> lot<00:02:36.630> of

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
very hard steel and need a lot of

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.130 
very hard steel and need a lot of
precision<00:02:37.440> without<00:02:38.269> even<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.390> slightest<00:02:39.959> bit

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
of stone deformity as the stone gets

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.440 
of stone deformity as the stone gets

have the capacity to be very specific
and<00:02:58.440> address<00:02:59.250> very<00:02:59.549> specific<00:03:00.269> needs<00:03:00.540> of

and address very specific needs of

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.699 
and address very specific needs of
sharpeners<00:03:01.940> we<00:03:03.109> expect<00:03:04.109> to<00:03:04.170> have<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.440> very

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
sharpeners we expect to have a very

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.690 
sharpeners we expect to have a very
sophisticated<00:03:04.950> group<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:06.000> sharpeners<00:03:06.569> the

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
sophisticated group of sharpeners the

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.420 
sophisticated group of sharpeners the
softer<00:03:08.700> stone<00:03:08.970> of<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:09.510> bunch<00:03:10.250> or<00:03:11.250> the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
softer stone of the bunch or the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.220 
softer stone of the bunch or the
standard<00:03:12.000> stone<00:03:12.359> I<00:03:12.569> guess<00:03:12.720> would<00:03:12.930> be<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.049> more

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
standard stone I guess would be a more

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.770 
standard stone I guess would be a more
accurate<00:03:13.410> way<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.769> put<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.100> we<00:03:14.970> feel<00:03:15.269> as<00:03:15.480> an

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
accurate way to put it we feel as an

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.890 
accurate way to put it we feel as an
ideal<00:03:16.880> formulation<00:03:17.880> for<00:03:17.910> use<00:03:18.389> for<00:03:18.739> knives<00:03:19.819> so

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
ideal formulation for use for knives so

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.039 
ideal formulation for use for knives so
let's<00:03:21.900> check<00:03:22.319> this<00:03:22.470> out<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.709> little<00:03:22.799> bit<00:03:23.100> and

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
let's check this out a little bit and

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.789 
let's check this out a little bit and
see<00:03:25.049> where<00:03:25.260> we<00:03:25.380> are<00:03:25.560> here<00:03:26.450> ok<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:28.319> we're<00:03:28.769> going

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
see where we are here ok so we're going

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.920 
see where we are here ok so we're going
to<00:03:29.099> begin<00:03:29.329> sharpening<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.420> back<00:03:30.599> of<00:03:30.810> this

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
to begin sharpening the back of this

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.990 
to begin sharpening the back of this
chisel<00:03:31.470> and

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.280 

get<00:03:37.720> some<00:03:37.900> impressions

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:56.559 

okay<00:03:48.110> go<00:03:49.110> from<00:03:49.350> this<00:03:49.470> side<00:03:49.740> a<00:03:49.770> little<00:03:49.950> bitch

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:03.080 

alright<00:03:57.569> very<00:03:58.319> hard<00:04:01.280> bordering<00:04:02.280> on<00:04:02.400> scratchy

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
alright very hard bordering on scratchy

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:13.910 
alright very hard bordering on scratchy
but<00:04:03.629> not<00:04:03.840> quite<00:04:07.069> we<00:04:08.069> can<00:04:08.280> see<00:04:08.519> that<00:04:12.920> very

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
but not quite we can see that very

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.569 
but not quite we can see that very
interestingly<00:04:14.220> very<00:04:15.060> little<00:04:16.340> swarf<00:04:17.340> is

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
interestingly very little swarf is

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:27.320 
interestingly very little swarf is
generated<00:04:18.299> very<00:04:18.870> fine<00:04:24.650> it's<00:04:25.650> hitting<00:04:26.330> higher

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
generated very fine it's hitting higher

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.330 
generated very fine it's hitting higher
spots<00:04:27.919> of<00:04:28.919> the<00:04:29.250> stone<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:30.780> water<00:04:31.080> is<00:04:31.950> staying

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
spots of the stone the water is staying

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:55.370 
spots of the stone the water is staying
on<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:32.850> stone

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:03.810 

thank<00:04:55.530> you

you're still getting feedback from the

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:13.200 
you're still getting feedback from the
stone<00:05:08.250> but<00:05:09.250> it's<00:05:09.430> a<00:05:09.580> much<00:05:09.880> more<00:05:10.920> precise<00:05:12.210> less

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210
