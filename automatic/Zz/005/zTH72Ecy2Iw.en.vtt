00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
the long run and I would say probably

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.570 
the long run and I would say probably
has<00:06:00.000> a<00:06:00.030> very<00:06:00.720> very<00:06:00.960> very<00:06:01.290> high<00:06:02.010> chance<00:06:02.370> of

doing the steam machine they're doing
the<00:06:28.740> VR<00:06:29.040> stuff<00:06:29.370> it's<00:06:30.150> focused<00:06:30.930> on<00:06:30.990> making<00:06:31.320> the

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
the VR stuff it's focused on making the

the VR stuff it's focused on making the
games<00:06:31.680> and<00:06:31.980> then<00:06:32.160> develop<00:06:32.520> the<00:06:32.640> tech<00:06:32.820> around

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
games and then develop the tech around

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.200 
games and then develop the tech around
those<00:06:33.330> games<00:06:33.570> don't<00:06:34.610> divide<00:06:35.610> into<00:06:35.880> three

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
those games don't divide into three

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.820 
those games don't divide into three
separate<00:06:36.480> categories<00:06:36.630> while<00:06:37.380> it's<00:06:37.530> still<00:06:37.680> not

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
separate categories while it's still not

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.130 
separate categories while it's still not
producing<00:06:38.460> titles<00:06:38.940> it<00:06:39.510> just<00:06:39.780> doesn't<00:06:40.050> work

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.140 
producing titles it just doesn't work

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.470 
producing titles it just doesn't work
this

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.480 
this

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.860 
this
way<00:06:40.650> as<00:06:41.650> much<00:06:41.980> as<00:06:42.160> I<00:06:42.460> think<00:06:42.670> that<00:06:42.970> they<00:06:43.210> want<00:06:43.630> to

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
way as much as I think that they want to

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.680 
way as much as I think that they want to
make<00:06:44.020> this<00:06:44.170> a<00:06:44.230> good<00:06:44.410> idea<00:06:44.740> even<00:06:45.670> Steam<00:06:46.180> fanboys

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
make this a good idea even Steam fanboys

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.450 
make this a good idea even Steam fanboys
probably<00:06:47.080> aren't<00:06:47.260> gonna<00:06:47.350> fork<00:06:47.650> down<00:06:47.800> the<00:06:47.950> 500

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
probably aren't gonna fork down the 500

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.070 
probably aren't gonna fork down the 500
bucks<00:06:48.610> because<00:06:48.790> frankly<00:06:49.330> what<00:06:49.840> would<00:06:49.960> you

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
bucks because frankly what would you

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.190 
bucks because frankly what would you
rather<00:06:50.230> have<00:06:50.470> seriously<00:06:51.340> a<00:06:51.730> console<00:06:52.720> that<00:06:52.930> you

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.200 
rather have seriously a console that you

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.170 
rather have seriously a console that you
know<00:06:53.680> will<00:06:53.860> last<00:06:54.100> you<00:06:54.250> for<00:06:54.430> eight<00:06:54.550> years<00:06:54.580> or

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
know will last you for eight years or

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.360 
know will last you for eight years or
one<00:06:55.570> that<00:06:55.810> will<00:06:55.990> last<00:06:56.140> you<00:06:56.380> for<00:06:56.410> maybe<00:06:56.680> two<00:06:57.040> and

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.370 
one that will last you for maybe two and

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.800 
one that will last you for maybe two and
then<00:06:57.430> you'll<00:06:58.240> be<00:06:58.390> just<00:06:58.780> kind<00:06:59.080> of<00:06:59.230> Sol<00:06:59.770> and<00:07:00.810> yeah

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810 
then you'll be just kind of Sol and yeah

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.690 
then you'll be just kind of Sol and yeah
also<00:07:02.230> what<00:07:02.470> if<00:07:02.560> components<00:07:03.070> fail<00:07:03.190> you<00:07:03.580> know

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.700 
also what if components fail you know

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.980 
also what if components fail you know
what's<00:07:03.910> the<00:07:04.000> return<00:07:04.270> rate<00:07:04.450> on<00:07:04.600> those<00:07:04.720> things

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990 
what's the return rate on those things

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.950 
what's the return rate on those things
and<00:07:05.200> the<00:07:05.830> fact<00:07:05.950> that<00:07:06.100> $500<00:07:07.090> is<00:07:07.300> the<00:07:07.510> minimal

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
and the fact that $500 is the minimal

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.530 
and the fact that $500 is the minimal
