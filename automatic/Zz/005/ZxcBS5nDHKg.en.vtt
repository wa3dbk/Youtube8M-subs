marchers<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.039> i'll<00:01:02.309> try<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.550> get<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.850> done

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
marchers and i'll try to get that done

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.479 
marchers and i'll try to get that done
and<00:01:03.390> i<00:01:04.199> don't<00:01:04.710> know<00:01:04.769> if<00:01:04.979> i'm<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> upgrade

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and i don't know if i'm going to upgrade

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.980 
and i don't know if i'm going to upgrade
the<00:01:05.790> bombs<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.330> stuff<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.780> just

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the bombs and stuff like that just

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.260 
the bombs and stuff like that just
because<00:01:07.350> it'll<00:01:07.590> take<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:07.950> long<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.460> might<00:01:09.150> get

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
because it'll take so long I might get

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.730 
because it'll take so long I might get
them<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.659> level<00:01:09.869> 2<00:01:10.020> or<00:01:10.170> something<00:01:10.590> but

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
them to like level 2 or something but

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.960 
them to like level 2 or something but
that's<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.189> whole<00:01:11.310> bunch<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.549> extra<00:01:11.820> time

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
that's just a whole bunch of extra time

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.060 
that's just a whole bunch of extra time
I<00:01:12.030> don't<00:01:12.360> want<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.570> spend<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.049> think<00:01:13.560> all<00:01:13.770> i<00:01:13.799> have

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070
