00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
controller and all that but I plan on

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.979 
controller and all that but I plan on
putting<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.789> VXL<00:00:45.420> system<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.960> there<00:00:47.870> just<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
putting a VXL system in there just to

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.010 
putting a VXL system in there just to
make<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.140> brushless<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.969> there's<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.690> look<00:00:51.870> at

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
make it brushless so there's a look at

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.560 
make it brushless so there's a look at
the<00:00:52.199> box<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.949> different<00:00:53.910> languages<00:00:54.210> so

have a traxxas link with the doc and I

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.750 
have a traxxas link with the doc and I
mean<00:02:39.020> hope<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.350> works<00:02:39.830> with<00:02:39.980> this<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.489> should

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760

nope can't forget the antenna and here's
the<00:03:02.450> boat<00:03:02.630> so<00:03:03.340> it's<00:03:04.340> actually<00:03:04.460> pretty<00:03:04.880> heavier

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
the boat so it's actually pretty heavier

two-thirds the size of a Spartan I know
people<00:03:10.520> of<00:03:10.610> people<00:03:10.790> say<00:03:10.970> why<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.180> just<00:03:11.420> get

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
people of people say why you just get

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.240 
people of people say why you just get
started<00:03:11.900> in<00:03:11.990> the<00:03:12.050> first<00:03:12.200> place<00:03:12.380> well<00:03:12.830> this<00:03:13.070> one

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
started in the first place well this one

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.300 
started in the first place well this one
is<00:03:13.490> a<00:03:13.520> lot<00:03:13.850> cheaper<00:03:13.880> than<00:03:14.240> a<00:03:14.360> Spartan<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.310> a

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
is a lot cheaper than a Spartan and a

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:25.210 
is a lot cheaper than a Spartan and a
lot<00:03:16.670> easier<00:03:16.910> to<00:03:17.090> upgrade<00:03:17.330> so<00:03:19.390> see<00:03:20.390> here<00:03:24.220> this

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
lot easier to upgrade so see here this

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.300 
lot easier to upgrade so see here this
is<00:03:25.280> held<00:03:25.730> down<00:03:25.850> by<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:27.620> rubber<00:03:28.370> band<00:03:28.700> here<00:03:29.090> saw

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
is held down by a rubber band here saw

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.830 
is held down by a rubber band here saw
something<00:03:31.310> I've<00:03:31.760> never<00:03:31.940> seen<00:03:32.060> before<00:03:32.210> so

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
something I've never seen before so

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.260 
something I've never seen before so
let's<00:03:32.990> just<00:03:33.520> slide<00:03:34.520> it<00:03:34.640> off<00:03:34.730> this<00:03:34.940> way<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:37.310> you

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
let's just slide it off this way and you

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.320 
let's just slide it off this way and you
can<00:03:38.420> see<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:40.250> insides<00:03:40.640> here<00:03:40.940> let<00:03:41.120> me<00:03:41.180> get<00:03:41.270> a

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
can see the insides here let me get a

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.420 
can see the insides here let me get a
better<00:03:41.510> shot<00:03:41.860> there's<00:03:42.860> a<00:03:42.950> better<00:03:43.040> look<00:03:43.220> at<00:03:43.370> the

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
better shot there's a better look at the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.050 
better shot there's a better look at the
electronics<00:03:43.970> you<00:03:44.120> got<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:45.220> ESC<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.580> servo

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
electronics you got the ESC the servo

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.080 
electronics you got the ESC the servo
radio<00:03:47.780> box<00:03:48.080> motor<00:03:48.830> everything's<00:03:49.490> laid<00:03:49.940> out

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
radio box motor everything's laid out

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.350 
radio box motor everything's laid out
all<00:03:50.300> nice<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:51.340> tidy<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.760> battery<00:03:53.090> sets

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
all nice and tidy and the battery sets

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.230 
all nice and tidy and the battery sets
up<00:03:53.540> this<00:03:53.900> way<00:03:54.170> so<00:03:54.670> everything<00:03:55.670> feels<00:03:55.940> really

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
up this way so everything feels really

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.840 
up this way so everything feels really
weighted<00:03:56.750> properly<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.530> hopefully<00:03:58.340> swapping

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
weighted properly and hopefully swapping

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.570 
weighted properly and hopefully swapping
this<00:03:59.000> out<00:03:59.180> with<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.540> brushless<00:03:59.780> will<00:04:00.170> be

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
this out with the brushless will be

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.650 
this out with the brushless will be
simple<00:04:01.580> and<00:04:01.820> still<00:04:02.420> maintain<00:04:02.600> its<00:04:02.989> bones<00:04:03.200> so

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
simple and still maintain its bones so

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.900 
simple and still maintain its bones so
that's<00:04:05.660> a<00:04:05.810> quick<00:04:05.959> look<00:04:06.230> at<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.769> traxxas<00:04:07.989> blast

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
that's a quick look at the traxxas blast

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.280 
that's a quick look at the traxxas blast
and<00:04:12.940> I'm<00:04:13.940> hoping<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.360> build<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.750> trailer<00:04:15.110> out<00:04:15.260> of

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
and I'm hoping to build a trailer out of

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.440 
and I'm hoping to build a trailer out of
this<00:04:15.470> other<00:04:15.650> for<00:04:15.980> styrene<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.700> you<00:04:17.299> know<00:04:17.390> you

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
this other for styrene and you know you

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.690 
this other for styrene and you know you
always<00:04:17.660> see<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:17.870> lot<00:04:18.049> of<00:04:18.080> full-size<00:04:18.620> there<00:04:19.489> are

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
always see a lot of full-size there are

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.550 
always see a lot of full-size there are
10<00:04:19.850> scale<00:04:20.150> tracks<00:04:20.480> of<00:04:20.660> stuff<00:04:20.840> hauling<00:04:21.320> the

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
10 scale tracks of stuff hauling the

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.710 
10 scale tracks of stuff hauling the
spartans<00:04:21.980> around<00:04:22.250> so<00:04:22.850> intent<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:23.480> make<00:04:23.690> a

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
spartans around so intent to make a

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.120 
spartans around so intent to make a
trailer<00:04:24.230> so<00:04:24.440> that<00:04:24.590> my<00:04:24.820> smaller<00:04:25.820> summit<00:04:26.360> will

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
trailer so that my smaller summit will

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.930 
trailer so that my smaller summit will
be<00:04:28.130> able<00:04:28.220> to<00:04:29.320> pull<00:04:30.320> this<00:04:30.350> one<00:04:30.590> around<00:04:30.860> so<00:04:31.400> again

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
be able to pull this one around so again
