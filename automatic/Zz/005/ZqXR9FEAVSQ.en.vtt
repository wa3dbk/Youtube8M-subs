we have a camera on top which is HD of
course<00:00:17.550> enters<00:00:18.240> also<00:00:18.990> here<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> little<00:00:19.470> sensor

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
course enters also here a little sensor

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.679 
course enters also here a little sensor
that<00:00:20.039> knows<00:00:20.279> when<00:00:20.820> i<00:00:20.850> have<00:00:21.150> my<00:00:21.300> finger<00:00:21.600> over

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689

that knows when i have my finger over
this<00:00:22.140> place<00:00:22.350> should<00:00:22.500> turn<00:00:22.980> off<00:00:23.189> after<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> few

this place should turn off after a few
seconds<00:00:24.060> i<00:00:24.180> guess<00:00:24.390> because<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.900> thinks<00:00:25.320> it's

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
seconds i guess because it thinks it's

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.050

here to the home screen but let's check
out<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.630> hardware<00:00:34.020> first<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.219> have<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
out the hardware first so we have on the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.020 
out the hardware first so we have on the
left<00:00:36.239> side<00:00:36.450> here<00:00:37.110> only<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.040> volume<00:00:38.430> rocker<00:00:38.700> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
headphone port and there is I think a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.459

there's two more speakers or maybe even
a<00:00:45.329> microphone<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.020> here<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.190> down<00:00:47.340> an<00:00:47.520> off

here the back the kickstand we will see

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.179 
here the back the kickstand we will see
that<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.930> have<00:01:03.960> actually<00:01:04.530> behind<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
that we have actually behind the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.109 
that we have actually behind the
kickstand<00:01:06.080> microSD<00:01:07.080> slot<00:01:07.580> so<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:09.000> use

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
kickstand microSD slot so you can use

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.899 
kickstand microSD slot so you can use
micro<00:01:09.420> sd's<00:01:09.659> up<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.990> 32<00:01:10.439> gigs<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.950> don't<00:01:11.700> know<00:01:11.790> if

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
micro sd's up to 32 gigs I don't know if

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.940 
micro sd's up to 32 gigs I don't know if
you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.510> clearly<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.350> there<00:01:13.650> should

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
you can see it clearly but there should

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.539 
you can see it clearly but there should
be<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.100> microSD<00:01:15.530> can<00:01:16.530> sting<00:01:16.770> not<00:01:17.250> for<00:01:17.490> an

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
be a microSD can sting not for an

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.359 
be a microSD can sting not for an
enduring<00:01:17.909> vision<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.479> I'm<00:01:18.570> yet<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.810> hear<00:01:19.170> an

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
enduring vision and I'm yet to hear an

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.560 
enduring vision and I'm yet to hear an
alternative

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
alternative

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.380 
alternative
so<00:01:22.140> there's<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.010> microSD<00:01:23.280> slot<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.760> is<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.000> 32

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
so there's a microSD slot and is this 32

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.360 
so there's a microSD slot and is this 32

for example we have a nice track that
here<00:02:15.360> in<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.450> bottom<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.870> can<00:02:16.050> even<00:02:16.170> use

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
here in the bottom so you can even use

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.840 
here in the bottom so you can even use
the<00:02:16.590> old<00:02:16.709> mouse<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.280> don't<00:02:17.459> want<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.700> touch

the old mouse if you don't want to touch
the<00:02:18.330> screen<00:02:18.570> while<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.930> use<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.230> in<00:02:19.320> office

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
the screen while you use it in office

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.890 
the screen while you use it in office
mode<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.160> also<00:02:20.489> here<00:02:21.090> left<00:02:21.720> and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
so you can see you can use it like a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.160 
so you can see you can use it like a
netbook<00:02:26.220> but<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.790> cover<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.180> quite<00:02:27.510> slim<00:02:27.959> and

light it's only a few millimeters thick

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.060 
light it's only a few millimeters thick
and<00:02:30.269> it<00:02:30.390> doesn't<00:02:30.660> need<00:02:30.750> too<00:02:31.260> much<00:02:31.380> extra<00:02:31.739> power

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
and it doesn't need too much extra power

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.949 
and it doesn't need too much extra power
either<00:02:32.340> which<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.330> course<00:02:33.360> quite<00:02:33.690> nice<00:02:33.840> you

screens on both and let's check out how
fast<00:05:11.000> they<00:05:11.720> rotate<00:05:12.229> then<00:05:12.410> you<00:05:12.500> can<00:05:12.680> see<00:05:12.860> here

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
fast they rotate then you can see here

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.730 
fast they rotate then you can see here
that<00:05:13.280> actually<00:05:13.699> the<00:05:13.970> windows<00:05:14.600> RT<00:05:14.960> tablet<00:05:15.350> with

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
10 hours of battery life is also quite

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.520 
10 hours of battery life is also quite
fast<00:05:19.010> and<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.850> specs<00:05:20.090> are<00:05:20.300> also<00:05:20.750> about<00:05:21.350> the

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
fast and the specs are also about the

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.960 
fast and the specs are also about the
same<00:05:21.740> and<00:05:21.979> if<00:05:22.040> you<00:05:22.130> put<00:05:22.340> them<00:05:22.520> on<00:05:22.639> each<00:05:22.790> other

you can see that in terms of thickness
they<00:05:25.550> are<00:05:25.610> actually<00:05:25.970> about<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.330> same<00:05:26.360> also

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
they are actually about the same also
