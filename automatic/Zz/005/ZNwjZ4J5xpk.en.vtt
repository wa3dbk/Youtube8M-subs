turn it on it the sound will come from
this<00:00:51.540> side<00:00:51.799> in<00:00:52.799> correction<00:00:57.890> yes<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.159> can

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
this side in correction yes so it can

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.880 
this side in correction yes so it can
lead<00:00:59.580> to<00:00:59.760> clear<00:01:00.000> longer<00:01:00.449> time<00:01:00.750> then<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.710> other

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
lead to clear longer time then the other

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.490 
lead to clear longer time then the other
two<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.909> put<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.299> curly<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.900> top<00:01:04.170> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
two we put this curly at the top and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.649 
two we put this curly at the top and
Thomas<00:01:05.100> all<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.460> way<00:01:05.549> down<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.240> they<00:01:06.390> see<00:01:06.570> how

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
Thomas all the way down so they see how

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.060 
Thomas all the way down so they see how
it<00:01:06.810> happens

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.590 

so<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.159> just<00:01:14.340> notice<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.729> whoever<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.390> on

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
so you just notice that whoever is on

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.469 
so you just notice that whoever is on
third<00:01:15.900> place<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.590> straight<00:01:17.430> one<00:01:17.700> gets

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
third place that straight one gets

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.470 
third place that straight one gets
toward<00:01:18.869> than<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> other<00:01:19.530> two<00:01:20.000> but<00:01:21.000> that's<00:01:21.150> not

toward than the other two but that's not

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.360 
toward than the other two but that's not
the<00:01:21.630> problem<00:01:21.840> with<00:01:22.290> engines<00:01:22.770> that's<00:01:23.190> the

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
the problem with engines that's the

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.520 
the problem with engines that's the
problem<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.120> track<00:01:24.480> let's<00:01:25.260> go<00:01:25.470> ahead
