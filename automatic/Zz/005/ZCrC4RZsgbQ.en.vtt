really<00:02:11.670> nicely<00:02:12.080> makes<00:02:13.080> those<00:02:13.260> essential<00:02:13.739> to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
really nicely makes those essential to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.830 
really nicely makes those essential to
me<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.580> what<00:02:14.730> we're<00:02:14.849> doing<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:15.239> pumping<00:02:15.630> lots

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.800 
me so what we're doing is pumping lots
of<00:02:15.989> flavor<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:17.580> bring<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.599> boil

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
then cook it just for about four or five

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.770 
then cook it just for about four or five
minutes<00:02:20.819> because<00:02:20.910> these<00:02:21.060> are<00:02:21.180> only<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.660> know
