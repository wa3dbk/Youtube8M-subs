00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:06.520
 Aan N'n'a 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:17.560
 Asphalt used on roads and parking lots 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:23.970
 Are you having trouble with a hole or crack that you made suddenly ? 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.970
 This lung bottom navigation introduces the repair method of asphalt 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:34.120
 Asphalt pavement is a mixture of asphalt and aggregate such as stone and gravel 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.770
 It is the pavement to perform in 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:43.800
 More flexible than concrete but less rigid 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:49.050
 There is a weak point that it is easy to open a hole in the place where it was constructed 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:55.390
 We perform simple repair of asphalt pavement this time 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:58.870
 There are several types of asphalt repair agents depending on the construction method 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:03.030
 This time, it reacts to water and hardens 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:10.620
 We use prefabricated armor type repair material 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:14.830
 This type has the advantage that construction is possible even in rainy weather or where water is accumulating 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:20.470
 Let's actually work 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:23.090
 What to prepare is asphalt repair material to solidify with abandoned water 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:31.780
 It is scoop water 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:31.780
 Sweeping in the repair singing broom with a hole had opened Remove any debris, such as fallen leaves and sand 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:44.380
 Open the asphalt repair material and put a little more so as not to overflow from the repair location 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:48.780
 Asphalt repair materials can not be stored for a very long time 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:53.450
 Let's use it in as short a time as possible 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:58.890
 Break-in technology in the scoop while crushing the ball 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:02.159
 The finish will be beautiful if you try to squeeze a little 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:10.390
 Sprinkling water using a can 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:16.560
 The standard for freshwater volume is about 1 liter of water for about 20 kilograms per bag 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:20.160
 After watering the next will do the work to solidify stepping say a transformer 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.470
 Because the repair agent hardens in response to water 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.680
 I will carry out compaction immediately after pouring water 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:33.210
 At first we set foot 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:38.990
 Next, let's eat with scoops and tools for voltage 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:46.140
 Compacting tool is best to use in construction, such as bricks 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:54.250
 Make the end part stronger because it is easy to make a gap 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:58.710
 There is also a method of rolling over the board by laying a board such as plywood and rolling. 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:06.340
 It is possible to pass vehicles immediately after enforcement 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:14.310
 We can open repair point in a short time even in places where cars such as parking lot go in and out 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:14.310
 If the stickiness of compaction after the repair material surface is a concern is a good idea and winding inspection 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:27.760
 It is the construction method when there is water in the repair place by rainy weather etc. 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:33.970
 Asphalt repair material is put in water as well as work in the case of drying 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:40.349
 Multiply the fewer of water the amount of time originally there was water in consideration 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.349
 The rest is completed if you set the sea with foot and scoop as well 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.720
 How was it 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.200
 Recruitment of surprisingly simple asphalt 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.200
 Please use all means when you troubled at the failure of the pavement 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.580
