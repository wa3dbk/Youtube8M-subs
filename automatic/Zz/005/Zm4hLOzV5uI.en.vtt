00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.570
 the most common questions that you do 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.000
 absolutely under the videos you know that 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.039
 I try to do it every Monday 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.560
 now in the old year the new year 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.259
 I was a bit shattered with rhythms 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.050
 of the videos however I try to do it every 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.789
 Monday before starting I tell you that 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.339

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.340
 therefore already registered in a few days 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:35.010
 that is, in a few days you will see it at the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.350
 I forgot about my hairstyle 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.330
 you will see that twisted braid 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.870
 you will see that video the week 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.140

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.270
 in this video he answers a question 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.640
 I couldn't find the comments 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.560
 who have not asked, however, who maybe 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.350
 read comments that I've been following for the longest time 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.140
 knows that one of the questions that comes to me 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.870
 most frequently asked is how you do ad 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.230
 have teeth so white but the question 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.540
 which I would say for years without exaggerating that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.990
 I am asked so much about 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.079
 frequent and I do n't have an answer 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.869
 magical I have no advice I was 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:15.090
 take this and you will see that I do n't say 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.850
 this because I am very lucky I am 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.609
 was really so lucky with with 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.880
 teeth is one of my fortunes though 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:27.240
 also of the ears level of physical bar 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.729
 of health, however, other teeth and eyes 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.120
 things obviously were really a 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.760
 big ass why 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.940
 I've never had a cavity but in life 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.860
 never have I ever ever brought my own 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.430
 the appliance I never had 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.460
 interventions that know what type I am removed 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.670
 a wisdom tooth years ago though 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.090
 I don't have a kind of problem I never have 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.180
 done whitening indeed I smoke too 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.910
 so I believe that if you really are an ass 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.900
 that of having decent teeth and 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.930
 whites because I really don't 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.430
 who knows what I am so naturally there 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.490
 they are converted to a toothbrush 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.610
 electric is this here is one of the oral 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.250
 b si professional which is a toothbrush 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.830
 electric in short, like the round head 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.110
 I use these here because it seems to me that 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.350
 clean your teeth better if you can 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.780
 pass each tooth one by one into 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.630
 I bought this role and it isn't either 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.690
 of the expensive ones I found or 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.530
 the supermarket in places like give you me 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.600
 these places here then I try to force myself 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.080
 be a dentist told me I have to 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.630
 do it every day in the evening often not 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.110
 I do mea culpa but I bought it 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.630
 these courses of the university of the range that 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.820
 replace dental floss 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.840
 but practically they are flossing 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:00.709
 made in a different way and are made like this 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:03.290
 practically helping to pass 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.870
 well and better between the lieutenant thing for 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.660
 keep them beautiful and then always clean 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.520
 mouthwash a generic mouthwash 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.760
 short mouthwash wherever you find them 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.850
 well enough and basically this is it 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.970
 what I do is my hygiene 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.610
 dental here is this so let's say that 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.920
 I'm very lucky I don't have 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.270
 done bleaching and I don't have any kind 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.160
 of miraculous product to advise you 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.620
 so I hope I answered this 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.900
 Your curiosity awaits all 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.260
 questions you want to ask me and then that 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.970
 that will take more votes than the one to come 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.830
 most frequently done will be the one to which 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.910
