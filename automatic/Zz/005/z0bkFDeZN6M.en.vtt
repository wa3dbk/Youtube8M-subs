 and to the channel for more videos like these 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.750
 now gentlemen I think we have to do 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.830
 good first of all that the low part 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.330
 in the creation this video are going to 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.530
 find a small link that is going to 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.360
 teach how to make your vehicle 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.799
 totally indestructible ok since not 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.610
 have done well let's take what 

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:45.930
 it's the cell phone 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.909
 let's go to contacts and we're going to 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.500
 mark my cousin the leicester and good 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.850
 we are going to ask you to activate this 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.559
 option that says the police ignores 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.210
 all our crimes ok we are going to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.500
 cost five thousand dollars for three 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.170
 minutes but we will 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.030
 unlimited now let's take what is 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.229
 the cell phone and let's go again to what 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.119
 which is contacts and we will mark you 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.129
 again to what is my cousin lester and 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:07.430
 we are going to tell him to get us to degrade 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.450
 or that is to say that it disappears us 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.280
 practically one minute for 500 dollars 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.360
 now that we already have all the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.280
 things activated now 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.110
 in this case I will go teach them that the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.460
 vehicle is totally indestructible 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.620
 so they're not going to say that they do not 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.090
 It is true or X thing that to see 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.100
 that still works here obviously 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.170
 I'm going to stop and I'm going to winnow what 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.000
 it's a grenade so you have to 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.380
 work and well the vehicle does not 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.820
 destroy now what we have to do 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.990
 before time runs out is get the 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.370
 which is a gun which we want 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.110
 be using while we are 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.520
 above what is the vehicle in this 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.580
 chance I will be using what is 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.300
 the shrapnel is not the mini uzi now 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.800
 when it is going to end what is the 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.930
 time at the bottom we will take the 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.410
 cellular to block what is 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.990
 this little time so to speak and 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.729
 to stay activated all the time and 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.200
 these options and how can you see here 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.460
 we found that it is a small victim 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.570
 which obviously we're going to shoot at 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.820
 head so they know a little more 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.960
 fast and good as he is fighting 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.460
 with another bastard who walks around here 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.259
 really this bastard already looked at me because 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.960
 is pointing yes with what you are the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.460
 sniper so she looked at me not what 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.110
 I can kill unless I give them 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.940
 contract title is already going and I looked for it 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.350
 so you 're going to have a very good time 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.660
 with this little trick the truth that 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.760
 It's very chinky the only thing you have to 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.920
 to do is to try to have the cell phone 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.570
 open all the time if you close it 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.860
 it will deactivate you ok 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.800
 a very good thing 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.410
 if you still have time left and you die 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.880
 sometimes sometimes when you open the cell phone 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.130
 quickly as to why as soon as 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.330
 now it seems that it continues to work what 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.980
 that of the trick you do not have to go back to 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.050
 do but this is only in 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.310
 ok but good times I hope you get the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.170
 I had a great time with this little trick 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.850
 remember the other brushes are people what 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.290
 that is the social networks and the channel 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.730
 for more videos like these if you have 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.500
 any doubt about this trick me 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.000
 can leave in the comments and I 'm going 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.780
 to try to answer you as fast 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.920
 possible ok 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.330
 also remember to subscribe to what is 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.520
 my channel of tweets in which then 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.050
 games with subscribers and we do 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.790
 lighting tweets suddenly and in the 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.740
 nights zones so you know I'm 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.740
