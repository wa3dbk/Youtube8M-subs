and here we have the msi wind pad 110
because<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.900> android<00:00:22.289> version<00:00:22.320> it's

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
because it is the android version it's

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.019 
because it is the android version it's
actually<00:00:23.160> got<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> different<00:00:23.609> ergonomic

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
actually got a different ergonomic

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.420 
actually got a different ergonomic
design<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.900> windows<00:00:25.380> version<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.310> can

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
design and the windows version you can

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.070 
design and the windows version you can
see<00:00:26.609> here<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:27.000> almost<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.539> structured

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
see here it's almost like a structured

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.099 
see here it's almost like a structured
kinda<00:00:28.320> side<00:00:28.939> curbside<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.570> ergonomic

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
kinda side curbside for ergonomic

kinda side curbside for ergonomic
holding<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.940> prototype<00:00:33.180> here<00:00:33.690> so

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
holding this is just a prototype here so

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.180 
holding this is just a prototype here so
these<00:00:34.020> ports<00:00:34.410> won't<00:00:34.620> work<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.040> they're

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
these ports won't work but they're

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.740 
these ports won't work but they're

card and what's this last one here this

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.520 
card and what's this last one here this
is<00:00:41.340> all<00:00:42.890> we<00:00:43.890> did<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.190> test<00:00:44.430> report<00:00:44.879> okay<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.440> you

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
is all we did a test report okay so you

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.319 
is all we did a test report okay so you
can<00:00:46.680> see<00:00:46.860> when<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.190> when<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.789> working<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.239> is

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
can see when it when it is working it is
