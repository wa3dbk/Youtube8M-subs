00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:08.580
 Hi everyone, today we'll see how 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.290
 solve a common problem they can 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.929
 present the brakes 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.789
 we lack both the skis and the model 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.789
 slx is the model xt that the former of f 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.390
 in practice this operation I will sing to 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:28.230
 explain to ensure that it can be resolved 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.240
 the problem of the lever that goes empty on 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.660
 these brakes in those conditions 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.239
 later you can present yourself in 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.879
 followed for example by cutting the tubes 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.450
 plumbers that I explained in another 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.120
 tutorial then the presence of air 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.620
 inside the student who 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.530
 means that when we go to us 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.020
 press the lever of our brakes 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.620
 this turns out to be very soft 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.050
 arrive almost at the end of the race without without 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.739
 precisely that the pistons of the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.609
 pliers go to bite the disc itself 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.350
 as I said then this 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.189
 condition is due to the presence of 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.760
 area at the level of the brake lever 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.310
 this process that I will explain 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.979
 corresponds to a part of the process 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.939
 more complex and longer than purging 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.450
 real of hydraulic systems 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:27.330
 despite this, however, this system 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.229
 solves the problem because these brakes 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.240
 as schwan xt then the family of gods 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:37.079
 then be family shimano brakes 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.570
 xx shooting xtr are defined brakes 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.509
 autosport cant what it means not that 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.780
 there is no need to purge 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:50.070
 but they have the characteristic that bubbles 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.520
 air rise to the level of the lever 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.920
 brake 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.680
 then they gather at the level of 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.210
 of the brake lever and when 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.040
 clearly the area is in excess 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.369
 entail precisely that effect 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.189
 spongy of the lever or even 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.360
 in the case it is excessive to do so that the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.890
 lever 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.050
 almost almost empty in practice in that one 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.260
 which we need to carry out 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:23.599
 this job is a simple screwdriver a 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:27.750
 cross a 2.5 mm Allen an allen 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:30.959
 instead of 4 mm 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.819
 we will need the glass of the 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.890
 of the shimono to purge 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.140
 which is very comfortable it works very well 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.230
 with this accessory it is clearly a 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.750
 some mineral oil to make it 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.550
 then bleed the brake lever 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.400
 let's see how this is done 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.129
 then I work at this point I want to 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.920
 specify that this system does not 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.650
 it is absolutely the brake bleed 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.010
 so shimano clearly for a job 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.540
 optimal it is necessary to purge the whole 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.989
 the whole system 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.680
 I will do this tutorial in the future 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:11.190
 just because you still do one 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.650
 Precise bleeding is an operation that goes 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.440
 made on the brakes with a certain one 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.349
 periodicity this system I repeat is not 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.840
 absolutely in a purging though if there is 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.300
 the presence of devising at the level 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.010
 of the student who then goes to 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.890
 emptiness does not arrive in the first one this 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.019
 system solves this problem 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.720
 then maybe when the pads do 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.459
 they will consume so we will have to change them 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.340
 tablets with new ones we carry out 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.959
 directly a purge itself 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.060
 so it's a temporary solution that 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.099
 clearly he will not have the same ones 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.250
 results of a complete study why 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:50.790
 will remain the area perhaps at the level 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.920
 the pliers that only with a true purge e 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.600
 we are going to eliminate then if 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.340
 we want to eliminate air at the level 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.530
 of the lever this system is more than 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.960
 enough as we proceed we proceed 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.090
 putting inside the glass 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.730
 shimano a little oil then without 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.800
 exaggerate because there is no need to 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.770
 a large quantity I want because I have to 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.320
 go up only a little air ed 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.580
 entering hate is therefore a modest one 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.580
 quantity is more than enough 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.880
 well at this point then how 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.820
 let's proceed the first thing to do 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.250
 remove the screw on the fuel tank 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.260
 brake lever 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.140
 then this black vine 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.880
 then once the screw is removed 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.160
 we put our glass with 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.240
 inside a little oil improve o 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.160
 let go with the plug in the 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.630
 inside so that it does not come out 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.210
 what we do we go to live there 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.340
 same small glass where before was the 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.110
 life therefore simply without 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.040
 observe it too much so as not to ruin the 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.930
 fillet we live just because later 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.640
 having lived in it what we do remove 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:03.330
 the locking pin in practice what 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:06.030
 we are going to simply give gods 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.100
 bodies on the brake lever 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.700
 this thing will do will leak out 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.860
 of air bubbles from the lever that 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.260
 then they will go up in the glass and to the 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.360
 Small glass itself will go up instead 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.200
 oil inside the file 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.600
 same after which this procedure 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:28.350
 we repeat it a few times doing 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.440
 even moving the brake lever in 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:34.290
 different angles therefore slightly 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.850
 lower is slightly higher 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.660
 clearly this to facilitate of 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:42.390
 succeeded in air bubbles 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.760
 on Sunday we wait below 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.150
 we will go slightly further 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.150
 high 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.230
 so several times until that 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.230
 ends to escape from the area 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:02.360
 perfect so at this point what there 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:05.270
 we block the vat i call the lever e 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.760
 we proceed to the reverse insert the 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:11.660
 plug inside the cup for 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:14.090
 do not spill the oil remove the 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.080
 small glass itself so we will see a 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:20.720
 this point we will see at this point that 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.610
 the amount of hate right at the level 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.170
 of the tank 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.000
 so when we're going to enter 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.340
 screw again a small amount 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.510
 leak out and normal then that 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:35.660
 we insert the vine we go to tighten it 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.580
 again slightly so as not to 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.680
 ruining life also because it is not 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.990
 necessary to make strong 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.730
 at this point then we clean up 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:47.720
 the excess of oil that maybe is 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:50.480
 leaked we will give some shot of 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.820
 brake and we will immediately feel that the lever 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.380
 will be less spongy then a 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.570
 second clearly in the amount of 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.000
 areas to those who were present at the beginning 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:02.360
 we will feel that this will be much more 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.240
 hard compared to the beginning then to this 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.280
 point we would have solved a problem of the 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.380
 leverage that was a void that was 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.540
 spongy without having needed 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.420
 carry out a study but I repeat is 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.820
 a much more complex job than that though 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.820
 clearly gives better results because 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.950
 totally removes air 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:24.190
 while in the hydraulic system, however, I repeat 

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:26.140
 in fact it can be done differently with 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.750
 this method we can solve maybe 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.400
 temporarily a little more 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:35.850
 superficial but the problem comes 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.850
 resolved absolutely hello to all
