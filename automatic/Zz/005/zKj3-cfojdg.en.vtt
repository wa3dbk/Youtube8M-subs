00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
it's following different characters now

I only read the first chapter of this

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.190 
I only read the first chapter of this
back<00:01:41.759> when<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.030> came<00:01:42.210> out<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> couple<00:01:42.659> years<00:01:42.780> ago

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
back when it came out a couple years ago

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.719 
back when it came out a couple years ago
and<00:01:43.470> now<00:01:43.740> I've<00:01:43.920> only<00:01:44.070> seen<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> first<00:01:44.549> episode

and now I've only seen the first episode

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.429 
and now I've only seen the first episode
of<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> anime<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.720> can't<00:01:46.020> make<00:01:46.170> too<00:01:46.320> many

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
of the anime so I can't make too many

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.170 
of the anime so I can't make too many
comments<00:01:46.920> about<00:01:46.950> where<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.640> story<00:01:47.880> goes

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
comments about where the story goes

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.789 
comments about where the story goes
because<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.689> haven't<00:01:48.930> read<00:01:49.200> up<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.680> or

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
because I haven't read up on it or

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.859 
because I haven't read up on it or
anything<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.399> don't<00:01:50.579> know<00:01:50.970> where<00:01:51.270> exactly<00:01:51.299> it

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
anything I don't know where exactly it

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:52.969 
anything I don't know where exactly it
falls<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.200> with<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> timeline<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
falls in with the timeline of the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.679 
falls in with the timeline of the
original<00:01:53.340> show<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> believe<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.360> starts

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
original show but I believe it starts

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.929 
original show but I believe it starts
around<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.110> same<00:01:55.290> time<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.950> because<00:01:56.310> some

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
around the same time just because some

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.090 
around the same time just because some
characters<00:01:57.360> who<00:01:57.540> die<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:58.290> early<00:01:58.799> into

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
characters who die really early into

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.130 
characters who die really early into
Soul<00:01:59.280> Eater<00:01:59.460> are<00:01:59.759> still<00:02:00.060> alive<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.719> Soul<00:02:00.990> Eater

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
Soul Eater are still alive in Soul Eater

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.530 
Soul Eater are still alive in Soul Eater
not<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.159> must<00:02:02.549> take<00:02:02.790> place<00:02:02.939> before<00:02:03.030> like

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
not so it must take place before like

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.630 
not so it must take place before like
episode<00:02:03.930> 4<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.500> original<00:02:04.860> show<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.310> don't

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
episode 4 of the original show I don't

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.029 
episode 4 of the original show I don't
know<00:02:05.790> if<00:02:05.969> it's<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.840> shorter<00:02:07.710> time

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
know if it's like just a shorter time

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.639 
know if it's like just a shorter time
span<00:02:08.280> or<00:02:08.849> what's<00:02:09.420> up<00:02:09.629> with<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.989> but<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.500> any

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
span or what's up with that but in any

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.290 
span or what's up with that but in any
case<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.790> parallel<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.840> so

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
case it's parallel to it so

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.850 
case it's parallel to it so
it<00:02:13.480> seems<00:02:13.810> like<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.200> inspiration<00:02:14.830> behind

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
it seems like the inspiration behind

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.650 
it seems like the inspiration behind
Soul<00:02:15.370> Eater<00:02:15.490> not<00:02:15.730> was<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.210> guess<00:02:16.480> the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
Soul Eater not was that I guess the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.320 
Soul Eater not was that I guess the
manga<00:02:16.990> artist<00:02:17.320> just<00:02:17.500> wanted<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.830> do<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.330> girls

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
manga artist just wanted to do a girls

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.530 
manga artist just wanted to do a girls
show<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.870> call<00:02:20.080> them<00:02:20.200> for<00:02:20.500> girls<00:02:20.860> show<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:22.330> could

that that's that's why it exists but
it's<00:02:55.810> not<00:02:55.990> very<00:02:56.320> good<00:02:56.950> at<00:02:57.340> being<00:02:57.730> that<00:02:57.970> this

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
it's not very good at being that this

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.180 
it's not very good at being that this
episode<00:02:59.140> tries<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.560> establish<00:02:59.710> the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
episode tries to establish the

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.480 
episode tries to establish the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
characters but it doesn't really give us

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.000 
characters but it doesn't really give us
anything<00:03:03.490> to<00:03:04.030> work<00:03:04.270> with<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:05.320> main<00:03:05.530> character

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
anything to work with the main character

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.560 
anything to work with the main character
is<00:03:06.160> kind<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.490> dull<00:03:06.730> she<00:03:07.120> doesn't<00:03:07.300> really<00:03:07.420> have

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
is kind of dull she doesn't really have

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.360 
is kind of dull she doesn't really have
any<00:03:07.750> personality<00:03:08.230> outside<00:03:08.710> of<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.130> fact<00:03:09.310> that

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
any personality outside of the fact that

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.370 
any personality outside of the fact that
she<00:03:09.550> hasn't<00:03:09.730> found<00:03:10.030> herself<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:11.170> two

just felt like a group of four friends
who<00:04:12.250> were<00:04:12.400> just<00:04:12.550> talking<00:04:13.480> about<00:04:13.989> and

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
who were just talking about and

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.960 
who were just talking about and
it's<00:04:14.709> not<00:04:14.830> the<00:04:14.950> most<00:04:15.100> exciting<00:04:15.430> thing<00:04:15.850> ever

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
it's not the most exciting thing ever

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.259 
it's not the most exciting thing ever
but<00:04:16.780> if<00:04:16.989> you're<00:04:17.560> into<00:04:17.859> that<00:04:17.950> kind<00:04:18.010> of<00:04:18.340> thing<00:04:18.580> it

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
but if you're into that kind of thing it

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:19.890 
but if you're into that kind of thing it
worked

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
worked

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.449 
worked
and<00:04:19.989> Soul<00:04:20.230> Eater<00:04:20.350> not<00:04:20.440> doesn't<00:04:20.890> have

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.710 
it doesn't have any realistic
conversation<00:04:24.460> so<00:04:24.669> this<00:04:24.850> slice<00:04:25.330> of<00:04:25.539> life

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
conversation so this slice of life

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.050 
conversation so this slice of life
doesn't<00:04:26.080> feel<00:04:26.350> like<00:04:26.560> anyone's<00:04:26.949> life<00:04:27.250> it<00:04:27.699> just

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060

doesn't feel like anyone's life it just
feels<00:04:28.539> like<00:04:28.750> nothing's<00:04:29.289> happening<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.220> I

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
feels like nothing's happening and I

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.640 
feels like nothing's happening and I
mean<00:04:30.849> this<00:04:30.940> is<00:04:31.060> only<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.360> first<00:04:31.509> episode<00:04:31.720> but

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
mean this is only the first episode but

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.800 
mean this is only the first episode but
the<00:04:33.069> first<00:04:33.280> episode<00:04:33.669> is<00:04:33.819> only<00:04:34.120> adapting<00:04:34.720> the

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
the first episode is only adapting the

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.870 
the first episode is only adapting the
first<00:04:35.020> chapter<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.560> manga<00:04:35.740> clearly<00:04:36.729> did

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
first chapter of the manga clearly did

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.700 
first chapter of the manga clearly did
not<00:04:36.970> need<00:04:37.120> to<00:04:37.240> be<00:04:37.330> a<00:04:37.360> whole<00:04:37.569> 22<00:04:38.080> minute<00:04:38.319> episode

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
not need to be a whole 22 minute episode

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.070 
not need to be a whole 22 minute episode
just<00:04:38.919> dedicated<00:04:39.400> to<00:04:39.490> this<00:04:39.699> one<00:04:39.940> chapter<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:40.690> I

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
just dedicated to this one chapter and I

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.480 
just dedicated to this one chapter and I
think<00:04:41.259> this<00:04:41.349> shows<00:04:41.530> only<00:04:41.680> gonna<00:04:41.860> be<00:04:41.979> like<00:04:42.099> 13

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
think this shows only gonna be like 13

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.860 
think this shows only gonna be like 13
episodes<00:04:42.910> so<00:04:43.030> I<00:04:43.060> don't<00:04:43.270> know<00:04:43.330> how<00:04:43.479> much<00:04:43.630> it<00:04:43.780> can

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
episodes so I don't know how much it can

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.390 
episodes so I don't know how much it can
possibly<00:04:44.319> get<00:04:44.470> done<00:04:44.710> in<00:04:44.830> that<00:04:44.919> amount<00:04:44.979> of<00:04:45.250> time

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
possibly get done in that amount of time

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.550 
possibly get done in that amount of time
if<00:04:45.550> it<00:04:45.639> keeps<00:04:45.789> moving<00:04:46.060> at<00:04:46.330> this<00:04:46.449> pace<00:04:46.750> but<00:04:47.530> I

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
if it keeps moving at this pace but I

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.770 
if it keeps moving at this pace but I
don't<00:04:47.770> imagine<00:04:47.979> much<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:49.300> weirdest<00:04:49.660> thing

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
don't imagine much the weirdest thing

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.719 
don't imagine much the weirdest thing
about<00:04:49.810> this<00:04:50.139> show<00:04:50.440> is<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.979> art<00:04:51.220> style

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
about this show is the art style

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.820 
about this show is the art style
so<00:04:52.150> the<00:04:52.270> original<00:04:52.389> Soul<00:04:52.900> Eater<00:04:53.050> was<00:04:53.289> extremely

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
so the original Soul Eater was extremely

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.070 
so the original Soul Eater was extremely
stylized<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:54.729> then<00:04:54.940> so<00:04:55.180> late<00:04:55.330> or<00:04:55.479> not<00:04:55.509> tries

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
stylized and then so late or not tries

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.490 
stylized and then so late or not tries
to<00:04:56.289> be<00:04:56.470> like<00:04:57.120> normal<00:04:58.120> looking<00:04:58.570> I<00:04:58.810> guess<00:04:59.139> and

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
to be like normal looking I guess and

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.249 
to be like normal looking I guess and
it's<00:05:00.039> really<00:05:00.400> weird<00:05:00.610> to<00:05:01.180> see<00:05:01.539> it<00:05:01.720> that<00:05:01.960> way

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.259 
it's really weird to see it that way

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.560 
it's really weird to see it that way
because<00:05:02.979> like<00:05:03.190> she<00:05:03.370> gets<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.729> the<00:05:03.849> school<00:05:04.210> and

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
because like she gets to the school and

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.749 
because like she gets to the school and
it's<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.990> big<00:05:05.320> crazy<00:05:05.800> school<00:05:06.310> that<00:05:06.669> we

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
it's the big crazy school that we

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:08.610 
it's the big crazy school that we
remember<00:05:07.000> from<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.539> first<00:05:07.780> show<00:05:08.050> and<00:05:08.259> it's

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
remember from the first show and it's

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.770 
remember from the first show and it's
got<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:08.830> crazy<00:05:09.099> Sun<00:05:09.520> but<00:05:10.090> then<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.479> town

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
got the crazy Sun but then the town

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.600

surrounding<00:05:11.590> it<00:05:11.710> and<00:05:11.889> the<00:05:11.979> inside<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.430> the

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
surrounding it and the inside of the

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.029 
surrounding it and the inside of the
school<00:05:12.880> just<00:05:13.120> looked<00:05:13.720> like<00:05:13.810> a<00:05:13.960> normal<00:05:14.560> school

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
in like a normal town it just looks like

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.920 
in like a normal town it just looks like
our<00:05:17.349> world<00:05:17.830> with<00:05:18.580> Soul<00:05:18.849> Eater<00:05:19.030> in<00:05:19.479> spite<00:05:19.900> of

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
our world with Soul Eater in spite of

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.620 
our world with Soul Eater in spite of
being<00:05:20.080> set<00:05:20.710> in<00:05:20.949> like<00:05:21.190> Nevada<00:05:21.490> looked<00:05:22.240> like<00:05:22.599> a

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
being set in like Nevada looked like a

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.930 
being set in like Nevada looked like a
total<00:05:23.169> crazy<00:05:23.440> fantasy<00:05:24.190> world<00:05:24.400> it<00:05:24.639> didn't<00:05:24.880> look

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
total crazy fantasy world it didn't look

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.210 
total crazy fantasy world it didn't look
realistic<00:05:25.690> and<00:05:25.900> now<00:05:26.380> it<00:05:26.560> does<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:27.099> it's

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
realistic and now it does and it's

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.100 
realistic and now it does and it's
really<00:05:27.639> weird<00:05:28.000> it's<00:05:28.419> as<00:05:28.659> if<00:05:28.780> the<00:05:28.930> original

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
really weird it's as if the original

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.140 
really weird it's as if the original
Soul<00:05:29.560> Eater<00:05:29.710> was<00:05:29.949> like<00:05:30.099> non-diegetic<00:05:30.699> Lee

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.719 
Soul Eater was like non-diegetic Lee
stylized<00:05:31.750> and<00:05:32.110> now<00:05:32.320> this<00:05:32.530> one's<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:33.159> reality

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
stylized and now this one's the reality

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.010 
stylized and now this one's the reality
of<00:05:33.759> what<00:05:34.060> was<00:05:34.210> happening<00:05:34.389> like<00:05:34.810> we<00:05:34.930> were

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
of what was happening like we were

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.510 
of what was happening like we were
seeing<00:05:35.229> the<00:05:35.409> original<00:05:35.590> show<00:05:36.009> through<00:05:36.340> some

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
seeing the original show through some

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.879 
seeing the original show through some
kind<00:05:36.699> of<00:05:36.729> weird<00:05:37.000> trippy<00:05:37.389> vision<00:05:37.780> and<00:05:38.229> this<00:05:38.710> is

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
kind of weird trippy vision and this is

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.830 
kind of weird trippy vision and this is
actually<00:05:39.370> what<00:05:39.550> was<00:05:39.669> happening<00:05:40.150> but<00:05:40.570> the<00:05:40.659> art

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840

actually what was happening but the art
style<00:05:41.080> just<00:05:41.349> looks<00:05:41.620> awkward<00:05:42.159> the<00:05:42.940> characters

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
style just looks awkward the characters

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.629 
style just looks awkward the characters
look<00:05:43.690> weird<00:05:44.139> like<00:05:44.500> the<00:05:44.620> new<00:05:44.800> ones<00:05:45.009> look<00:05:45.219> okay

look weird like the new ones look okay

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.070 
look weird like the new ones look okay
because<00:05:45.969> they're<00:05:46.240> meant<00:05:46.479> to<00:05:46.509> be<00:05:46.659> in<00:05:46.750> this<00:05:46.840> art

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
because they're meant to be in this art

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.899 
because they're meant to be in this art
style<00:05:47.320> but<00:05:47.860> when<00:05:47.949> you<00:05:48.039> see<00:05:48.190> old<00:05:48.400> characters

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
style but when you see old characters

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:51.330 
style but when you see old characters
like<00:05:49.060> Sid<00:05:49.300> sensei<00:05:49.750> and<00:05:49.900> Blackstar<00:05:50.560> they<00:05:51.130> just

like Sid sensei and Blackstar they just

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.950 
like Sid sensei and Blackstar they just
look<00:05:51.580> strange<00:05:52.090> because<00:05:52.479> they're<00:05:52.630> supposed<00:05:52.750> to

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
look strange because they're supposed to

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.649 
look strange because they're supposed to
be<00:05:53.080> these<00:05:53.199> like<00:05:53.380> overly<00:05:54.159> muscular<00:05:54.479> shown<00:05:55.479> in
