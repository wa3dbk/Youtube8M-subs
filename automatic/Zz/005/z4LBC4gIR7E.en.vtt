big and muscular you know because the

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.130 
big and muscular you know because the
hodgetwins<00:02:00.549> weren't<00:02:01.090> doing<00:02:01.299> in<00:02:01.420> fasting<00:02:02.049> to

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
hodgetwins weren't doing in fasting to

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.870 
hodgetwins weren't doing in fasting to
gain<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.470> muscle<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:02.860> they<00:02:02.979> gained<00:02:03.220> they

were<00:02:04.060> training<00:02:04.450> like<00:02:04.720> body<00:02:04.960> blows<00:02:05.350> they<00:02:05.470> were

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
were training like body blows they were

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.260 
were training like body blows they were
eating<00:02:05.770> all<00:02:05.890> kinds<00:02:05.920> of<00:02:06.220> stuff<00:02:06.460> they<00:02:06.670> were<00:02:07.150> not

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270

eating all kinds of stuff they were not
doing<00:02:07.540> that<00:02:07.659> they<00:02:07.869> decided<00:02:08.529> to<00:02:08.649> do<00:02:08.709> the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:08.829 
doing that they decided to do the

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.190 
doing that they decided to do the
fasting<00:02:09.340> thing<00:02:09.489> afterwards<00:02:09.939> to<00:02:10.060> get<00:02:10.179> lean<00:02:10.450> so

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
fasting thing afterwards to get lean so

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.629 
fasting thing afterwards to get lean so
my<00:02:11.319> advice<00:02:11.590> is<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.829> go<00:02:12.010> out<00:02:12.099> and<00:02:12.249> research<00:02:12.370> as

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:12.639 
my advice is to go out and research as

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:13.649 
my advice is to go out and research as
much<00:02:12.819> as<00:02:12.939> you<00:02:13.029> can<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.359> get<00:02:13.480> as<00:02:13.540> much

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
much as you can to get as much

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:14.199 
much as you can to get as much
information

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
information

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.149 
information
on<00:02:14.359> the<00:02:14.480> subject<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.019> can<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.469> then

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
on the subject that you can and then

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.979 
on the subject that you can and then
basically<00:02:16.640> do<00:02:16.849> your<00:02:17.030> own<00:02:17.150> study<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.870> know

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
basically do your own study you know

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.959 
basically do your own study you know
take<00:02:18.290> all<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.920> numbers<00:02:19.219> added<00:02:19.430> up<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.849> see

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:19.969 
take all the numbers added up and see

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.119 
take all the numbers added up and see
what<00:02:20.090> you're<00:02:20.239> left<00:02:20.359> with<00:02:21.040> said<00:02:22.040> they

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
what you're left with said they

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.550 
what you're left with said they
mentioned<00:02:22.519> that<00:02:22.640> also<00:02:23.299> after<00:02:23.569> fasting<00:02:24.200> which

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
mentioned that also after fasting which

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.880 
mentioned that also after fasting which
he's<00:02:24.769> doing<00:02:25.010> from<00:02:25.189> 7:30<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:27.200> 9:30

shouldn't consume any food supplements
for<00:02:33.049> that<00:02:33.139> matter<00:02:33.290> after<00:02:33.590> working<00:02:33.769> out<00:02:33.980> for

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
for that matter after working out for

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.800 
for that matter after working out for
about<00:02:34.159> an<00:02:34.370> hour<00:02:34.430> hour<00:02:34.879> and<00:02:34.939> a<00:02:35.030> half<00:02:35.209> to

about an hour hour and a half to

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.449 
about an hour hour and a half to
maximize<00:02:36.260> fat<00:02:36.469> loss<00:02:36.530> results<00:02:37.129> from<00:02:37.189> growth

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
maximize fat loss results from growth

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.420 
maximize fat loss results from growth
hormone<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.819> spiking<00:02:38.950> insulin<00:02:39.950> directly<00:02:40.310> will

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
hormone of spiking insulin directly will

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.039 
hormone of spiking insulin directly will
prevent<00:02:40.700> world<00:02:40.969> hormone<00:02:41.269> from<00:02:41.480> doing<00:02:41.689> its<00:02:41.810> job

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
prevent world hormone from doing its job

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.530 
prevent world hormone from doing its job
as<00:02:42.439> they<00:02:43.159> can't<00:02:43.400> coexist<00:02:43.639> together<00:02:44.000> what's<00:02:44.389> my

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
as they can't coexist together what's my

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.670 
as they can't coexist together what's my
opinion<00:02:44.870> on<00:02:44.959> that<00:02:45.079> as<00:02:45.260> well<00:02:45.439> um<00:02:47.349> first<00:02:48.349> of<00:02:48.530> all

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
opinion on that as well um first of all

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.190 
opinion on that as well um first of all
your<00:02:49.099> fasting<00:02:49.849> from<00:02:49.909> 7:30<00:02:50.389> to<00:02:50.540> 9:30<00:02:50.810> in<00:02:51.169> the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
your fasting from 7:30 to 9:30 in the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.729 
your fasting from 7:30 to 9:30 in the
morning

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
morning

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.659 
morning
so<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:52.819> mean<00:02:53.090> 11<00:02:53.720> 12<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.769> mean<00:02:55.069> I<00:02:55.099> guess<00:02:55.370> this<00:02:55.549> is

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:55.669 
so I mean 11 12 I mean I guess this is

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:56.679 
so I mean 11 12 I mean I guess this is
intermittent<00:02:56.060> fasting<00:02:56.150> this<00:02:56.419> is<00:02:56.540> like<00:02:56.659> a

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
intermittent fasting this is like a

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:58.659 
intermittent fasting this is like a
regular<00:02:56.959> day<00:02:57.470> for<00:02:57.769> most<00:02:57.919> people<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:58.549> I<00:02:58.579> don't

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:58.669 
regular day for most people so I don't

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:02.319 
regular day for most people so I don't
know<00:02:58.909> you<00:02:59.780> know<00:02:59.930> you<00:03:00.889> know<00:03:00.919> this<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.669> guess<00:03:02.030> I

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
know you know you know this I guess I

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:03.909 
know you know you know this I guess I
don't<00:03:03.079> know<00:03:03.139> what<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.349> make<00:03:03.379> of<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.709> but<00:03:03.889> I

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:03.919 
don't know what to make of that but I

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.349 
don't know what to make of that but I
mean<00:03:04.099> I<00:03:04.219> know<00:03:04.280> usually<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.849> eating<00:03:05.090> window

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
mean I know usually the eating window

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.379 
mean I know usually the eating window
most<00:03:06.260> people<00:03:06.620> have<00:03:06.769> is<00:03:07.069> at<00:03:07.370> night<00:03:07.700> not<00:03:08.329> during

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
most people have is at night not during

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.179 
most people have is at night not during
the<00:03:08.689> day<00:03:08.930> they<00:03:09.290> leave<00:03:09.409> very<00:03:09.650> little<00:03:09.769> during

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
the day they leave very little during

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.190 
the day they leave very little during
the<00:03:10.280> day<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.579> they'll<00:03:10.700> eat<00:03:10.849> at<00:03:11.299> night<00:03:11.599> your

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
the day and they'll eat at night your

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.990 
the day and they'll eat at night your
seems<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:12.620> be<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.829> opposite<00:03:13.219> way<00:03:13.340> around<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:13.939> I

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
seems to be the opposite way around so I

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.309 
seems to be the opposite way around so I
don't<00:03:14.150> know<00:03:14.209> how<00:03:14.329> that<00:03:14.510> affects<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:15.169> outcome

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
don't know how that affects the outcome

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.869 
don't know how that affects the outcome
of<00:03:15.500> that<00:03:15.560> because<00:03:15.889> I've<00:03:16.040> never<00:03:16.159> done<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.760> that

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
of that because I've never done it that

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.080 
of that because I've never done it that
way<00:03:16.909> so<00:03:17.979> as<00:03:18.979> far<00:03:19.250> as<00:03:19.370> not<00:03:19.489> eating<00:03:19.790> after<00:03:20.000> your

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
way so as far as not eating after your

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.140 
way so as far as not eating after your
workouts<00:03:20.389> is<00:03:20.949> it<00:03:21.949> the<00:03:22.040> insulin<00:03:22.430> aspect<00:03:22.909> of<00:03:23.030> it

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
workouts is it the insulin aspect of it

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.250 
workouts is it the insulin aspect of it
or<00:03:23.299> is<00:03:23.419> it<00:03:23.449> the<00:03:23.569> fact<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.139> have

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
or is it the fact that you have

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.399 
or is it the fact that you have
mobilized<00:03:24.709> fat<00:03:25.659> but<00:03:26.659> I've<00:03:26.780> not<00:03:26.900> actually<00:03:27.229> used

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
mobilized fat but I've not actually used

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.559 
mobilized fat but I've not actually used
for<00:03:27.680> energy<00:03:27.979> yet<00:03:28.129> so<00:03:29.000> therefore<00:03:29.329> if<00:03:29.419> you<00:03:29.540> take

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
for energy yet so therefore if you take

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.240 
for energy yet so therefore if you take
another<00:03:30.049> fuel<00:03:30.409> source<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.829> put<00:03:30.949> it<00:03:31.040> in<00:03:31.220> your

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
another fuel source and put it in your

it could be looking to go protis I it's
my<00:03:34.909> command<00:03:35.180> cylinder<00:03:35.569> is<00:03:35.689> there<00:03:35.900> pit<00:03:36.079> if<00:03:36.500> you

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
my command cylinder is there pit if you

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.080 
my command cylinder is there pit if you

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
take another fuel source which is more

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.729 
take another fuel source which is more

readily available easier to use fuel

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.110 
readily available easier to use fuel
source<00:03:39.949> like<00:03:40.129> glucose<00:03:40.459> and<00:03:40.699> put<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:40.879> in<00:03:41.000> your

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.469 
source like glucose and put it in your
body<00:03:41.269> and<00:03:42.009> your<00:03:43.009> body<00:03:43.159> can<00:03:43.250> use<00:03:43.370> that<00:03:43.699> the<00:03:44.299> fat

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:44.479 
body and your body can use that the fat

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.939 
body and your body can use that the fat
that<00:03:44.509> is<00:03:44.780> mobilized<00:03:45.199> it's<00:03:45.409> not<00:03:45.500> going<00:03:45.650> to<00:03:45.709> use

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
that is mobilized it's not going to use

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.800 
that is mobilized it's not going to use
for<00:03:46.129> energy<00:03:46.430> it's<00:03:46.639> going<00:03:46.729> to<00:03:46.819> redeposit<00:03:47.569> it<00:03:47.659> as

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
for energy it's going to redeposit it as

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.159 
for energy it's going to redeposit it as
fat<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:49.430> do<00:03:50.269> I<00:03:50.299> think<00:03:50.419> that<00:03:50.689> it's<00:03:50.870> a<00:03:50.930> good<00:03:51.079> idea

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
fat so do I think that it's a good idea

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:52.449 
fat so do I think that it's a good idea
yeah<00:03:51.590> I<00:03:51.620> think<00:03:51.889> it's<00:03:51.979> probably<00:03:52.159> a<00:03:52.280> good<00:03:52.400> idea

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
yeah I think it's probably a good idea

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.129 
yeah I think it's probably a good idea
if<00:03:52.790> you're<00:03:52.939> in<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:53.150> you're<00:03:53.629> doing<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:53.989> I<00:03:54.109> mean

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
if you're in it you're doing it I mean

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.729 
if you're in it you're doing it I mean
fasting<00:03:54.709> to<00:03:54.829> wait<00:03:55.040> a<00:03:55.250> little<00:03:55.519> while<00:03:55.729> after<00:03:56.000> you

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
fasting to wait a little while after you

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.770 
fasting to wait a little while after you
after<00:03:57.739> you<00:03:57.829> eat<00:03:58.009> to<00:03:58.280> do<00:03:58.430> any<00:03:58.579> you<00:03:59.359> know<00:03:59.449> meals

or anything like that but I'm not so

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.610 
or anything like that but I'm not so
sure<00:04:01.430> it's<00:04:01.699> based<00:04:01.879> on<00:04:02.030> insulin<00:04:02.449> so<00:04:02.750> hope<00:04:03.439> this

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
sure it's based on insulin so hope this

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.199 
sure it's based on insulin so hope this
