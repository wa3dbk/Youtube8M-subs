00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
soundtrack it's a very nice looking box

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.900 
soundtrack it's a very nice looking box
but<00:00:46.399> ultimately<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:49.190> seven<00:00:50.190> discs<00:00:50.520> very

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
nice looking discs but there's not much

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.490 
nice looking discs but there's not much
else<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.520> them<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.180> why<00:00:54.390> does<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.660> come<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:54.989> so

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
else to them so why does it come on so

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.830 
else to them so why does it come on so
many<00:00:55.620> discs<00:00:56.070> when<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:56.969> save<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.690> much

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
many discs when can you save so much

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.810 
many discs when can you save so much
space<00:00:57.899> if<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.530> put<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.859> USB<00:00:59.160> or<00:00:59.760> a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
space if you just put it on a USB or a

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.450 
space if you just put it on a USB or a
blu-ray<00:01:00.480> disc<00:01:00.840> well<00:01:01.320> not<00:01:01.710> everyone<00:01:02.070> has<00:01:02.250> those

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
blu-ray disc well not everyone has those

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.369 
blu-ray disc well not everyone has those
things<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.149> honestly<00:01:03.600> these<00:01:03.840> things<00:01:03.989> are<00:01:04.140> so

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
things and honestly these things are so

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.870 
things and honestly these things are so
much<00:01:04.589> cheaper<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.949> make<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.670> think<00:01:05.790> about

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
much cheaper to make just think about

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.210 
much cheaper to make just think about
the<00:01:06.150> time<00:01:06.390> what<00:01:06.720> 10<00:01:06.960> 15<00:01:07.110> years<00:01:07.470> ago<00:01:07.530> when<00:01:07.950> AOL

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the time what 10 15 years ago when AOL

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.609 
the time what 10 15 years ago when AOL
was<00:01:08.640> sending<00:01:08.909> discs<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.780> mail<00:01:09.930> constantly

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
was sending discs in the mail constantly

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.170 
was sending discs in the mail constantly
and<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.040> were<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.310> using<00:01:11.490> them<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:11.790> frisbees

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
and you were just using them as frisbees

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.840 
and you were just using them as frisbees
that's<00:01:12.810> where<00:01:12.960> DVDs<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.890> gotten<00:01:14.220> now<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:14.760> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
that's where DVDs have gotten now it's a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.789 
that's where DVDs have gotten now it's a
lot<00:01:15.000> cheaper<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.270> produce<00:01:15.450> these<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.960> so

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
lot cheaper to produce these and so

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.719 
lot cheaper to produce these and so
that's<00:01:17.009> why<00:01:17.159> you're<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.460> get<00:01:17.610> this

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
that's why you're going to get this

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.490 
that's why you're going to get this
really<00:01:18.119> big<00:01:18.330> set<00:01:18.570> rather<00:01:18.810> than<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.229> single

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
really big set rather than just a single

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.980 
really big set rather than just a single
blu-ray<00:01:19.890> or<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.460> really<00:01:20.759> handy<00:01:21.119> USB<00:01:21.689> stick<00:01:21.900> but
