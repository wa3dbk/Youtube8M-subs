00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.859
 renaissance architecture simple 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.599
 That's David David soon 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.309
 high school diploma and would like for his art project 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.120
 something about the architecture of 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.120
 experienced renaissance 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.590
 the epoch of renaissance is that of the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.000
 well detached and renaissance itself 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.070
 followed the baroque renaissance or 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.430
 even the second antique will be like one 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.090
 Pie in three pieces parts early 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.550
 renaissance here was the ground like the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.280
 floor of this gate to be fixed and the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.379
 Game rules were made instead of themselves 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.879
 devise something new they have 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.450
 just the pillars the old romans 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.450
 took 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.559
 renaissance in the high renaissance 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.300
 the plans of architecture always became 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.899
 better and could run safely 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.940
 become 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.890
 however, they still could not 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.370
 invent itself and looked at fell 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.949
 the romans from mannerism tried the 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.550
 architect with shape like a chemist with 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.550
 its ingredients 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.530
 Architect game 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.939
 the building block around the building for a 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.250
 puzzle together 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.960
 this puzzle made sure that the 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.960
 architects could work freely 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.350
 the elements of architecture in the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.350
 Renaissance 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.360
 know is that you 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.090
 tecan according to their own 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.610
 to make thoughts and just the ideas 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.290
 the ancient Romans excepted those 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.770
 because if you have your own 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.710
 Introduce conceptions of the floor plan 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.630
 the floor plans of these buildings were almost 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.210
 always right angles that you know from 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.580
 your room has every corner of the room 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.150
 a 90 degree angle is right 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.420
 corner 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.820
 new was that the facade so the wall 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.320
 and the layout was like good 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.320
 friends and was no longer lonely 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.130
 may like consist of semicircles 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.760
 or were ova government circles 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.470
 passed 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.770
 These bows were used as windows 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.600
 Promise often the shear and cover 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.490
 the guests heard directly with the 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.210
 house walls on so that the edges are not 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.100
 survived 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.930
 The roofs were usually not very high 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.060
 Doors are the doors of one of them 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.670
 horizontal lines marked the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.620
 as an animal protection , the door is called the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.010
 had upper triangular or 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.480
 admit semicircular who do not like 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.610
 So do only had to decoration 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.660
 were attached with a 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.660
 provided with a closing stone 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.360
 the windows were alone or as 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.220
 passion attached when you as a person 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.560
 they were attached with a 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.959
 arched windows had the windows 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.840
 also a horizontal line so one 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.299
 fall or a bow over the windows 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.620
 were triangles or semicircular gables 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:04.540
 Similar to those in addition, the turn in 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.269
 The period of the renaissance was the 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.010
 Walls plastered are so similar 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:13.599
 like the houses that you know today 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.379
 Features based on the old town hall in 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.329
 Wiesbaden 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.370
 as you learned earlier in our video 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.470
 Hats were the floor plans of the buildings 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.000
 usually quite friendly and that's it 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.190
 at the old town hall the fall 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.170
 on the photo you can see the 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.690
 bows from semicircles what like 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.430
 a feature of renaissance also said 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.980
 the roof is typical of the renaissance 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.209
 the roof stops with the house wall in such a way 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.170
 that the edges of the roof is not 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.130
 survive 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.990
 the roof is not very good either 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.720
 the doors also have a few here 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.460
 greek fall so this horizontal 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.650
 lines and sit about 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.810
 semicircular c gable 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.180
 the windows also have features of 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.370
 epoch on these both individually as 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.200
 also attached as passion 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.930
 Paired windows are also here with 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.180
 one summarized the fans above 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.030
 Town Hall have a horizontal fall 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.099
 and above it triangular gables the 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.379
 House wall of the town hall is plastered and 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.470
 will therefore go home from today 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.470
 Time 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.669
 Now that has a lot to do with architecture 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.320
 experienced and can be renaissance 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.949
 art project with a clear conscience 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.949
 complete
