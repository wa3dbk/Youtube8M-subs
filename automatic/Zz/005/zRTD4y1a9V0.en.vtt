00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.120
 hi friends as you already know in the new 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.980
 update to dota 2 would add a hero and 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.379
 A column that can be approximately Russian 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.119
 translate like needle skins today I had 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.559
 the honor of driving him a party by the way 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.810
 it was difficult to do 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.060
 because he was chosen very much all the time 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.800
 They all want to see a new hero but 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.839
 at least three herbs two times I could 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.970
 do and although the first time my team 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.380
 it was a creepy bottom the second time I still 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.830
 managed to play well for this 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.990
 the hero 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.599
 evaluate its positive qualities and 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.280
 Iâ€™ll probably tell you about them in 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.170
 first individual attention deserves 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.140
 his appearance is so beautiful 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.090
 slightly bent porcupine with a huge 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.160
 his spiked back to you he looks very 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.800
 nice plus eye patch like 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.829
 hints us that he may be pirates 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.600
 sometimes drinks buying by the way he 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.030
 became much prettier than he brought in 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.250
 dota 1 in general you can compare and 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.170
 really the character has become much 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.480
 more charismatic much more 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.190
 pleasant more than that I was pleased that 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.239
 this hero is pretty simple he has two 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.489
 passive skill 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.770
 and it allows beginners to play for him 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.750
 instead of picking again a sniper or trucks 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.640
 actually on the skills you need to stop 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.020
 slightly in more detail first skill 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.390
 throw snot that slows down 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.619
 the enemy lowers his armor and this 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.570
 skill reminded me very old 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.549
 Good Germanov you may have played 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.680
 he also loved this game as a child 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.840
 throw snot and other not very 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.880
 pleasant thing she hates and 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.409
 skill but it seemed to me very beautiful 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.509
 and the more fun the slowdown 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.759
 maybe up to 48 percent 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.009
 tangible enough for the enemy second 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.020
 skill spreading and needles too 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.659
 quite pleasant many damask and 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.159
 very useful in bulk kneading the most 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.549
 I was greatly interested in the third 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.799
 skill 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.200
 because it allows you to get less 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.640
 damage with forgings of damage behind the back taking advantage 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.409
 I want to say hello to Ricky 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.909
 ulta passive after each 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.009
 use of skill gives increase 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.899
 damage rate given that skill and ours 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.420
 worth very cheap mana character a lot 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.320
 Ult almost always works and 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.909
 makes us run and kill 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.439
 generally strong enough handsome 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.060
 a hero to me honestly he is very 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.560
 like most likely I will play them 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.280
 very cool to use in the role 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.840
 initiator 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.299
 or tanka because it really is 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.980
 tenacious turned his back and half 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.679
 enemy skills just don't get on 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.329
 you 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.280
 moreover even if some kind of strong 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.750
 how much will you back in response you 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.090
 throwing needles that is also very 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.079
 beautiful, make sure you make 3 columns 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.209
 try to play it 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.209
