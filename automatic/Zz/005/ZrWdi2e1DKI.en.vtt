00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.010 
idea what's going on this block is going
to<00:01:49.200> sit<00:01:49.409> between<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.549> hitch<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.030> van<00:01:51.720> and

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
to sit between the hitch and the van and

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.109 
to sit between the hitch and the van and
be<00:01:52.290> held<00:01:52.470> together<00:01:52.619> with<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.340> bolt<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
be held together with the bolt and the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.850 
be held together with the bolt and the
conical<00:01:54.149> tooth<00:01:54.659> washer<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.439> teeth<00:01:55.649> will

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
conical tooth washer and the teeth will

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.560 
conical tooth washer and the teeth will
always<00:01:56.100> go<00:01:56.250> towards<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.670> hitch<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.479> we'll

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
always go towards the hitch so we'll

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.910 
always go towards the hitch so we'll
take<00:01:57.750> our<00:01:57.869> hitch<00:01:58.020> we'll<00:01:58.350> slide<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.710> over<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
take our hitch we'll slide it over the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.940 
take our hitch we'll slide it over the
exhaust<00:01:59.219> first<00:01:59.579> hold<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.030> side<00:02:00.299> up<00:02:00.950> we'll

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
exhaust first hold that side up we'll

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.709 
exhaust first hold that side up we'll
start<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.310> Hardware<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.240> driver<00:02:03.630> side

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
start to Hardware on the driver side

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.080 
start to Hardware on the driver side
first

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
first

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.459 
first
okay<00:02:06.090> we're<00:02:06.450> use<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> bolt<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.079> hold<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.320> hitch

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
okay we're use a bolt to hold the hitch

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.260 
okay we're use a bolt to hold the hitch
up<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:07.770> now<00:02:07.890> we'll<00:02:08.729> go<00:02:08.849> ahead<00:02:08.910> with<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.179> other

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
up for now we'll go ahead with the other

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.290 
up for now we'll go ahead with the other
two<00:02:09.450> remaining<00:02:09.720> holes<00:02:10.020> install<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.069> spacers

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
two remaining holes install the spacers

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.610 
two remaining holes install the spacers
the<00:02:12.330> hardware<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.870> come<00:02:13.020> back<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.320> install<00:02:13.560> a

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
the hardware and come back and install a

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:30.309 
the hardware and come back and install a
spacer<00:02:14.070> for<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:14.460> site

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.589

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
come back to our middle Bolton's put our

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.449 
come back to our middle Bolton's put our
spacer<00:02:34.019> in<00:02:34.170> alright<00:02:34.920> now<00:02:35.040> we're<00:02:35.159> go<00:02:35.250> ahead<00:02:35.370> and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
repeat the same process back over on the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.199 
repeat the same process back over on the
passenger<00:02:37.739> side<00:02:37.890> okay<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.579> sometimes<00:02:39.060> you

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
passenger side okay and sometimes you

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.030 
passenger side okay and sometimes you
run<00:02:39.329> into<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.510> situation<00:02:39.540> where<00:02:40.200> for<00:02:40.469> some

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
run into a situation where for some

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.589 
run into a situation where for some
reason<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.609> hitch<00:02:41.730> doesn't<00:02:42.090> reach<00:02:42.209> all<00:02:42.390> the

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
reason the hitch doesn't reach all the

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.240 
reason the hitch doesn't reach all the
way<00:02:42.659> across<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.170> other<00:02:43.319> side<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:44.010> can

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
way across the other side this can

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.830 
way across the other side this can
sometimes<00:02:44.489> happens<00:02:45.030> in<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.239> bolts<00:02:45.569> going

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
sometimes happens in the bolts going

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.539 
sometimes happens in the bolts going
towards<00:02:46.139> the<00:02:46.590> front<00:02:46.799> of<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.069> van

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
towards the front of the van

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.369 
towards the front of the van
we're<00:02:47.879> just<00:02:48.000> use<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.209> long<00:02:48.450> pry<00:02:48.930> bar<00:02:49.170> but<00:02:49.349> you

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
we're just use a long pry bar but you

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.649 
we're just use a long pry bar but you
can<00:02:49.560> use<00:02:49.680> anything<00:02:50.609> in<00:02:50.730> pry<00:02:51.000> against<00:02:51.299> just

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
can use anything in pry against just

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.559 
can use anything in pry against just
move<00:02:52.349> it<00:02:52.439> over<00:02:52.530> if<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.799> see<00:02:53.010> how<00:02:53.269> easy<00:02:54.269> it<00:02:54.480> is

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
move it over if you see how easy it is

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.360 
move it over if you see how easy it is
to<00:02:54.719> move<00:02:55.939> we're<00:02:56.939> not<00:02:57.060> distorting<00:02:58.219> anything<00:02:59.219> in
