00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.019
 and 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.110
 good afternoon, I'm glad to find you at 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.539
 home do you think that one day it will end 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.860
 all the suffering that there is in the world 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.650
 how could it be possible to me do not talk to me 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.230
 instead of talking to me that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.890
 it loses its time because they do not go and they do 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.250
 community work to do hospitals 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.320
 give food to the poor I understand that a 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.720
 we also help others 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.690
 people in a practical way have it 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.750
 sure only that ends some time 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.270
 to share what the Bible says and 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.440
 what kind of works do I ever have 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.390
 seen please allow me a few minutes 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.760
 and with an example from the bible I 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.820
 like to answer it's about a 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.410
 Servant of God called Dorcas she us 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.979
 will give the answer it seems good 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.600
 It's fine but fast that I have fans for 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.000
 Here was a woman who leaves us all 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.030
 an example in terms of doing many 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.340
 good works she lived in the time of 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 Apostle Peter and his kindness was very great 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.290
 for all but do not say I look 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.390
 what it says facts 9 36 and 39 but in 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.070
 jope dÃ­az certain disciple by name 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.689
 Saudi that translated means dorcas 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.210
 is abounding in good deeds and in such 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.700
 more of mercy that made note to 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.090
 you the final part of what good 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.640
 facts or gifts did she good the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.070
 bible does not mention it but we are 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.750
 sure that she was like that how much we 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.000
 would hurt the death of someone who has 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.110
 done so much good by others 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.810
 verses 37 and 38 but in those days 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.700
 happened that he fell ill and died so that 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.729
 they praised him and put her in a room 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.369
 from above now well as leader was 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.280
 close to job when the disciples 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.590
 they heard that Pedro was in this city 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.810
 with two males to beg for 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.350
 please do not hesitate to come to where 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.900
 we are aware that they were hurt by the death of 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.550
 that Christian so much that they wanted the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.910
 I support the consolation of one of the 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.850
 apostles Peter would not otherwise have 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.520
 requested his presence by the way 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.950
 Neither was Pedro so close 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.690
 It was about 18 kilometers from the place 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.440
 where was the dead body of 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.150
 dorcas jope what was the reward for 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.400
 this woman as good as it is possible 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.090
 to be dedicated in his life when he was 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:52.019
 live let's see the following verses if 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.660
 you want until 40 before that Pedro 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.050
 he got up and went with them and when he arrived 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.060
 they took him to the upper room and 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.160
 all the widows were presented 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.989
 crying and displaying many clothes 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.090
 dress interiors and exteriors that 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.090
 Deduce I used to do while I was with 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.690
 them but Pedro made everyone go out and 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.580
 bending knees prayed and turning 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.000
 towards the body said 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.200
 tabitha get up she opened her eyes 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.940
 reaching to see Pedro joined 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.320
 I rise like that is 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.300
 this is the first time that 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.450
 mentioned in the bible that an apostle of 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.590
 jesus resurrects goes to someone that allowed 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.820
 that much more will accept the message 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.190
 surely the resurrection of this 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.800
 Christian who was possibly engaged in 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.340
 making garments for widows was 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.440
 something incredible, as shown by the 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.270
 story said that they cried what 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.520
 indicated that the truth hurt them that 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.520
 Dore who would have died but not 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.220
 they had this resurrection 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.110
 so surely he was highly appreciated 2k 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.239
 for his spirituality but also 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.940
 because it helped in a practical way the 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.460
 others we and all do well in 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.190
 imitate it 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.980
 that's why the witnesses of jehova we support 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.990
 to brothers and other people so 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.920
 We do it in a very general way 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:18.980

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:24.020

 well I have to go but I have 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.690
 I confess that I liked the explanation 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.520
