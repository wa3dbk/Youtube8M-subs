00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
that will pretty much overclock it I

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.440 
that will pretty much overclock it I
mean<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:36.990> fast<00:01:37.290> without<00:01:37.650> even<00:01:38.189> any

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
mean it is fast without even any

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.899 
mean it is fast without even any
overclocking<00:01:39.890> certainly<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.670> best

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
overclocking certainly this is the best

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.030 
overclocking certainly this is the best
problem<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:43.079> your<00:01:43.409> t-mobile

using it as a shortcut yeah and if you
try<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.070> do<00:02:02.310> multi<00:02:02.670> window<00:02:02.820> you'll<00:02:03.180> get<00:02:03.390> a

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
try to do multi window you'll get a

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.600 
try to do multi window you'll get a
force<00:02:03.840> close<00:02:03.990> for<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.680> don't<00:02:04.920> try<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.460> um

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
force close for so don't try it but um

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.999 
force close for so don't try it but um
it<00:02:05.820> should<00:02:05.990> eventually<00:02:06.990> get<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.500> working

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
it should eventually get it working

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.190 
it should eventually get it working
sometime<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:09.060> don't<00:02:09.450> know<00:02:09.539> I'm<00:02:09.840> not<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200
