then I give it two cuts now a lot of

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.509 
then I give it two cuts now a lot of
people<00:02:37.900> argue<00:02:38.080> against<00:02:38.620> using<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.010> s<00:02:39.250> as<00:02:39.459> a

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
people argue against using this s as a

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.490 
people argue against using this s as a
control<00:02:40.329> they<00:02:40.540> say<00:02:40.720> it's<00:02:40.840> too<00:02:41.019> simple<00:02:41.349> it's

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
control they say it's too simple it's

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.699 
control they say it's too simple it's
too<00:02:41.620> obvious<00:02:43.049> you<00:02:44.049> know<00:02:44.170> I<00:02:44.200> disagree<00:02:44.530> with

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
too obvious you know I disagree with

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.500 
too obvious you know I disagree with
that<00:02:44.860> because<00:02:45.099> you<00:02:46.060> know<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.209> can<00:02:46.360> always

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
that because you know you can always

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.180 
that because you know you can always
throw<00:02:46.720> in<00:02:46.810> something<00:02:47.140> extra<00:02:47.470> after<00:02:48.099> the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
throw in something extra after the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.580 
throw in something extra after the
double<00:02:48.489> undercut<00:02:48.879> so<00:02:49.450> whenever<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:49.900> do<00:02:50.049> this<00:02:50.349> I

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
double undercut so whenever I do this I

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.009 
double undercut so whenever I do this I
do<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:51.069> double<00:02:51.340> undercut<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:51.910> then<00:02:52.690> maybe

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
do the double undercut and then maybe

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.770 
do the double undercut and then maybe
I'll<00:02:53.200> throw<00:02:53.379> in<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.859> fall<00:02:54.579> shuffle<00:02:55.000> like<00:02:55.660> the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
I'll throw in a fall shuffle like the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.170 
I'll throw in a fall shuffle like the
Falls<00:02:55.989> Hindu<00:02:56.290> shuffle<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.640> can<00:02:57.790> check<00:02:58.150> a

video tutorial for that so yeah I would
agree<00:03:02.379> in<00:03:02.709> saying<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:03.069> you<00:03:03.099> should<00:03:03.310> never

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
agree in saying that you should never

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.140 
agree in saying that you should never
just<00:03:03.910> do<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.060> double<00:03:04.239> undercut<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:04.959> then<00:03:06.150> act

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
like they're quite lost that might be a

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.830 
like they're quite lost that might be a
little<00:03:09.129> suspicious<00:03:09.549> but<00:03:10.390> do<00:03:10.569> it<00:03:10.599> under

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
little suspicious but do it under

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.080 
little suspicious but do it under
undercut<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.650> get<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.099> card<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.549> top<00:03:12.579> and

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.500 
false shuffle right so you don't want to
do<00:03:27.340> just<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.609> double<00:03:27.880> undercut<00:03:28.150> that's<00:03:28.299> true

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
do just the double undercut that's true

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.930 
do just the double undercut that's true
but<00:03:28.690> it's<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.840> great<00:03:29.049> way<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.230> get<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.709> top<00:03:30.430> to

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
but it's a great way to get the top to

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.330 
but it's a great way to get the top to
get<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.209> card<00:03:31.419> to<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.599> top<00:03:31.630> initially<00:03:32.340> so

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
get the card to the top initially so

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.099 
get the card to the top initially so
that's<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.579> double<00:03:33.849> undercut<00:03:34.180> has<00:03:34.389> a<00:03:34.690> control

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
that's the double undercut has a control

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.979 
that's the double undercut has a control
let's<00:03:36.010> talk<00:03:36.310> about<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:37.090> double<00:03:37.419> undercut<00:03:37.810> has

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
let's talk about the double undercut has

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.440 
let's talk about the double undercut has
a<00:03:38.440> false<00:03:38.919> cut<00:03:39.160> so<00:03:39.700> what<00:03:39.849> that<00:03:39.940> looks<00:03:40.000> like<00:03:40.239> is

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
a false cut so what that looks like is

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.289 
a false cut so what that looks like is
this<00:03:42.780> okay<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:44.799> not<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.370> card<00:03:45.730> at<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.090> deck

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
this okay so not a card at the deck

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.670 
this okay so not a card at the deck
change<00:03:46.599> position<00:03:47.049> there<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.260> I'll<00:03:47.470> do<00:03:47.590> it

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
change position there and I'll do it

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.740 
change position there and I'll do it
once<00:03:47.799> more<00:03:50.459> well<00:03:51.459> that<00:03:52.120> was<00:03:52.239> a<00:03:52.450> little

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
once more well that was a little

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.300 
once more well that was a little
hesitation<00:03:53.079> there<00:03:53.349> so<00:03:53.680> this<00:03:53.829> is<00:03:53.919> actually<00:03:54.250> a

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
hesitation there so this is actually a

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.390 
hesitation there so this is actually a
triple<00:03:55.269> cut<00:03:55.569> right<00:03:55.840> so<00:03:56.680> all<00:03:56.829> you're<00:03:56.980> doing<00:03:57.220> is

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
triple cut right so all you're doing is

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.050 
triple cut right so all you're doing is
undercutting<00:03:57.940> about<00:03:58.180> a<00:03:58.209> third<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:58.599> the<00:03:58.690> deck

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
undercutting about a third of the deck

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.960 
undercutting about a third of the deck
and<00:04:01.060> as<00:04:01.299> you<00:04:01.870> square<00:04:02.349> this<00:04:02.530> pack<00:04:02.769> of<00:04:02.919> up<00:04:03.040> you're

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
and as you square this pack of up you're

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.940 
and as you square this pack of up you're
actually<00:04:04.090> getting<00:04:04.389> a<00:04:04.599> break<00:04:04.930> underneath<00:04:05.769> it

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
actually getting a break underneath it

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.550 
actually getting a break underneath it
and<00:04:06.040> that's<00:04:06.220> easy<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.579> do<00:04:06.730> because<00:04:07.209> it's<00:04:08.169> it's

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
and that's easy to do because it's it's

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.250 
and that's easy to do because it's it's
a<00:04:08.739> angle<00:04:09.340> drop<00:04:09.549> right<00:04:09.849> so<00:04:10.629> as<00:04:10.780> you<00:04:10.930> square<00:04:11.169> up

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
a angle drop right so as you square up

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.289 
a angle drop right so as you square up
the<00:04:11.379> deck<00:04:11.620> all<00:04:12.400> you<00:04:12.699> have<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:12.879> do<00:04:13.000> is<00:04:13.120> stick

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
the deck all you have to do is stick

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:14.819 
the deck all you have to do is stick
your<00:04:13.419> pinky<00:04:13.599> between<00:04:14.079> those<00:04:14.199> packets<00:04:14.590> there

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
your pinky between those packets there

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.529 
your pinky between those packets there
and<00:04:15.069> as<00:04:15.220> you<00:04:15.250> square<00:04:15.609> up<00:04:15.639> you<00:04:15.819> can<00:04:15.970> get<00:04:16.120> a<00:04:16.150> pinky

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
and as you square up you can get a pinky

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.890 
and as you square up you can get a pinky
break<00:04:16.750> between<00:04:17.680> them<00:04:18.070> okay<00:04:18.910> then<00:04:19.570> you

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
break between them okay then you

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.539 
break between them okay then you
transfer<00:04:20.320> that<00:04:20.349> pinky<00:04:20.709> break<00:04:20.889> to<00:04:21.220> your<00:04:21.310> thumb

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
transfer that pinky break to your thumb

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.740 
transfer that pinky break to your thumb
and<00:04:22.409> then<00:04:23.409> you<00:04:23.620> undercut

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
and then you undercut

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.020 
and then you undercut
half<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.230> packets<00:04:25.590> remaining<00:04:26.100> below<00:04:26.820> the

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
half the packets remaining below the

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.360 
half the packets remaining below the
below<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.660> break<00:04:27.960> and<00:04:28.350> then<00:04:28.860> you<00:04:28.950> undercut

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
below the break and then you undercut

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.560 
below the break and then you undercut
the<00:04:29.490> remaining<00:04:29.880> Christ<00:04:30.060> below<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.390> break

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
the remaining Christ below the break

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.680 
the remaining Christ below the break
just<00:04:30.840> like<00:04:31.320> that<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:31.800> rhythm<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:33.390> rhythm<00:04:33.540> for

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
just like that and rhythm the rhythm for

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.800 
just like that and rhythm the rhythm for
this<00:04:33.930> is<00:04:34.110> cut<00:04:34.890> one<00:04:35.100> pause<00:04:36.030> for<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.330> second<00:04:36.720> and

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
this is cut one pause for a second and

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.860 
this is cut one pause for a second and
then<00:04:37.020> cut<00:04:37.260> to<00:04:37.470> in<00:04:37.590> quick<00:04:37.800> succession<00:04:38.720> okay

and<00:05:06.810> now<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:09.060> deck<00:05:09.270> has<00:05:09.540> maintained<00:05:10.320> its

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
and now the deck has maintained its

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.020 
and now the deck has maintained its
order<00:05:10.710> that's<00:05:10.920> that's<00:05:11.280> a<00:05:11.340> triple<00:05:11.550> cut<00:05:11.790> and

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
order that's that's a triple cut and

keep in mind you don't have to do just

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.900 
keep in mind you don't have to do just
three<00:05:13.710> undercuts<00:05:14.190> you<00:05:14.310> can<00:05:14.460> do<00:05:14.520> as<00:05:14.640> many<00:05:14.850> as

you want so you could do you know one
two<00:05:19.260> three<00:05:20.220> four<00:05:20.820> you<00:05:21.030> can<00:05:21.390> do<00:05:21.480> as<00:05:21.570> many<00:05:21.750> cuts

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
two three four you can do as many cuts

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.340 
two three four you can do as many cuts
as<00:05:22.230> long<00:05:22.440> as<00:05:22.710> you<00:05:23.250> finish<00:05:23.730> at<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.360> break<00:05:24.570> okay

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
as long as you finish at the break okay

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.590 
as long as you finish at the break okay
so<00:05:25.800> I<00:05:25.830> do<00:05:26.100> one<00:05:26.370> undercut<00:05:26.760> keep<00:05:27.000> a<00:05:27.120> break<00:05:27.330> there

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
so I do one undercut keep a break there

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.530 
so I do one undercut keep a break there
now<00:05:28.169> I<00:05:28.200> can<00:05:28.500> use<00:05:28.740> as<00:05:29.490> many<00:05:29.640> cuts<00:05:29.910> as<00:05:30.060> I<00:05:30.150> want<00:05:30.419> to

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
now I can use as many cuts as I want to

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.180 
now I can use as many cuts as I want to
deposit<00:05:30.810> all<00:05:31.200> the<00:05:31.320> rest<00:05:31.500> of<00:05:31.620> these<00:05:31.710> cards<00:05:32.040> on

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
deposit all the rest of these cards on

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.000 
deposit all the rest of these cards on
top<00:05:32.460> of<00:05:32.669> this<00:05:32.850> initial<00:05:33.660> bottom<00:05:33.930> packet<00:05:34.140> right

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
top of this initial bottom packet right

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.219 
top of this initial bottom packet right
so<00:05:35.250> I<00:05:35.280> could<00:05:35.490> do<00:05:35.640> very<00:05:35.940> tiny<00:05:36.270> packets<00:05:37.400> and<00:05:39.229> as

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
so I could do very tiny packets and as

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.100 
so I could do very tiny packets and as
long<00:05:40.470> as<00:05:40.500> I<00:05:40.740> finish<00:05:41.160> at<00:05:41.370> the<00:05:41.550> break<00:05:41.930> the<00:05:42.930> order

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
long as I finish at the break the order

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.810 
long as I finish at the break the order
of<00:05:43.290> the<00:05:43.380> deck<00:05:43.590> is<00:05:43.770> going<00:05:43.979> to<00:05:44.070> be<00:05:44.160> maintained<00:05:44.580> so

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
of the deck is going to be maintained so

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.620 
of the deck is going to be maintained so
that<00:05:45.720> it's<00:05:46.080> a<00:05:46.140> really<00:05:46.350> nice<00:05:46.470> false<00:05:46.740> cut<00:05:46.979> and

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
that it's a really nice false cut and

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.790 
that it's a really nice false cut and
the<00:05:48.630> last<00:05:48.810> thing<00:05:48.990> to<00:05:49.080> talk<00:05:49.229> about<00:05:49.260> is<00:05:49.590> how<00:05:49.740> to

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
the last thing to talk about is how to

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.830 
the last thing to talk about is how to
use<00:05:50.010> this<00:05:50.190> to<00:05:50.580> displace<00:05:51.090> a<00:05:51.120> number<00:05:51.510> of<00:05:51.570> cards

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
use this to displace a number of cards

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.690 
use this to displace a number of cards
from<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:52.050> top<00:05:52.229> to<00:05:52.380> the<00:05:52.410> bottom<00:05:52.500> or<00:05:52.950> from<00:05:53.490> the

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
from the top to the bottom or from the

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.520 
from the top to the bottom or from the
bottom<00:05:53.820> to<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.180> top<00:05:54.210> and<00:05:54.720> what<00:05:55.140> I<00:05:55.200> mean<00:05:55.380> by

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
bottom to the top and what I mean by

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.440 
bottom to the top and what I mean by
that<00:05:55.560> is<00:05:55.860> let's<00:05:56.130> say<00:05:56.310> you<00:05:56.370> have<00:05:56.700> a<00:05:57.000> selected

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
that is let's say you have a selected

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.659 
that is let's say you have a selected
cards<00:05:57.720> at<00:05:57.810> the<00:05:57.870> top<00:05:58.080> of<00:05:58.200> the<00:05:58.290> deck<00:05:58.470> or<00:05:59.310> you<00:05:59.490> want

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
cards at the top of the deck or you want

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.640 
cards at the top of the deck or you want
it<00:05:59.790> on<00:05:59.850> the<00:05:59.910> bottom<00:06:00.300> of<00:06:00.390> the<00:06:00.510> deck<00:06:00.690> so<00:06:01.440> you<00:06:01.530> can

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
it on the bottom of the deck so you can

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.409 
it on the bottom of the deck so you can
just<00:06:01.800> you<00:06:02.130> can<00:06:02.250> use<00:06:02.400> a<00:06:02.430> double<00:06:02.640> undercut<00:06:03.150> to<00:06:03.270> do

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
just you can use a double undercut to do

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.090 
just you can use a double undercut to do
this<00:06:03.570> all<00:06:04.110> you<00:06:04.320> have<00:06:04.440> to<00:06:04.500> do<00:06:04.590> is<00:06:04.680> get<00:06:04.800> the<00:06:04.890> break

this all you have to do is get the break

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.050 
this all you have to do is get the break
underneath<00:06:05.910> the<00:06:06.030> top<00:06:06.180> card<00:06:07.010> okay<00:06:08.010> then<00:06:08.790> what

you're going to do is undercut a number
of<00:06:11.130> cards<00:06:12.590> then<00:06:13.590> square<00:06:14.070> up<00:06:15.470> maintaining<00:06:16.470> that

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
of cards then square up maintaining that

you're going to do something a little

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.740 
you're going to do something a little
bit<00:06:46.000> differently<00:06:46.300> this<00:06:46.450> time<00:06:46.720> now<00:06:48.750> you're
