hello<00:00:08.470> students<00:00:08.890> today<00:00:09.010> I<00:00:09.280> will<00:00:09.490> be<00:00:09.610> starting

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 
hello students today I will be starting

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.390 
hello students today I will be starting
with<00:00:10.090> a<00:00:10.240> new<00:00:10.510> chapter<00:00:10.840> that<00:00:11.080> is<00:00:11.400> biodiversity

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
with a new chapter that is biodiversity

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:20.300 
with a new chapter that is biodiversity
and<00:00:12.610> conservation<00:00:12.880> so<00:00:13.600> let's<00:00:13.780> start<00:00:14.080> with<00:00:14.290> it

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:30.760 

you

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.189 

you

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.900 

biodiversity<00:00:34.199> it<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.190> occurrence<00:00:35.670> of

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
biodiversity it is occurrence of

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.930 
biodiversity it is occurrence of
different<00:00:36.480> types<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:37.110> gene<00:00:37.530> gene<00:00:38.489> pools

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
different types of gene gene pools

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.939 
different types of gene gene pools

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.450 
different types of species habitat

ecosystem biome over the Earth's surface

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.520 
ecosystem biome over the Earth's surface
so<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:47.850> saw<00:00:48.089> a<00:00:48.120> variation<00:00:49.110> F<00:00:49.290> with

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
so you just saw a variation F with

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.969 
so you just saw a variation F with
respect<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.339> species<00:00:50.870> by<00:00:51.870> owns<00:00:52.170> G's<00:00:52.680> this

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:52.979 
respect to the species by owns G's this

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.240 
respect to the species by owns G's this
is<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:53.430> going<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.000> constitute<00:00:55.250> biodiversity

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
is all going to constitute biodiversity

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.579 
is all going to constitute biodiversity
so<00:00:56.460> let's<00:00:56.640> write<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.030> definition<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.839> this

that a great deal of biodiversity it is

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.330 
that a great deal of biodiversity it is
