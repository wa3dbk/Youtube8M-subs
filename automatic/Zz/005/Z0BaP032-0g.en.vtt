warfare<00:01:13.660> 3<00:01:13.810> for<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.140> pc<00:01:14.530> i<00:01:14.560> guess<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:15.009> reason

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
warfare 3 for the pc i guess the reason

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.889 
warfare 3 for the pc i guess the reason
why<00:01:15.369> they<00:01:15.520> did<00:01:15.700> this<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:15.970> because<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.479> pc

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
why they did this is because the pc

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.080 
why they did this is because the pc
sales<00:01:17.170> of<00:01:17.440> modern<00:01:17.649> warfare<00:01:17.800> 3<00:01:17.979> we're<00:01:18.820> kind<00:01:19.000> of

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
sales of modern warfare 3 we're kind of

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.520 
sales of modern warfare 3 we're kind of
lacking<00:01:19.330> and<00:01:19.690> so<00:01:19.780> they<00:01:19.899> wanted<00:01:20.140> kind<00:01:20.380> of<00:01:20.440> to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
lacking and so they wanted kind of to

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.990 
lacking and so they wanted kind of to
make<00:01:20.649> a<00:01:20.709> demo<00:01:21.069> version<00:01:21.220> of<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.670> game<00:01:21.789> so

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
make a demo version of the game so

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.249 
make a demo version of the game so
people<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.330> try<00:01:22.509> it<00:01:22.569> out<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:22.780> if<00:01:22.959> they<00:01:23.020> really

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
people to try it out and if they really

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.590 
people to try it out and if they really
like<00:01:23.530> mono<00:01:23.770> or<00:01:23.920> 43<00:01:24.190> on<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.340> pc<00:01:24.670> maybe<00:01:25.330> they

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
like mono or 43 on the pc maybe they

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.240 
like mono or 43 on the pc maybe they
would<00:01:25.780> buy<00:01:26.050> it<00:01:26.110> in<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.470> end<00:01:26.649> so<00:01:26.950> i<00:01:26.979> guess

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
would buy it in the end so i guess

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.499 
would buy it in the end so i guess
that's<00:01:27.459> the<00:01:27.550> reason<00:01:27.850> why<00:01:27.880> just<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.360> increase

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
that's the reason why just to increase

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.419 
that's the reason why just to increase
sales<00:01:28.899> and<00:01:29.170> that<00:01:29.319> you<00:01:29.470> know<00:01:29.590> there<00:01:30.069> is<00:01:30.100> nothing

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
sales and that you know there is nothing

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:31.919 
sales and that you know there is nothing
to<00:01:30.580> lose<00:01:30.729> for<00:01:30.970> me<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.209> so<00:01:31.330> that's<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.660> reason

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
to lose for me and so that's the reason

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.540 
to lose for me and so that's the reason
why<00:01:31.959> i<00:01:32.050> just<00:01:32.319> downloaded<00:01:32.530> it<00:01:32.979> i<00:01:33.069> have<00:01:33.190> a<00:01:33.250> steam

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
think those are you know a really great

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.419 
think those are you know a really great
pair<00:02:03.880> against<00:02:04.780> like<00:02:04.959> the<00:02:05.170> xbox<00:02:05.619> 360<00:02:06.250> on<00:02:06.280> the

ps3 that's like another pair but the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.380 
ps3 that's like another pair but the
reason<00:02:08.170> why<00:02:08.440> they're<00:02:08.619> similar<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:09.640> because

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.759 
because everybody pretty much on the pc
is<00:03:15.599> pretty<00:03:16.599> good<00:03:16.780> they're<00:03:16.930> really<00:03:17.230> avid<00:03:17.620> and

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
is pretty good they're really avid and

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:18.990 
is pretty good they're really avid and
competitive<00:03:18.280> in<00:03:18.400> their<00:03:18.549> game<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.910> that's

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
competitive in their game and that's

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.720 
competitive in their game and that's
what<00:03:19.299> i<00:03:19.329> like<00:03:19.569> about<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.319> pc<00:03:20.709> a<00:03:20.739> lot<00:03:21.010> like<00:03:21.610> i

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
what i like about the pc a lot like i

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.160 
what i like about the pc a lot like i
said<00:03:21.910> before<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.510> similarities<00:03:23.049> between

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
said before to the similarities between

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.140 
said before to the similarities between
the<00:03:23.380> wii<00:03:23.500> on<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.739> pc<00:03:24.160> is<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.700> controls

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
the wii on the pc is that the controls

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.690 
the wii on the pc is that the controls
are<00:03:25.390> very<00:03:25.599> similar<00:03:25.959> they<00:03:26.829> they<00:03:27.040> feel<00:03:27.340> great

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
are very similar they they feel great

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.759 
are very similar they they feel great
it's<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.480> lot<00:03:28.660> you<00:03:28.780> know<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:28.930> lot<00:03:29.110> more<00:03:29.170> smoother

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
it's a lot you know a lot more smoother

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.080 
it's a lot you know a lot more smoother
obviously<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.250> mouse<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.430> keyboard<00:03:30.700> is<00:03:31.060> the

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
obviously the mouse and keyboard is the

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.120 
obviously the mouse and keyboard is the
best<00:03:31.390> set<00:03:31.599> up<00:03:31.750> for<00:03:32.109> our<00:03:32.319> first<00:03:32.590> person<00:03:32.829> shooter

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
best set up for our first person shooter

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.590 
best set up for our first person shooter
but<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.430> wiimote<00:03:33.760> is<00:03:33.880> actually<00:03:34.209> pretty<00:03:34.389> good

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
but the wiimote is actually pretty good

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.199 
but the wiimote is actually pretty good
as<00:03:34.720> well<00:03:34.750> i<00:03:35.170> can<00:03:35.650> never<00:03:35.859> really<00:03:36.190> get<00:03:36.519> used<00:03:36.910> to

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
as well i can never really get used to

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.509 
as well i can never really get used to
dual<00:03:37.840> analog<00:03:38.049> or<00:03:38.470> thumb<00:03:38.680> stick<00:03:38.920> controls<00:03:39.310> and

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
dual analog or thumb stick controls and

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.160 
dual analog or thumb stick controls and
so<00:03:39.609> that's<00:03:39.760> why<00:03:39.910> i<00:03:39.940> think<00:03:40.209> those<00:03:40.989> are<00:03:41.019> the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
so that's why i think those are the

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.710 
so that's why i think those are the
strengths<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.829> pc<00:03:42.160> and<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.340> wii<00:03:42.489> but<00:03:43.480> you

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
strengths of the pc and the wii but you

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.300 
strengths of the pc and the wii but you
know<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.019> difference<00:03:44.380> is<00:03:44.590> well<00:03:45.130> not<00:03:45.250> really

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
know the difference is well not really

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.520 
know the difference is well not really
differences<00:03:45.970> but<00:03:46.090> like<00:03:46.269> disadvantages<00:03:47.200> about

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
differences but like disadvantages about

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.170 
differences but like disadvantages about
these<00:03:47.739> two<00:03:47.920> systems<00:03:48.130> i<00:03:48.489> feel<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:48.880> they<00:03:49.150> are

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
these two systems i feel that they are

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.629 
these two systems i feel that they are
neglected<00:03:50.109> there<00:03:50.739> aren't<00:03:50.950> you<00:03:51.400> know<00:03:51.519> the

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
neglected there aren't you know the

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.729 
neglected there aren't you know the
versions<00:03:51.970> of<00:03:52.060> these<00:03:52.180> games<00:03:52.450> aren't<00:03:52.750> as<00:03:52.989> cared

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
versions of these games aren't as cared

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.039 
versions of these games aren't as cared
for<00:03:54.010> as<00:03:54.160> much<00:03:54.370> as<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:54.670> xbox<00:03:55.090> 360<00:03:55.630> on<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.780> ps3

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
for as much as the xbox 360 on the ps3

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.680 
for as much as the xbox 360 on the ps3

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
versions because you know I guess

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.140 
versions because you know I guess
activation<00:03:59.290> just<00:03:59.530> cares<00:03:59.769> about<00:03:59.859> the<00:04:00.579> ps3<00:04:00.790> and

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
activation just cares about the ps3 and

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.180 
activation just cares about the ps3 and
xbox<00:04:01.630> a<00:04:01.780> lot<00:04:01.959> more<00:04:02.230> it's<00:04:02.709> kind<00:04:02.859> of<00:04:02.889> unfortunate
