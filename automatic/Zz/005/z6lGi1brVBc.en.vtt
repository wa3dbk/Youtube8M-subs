the moment I'll show the fault in

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.000 
the moment I'll show the fault in
seconds<00:00:35.000> on<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.089> screen<00:00:37.190> yeah<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.699> see

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
seconds on the screen yeah so see

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.270 
seconds on the screen yeah so see
graphics<00:00:41.010> appear<00:00:41.210> okay<00:00:44.239> yeah<00:00:45.289> but<00:00:46.289> when<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:46.980> got

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
graphics appear okay yeah but when I got

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.479 
graphics appear okay yeah but when I got
it<00:00:47.570> I'll<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:48.629> fix<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.320> actual<00:00:50.070> say<00:00:50.820> fix

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
it I'll just fix this actual say fix

it I'll just fix this actual say fix
different<00:00:53.489> Stephen<00:00:54.360> gets<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> frame<00:00:55.079> I

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
different Stephen gets on the frame I

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.760 
different Stephen gets on the frame I
should<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:57.899> able<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.079> see<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.379> there<00:00:58.739> just

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
should be able to see that there just

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.560 
should be able to see that there just
try<00:00:59.309> out<00:01:00.859> yes

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
try out yes

try out yes
you<00:01:03.570> see<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:03.930> we're<00:01:04.500> doing<00:01:05.399> a<00:01:05.460> green<00:01:05.670> screen

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
you see this we're doing a green screen

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.420 
you see this we're doing a green screen
full<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.140> noise<00:01:07.410> and<00:01:07.830> basically<00:01:08.160> anything

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
full of noise and basically anything

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.020 
full of noise and basically anything
black<00:01:08.789> became<00:01:09.180> green<00:01:10.070> well<00:01:11.070> as<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.759> really

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
black became green well as you really

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.420 
black became green well as you really
simple<00:01:12.300> to<00:01:12.360> fix<00:01:13.610> loose<00:01:14.610> LVDS<00:01:15.179> cable<00:01:15.570> again

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
simple to fix loose LVDS cable again

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.700 
simple to fix loose LVDS cable again
there's<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> little<00:01:17.640> loose<00:01:18.110> press<00:01:19.110> down<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.560> it

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
there's a little loose press down on it

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.270 
there's a little loose press down on it
it's<00:01:20.220> alright<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.590> I'm<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:22.979> gonna<00:01:23.100> do

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
it's alright so I just I'm just gonna do

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.679 
it's alright so I just I'm just gonna do
that<00:01:23.400> end<00:01:23.610> tight<00:01:23.850> enough<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.390> put<00:01:24.659> a

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
that end tight enough of it and put a

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.510 
that end tight enough of it and put a
little<00:01:25.200> shim<00:01:25.590> under<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> hold<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.400> place

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
little shim under it to hold it in place

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.819 
little shim under it to hold it in place
because<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:27.600> looks<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:28.049> there<00:01:28.770> were

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
because it looks like there were

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.170 
because it looks like there were
supposed<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.220> some<00:01:29.400> hate<00:01:29.610> here<00:01:29.880> holding

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
supposed to be some hate here holding

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.420 
supposed to be some hate here holding
this<00:01:30.299> down<00:01:30.619> but<00:01:31.619> they<00:01:31.740> haven't<00:01:31.950> put<00:01:32.070> any<00:01:32.220> there

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
this down but they haven't put any there

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.640 
this down but they haven't put any there
which<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.880> should<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:34.850> LED<00:01:35.850> TVs<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.750> 32<00:01:37.470> inch

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
which I should have LED TVs this 32 inch

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.310 
which I should have LED TVs this 32 inch
model<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.060> other<00:01:39.060> interesting<00:01:39.659> but<00:01:40.110> quite

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
model and other interesting but quite

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.960 
model and other interesting but quite
similar<00:01:40.649> to<00:01:40.710> LCD<00:01:41.250> well<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> panel

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
similar to LCD well the panel

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.580 
similar to LCD well the panel
technologies<00:01:42.479> basically<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.899> saying<00:01:43.049> they

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
technologies basically is saying they

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.770 
technologies basically is saying they
serve<00:01:43.829> an<00:01:43.979> LCD<00:01:44.310> panel<00:01:44.790> because<00:01:45.360> they're<00:01:45.479> LED

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
serve an LCD panel because they're LED

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.539 
serve an LCD panel because they're LED
backlit<00:01:46.170> LCD<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.680> instead<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.009> fluorescently

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
backlit LCD is instead of fluorescently

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.410 
backlit LCD is instead of fluorescently
Bakula<00:01:47.970> LCDs<00:01:48.979> but<00:01:49.979> instead<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.670> normal<00:01:51.090> high

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
Bakula LCDs but instead of a normal high

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.359 
Bakula LCDs but instead of a normal high
voltage<00:01:51.780> inverter<00:01:51.930> they<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.890> backlight

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
voltage inverter they have a backlight

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.929 
voltage inverter they have a backlight
driver<00:01:53.899> which<00:01:54.899> takes<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:56.219> one<00:01:56.549> this

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
driver which takes on this one this

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.910 
driver which takes on this one this
probably<00:01:57.270> 24<00:01:57.630> volt

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
probably 24 volt

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.240 
probably 24 volt
I<00:01:58.979> can't<00:01:59.670> them<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.969> can't<00:02:00.630> see<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.320> sure<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:02.130> it

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
I can't them I can't see for sure but it

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.480 
I can't them I can't see for sure but it
usually<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.759> 24<00:02:03.149> volt<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:04.560> converts<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.280> to

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
usually is 24 volt and it converts it to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.380 
usually is 24 volt and it converts it to
the<00:02:05.969> high<00:02:06.180> voltage<00:02:06.390> for<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.140> LED<00:02:08.390> backlights

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the high voltage for the LED backlights

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.810 
the high voltage for the LED backlights
which<00:02:09.869> typically<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.950> 32<00:02:11.310> inch<00:02:11.459> screen<00:02:11.519> will

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
which typically for 32 inch screen will

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.150 
which typically for 32 inch screen will
be<00:02:11.880> on<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.060> order<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.299> 90<00:02:12.690> volts<00:02:13.160> because

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
be on the order of 90 volts because

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.130 
be on the order of 90 volts because
they're<00:02:14.900> around

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
they're around

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.250 
they're around
so<00:02:17.070> in<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.370> probably<00:02:17.820> at<00:02:17.880> 40<00:02:18.299> LEDs<00:02:18.630> in<00:02:18.840> series

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
so in this probably at 40 LEDs in series

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.789 
so in this probably at 40 LEDs in series
or<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.630> would<00:02:21.810> be<00:02:21.870> at<00:02:21.959> about<00:02:22.169> 120

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
or so so that would be at about 120

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.930 
or so so that would be at about 120
undred<00:02:23.040> 50<00:02:23.310> volt<00:02:23.489> but<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:24.150> varies

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
undred 50 volt but it varies

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.610 
undred 50 volt but it varies
hang<00:02:25.090> on<00:02:25.300> how<00:02:25.600> they<00:02:25.720> construct<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:26.200> sometimes

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
hang on how they construct it sometimes

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.340 
hang on how they construct it sometimes
they'll<00:02:27.550> have<00:02:27.580> several<00:02:28.510> smaller<00:02:28.840> strings<00:02:29.170> in

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
they'll have several smaller strings in

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.610 
they'll have several smaller strings in
series<00:02:30.240> I've<00:02:31.240> been<00:02:31.480> put<00:02:31.690> in<00:02:31.780> parallel<00:02:32.170> and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
series I've been put in parallel and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.770 
series I've been put in parallel and
then<00:02:32.770> there<00:02:32.950> will<00:02:33.100> return<00:02:33.430> feed<00:02:33.790> going

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
then there will return feed going

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.000 
then there will return feed going
through<00:02:34.930> some<00:02:35.110> constant<00:02:35.530> current<00:02:35.770> raking

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
through some constant current raking

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.400 
through some constant current raking
layers<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:37.180> other<00:02:37.300> cases<00:02:37.570> they<00:02:37.960> will<00:02:38.110> have

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
layers in other cases they will have

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.490 
layers in other cases they will have
just<00:02:38.770> one<00:02:38.980> long<00:02:39.160> strip<00:02:39.490> a<00:02:39.640> high<00:02:39.790> voltage

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
just one long strip a high voltage

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.660 
just one long strip a high voltage
because<00:02:41.500> it's<00:02:41.650> high<00:02:41.740> voltage<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.280> fan<00:02:42.460> I

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
because it's high voltage the fan I

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.220 
because it's high voltage the fan I
can't<00:02:43.000> behind<00:02:43.240> it<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:43.720> really<00:02:44.080> quite

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
can't behind it is really quite

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.230 
can't behind it is really quite
dangerous<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:45.040> you'll<00:02:45.640> be<00:02:45.730> very<00:02:45.910> careful

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
dangerous so you'll be very careful

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.990 
dangerous so you'll be very careful
around<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.770> anyone<00:02:47.770> quite<00:02:47.980> happy<00:02:48.490> I<00:02:48.520> just<00:02:48.790> fix

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
around it anyone quite happy I just fix

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.930 
around it anyone quite happy I just fix
this<00:02:49.150> one<00:02:50.160> amazingly<00:02:51.160> easy<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.490> fix

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
this one amazingly easy to fix

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.720 
this one amazingly easy to fix
sure<00:02:52.510> yeah<00:02:52.860> all<00:02:53.860> three<00:02:54.220> of<00:02:54.340> these<00:02:54.460> have<00:02:54.640> been

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
sure yeah all three of these have been

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.360 
sure yeah all three of these have been
amazingly<00:02:55.210> easy<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.540> fix<00:02:55.810> oh<00:02:56.550> that's<00:02:57.550> not<00:02:57.790> bad

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
amazingly easy to fix oh that's not bad

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.010 
amazingly easy to fix oh that's not bad
time<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.610> assemble<00:03:01.240> this<00:03:01.360> one<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.720> it's<00:03:01.840> got<00:03:01.960> a

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
time to assemble this one and it's got a

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.040 
time to assemble this one and it's got a
very<00:03:02.350> awkward<00:03:03.100> design<00:03:03.430> this<00:03:04.300> is<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.540> fun<00:03:04.810> for<00:03:05.020> a

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
very awkward design this is a fun for a

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.690 
very awkward design this is a fun for a
thimble<00:03:05.410> looks<00:03:06.010> like<00:03:06.160> all<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.430> screws

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
thimble looks like all the screws

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.860 
thimble looks like all the screws
basically<00:03:07.090> going<00:03:07.210> to<00:03:07.300> use<00:03:07.360> little<00:03:07.600> metal

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
basically going to use little metal

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.350 
basically going to use little metal
bracket<00:03:07.990> so<00:03:08.440> just<00:03:08.620> going<00:03:09.430> line<00:03:09.670> up<00:03:09.910> guides<00:03:10.150> on

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
bracket so just going line up guides on

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.820 
bracket so just going line up guides on
the<00:03:10.450> panel<00:03:10.750> there<00:03:10.840> just<00:03:10.990> kind<00:03:11.140> of<00:03:11.170> sit<00:03:11.470> there

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
the panel there just kind of sit there

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.740 
the panel there just kind of sit there
so<00:03:12.490> I'm<00:03:12.550> guessing<00:03:12.730> when<00:03:12.970> Toshiba<00:03:13.390> make<00:03:13.570> these

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
so I'm guessing when Toshiba make these

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.590 
so I'm guessing when Toshiba make these
they<00:03:13.870> have<00:03:13.900> jigs<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.500> hold<00:03:14.710> them<00:03:14.860> in<00:03:14.950> place<00:03:15.600> I

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
they have jigs to hold them in place I

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.020 
they have jigs to hold them in place I
don't<00:03:17.380> have<00:03:17.650> such<00:03:17.860> a<00:03:17.890> jig<00:03:18.190> so<00:03:18.730> I'm<00:03:18.820> gonna<00:03:18.910> have

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
don't have such a jig so I'm gonna have

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:31.920 
don't have such a jig so I'm gonna have
to<00:03:19.090> improvise<00:03:19.830> wish<00:03:20.830> me<00:03:21.010> luck

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.989 

you
