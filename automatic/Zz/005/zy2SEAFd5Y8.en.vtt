America too unexpected through

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.170 
America too unexpected through
unexpectedly<00:01:57.620> similar<00:01:58.070> not<00:01:58.280> small<00:01:58.670> but<00:01:58.790> I<00:01:58.970> say

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
unexpectedly similar not small but I say

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.090 
unexpectedly similar not small but I say
it's<00:01:59.330> like<00:01:59.480> an<00:01:59.600> odd<00:01:59.750> couple<00:02:00.050> I<00:02:00.470> think<00:02:00.830> we<00:02:00.950> each

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
it's like an odd couple I think we each

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.370 
it's like an odd couple I think we each
have<00:02:01.340> pretty<00:02:01.610> different<00:02:02.350> approaches<00:02:03.350> to

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
have pretty different approaches to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.100 
have pretty different approaches to
morality<00:02:04.160> and<00:02:04.850> I<00:02:05.150> think<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.630> makes<00:02:05.840> for<00:02:05.930> an

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
morality and I think that makes for an

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.780 
morality and I think that makes for an
interesting<00:02:06.260> dichotomy<00:02:06.619> this<00:02:07.220> really<00:02:07.460> in

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
interesting dichotomy this really in

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.190 
interesting dichotomy this really in
this<00:02:07.970> movie<00:02:08.300> in<00:02:08.420> this<00:02:08.540> relationship<00:02:09.110> because

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
this movie in this relationship because

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.680 
this movie in this relationship because
they<00:02:09.380> they<00:02:09.679> need<00:02:09.950> one<00:02:10.220> another<00:02:10.459> each<00:02:11.209> other<00:02:11.450> as

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
they they need one another each other as

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.660 
they they need one another each other as

yet in our world Molly's getting there I

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.970 
yet in our world Molly's getting there I
mean<00:02:16.430> he's<00:02:16.550> not<00:02:16.730> it's<00:02:17.270> not<00:02:17.450> so<00:02:17.720> much<00:02:17.930> about<00:02:18.080> his

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
mean he's not it's not so much about his

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.130 
mean he's not it's not so much about his
shock<00:02:19.280> with<00:02:19.720> techniques<00:02:20.720> not<00:02:20.810> like<00:02:20.990> old

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
shock with techniques not like old

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.580 
shock with techniques not like old
internet<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.800> know<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:21.950> mean<00:02:22.280> it's<00:02:22.520> more<00:02:22.760> about

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
internet you know I mean it's more about

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.949 
internet you know I mean it's more about
it's<00:02:24.590> more<00:02:24.860> about<00:02:25.780> societal<00:02:26.780> differences

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
it's more about societal differences

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.100 
it's more about societal differences
with<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:28.430> 40s<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:29.030> today<00:02:29.330> I<00:02:29.360> think<00:02:29.570> he<00:02:29.900> comes

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
with the 40s to today I think he comes

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.010 
with the 40s to today I think he comes
from<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.410> world<00:02:30.650> where<00:02:30.830> people<00:02:30.980> are<00:02:31.430> more

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
from a world where people are more

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.140 
from a world where people are more
trusting<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.320> I<00:02:33.380> think<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:34.280> threats<00:02:34.610> weren't

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
trusting and I think the threats weren't

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.660 
trusting and I think the threats weren't
as<00:02:35.480> deep<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.740> know<00:02:36.860> world<00:02:37.310> we<00:02:37.459> didn't

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
as deep and and you know world we didn't

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.970 
as deep and and you know world we didn't
right<00:02:37.820> now<00:02:38.030> it's<00:02:38.870> harder<00:02:39.350> to<00:02:39.500> know<00:02:39.650> what's

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
right now it's harder to know what's

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.410 
right now it's harder to know what's
right<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.250> wrong<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.880> what's<00:02:41.030> good<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:41.269> bad

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
right and wrong and what's good and bad

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.000 
right and wrong and what's good and bad
in<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.840> forties<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.380> think<00:02:42.590> we<00:02:42.680> get<00:02:42.800> all<00:02:42.920> the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
in the forties I think we get all the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.830 
in the forties I think we get all the
great<00:02:43.160> Nazis<00:02:43.670> are<00:02:43.820> bad<00:02:44.000> it's<00:02:44.300> pretty<00:02:44.450> clear

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
great Nazis are bad it's pretty clear

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.290 
great Nazis are bad it's pretty clear
there's<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:45.350> bad<00:02:45.560> by<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.890> way<00:02:46.060> that's<00:02:47.060> black

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
there's so bad by the way that's black

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.500 
there's so bad by the way that's black
and<00:02:47.540> white<00:02:47.830> but<00:02:48.830> today<00:02:49.160> it's<00:02:49.730> harder<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.300> know

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
and white but today it's harder to know

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.229 
and white but today it's harder to know
who's<00:02:50.810> right<00:02:51.110> who's<00:02:51.470> wrong<00:02:51.910> sometimes<00:02:52.910> the

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
who's right who's wrong sometimes the

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.970 
who's right who's wrong sometimes the
actions<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.810> have<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:54.110> take<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.560> prevent

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
actions you have to take to prevent

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.229 
actions you have to take to prevent
certain<00:02:55.370> threats<00:02:55.989> compromise<00:02:56.989> some<00:02:57.320> of<00:02:57.410> our

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
certain threats compromise some of our

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.509 
certain threats compromise some of our
civil<00:02:59.239> liberties<00:02:59.269> or<00:02:59.780> our<00:03:00.470> privacy<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.430> I

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
civil liberties or our privacy and I

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.120 
civil liberties or our privacy and I
think<00:03:01.790> that's<00:03:02.000> tough<00:03:02.480> for<00:03:02.540> Steve<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.470> swallow

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
think that's tough for Steve to swallow

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.030 
think that's tough for Steve to swallow

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
yes is black and white think about who's

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.810 
yes is black and white think about who's
the<00:03:07.070> enemy<00:03:07.340> who<00:03:08.709> who<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.860> good<00:03:09.980> guys<00:03:10.190> he's<00:03:10.670> in

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
the enemy who who the good guys he's in

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.940 
the enemy who who the good guys he's in
a<00:03:10.880> world<00:03:11.090> now<00:03:11.300> where<00:03:11.330> some<00:03:12.290> of<00:03:12.350> those<00:03:12.470> enemies

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
a world now where some of those enemies
