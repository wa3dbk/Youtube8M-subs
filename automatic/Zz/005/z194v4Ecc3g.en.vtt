family<00:00:06.390> pedigree<00:00:06.660> diagrams<00:00:09.260> notice<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.410> in

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
family pedigree diagrams notice that in

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.610 
family pedigree diagrams notice that in
our<00:00:10.679> diagram<00:00:11.389> squared<00:00:12.389> represent<00:00:13.019> males<00:00:13.259> and

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
our diagram squared represent males and

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.910 
our diagram squared represent males and
circle<00:00:14.219> represent<00:00:14.759> females<00:00:15.269> if<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:16.770> have

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
circle represent females if you have

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.179 
circle represent females if you have
inherited<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.609> condition<00:00:18.529> then<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.830> square

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
inherited a condition then the square

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.700 
inherited a condition then the square
would<00:00:20.670> be<00:00:20.699> filled<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.300> if<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:22.050> were<00:00:22.199> male<00:00:22.439> and

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
would be filled in if you were male and

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.759 
would be filled in if you were male and
the<00:00:23.490> circle<00:00:24.029> would<00:00:24.359> be<00:00:24.420> filled<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:25.109> if<00:00:25.320> you

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
the circle would be filled in if you

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.589 
the circle would be filled in if you
were<00:00:25.980> female<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.029> these<00:00:27.180> would<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.570> in

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
were female so these would be in

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.549 
were female so these would be in
inherited<00:00:29.539> conditions<00:00:33.140> often<00:00:34.140> these<00:00:34.500> are

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
inherited conditions often these are

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.150 
inherited conditions often these are
diseases<00:00:35.100> but<00:00:35.520> not<00:00:35.760> necessarily<00:00:37.160> remember

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
diseases but not necessarily remember

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.840 
diseases but not necessarily remember
that<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.730> circles<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.450> squares<00:00:39.739> represent

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
that the circles and squares represent

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.569 
that the circles and squares represent
phenotypes<00:00:42.410> so<00:00:43.410> these<00:00:43.649> would<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:44.070> things<00:00:44.100> that

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
phenotypes so these would be things that

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.170 
phenotypes so these would be things that
could<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:44.910> observed<00:00:46.579> let's<00:00:47.579> take<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> look<00:00:48.059> at

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
could be observed let's take a look at

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.549 
could be observed let's take a look at
our<00:00:48.360> diagram<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:51.210> horizontal<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:52.199> we

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
our diagram on the horizontal here we

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.299 
our diagram on the horizontal here we
have<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:53.100> female<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.800> male<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:57.920> we<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.100> see

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
have a female and a male and we can see

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.790 
have a female and a male and we can see
that<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.550> female<00:00:59.850> has<00:01:00.420> already<00:01:00.870> got<00:01:01.109> some

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
that the female has already got some

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.090 
that the female has already got some
condition<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:03.449> male<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.559> square<00:01:04.890> is

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
condition and the male the square is

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.940 
condition and the male the square is
open<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:06.030> would<00:01:06.150> describe<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.630> as<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:07.049> normal

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
open we would describe that as a normal

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.250 
open we would describe that as a normal
male<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:11.159> female<00:01:11.450> seems<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.750> affected

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
male and the female seems to be affected

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.560 
male and the female seems to be affected
by<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.439> inherited<00:01:14.189> condition<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.210> that's<00:01:15.450> an

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
by the inherited condition so that's an

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.520 
by the inherited condition so that's an
affected<00:01:17.000> female

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.750 

these<00:01:23.190> two<00:01:23.580> parents<00:01:24.860> show<00:01:25.860> their<00:01:26.100> children<00:01:26.369> by

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
these two parents show their children by

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.190 
these two parents show their children by
this<00:01:26.970> vertical<00:01:27.600> line<00:01:27.630> here<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:30.200> this

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
this vertical line here so this is this

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.740 
this vertical line here so this is this
person<00:01:31.710> here<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.520> daughter<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.570> a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
person here is the daughter it's a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.160 
person here is the daughter it's a
circle<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.440> these<00:01:35.340> two<00:01:35.610> parents<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.330> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
circle of these two parents and the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.130 
circle of these two parents and the
daughter's<00:01:37.710> circle<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.460> open<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.750> therefore

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
daughter's circle is open so therefore

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.170 
daughter's circle is open so therefore
she's<00:01:40.350> unaffected<00:01:41.250> by<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.550> inherited

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
she's unaffected by the inherited

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.999 
she's unaffected by the inherited
condition<00:01:44.360> this<00:01:45.360> daughter<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:47.159> man

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
condition this daughter and this man

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.870 
condition this daughter and this man
have<00:01:50.009> children<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.750> next<00:01:51.869> generation<00:01:52.049> and

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
have children in the next generation and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.570 
have children in the next generation and
the<00:01:53.880> children<00:01:54.509> are<00:01:54.630> indicated<00:01:55.410> by<00:01:55.679> this

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
the children are indicated by this

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.350 
the children are indicated by this
vertical<00:01:56.910> line<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:58.140> one<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.369> so

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
vertical line this one and this one so

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.190 
vertical line this one and this one so
we<00:02:00.509> can<00:02:00.690> see<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.050> they<00:02:01.229> have<00:02:01.500> two<00:02:01.920> sons<00:02:02.610> and

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
we can see that they have two sons and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.419 
we can see that they have two sons and
one<00:02:04.200> daughter<00:02:05.720> these<00:02:06.720> children<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.740> two<00:02:07.979> sons

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
one daughter these children the two sons

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.570 
one daughter these children the two sons
and<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.929> one<00:02:10.110> daughter<00:02:10.519> are<00:02:11.519> the
