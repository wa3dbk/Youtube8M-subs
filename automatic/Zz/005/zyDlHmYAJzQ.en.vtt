00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
long time I felt like the design is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.029 
long time I felt like the design is
solid<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:15.240> art<00:01:15.450> load<00:01:15.780> was<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.829> thing

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
something that I hammered out a long

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.570 
something that I hammered out a long
time<00:04:03.239> ago<00:04:03.540> but<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.260> kept<00:04:04.530> changing<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:05.100> way<00:04:05.310> the

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
time ago but I kept changing the way the

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.600 
time ago but I kept changing the way the
game<00:04:05.760> was<00:04:05.940> played<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:06.739> like<00:04:07.739> I<00:04:07.769> just<00:04:07.920> wasn't

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
game was played and like I just wasn't

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.580 
game was played and like I just wasn't
quite<00:04:08.880> happy<00:04:09.239> with<00:04:09.269> it<00:04:09.570> I<00:04:09.690> throughout<00:04:10.470> the

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
quite happy with it I throughout the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.050 
quite happy with it I throughout the
design<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.890> redesigned<00:04:11.489> it<00:04:11.610> again<00:04:11.820> with<00:04:12.030> a

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
design a redesigned it again with a

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.720 
design a redesigned it again with a
whole<00:04:12.840> different<00:04:13.170> approach<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.860> then<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:14.489> kind

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
whole different approach and then I kind

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.190 
whole different approach and then I kind
of<00:04:14.760> went<00:04:14.850> back<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.209> first<00:04:15.420> approach<00:04:16.049> but

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
of went back to the first approach but

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.479 
of went back to the first approach but
add<00:04:16.380> some<00:04:16.620> symbols<00:04:17.040> and<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.250> start<00:04:17.459> of

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
add some symbols and the start of

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.099 
add some symbols and the start of
breaking<00:04:17.820> down<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.060> guests<00:04:18.419> and<00:04:18.540> just

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
breaking down the guests and just

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.099 
breaking down the guests and just
redesigned<00:04:20.040> it<00:04:20.190> again<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.489> again<00:04:20.580> and<00:04:20.730> again

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
redesigned it again and again and again

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.620 
redesigned it again and again and again
but<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.590> some<00:04:22.950> of<00:04:23.040> the<00:04:23.070> basics<00:04:23.550> have<00:04:23.700> never

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
but the some of the basics have never

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.810 
but the some of the basics have never
changed<00:04:24.900> so<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.890> structure<00:04:26.190> kind<00:04:26.520> of<00:04:26.610> lets

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
changed so the structure kind of lets

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.220 
changed so the structure kind of lets
you<00:04:26.910> do<00:04:27.030> that<00:04:27.180> your<00:04:27.360> soda<00:04:27.570> you<00:04:27.690> get<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.900> basic

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
game and then you can kind of add

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.430 
game and then you can kind of add
additional<00:04:30.180> rules<00:04:30.630> once<00:04:30.990> you've<00:04:31.140> got<00:04:31.320> the

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440
