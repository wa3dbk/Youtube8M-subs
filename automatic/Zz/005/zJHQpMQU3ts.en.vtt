00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
hi there it's time for a domino tutorial

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.299 
hi there it's time for a domino tutorial
so<00:00:04.400> let's<00:00:05.400> just<00:00:05.790> get<00:00:06.060> right<00:00:06.270> into<00:00:06.330> this<00:00:07.309> I'll

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
so let's just get right into this I'll

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.200 
so let's just get right into this I'll
start<00:00:08.820> placing<00:00:09.330> Domino's<00:00:09.900> like<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:11.210> just

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
start placing Domino's like so and just

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.120 
start placing Domino's like so and just
try<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.420> keep<00:00:12.660> everything<00:00:12.990> as<00:00:13.320> accurate<00:00:13.920> as

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
try to keep everything as accurate as

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.120 
try to keep everything as accurate as
possible<00:00:17.180> so<00:00:18.180> if<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.170> look<00:00:19.410> closely<00:00:19.800> you'll

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
possible so if you look closely you'll

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.920 
possible so if you look closely you'll
have<00:00:20.340> something<00:00:20.850> like<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:24.920> and<00:00:26.779> you<00:00:27.779> just

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
have something like this and you just

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.300 
have something like this and you just
put<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> little<00:00:28.320> pressure<00:00:28.560> where<00:00:28.949> my<00:00:29.099> right

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
put a little pressure where my right

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.860 
put a little pressure where my right
thumb<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.689> pull<00:00:31.170> out<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.439> green<00:00:31.710> Domino

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
thumb is and pull out this green Domino

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.750 
thumb is and pull out this green Domino
all<00:00:33.870> right<00:00:34.050> then<00:00:34.500> you'll<00:00:34.739> place<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.309> Domino

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
all right then you'll place a Domino

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.590 
all right then you'll place a Domino
right<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.660> edge<00:00:36.899> here<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:38.059> this<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.360> what

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
right on this edge here and this is what

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.090 
right on this edge here and this is what
you<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.840> made

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.440 

doesn't<00:00:44.100> seem<00:00:44.219> interesting<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:44.850> let's<00:00:44.969> just

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
doesn't seem interesting but let's just

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.170 
doesn't seem interesting but let's just
continue<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.350> as<00:00:47.010> if<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.760> was<00:00:48.030> not

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
continue on as if that was not

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.920 
continue on as if that was not
underwhelming<00:00:49.700> so<00:00:50.700> let<00:00:50.910> me<00:00:51.059> just<00:00:51.239> start

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
underwhelming so let me just start

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:29.300 
underwhelming so let me just start
setting<00:00:52.230> up<00:00:52.260> some<00:00:52.320> dominoes<00:00:52.860> here

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.800 

all<00:01:30.310> righty<00:01:30.909> let's<00:01:31.150> see<00:01:31.330> what<00:01:31.450> this<00:01:31.570> looks

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
all righty let's see what this looks

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:43.290 
all righty let's see what this looks
like<00:01:33.810> that's<00:01:34.810> that<00:01:41.760> some<00:01:42.760> things<00:01:43.000> you<00:01:43.150> might

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
like that's that some things you might

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.280 
like that's that some things you might
not<00:01:43.570> know<00:01:43.810> that<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:45.310> can<00:01:45.600> make<00:01:46.600> a<00:01:46.810> couple<00:01:47.080> of

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
not know that you can make a couple of

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.240 
not know that you can make a couple of
these<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:48.300> they<00:01:49.300> can<00:01:51.060> make<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.950> really<00:01:53.950> long

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
these and they can make a really long

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:02.820 
these and they can make a really long
chain<00:01:58.950> that's<00:01:59.950> one<00:02:00.220> of<00:02:00.340> those<00:02:00.430> there<00:02:01.830> that's

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
chain that's one of those there that's

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.900 
chain that's one of those there that's
one<00:02:03.070> there<00:02:05.039> here<00:02:06.039> let<00:02:06.220> me<00:02:06.250> just<00:02:06.399> get<00:02:06.700> these

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
one there here let me just get these

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.510 
one there here let me just get these
both<00:02:07.149> in<00:02:07.390> shot<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:08.140> this<00:02:08.500> is<00:02:08.679> what<00:02:08.920> two<00:02:09.399> of

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
both in shot and this is what two of

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.670 
both in shot and this is what two of
them<00:02:09.670> look<00:02:09.820> like<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:13.080> one<00:02:14.080> final<00:02:14.350> thing<00:02:14.470> you

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
them look like and one final thing you

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.500 
them look like and one final thing you
can<00:02:14.920> do<00:02:15.040> with<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.310> with<00:02:15.700> these<00:02:20.820> or<00:02:21.820> turn<00:02:22.180> them

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
can do with the with these or turn them

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:34.000 
can do with the with these or turn them
I<00:02:25.080> need<00:02:26.080> degrees

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.580 

like<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:41.000> like<00:02:42.000> that

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
like so like that

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.500 
like so like that
and<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:43.980> what<00:02:44.160> happens<00:02:47.240> all<00:02:48.240> right

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
and this is what happens all right

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.000 
and this is what happens all right
they've<00:02:48.690> had<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.930> lot<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.110> practice<00:02:49.620> with<00:02:49.650> this

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
they've had a lot of practice with this

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.930 
they've had a lot of practice with this
and<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:51.000> developed<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.870> little<00:02:52.020> another<00:02:52.980> tip<00:02:53.550> for

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
and I developed a little another tip for

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.770 
and I developed a little another tip for
making<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:55.080> even<00:02:56.070> more<00:02:56.250> reliable<00:02:56.790> as<00:02:57.600> you

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
making this even more reliable as you

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.080 
making this even more reliable as you
can<00:02:57.930> see<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.890> space<00:02:59.160> between<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.730> green<00:03:00.060> and

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
can see the space between the green and

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.150 
can see the space between the green and
the<00:03:00.450> yellow<00:03:00.480> Domino<00:03:01.110> is<00:03:01.260> nothing<00:03:01.740> and<00:03:01.920> if<00:03:02.130> you

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
the yellow Domino is nothing and if you

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.860 
the yellow Domino is nothing and if you
do<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:04.590> domino<00:03:04.920> falls<00:03:05.130> but<00:03:05.850> observe<00:03:06.510> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
do this the domino falls but observe the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.320 
do this the domino falls but observe the
little<00:03:08.510> rocking<00:03:09.510> red<00:03:09.990> Domino<00:03:10.320> here<00:03:11.090> if<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.270> do

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
little rocking red Domino here if I do

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.560 
little rocking red Domino here if I do
this<00:03:12.740> it<00:03:13.740> moves<00:03:13.890> really<00:03:14.250> high<00:03:14.970> up<00:03:15.210> especially

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
this it moves really high up especially

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.550 
this it moves really high up especially
in<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.960> left<00:03:16.140> side<00:03:17.510> also<00:03:18.510> if<00:03:19.020> you<00:03:19.200> are<00:03:19.470> a

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
in the left side also if you are a

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.290 
in the left side also if you are a
little<00:03:19.890> bit<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.340> left<00:03:20.700> here

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
little bit to the left here

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.830 
little bit to the left here
like<00:03:21.900> if<00:03:22.050> you're<00:03:22.170> not<00:03:22.200> accurate<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:24.630> red

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
like if you're not accurate and the red

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.330 
like if you're not accurate and the red
Domino's<00:03:25.200> actually<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.650> little<00:03:25.890> bit<00:03:26.010> more<00:03:26.220> on

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
Domino's actually a little bit more on

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.670 
Domino's actually a little bit more on
the<00:03:26.490> green<00:03:26.790> Domino<00:03:27.270> it<00:03:27.960> will<00:03:28.170> go<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.500> wrong

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
the green Domino it will go the wrong

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.940 
the green Domino it will go the wrong
way<00:03:29.150> that<00:03:30.150> was<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.360> reason<00:03:30.630> why<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:30.920> said<00:03:31.920> that

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
way that was the reason why I said that

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.950 
way that was the reason why I said that
we<00:03:32.130> should<00:03:32.370> have<00:03:32.520> a<00:03:32.550> gap<00:03:32.880> here<00:03:33.210> between<00:03:33.420> the

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
we should have a gap here between the

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.710 
we should have a gap here between the
green<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.560> yellow<00:03:34.590> Domino<00:03:35.270> such<00:03:36.270> that<00:03:36.540> it

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
green and the yellow Domino such that it

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.330 
green and the yellow Domino such that it
guarantees<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.650> red<00:03:37.800> Domino<00:03:37.920> look<00:03:38.250> at

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
guarantees that the red Domino look at

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.570 
guarantees that the red Domino look at
that<00:03:38.490> way<00:03:39.440> there's<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.560> problem<00:03:41.010> though<00:03:41.160> if<00:03:41.400> you

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
that way there's a problem though if you

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.440 
that way there's a problem though if you
hit<00:03:41.730> too<00:03:41.910> hard<00:03:42.320> you<00:03:43.320> cannot<00:03:43.620> guarantee<00:03:44.450> that

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
hit too hard you cannot guarantee that

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.410 
hit too hard you cannot guarantee that
the<00:03:45.570> red<00:03:45.720> Domino<00:03:45.900> will<00:03:46.260> not<00:03:46.440> turn<00:03:46.680> too<00:03:47.040> much

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
the red Domino will not turn too much

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.610 
the red Domino will not turn too much
especially<00:03:48.420> after<00:03:48.750> having<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.410> lot<00:03:49.560> of

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
especially after having a lot of

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.790 
especially after having a lot of
Domino's<00:03:50.040> while<00:03:50.370> on<00:03:50.520> this<00:03:51.200> I've<00:03:52.200> been<00:03:52.470> working

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
Domino's while on this I've been working

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.910 
Domino's while on this I've been working
on<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.040> large-scale<00:03:53.720> line<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.960> these<00:03:55.620> things

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
on the large-scale line of these things

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.720 
on the large-scale line of these things
going<00:03:56.190> on<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:57.150> find<00:03:57.450> that<00:03:58.250> if<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.700> can

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
going on and I find that if you can

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.170 
going on and I find that if you can
bring<00:04:00.210> the<00:04:00.870> gap<00:04:01.080> a<00:04:01.290> little<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:03.150> most<00:04:04.250> if<00:04:05.250> you

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
bring the gap a little the most if you

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.700 
bring the gap a little the most if you
can<00:04:06.390> separate<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:07.050> green<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.680> yellow

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
can separate the green and the yellow

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.740 
can separate the green and the yellow
Domino<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.310> most<00:04:08.670> while<00:04:08.880> keeping<00:04:09.210> this<00:04:09.300> side

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
Domino the most while keeping this side

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.340 
Domino the most while keeping this side
flush<00:04:10.940> you'll<00:04:11.940> have<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.210> very<00:04:12.480> reliable<00:04:12.840> stunt

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
flush you'll have a very reliable stunt

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.950 
flush you'll have a very reliable stunt
here<00:04:13.710> so<00:04:14.400> if<00:04:14.610> you<00:04:14.790> bring<00:04:15.330> it<00:04:15.480> out<00:04:15.570> all<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.930> way

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
here so if you bring it out all the way

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.170 
here so if you bring it out all the way
like<00:04:16.200> that<00:04:17.299> but<00:04:18.299> not<00:04:19.020> too<00:04:19.260> much<00:04:19.410> that<00:04:20.180> the

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
like that but not too much that the

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.030 
like that but not too much that the
yellow<00:04:21.420> cannot<00:04:21.660> keep<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.440> green<00:04:22.800> from

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
yellow cannot keep the green from

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.810 
yellow cannot keep the green from
touching<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.910> bottom<00:04:24.300> here<00:04:27.530> like<00:04:28.610> about<00:04:29.610> this

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
touching the bottom here like about this

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.510 
touching the bottom here like about this
much<00:04:30.090> about<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.840> thickness<00:04:31.230> of<00:04:31.350> a<00:04:31.470> Domino<00:04:31.830> not

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
much about the thickness of a Domino not

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.760 
much about the thickness of a Domino not
less<00:04:32.790> but<00:04:33.030> almost<00:04:33.690> exactly<00:04:34.140> the<00:04:34.320> thickness<00:04:34.650> of

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
less but almost exactly the thickness of

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.800 
less but almost exactly the thickness of
a<00:04:34.860> domino<00:04:36.230> the<00:04:37.230> red<00:04:37.620> Domino<00:04:37.800> barely<00:04:38.670> moves<00:04:39.030> but

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
a domino the red Domino barely moves but

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.560 
a domino the red Domino barely moves but
my<00:04:40.170> move<00:04:40.350> is<00:04:40.470> just<00:04:40.770> enough<00:04:41.150> such<00:04:42.150> that<00:04:42.180> the

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
my move is just enough such that the

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.970 
my move is just enough such that the
blue<00:04:43.320> domino<00:04:44.250> falls<00:04:44.430> over

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
blue domino falls over

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.790 
blue domino falls over
in<00:04:46.640> fact<00:04:46.910> if<00:04:47.360> you<00:04:47.510> watch<00:04:47.690> in<00:04:47.900> slow<00:04:48.020> motion<00:04:48.350> it

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
in fact if you watch in slow motion it

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.120 
in fact if you watch in slow motion it
appears<00:04:49.280> that<00:04:49.900> this<00:04:50.900> Bob's<00:04:51.230> up<00:04:51.440> pretty<00:04:51.920> high

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
appears that this Bob's up pretty high

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.460 
appears that this Bob's up pretty high
and<00:04:52.370> then<00:04:53.210> this<00:04:53.390> guy<00:04:53.570> just<00:04:53.870> stays<00:04:54.080> in<00:04:54.260> place

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
and then this guy just stays in place

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.530 
and then this guy just stays in place
for<00:04:54.710> a<00:04:54.740> few<00:04:54.890> seconds<00:04:55.370> then<00:04:55.550> in<00:04:55.880> slow<00:04:56.180> motion

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
for a few seconds then in slow motion

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.840 
for a few seconds then in slow motion
falls<00:04:56.810> down<00:04:57.190> which<00:04:58.190> is<00:04:58.370> why<00:04:58.490> I'm<00:04:58.640> going<00:04:58.790> to
