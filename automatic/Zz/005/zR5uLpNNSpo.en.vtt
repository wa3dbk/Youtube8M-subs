but I honestly would rather have three
to<00:01:54.630> four<00:01:54.810> days<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.140> practice<00:01:55.260> two<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.100> four

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
to four days of practice two to four

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.480

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
days of that and really pick an area of

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.399 
days of that and really pick an area of
the<00:01:59.549> lake<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.909> learn<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.299> as<00:02:00.540> best<00:02:00.720> I<00:02:00.930> can<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the lake and learn it as best I can you

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
lives and they still don't know

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.590 
lives and they still don't know
everything<00:02:05.130> about<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.460> lake<00:02:05.670> how<00:02:06.150> am<00:02:06.330> I<00:02:06.420> going

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
everything about the lake how am I going

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.330 
everything about the lake how am I going
to<00:02:06.689> learn<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.229> few<00:02:07.439> days<00:02:07.560> but<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.159> can

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
to learn it in a few days but if I can

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.489 
to learn it in a few days but if I can
pick<00:02:08.489> one<00:02:08.759> general<00:02:09.149> area<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.959> know<00:02:10.079> a<00:02:10.109> square

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:10.499 
pick one general area you know a square

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:13.429 
pick one general area you know a square
mile<00:02:10.950> radius<00:02:11.939> of<00:02:12.299> like<00:02:12.510> five<00:02:12.779> or<00:02:13.049> six<00:02:13.230> miles

something
like<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:15.290> can<00:02:15.890> really<00:02:16.220> dissect<00:02:16.430> it

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
like that I can really dissect it

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.370 
like that I can really dissect it
quickly<00:02:16.970> use<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.360> lot<00:02:17.600> of<00:02:17.630> search<00:02:17.900> baits<00:02:18.200> you

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
quickly use a lot of search baits you

know there's a swimbait for example one
of<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.620> baits<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:21.950> always<00:02:22.459> start<00:02:22.700> off<00:02:22.819> throwing

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
of the baits I always start off throwing

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.750

just<00:02:23.569> on<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.750> jig<00:02:23.990> head<00:02:24.200> simple<00:02:25.040> stuff<00:02:25.130> gets<00:02:25.520> bit

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
just on a jig head simple stuff gets bit

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.610 
just on a jig head simple stuff gets bit
if<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.390> doesn't<00:02:26.720> get<00:02:26.780> bit<00:02:26.990> you<00:02:27.170> at<00:02:27.290> least<00:02:27.440> get

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
if it doesn't get bit you at least get

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.520 
if it doesn't get bit you at least get
followers<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.520> still<00:02:28.910> learn<00:02:29.180> gets<00:02:30.080> down<00:02:30.290> into

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
followers and still learn gets down into

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.410 
followers and still learn gets down into
