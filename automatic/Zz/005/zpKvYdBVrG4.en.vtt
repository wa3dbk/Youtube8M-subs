settings on the remote okay an open loop
she<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.460> hit<00:00:23.609> start<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.240> says<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
she just hit start and it says in the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.300 
she just hit start and it says in the
same<00:00:24.779> side<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.109> cable<00:00:25.320> goes<00:00:25.859> back<00:00:26.099> and

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
same side of the cable goes back and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.609 
same side of the cable goes back and
forth<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.760> beginner<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.019> open<00:00:28.289> loop<00:00:28.380> is

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
forth on beginner so the open loop is

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.859 
forth on beginner so the open loop is
what<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.039> now<00:00:29.250> she<00:00:29.970> just<00:00:30.000> goes<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.660> never

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
what it's on now she just goes and never

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.659 
what it's on now she just goes and never
stops<00:00:31.199> just<00:00:31.650> keeps<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.040> as<00:00:32.250> long<00:00:32.399> as<00:00:32.550> she

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
stops just keeps going as long as she

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.090 
stops just keeps going as long as she
wants<00:00:32.700> until<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.590> till<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.680> change<00:00:34.890> the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
beginner now which loop which that are

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.760 
beginner now which loop which that are
you<00:01:26.680> gonna<00:01:26.770> put<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:27.040> in<00:01:27.990> Chuck<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.110> do<00:01:29.260> for<00:01:29.650> the

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
you gonna put it in Chuck to do for the

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.980 
you gonna put it in Chuck to do for the
open<00:01:29.980> loop<00:01:30.130> or<00:01:30.400> one<00:01:31.360> where<00:01:31.510> it<00:01:31.600> drops<00:01:31.840> you

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
open loop or one where it drops you

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.550 
open loop or one where it drops you
again<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.880> right<00:01:34.000> cool<00:01:34.240> okay<00:01:34.840> so<00:01:35.410> you<00:01:35.470> just

again all right cool okay so you just

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.530 
again all right cool okay so you just
switch<00:01:36.070> it<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.460> beginner<00:01:36.910> mode<00:01:37.150> it's<00:01:38.080> start

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
switch it to beginner mode it's start

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.730 
switch it to beginner mode it's start

live to the cable to go just pulls the

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.570 
live to the cable to go just pulls the
slack<00:01:44.890> out<00:01:45.160> nice<00:01:45.400> and<00:01:45.430> slow<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:45.850> smooth

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580

accelerates nice and smooth start all

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.690 
accelerates nice and smooth start all
automated<00:01:50.200> again<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.650> operator<00:01:51.040> just<00:01:51.340> pushes

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
automated again the operator just pushes

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.760 
automated again the operator just pushes
the<00:01:51.820> button<00:01:51.970> and<00:01:52.720> that's<00:01:53.050> all<00:01:53.200> he<00:01:53.230> has<00:01:53.470> to<00:01:53.500> do

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
the button and that's all he has to do

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.440 
the button and that's all he has to do
now<00:01:54.160> at<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.430> end<00:01:54.550> it's<00:01:54.790> going<00:01:55.000> to<00:01:55.090> set<00:01:55.300> him

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
now at the end it's going to set him

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.270 
now at the end it's going to set him
down<00:01:55.480> in<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.750> water<00:01:55.900> and<00:01:56.620> let<00:01:56.770> him<00:01:56.920> do<00:01:57.040> a<00:01:57.070> deep

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
down in the water and let him do a deep

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.100 
down in the water and let him do a deep
water<00:01:57.490> start<00:01:57.880> on<00:01:58.210> his<00:01:58.450> own<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:58.870> come<00:01:59.020> back<00:02:01.110> so

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
water start on his own and come back so

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.780 
water start on his own and come back so
he<00:02:02.200> goes<00:02:02.350> out<00:02:02.590> now<00:02:02.890> actually<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.340> pulley<00:02:03.550> or

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
he goes out now actually the pulley or

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.980 
he goes out now actually the pulley or
the<00:02:03.910> carrier<00:02:04.210> is<00:02:04.330> going<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.510> go<00:02:04.600> all<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.840> way

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
the carrier is going to go all the way

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.620 
the carrier is going to go all the way
around<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.410> pulley<00:02:06.030> let's<00:02:07.030> write<00:02:07.300> or<00:02:07.450> sit

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
around the pulley let's write or sit

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.010 
around the pulley let's write or sit
down<00:02:09.000> come<00:02:10.000> around<00:02:10.179> get<00:02:10.390> readjusted<00:02:10.600> in<00:02:10.959> the
