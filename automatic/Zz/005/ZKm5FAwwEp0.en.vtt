gonna<00:00:08.189> do<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> pump<00:00:08.910> alignment<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.440> a

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
gonna do a pump alignment and this is a

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.940 
gonna do a pump alignment and this is a
special<00:00:10.920> tool<00:00:11.160> from<00:00:11.370> Sonics<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.650> kem<00:00:13.650> pump

special tool from Sonics and kem pump
alignment<00:00:14.429> tool<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:15.000> don't<00:00:15.420> have<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.839> partner

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
alignment tool I don't have the partner

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.410 
alignment tool I don't have the partner
it's<00:00:16.470> not<00:00:16.619> printed<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.130> here<00:00:17.520> but<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.090> can<00:00:18.300> go

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.939 
to the Sonics website and search for it
and<00:00:23.390> this<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.449> what<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.810> looks<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.439> this

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
and this is what it looks like and this

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.820 
and this is what it looks like and this
is<00:00:26.010> what<00:00:26.130> we're<00:00:26.880> gonna<00:00:26.970> use<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.529> align<00:00:28.529> our

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
is what we're gonna use to align our

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.089 
is what we're gonna use to align our
pump<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:30.060> now<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:30.779> our<00:00:30.980> bushing<00:00:31.980> in

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
pump so now that we have our bushing in

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.470 
pump so now that we have our bushing in
our<00:00:32.250> seal<00:00:32.579> installed<00:00:33.800> we<00:00:34.800> lower<00:00:35.040> our<00:00:35.480> pump

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
our seal installed we lower our pump

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.880 
our seal installed we lower our pump
body<00:00:37.469> assembly<00:00:38.309> here<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:41.570> it's<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.690> very<00:00:42.989> tight

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
body assembly here and it's a very tight

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.810 
body assembly here and it's a very tight
fit<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.420> see<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:45.899> now<00:00:46.640> we're<00:00:47.640> all<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
fit as you see here now we're all the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.389 
fit as you see here now we're all the
way<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> bottom<00:00:49.219> basically<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
way to the to the bottom basically and

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.099 
way to the to the bottom basically and
inside<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.949> of<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:57.000> tool<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.600> can<00:00:57.899> see<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
inside of the of the tool you can see a

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.369 
inside of the of the tool you can see a
recess<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.879> recess<00:01:00.449> centers<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
recess and that recess centers on the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.880 
recess and that recess centers on the
stator<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.199> that's<00:01:04.199> what's<00:01:04.439> that's

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
stator here and that's what's that's

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.789 
stator here and that's what's that's
what<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.489> align<00:01:05.820> our<00:01:06.150> hub<00:01:06.720> here<00:01:07.049> now

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
what is going to align our hub here now

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.330 
what is going to align our hub here now
we're<00:01:07.950> gonna<00:01:08.040> go<00:01:08.250> ahead<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.520> lower<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.909> into

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
we're gonna go ahead and lower it into

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.440 
we're gonna go ahead and lower it into
the<00:01:11.340> tool

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.480 

I'm<00:01:15.930> gonna<00:01:16.050> try<00:01:16.260> to<00:01:16.290> shine<00:01:16.620> a<00:01:16.650> light<00:01:16.800> in<00:01:17.250> there

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
I'm gonna try to shine a light in there

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.969 
I'm gonna try to shine a light in there
and<00:01:18.020> I<00:01:19.020> don't<00:01:19.290> know<00:01:19.440> if<00:01:19.500> you're<00:01:19.620> gonna<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.890> able

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
and I don't know if you're gonna be able

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.730 
and I don't know if you're gonna be able
to<00:01:20.130> see<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.870> the<00:01:21.990> bushing<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
to see but you see the bushing the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.940 
to see but you see the bushing the
bushing<00:01:23.130> rests<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.909> top<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.570> tool<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
bushing rests on top of the tool and the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.040 
bushing rests on top of the tool and the
centerpiece<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.550> the<00:01:26.820> tool<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.240> centering<00:01:27.780> in

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
centerpiece of the tool is centering in

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.230 
centerpiece of the tool is centering in
the<00:01:28.920> stator<00:01:29.670> support<00:01:31.580> okay<00:01:32.580> now<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.910> we<00:01:33.000> have

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the stator support okay now that we have

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.190 
the stator support okay now that we have
that<00:01:33.390> installed<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.740> we<00:01:34.830> put<00:01:35.040> our<00:01:35.690> our<00:01:36.690> bolts

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
that installed and we put our our bolts

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.999 
that installed and we put our our bolts
on<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.619> pump<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.050> stator<00:01:40.350> support<00:01:40.800> is

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
on the pump so the stator support is

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.190 
on the pump so the stator support is
considered<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> pump<00:01:42.240> cover<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.020> foot

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
considered the pump cover and the foot

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.230 
considered the pump cover and the foot
body<00:01:43.440> use<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.159> one<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.430> take<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> bushing<00:01:45.090> and

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
body use the one to take the bushing and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:02:13.820 
body use the one to take the bushing and
the<00:01:45.300> seal<00:01:47.330> and<00:01:48.330> he<00:01:48.450> supports<00:01:48.990> 30<00:02:12.800> neela

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the seal and he supports 30 neela

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.250 
the seal and he supports 30 neela
sealing<00:02:14.459> rings<00:02:14.640> installed<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.720> now<00:02:15.900> we<00:02:15.959> can

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
sealing rings installed and now we can

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.319 
sealing rings installed and now we can
remove<00:02:16.620> our<00:02:16.830> tool<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.989> there<00:02:18.989> we<00:02:19.110> have<00:02:19.260> it

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
remove our tool and there we have it

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:26.150 
remove our tool and there we have it
f-for<00:02:21.329> a<00:02:21.530> f5<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:23.180> Mitsubishi<00:02:24.180> units<00:02:25.160> pump
