00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 fans all welcome as always in the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.740
 pupa nail academy today I propose you a 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.530
 very simple nail art for valentine's day 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.240
 to be reproduced with a decidedly theme that 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.490
 you can combine it with your make up 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.240
 applying a nice red lipstick on the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.150
 lips 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.619
 then a perfect pair of lips e 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.050
 nails of the same color 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.390
 let's see how to reproduce it I applied 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.400
 first the scrub an informant is the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.880
 base over smoothing and these come 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.539
 with an ultra-smoothing treatment 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.540
 this to make the surface 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.520
 as homogeneous as possible 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.920
 now I only drag one on the ring finger the axes 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:44.100
 in color gello the number 72 that 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:46.079
 it is a white on the other long ones instead 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.870
 apply this beautiful monocolor 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.430
 red that the number 41 always lasting 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.500
 gel effect color and after the first 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.059
 passed also a second pass 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.059
 both white and red 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.449
 I wait for them to be dry and alone 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.030
 on the ring finger then on the white color 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.030
 I apply a layer of glue per file 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.880
 I expect that this too is dry 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.520
 then I take and then the spreaders 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.100
 obviously themed with with lips and 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.990
 as you see all these dots 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.160
 metallized that will be a lot 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.160
 light to nail art 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.530
 I press well on the nail making it stick 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.050
 to perfection it is simply moving 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.490
 the file the decoration remains on mine 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.410
 nail then a perfect decoration with 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.820
 few gestures 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.250
 at this point all that remains is 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.470
 perfect everything by applying the top 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.840
 coat obviously yellow effect to give 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.479
 greater intensity and brightness to mine 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.880
 handle and beyond the art completed me 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.229
 I really hope you enjoyed it and nothing 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.950
 I send a kiss and see you 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.950
