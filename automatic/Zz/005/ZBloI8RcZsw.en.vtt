00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
that was hindering us from starting the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.270 
that was hindering us from starting the
phone<00:01:09.270> right<00:01:10.110> slide<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> battery<00:01:10.920> back<00:01:11.040> up<00:01:11.159> in

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
phone right slide the battery back up in

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.679 
phone right slide the battery back up in
here<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.640> always<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> look<00:01:12.270> at<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> battery

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
here I always have a look at the battery

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.120 
here I always have a look at the battery
size<00:01:12.840> first<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.260> all<00:01:14.990> 1415<00:01:15.990> milliamp<00:01:16.409> hours<00:01:16.770> so

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
size first of all 1415 milliamp hours so

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.969 
size first of all 1415 milliamp hours so
should<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.180> pretty<00:01:18.390> good<00:01:18.450> battery<00:01:18.780> life

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
should be a pretty good battery life

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.440 
should be a pretty good battery life
just<00:01:19.979> clip<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.310> back<00:01:21.950> there<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.040> go

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
just clip that back there we go

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.980 
just clip that back there we go
put<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.600> back<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.110> yeah<00:01:25.880> there<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.939> go<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
put this back on yeah there you go and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.069 
put this back on yeah there you go and
now<00:01:28.110> let's<00:01:28.259> do<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> first<00:01:28.590> boot<00:01:31.729> there<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:32.909> go

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
now let's do the first boot there we go

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:40.370 
now let's do the first boot there we go
slight<00:01:34.079> vibration<00:01:35.720> put<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.810> down<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:40.259> my

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
slight vibration put it down and my

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.630 
slight vibration put it down and my
camera<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.740> about<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.950> die<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.310> we<00:01:41.460> should

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
camera is about to die so we should

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.670 
camera is about to die so we should
hurry<00:01:41.850> up<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.000> bit<00:01:42.210> ah

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.920 

so<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> normal<00:01:47.040> HDC<00:01:47.549> branding<00:01:50.930> quietly

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
so a normal HDC branding quietly

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.800 
so a normal HDC branding quietly
brilliant<00:01:53.000> wasn't<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.060> quiet<00:01:56.570> and<00:01:57.570> well<00:01:57.719> I'm

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
brilliant wasn't that quiet and well I'm

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.480 
brilliant wasn't that quiet and well I'm
guessing<00:01:57.990> you'll<00:01:58.259> take<00:01:58.439> us<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.070> normal

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
guessing you'll take us to the normal

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.149 
guessing you'll take us to the normal
setup<00:01:59.790> here<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:00.840> have<00:02:01.020> screen<00:02:01.590> rocks<00:02:01.770> take

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
setup here we have screen rocks take

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.940 
setup here we have screen rocks take
that<00:02:02.340> down<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:04.790> let's<00:02:05.790> see<00:02:06.180> if<00:02:06.540> we<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.860> do

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
that down and let's see if we have to do

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.190 
that down and let's see if we have to do
the<00:02:08.039> setup<00:02:08.250> I'll<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.390> skip<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.780> we<00:02:09.989> have<00:02:10.110> to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
the setup I'll just skip that we have to

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.270 
the setup I'll just skip that we have to
do

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
do

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:20.230 
do
once<00:02:13.280> again<00:02:13.400> HTC<00:02:14.030> logo<00:02:18.760> just<00:02:19.760> had<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:19.970> fade<00:02:20.210> out

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
once again HTC logo just had to fade out

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.050 
once again HTC logo just had to fade out
a<00:02:20.390> bit<00:02:20.600> exact<00:02:24.400> once<00:02:25.400> again<00:02:25.610> this<00:02:25.700> is<00:02:25.820> not<00:02:25.940> the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
a bit exact once again this is not the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.730 
a bit exact once again this is not the
normal<00:02:26.390> boot<00:02:26.570> process<00:02:27.050> this<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.320> just<00:02:27.560> the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
normal boot process this is just the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:36.130 
normal boot process this is just the
very<00:02:28.100> first<00:02:28.280> boot<00:02:34.480> I'll<00:02:35.480> just<00:02:35.690> skip<00:02:35.960> to<00:02:36.110> the

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
very first boot I'll just skip to the
