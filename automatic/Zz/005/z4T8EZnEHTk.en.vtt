00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
okay so today I'm going to be teaching

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.329 
okay so today I'm going to be teaching
you<00:00:02.580> guys<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:03.319> basics<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.470> tweening<00:00:04.920> and

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
you guys the basics of tweening and

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.390 
you guys the basics of tweening and
what's<00:00:06.270> its<00:00:06.480> purpose<00:00:07.160> now<00:00:08.809> first<00:00:09.809> off<00:00:10.050> I'm

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
what's its purpose now first off I'm

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:44.420 
what's its purpose now first off I'm
gonna<00:00:11.400> make<00:00:11.639> an<00:00:11.820> object

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.400 

there's<00:00:45.090> my<00:00:45.270> object<00:00:46.040> and<00:00:47.040> now<00:00:48.260> it's<00:00:49.260> gonna

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
there's my object and now it's gonna

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.680 
there's my object and now it's gonna
make<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.620> into<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> symbol<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:51.330> object

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
make it into a symbol so the object

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.410 
make it into a symbol so the object
stays<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.170> place<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:55.430> say<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.460> want<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.820> go

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
stays in one place and say I want to go

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.150 
stays in one place and say I want to go
across<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.960> screen<00:00:58.170> how<00:00:58.650> I<00:00:58.680> taught<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.010> guys

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
across the screen how I taught you guys

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.820 
across the screen how I taught you guys
is<00:00:59.520> to<00:01:00.060> hit<00:01:00.180> f6<00:01:00.540> move<00:01:00.990> it<00:01:01.110> a<00:01:01.140> little<00:01:01.410> move<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
is to hit f6 move it a little move it a

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.420 
is to hit f6 move it a little move it a
little<00:01:01.860> move<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.400> a<00:01:02.430> little<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.800> this<00:01:04.800> is<00:01:05.160> very

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
little move it a little and this is very

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.320 
little move it a little and this is very
time-consuming<00:01:06.140> and<00:01:07.700> just<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.120> go

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
time-consuming and just for it to go

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.390 
time-consuming and just for it to go
across<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.810> screen<00:01:10.580> rather<00:01:11.580> quickly<00:01:12.980> in<00:01:13.980> fact

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
across the screen rather quickly in fact

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.080 
across the screen rather quickly in fact
in<00:01:15.140> one<00:01:16.140> second<00:01:16.650> because<00:01:16.800> we're<00:01:17.220> 24<00:01:17.700> frames

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
in one second because we're 24 frames

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.840 
in one second because we're 24 frames
per<00:01:18.300> second<00:01:18.690> there's<00:01:18.869> 24<00:01:19.290> frames<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:20.610> took

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
per second there's 24 frames that took

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.480 
per second there's 24 frames that took
me<00:01:21.030> about<00:01:21.270> I'd<00:01:22.050> say<00:01:22.380> maybe<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.890> minute<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.250> make

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
me about I'd say maybe a minute to make

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.609 
me about I'd say maybe a minute to make
and<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.660> a<00:01:24.690> wheel<00:01:24.869> going<00:01:25.140> across<00:01:25.260> really

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
and we have a wheel going across really

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.359 
and we have a wheel going across really
fast<00:01:26.000> now<00:01:27.200> say<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> want<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:28.710> 60<00:01:29.100> frames

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
fast now say I want it like 60 frames

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.430 
fast now say I want it like 60 frames
that<00:01:29.760> take<00:01:30.000> even<00:01:30.270> longer<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.900> I'd<00:01:31.050> have<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.320> be

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
that take even longer and I'd have to be

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.160 
that take even longer and I'd have to be
slower<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.040> more<00:01:32.280> precise<00:01:33.170> what

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
slower with it more precise what

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.830 
slower with it more precise what
tweening<00:01:34.440> does<00:01:34.970> say<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.090> want<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.390> 60<00:01:36.720> frames

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
tweening does say we want at 60 frames

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.300 
tweening does say we want at 60 frames
right<00:01:37.350> click<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.680> 60<00:01:38.300> insert<00:01:39.300> keyframe<00:01:40.310> drag

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
right click on 60 insert keyframe drag

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.760 
right click on 60 insert keyframe drag
this<00:01:41.640> across<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.479> screen<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:43.320> where<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.560> want

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
this across the screen to where you want

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.060 
this across the screen to where you want
it<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> want<00:01:44.580> it<00:01:44.610> right<00:01:44.729> about<00:01:44.910> there<00:01:44.970> and

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
it so I want it right about there and

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.470 
it so I want it right about there and
then<00:01:47.070> if<00:01:47.190> we<00:01:47.340> right<00:01:47.790> click<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:49.260> one<00:01:50.480> then

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
then if we right click on this one then

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.640 
then if we right click on this one then
do<00:01:51.720> create<00:01:52.230> classic<00:01:52.920> tween<00:01:54.320> then<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.470> does

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
do create classic tween then it does

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:04.399 
do create classic tween then it does
this<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:58.520> that's<00:01:59.520> what<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.730> wanted<00:02:01.370> now<00:02:03.409> we

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
this and that's what I wanted now we

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.770 
this and that's what I wanted now we
could<00:02:04.560> take<00:02:04.710> that

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.040 

and<00:02:10.869> do<00:02:11.620> this<00:02:13.740> well<00:02:14.740> bring<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.220> right<00:02:15.490> about

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
and do this well bring that right about

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:25.760 
and do this well bring that right about
there<00:02:18.180> take<00:02:19.180> both<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.420> these<00:02:19.690> put<00:02:20.320> them<00:02:20.350> there

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:37.970 

and<00:04:24.370> give<00:04:25.370> it<00:04:25.400> a

like<00:04:48.759> that

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.990 

and<00:04:54.980> then<00:04:55.580> what<00:04:55.730> we<00:04:55.850> have<00:04:55.880> is<00:04:56.530> this<00:04:57.820> so<00:04:58.820> we<00:04:58.910> have

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
and then what we have is this so we have

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.460 
and then what we have is this so we have
a<00:04:59.030> car<00:04:59.270> going<00:04:59.510> across<00:04:59.750> like<00:05:00.080> that<00:05:00.580> now<00:05:02.320> to<00:05:03.320> do

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
a car going across like that now to do

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.350 
a car going across like that now to do
that<00:05:03.710> that<00:05:04.580> would<00:05:04.760> have<00:05:04.850> took<00:05:05.030> a<00:05:05.150> lot<00:05:05.330> longer

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
that that would have took a lot longer

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.810 
that that would have took a lot longer
to<00:05:05.690> get<00:05:05.900> 60<00:05:06.260> frames<00:05:06.290> to<00:05:06.710> do<00:05:06.800> that<00:05:06.980> tweening

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
to get 60 frames to do that tweening

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.380 
to get 60 frames to do that tweening
makes<00:05:08.150> it<00:05:08.330> nice<00:05:08.480> and<00:05:08.510> fast<00:05:09.970> but<00:05:10.970> another<00:05:11.150> thing

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
makes it nice and fast but another thing

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.080 
makes it nice and fast but another thing
tweening<00:05:11.690> can<00:05:11.960> do<00:05:12.110> is<00:05:12.440> this<00:05:13.430> will<00:05:13.670> always<00:05:13.940> be

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
tweening can do is this will always be

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.610 
tweening can do is this will always be
like<00:05:14.270> this<00:05:14.300> and<00:05:14.810> now<00:05:15.050> we<00:05:15.080> could<00:05:15.320> screw<00:05:15.530> around

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
like this and now we could screw around

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.560 
like this and now we could screw around
with<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:16.160> cymbals<00:05:16.550> so<00:05:17.030> if<00:05:17.120> I<00:05:17.180> click<00:05:17.360> on<00:05:17.420> the

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
with the cymbals so if I click on the

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.800 
with the cymbals so if I click on the
car<00:05:18.760> well<00:05:19.760> double<00:05:20.060> click<00:05:20.180> on<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.390> car<00:05:20.540> so<00:05:20.690> now

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
car well double click on the car so now

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.750 
car well double click on the car so now
I'm<00:05:20.870> inside<00:05:21.200> the<00:05:21.320> car<00:05:21.530> cymbal<00:05:21.920> double<00:05:22.610> click

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
I'm inside the car cymbal double click

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.010 
I'm inside the car cymbal double click
on<00:05:22.850> the<00:05:22.970> wheels<00:05:23.180> and<00:05:23.510> I'm<00:05:23.570> on<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:23.840> wheel

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
on the wheels and I'm on the wheel

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.590 
on the wheels and I'm on the wheel
cymbal<00:05:24.560> and<00:05:24.920> then<00:05:25.580> double<00:05:25.880> click<00:05:26.030> on<00:05:26.150> it<00:05:26.300> again

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
cymbal and then double click on it again

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.250 
cymbal and then double click on it again
whoops<00:05:27.560> actually<00:05:29.050> not<00:05:30.050> again<00:05:32.020> highlight<00:05:33.020> all

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
whoops actually not again highlight all

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:40.960 
whoops actually not again highlight all
of<00:05:33.410> it<00:05:36.730> yeah<00:05:37.730> highlight<00:05:38.090> all<00:05:38.240> of<00:05:38.360> it<00:05:39.760> zoom<00:05:40.760> into

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
of it yeah highlight all of it zoom into

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:50.640 
of it yeah highlight all of it zoom into
it<00:05:44.320> get<00:05:45.320> the<00:05:45.530> transform<00:05:46.400> tool<00:05:48.400> hit<00:05:49.400> f6<00:05:49.820> and

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
it get the transform tool hit f6 and

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.770 
it get the transform tool hit f6 and
rotate<00:05:51.650> it<00:05:54.760> two<00:05:55.760> times<00:05:56.000> see<00:05:56.270> how<00:05:56.360> like<00:05:56.570> well

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
rotate it two times see how like well

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.960 
rotate it two times see how like well
like<00:05:57.230> -<00:05:57.560> like<00:05:57.770> little<00:05:58.100> like<00:05:58.280> see<00:05:58.610> how<00:05:58.670> it<00:05:58.700> stops

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
like - like little like see how it stops

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.700 
like - like little like see how it stops
there<00:05:59.330> and<00:05:59.480> it<00:06:00.050> stops<00:06:00.320> there

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
there and it stops there

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.440 
there and it stops there
so<00:06:00.860> rotate<00:06:01.220> it<00:06:01.690> -<00:06:02.690> to<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:02.960> right

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
so rotate it - to the right

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:10.870 
so rotate it - to the right
f6<00:06:06.970> to<00:06:07.970> the<00:06:08.150> right<00:06:08.330> again<00:06:09.400> to<00:06:10.400> the<00:06:10.610> right<00:06:10.760> again

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
f6 to the right again to the right again

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.240 
f6 to the right again to the right again
so<00:06:11.330> now<00:06:11.480> this<00:06:11.750> which<00:06:12.050> was<00:06:12.230> at<00:06:12.380> top<00:06:12.620> is<00:06:12.860> now<00:06:13.010> over

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
so now this which was at top is now over

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.910 
so now this which was at top is now over
there<00:06:13.870> f6<00:06:15.490> -<00:06:16.490> to<00:06:16.610> the<00:06:16.700> right<00:06:16.820> again<00:06:17.770> to<00:06:18.770> the

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:18.920 
there f6 - to the right again to the

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.210 
there f6 - to the right again to the
right<00:06:19.010> again<00:06:20.170> to<00:06:21.170> the<00:06:21.320> right<00:06:21.440> again<00:06:21.560> now<00:06:22.160> the

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
right again to the right again now the

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:28.060 
right again to the right again now the
wheel<00:06:22.460> went<00:06:22.820> 180<00:06:23.510> degrees<00:06:26.860> to<00:06:27.860> the<00:06:28.040> right

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
wheel went 180 degrees to the right

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:34.300 
wheel went 180 degrees to the right
again<00:06:28.990> to<00:06:29.990> the<00:06:30.170> right<00:06:30.290> again<00:06:30.410> I<00:06:33.130> screwed<00:06:34.130> up<00:06:34.160> a

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
again to the right again I screwed up a

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.710 
again to the right again I screwed up a
little<00:06:34.460> there<00:06:34.790> but<00:06:35.000> you<00:06:35.300> won't<00:06:35.450> be<00:06:35.540> able<00:06:35.630> to

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
little there but you won't be able to

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.220 
little there but you won't be able to
see<00:06:35.900> that<00:06:36.080> that<00:06:36.230> much<00:06:36.730> -<00:06:37.730> again<00:06:38.060> -<00:06:38.860> again<00:06:39.860> -

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
see that that much - again - again -

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.790 
see that that much - again - again -
again<00:06:42.230> I<00:06:42.380> now<00:06:42.560> made<00:06:42.940> 360<00:06:44.320> but<00:06:45.320> the<00:06:45.440> last<00:06:45.620> one

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
again I now made 360 but the last one

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.830 
again I now made 360 but the last one
actually<00:06:46.730> you<00:06:47.030> don't<00:06:47.210> want<00:06:47.390> to<00:06:47.510> you<00:06:47.630> want<00:06:47.780> to

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 
actually you don't want to you want to

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.560 
actually you don't want to you want to
get<00:06:47.960> rid<00:06:48.080> of<00:06:48.110> the<00:06:48.230> last<00:06:48.380> one<00:06:48.590> making<00:06:48.860> it<00:06:48.890> 360<00:06:49.880> so

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.570 
get rid of the last one making it 360 so

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.140 
get rid of the last one making it 360 so
just<00:06:51.230> remove<00:06:51.650> that<00:06:51.680> frame<00:06:52.280> which<00:06:52.820> is<00:06:52.850> right

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
just remove that frame which is right

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.750 
just remove that frame which is right
there<00:06:53.180> and<00:06:53.710> you<00:06:54.710> want<00:06:54.920> to<00:06:55.040> stop<00:06:55.280> where<00:06:55.580> it's

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:55.760 
there and you want to stop where it's

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.910 
there and you want to stop where it's
right<00:06:56.060> before<00:06:56.270> it<00:06:56.540> makes<00:06:56.720> the<00:06:56.870> 360<00:06:57.530> because

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:57.920 
right before it makes the 360 because

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.230 
right before it makes the 360 because
it's<00:06:58.220> going<00:06:58.400> to<00:06:58.460> loop<00:06:58.640> back<00:06:58.820> over<00:06:59.060> to<00:06:59.150> the

00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 
it's going to loop back over to the

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.660 
it's going to loop back over to the
first<00:06:59.360> one<00:06:59.690> which<00:06:59.960> is<00:06:59.990> already<00:07:00.340> 360<00:07:01.340> degrees

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:01.670 
first one which is already 360 degrees

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.760 
first one which is already 360 degrees
so<00:07:02.360> now<00:07:02.450> if<00:07:02.510> we<00:07:02.570> click<00:07:02.780> out<00:07:02.930> of<00:07:03.050> that<00:07:03.200> because

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770 
so now if we click out of that because

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.520 
so now if we click out of that because
we<00:07:04.040> made<00:07:04.250> that<00:07:04.430> inside<00:07:04.850> the<00:07:05.000> symbol<00:07:05.380> we<00:07:06.380> also

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:06.530 
we made that inside the symbol we also

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.470 
we made that inside the symbol we also
made<00:07:06.800> it<00:07:06.920> for<00:07:07.100> that<00:07:07.220> wheel<00:07:07.400> too

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:08.480 
made it for that wheel too

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.110 
made it for that wheel too
out<00:07:08.660> of<00:07:08.810> that<00:07:10.870> zoom<00:07:11.870> out<00:07:12.020> and<00:07:12.850> then<00:07:13.850> if<00:07:13.940> we<00:07:14.030> were

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 
out of that zoom out and then if we were

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.690 
out of that zoom out and then if we were
to<00:07:14.210> test<00:07:14.420> the<00:07:14.540> movie<00:07:15.250> now<00:07:16.250> it<00:07:16.370> looks<00:07:16.520> like<00:07:16.670> a

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:16.700 
to test the movie now it looks like a

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.760 
to test the movie now it looks like a
car<00:07:17.000> moving<00:07:17.150> with<00:07:17.420> wheels<00:07:17.630> while<00:07:18.470> the<00:07:18.620> wheels

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770 
car moving with wheels while the wheels

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.820 
car moving with wheels while the wheels
rotating<00:07:19.370> and<00:07:19.900> if<00:07:20.900> we<00:07:21.080> were<00:07:21.200> to<00:07:21.350> try<00:07:21.560> to<00:07:21.590> make

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:21.830 
rotating and if we were to try to make

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.490 
rotating and if we were to try to make
that<00:07:22.070> in<00:07:22.430> just<00:07:23.390> doing<00:07:23.840> frame<00:07:24.140> after<00:07:24.350> frame

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:24.500 
that in just doing frame after frame

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.370 
that in just doing frame after frame
after<00:07:24.890> frame<00:07:25.510> without<00:07:26.510> any<00:07:26.870> tweening

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:27.380 
after frame without any tweening

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.460 
after frame without any tweening
that<00:07:28.190> would<00:07:28.490> have<00:07:28.580> taken<00:07:28.820> probably<00:07:29.570> about<00:07:30.080> a

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:30.470 
that would have taken probably about a

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.860 
that would have taken probably about a
good<00:07:30.950> 1<00:07:31.460> or<00:07:31.610> 2<00:07:31.760> hours<00:07:31.790> just<00:07:32.210> to<00:07:32.720> make<00:07:32.840> it

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:32.870 
good 1 or 2 hours just to make it

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.220 
good 1 or 2 hours just to make it
perfect<00:07:33.440> like<00:07:33.590> this<00:07:33.800> this<00:07:34.610> took<00:07:35.030> not<00:07:35.690> even<00:07:36.020> 10

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:36.230 
perfect like this this took not even 10

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.270
