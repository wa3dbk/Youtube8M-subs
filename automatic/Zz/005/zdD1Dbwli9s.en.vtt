because a lot of that stuff wasn't on
blu-ray<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:17.190> know<00:02:17.340> but<00:02:17.640> had<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.690> get<00:02:18.870> it

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
blu-ray you know but had to get it

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.020 
blu-ray you know but had to get it
because<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.230> bought<00:02:19.470> all<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.680> crap<00:02:20.030> Royal

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030

Rumble<00:02:21.390> 2010<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.440> very<00:02:22.800> good<00:02:22.980> Royal<00:02:23.190> Rumble<00:02:23.610> but

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.580 
Rumble 2010 a very good Royal Rumble but
I<00:02:24.660> think<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:24.900> was<00:02:24.989> much<00:02:25.140> better<00:02:25.290> than<00:02:25.380> this

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590

I think it was much better than this
year<00:02:25.769> because<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.070> didn't<00:02:26.310> waste<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:26.700> on

experience<00:02:49.650> oh<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.230> think<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.680> just

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
experience oh and I think that just

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.800 
experience oh and I think that just
about<00:02:53.220> does<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.940> think<00:02:53.970> that's<00:02:54.329> all<00:02:54.570> the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
about does it I think that's all the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.310 
about does it I think that's all the
ones<00:02:55.049> that<00:02:55.380> came<00:02:55.769> out<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.220> far<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:57.019> mean<00:02:58.019> I<00:02:58.110> could

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
ones that came out so far I mean I could

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.640 
ones that came out so far I mean I could
be<00:02:58.500> wrong<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.459> know<00:03:00.079> but<00:03:01.079> for<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.260> most<00:03:01.440> part

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
be wrong you know but for the most part

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.170 
be wrong you know but for the most part
