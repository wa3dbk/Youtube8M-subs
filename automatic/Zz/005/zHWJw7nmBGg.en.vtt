00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.180
 the stops the pit is believed and welcome to 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.799
 the clay of the m 417 possibly a 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.750
 of the best weapons for the class of 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.859
 recognition and we are around here the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.389
 count the videos are not for 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:17.220
 demonstrate skills but to see 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.619
 how to function in the hands of a puppet 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.720
 average as I am also if I do not 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.329
 I have to comment can comment with 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.380
 the word currency so know that being in 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.509
 the fifth is put coin in the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.060
 comments and well we started with what 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.130
 which is the grid of the m-45 17 the m 4 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.070
 without 17 in real life it is rather the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.860
 girl of 400 and 7 because girl because 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.870
 comes from clan with the clan with the company 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.800
 German that manufactures this weapon and its 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.660
 variants like the m 27 and the girl 416 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.120
 that are also in the game was 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.060
 is produced since 2005 that uses 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.100
 Ammunition of 7.62 x 51 mm 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.380
 the naan this because this is because it is a 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.870
 good medium rifle sniper rifle 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.790
 maximum no good battle rifle that is 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.310
 a longer barrel compared to what 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.439
 that would be the 416 m to give a 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.689
 idea that this weapon is for longer 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.480
 distance rather than a cadence of 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.890
 shots of 600 shots per minute something 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.680
 much higher 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.570
 what is the game raised to 3 already 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.760
 going to for 2003 this is not 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.190
 unlockable through what will be the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.979
 team player challenge this challenge 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.159
 consists of having obviously the first 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.440
 expansion of klosters and then do 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.080
 that your expansion is activated 10 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.880
 assists with the tves module which is the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.340
 sensor module that plant the soil 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.979
 like little cucumber on the ground and 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.600
 capture 20 flags in the conquest or 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.740
 quick conquest 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.990
 after that it is automatically 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.119
 available through the class of 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.560
 recognition has enough damage 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.410
 peculiar that leaves all models 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.860
 with 50 damage up to a distance of 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.500
 15 meters and down to a minimum of 37.5 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.780
 to a minimum where it starts at 75 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.580
 meters this makes it possibly this 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.259
 weapon is perfect for body combat 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.210
 body but its cadence shot the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.460
 limits a bit because because obviously 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.770
 50 in someone and they give him a shot in the 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.690
 head is automatically a death of 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.239
 a single shot in what has peculiar 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.709
 is this weapon that within 15 meters to 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.410
 whatever you give your head is going to be 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.740
 a death from a shot and that 37.5 does 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.930
 that anyone who 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.000
 in the distance it does not matter that it is 100 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.040
 meters this weapon will always kill 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.350
 three shots nothing more and nothing less 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.300
 obviously saying that they are not headsets 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.670
 some of them because obviously with 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.400
 two head shops is already absolutely more 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.690
 that killed another feature so 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.970
 that this weapon is pretty good for 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.980
 recognition class is that more than 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.500
 nothing has 20 bullets in the charger anymore 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.930
 a bullet in the chamber so it's 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.790
 they will realize that good is double what 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.140
 which is an average sniper rifle 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.050
 of which we are talking about being everything 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.090
 the 98 b element but it's pretty 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.740
 pretty useful for moving around with 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.110
 this weapon and not have to be recharged 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.030
 so so often but eye 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.230
 recharge is also the fastest if not 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.600
 I'm wrong about the whole class of 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.390
 recognition with 1.80 seconds as 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.860
 they have bullets in the chamber and 2.40 empty 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.360
 that is, it can kill someone and 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.610
 recharge without any problem what can 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.140
 do virtually automatically without 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.690
 that you realize this way of ops and 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.940
 recharge either way or what does not matter is 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.290
 quite pretty good and is old much 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.690
 better than you are recharging 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.160
 constantly since that way those 20 bullets 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.870
 they will never be finished if they fall 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.660
 problems can use those 20 bullets 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.700
 when you 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.740
 it is what the cadence of shots needs 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.270
 is more or less limited is not so fast 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.230
 as the s falls I know that it is the most 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:36.020
 comparable of 200 thousand 95 295 shots 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.150
 per minute what good maybe if they arrive 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.010
 is 295 already doing it wrong 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.230
 unless they are very close is 295 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.730
 should never reach that maximum because 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.800
 because also the imprecision of this 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.540
 gun firing is not very good then 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.760
 let's see him talk a little more about that 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.830
 forward with precision or express or 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.270
 opening as you want to say the 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.280
 speed that this bullet has when leaving 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.020
 of the barrel is 450 meters above 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.630
 second and I must say that it is quite 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.060
 good slow not so slow as the sks 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.620
 but you must definitely realize 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.050
 that should point much higher than 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.850
 head long distance and a little 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.590
 later on where he's running from 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.560
 enemy player so that you can 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.000
 give him the bullets in time modes 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.400
 shot that this weapon has only is 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.260
 the semiautomatic one there is no more you 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.489
 click for bullet and the bullet reaches 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.959
 its objective 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.850
 the recoil shooting pattern is 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.850
 pretty pretty good you should say that 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.740
 is one of the best of all the game with 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.590
 1.15 up 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.230
 - point 0 5 to the left and be 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.480
 25 on the right pretty controllable 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.520
 much more control and even that what 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.220
 It's the one that that's good is pretty 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.720
 quite controllable the sk s the 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.930
 precision that you have pointing from the 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.130
 look without moving from 0.05 only 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.140
 overcome by the rifles of 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.000
 sniper as such and this makes 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.770
 be more accurate than what is the sks 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.140
 since the hip is not as accurate as 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.150
 the sk s but good more or less 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.820
 defends better than the other rifles with 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.340
 a precision 3.0 of course if you 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.710
 approach zero is more accurate 3.0 is no 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.550
 as accurate as others for example the s 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.380
 k s has 2.25 2.5 forgiveness and really what 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.090
 what is wrong is the fact that if 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.950
 you are moving a lot the 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.450
 precision is going to scrub this 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.220
 weapon so they rather have to 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.960
 be still when they are shooting 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.310
 that is, they are running, they can be 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.810
 jumping one side to the other 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.420
 but it is found in someone who en 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.920
 stand still and shoot and take your time now 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.660
 that that firing rate is also 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.460
 can get a little control and maybe 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.780
 that sight opening for each shot is 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.030
 You will open and they will lose a lot 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.980
 precision that they would be winning with 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.470
 good shoot with a little more than 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.090
 time and without moving and all that 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.920
 and be elevated to a rating of 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.080
 four slices of pizza on four 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.180
 since it was easily from the 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.590
 better if not that it is the best weapon if 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.600
 you will find sniper rifles 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.070
 in the recognition class very 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.320
 versatile even though I can not 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.480
 use at such a long distance can 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.980
 use the long half even short 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.420
 distance to defend himself enough 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.880
 well if you have patience for 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.430
 make each click at the right time not 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.200
 they leave us to click on click click 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.580
 click click until they can give you a 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.530
 objective but that you take the 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.930
 time and remember that you have a power 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.150
 50 to 37 points of damage 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.590
 powerful that no other weapon is going to 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.540
 be able to put less action 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.790
 sniper as such when 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.380
 attachments I definitely loved 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.000
 the fact of using a cobra at the beginning 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.280
 to use a holographic but the 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.200
 you that do not know what you can 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.180
 embrace and lose easily in what 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.950
 It would be the zoom that has the holographic 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.680
 no matter how little it is definitely 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.060
 I prefer a cobra in this weapon if 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.860
 they use another look that is not for 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.900
 example the holographic or a look of 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.610
 red dot are definitely not 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.380
 using the good for that better 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.690
 use a sniper rifle that 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.830
 it will be much more useful with more damage and 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.990
 that can also put a 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.940
 of this amount of zoom that you 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.770
 would like to use without losing so much to 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.600
 long distance as others 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.450
 own attachments a little bit with what 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.010
 It would be based bipod but 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.690
 I did not really liked the fact 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.800
 to stand with this weapon since I do not 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.420
 it's so powerful with a rifle 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.850
 sniper and you're very exposed to 

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:04.610
 be still about the front wing 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.260
 I do not think it's a big improvement and in fact 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.180
 long distance takes away a bit of 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.770
 precision did not show too much 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.300
 then if you want to use it combat 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.590
 melee or media mode 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.630
 distance can definitely 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.710
 use is not mandatory since the 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.420
 pattern to dispose is pretty 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.640
 Controllable with or without handle 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.950
 then that also brings us to what 

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.590
 be the last the last modification that 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.660
 would be between a lamp a laser sight and 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.760
 really look at it laser I should say that 

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.280
 it worked for me they still worked but if 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.600
 you are going too fast look 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.400
 laser is not going to do them miracles is 

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.380
 say you shoot in the time that 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.720
 you need and therefore really not 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:41.870
 They must use another one more 

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.550
 that looks at it I do not know did not give me a certain 

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.750
 air as he said is the 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.790
 City Council of El Ejido more than 

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.470
 use a good look I hope that you 

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.729
