00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
play the hi-hat nice and straight so

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.390 
play the hi-hat nice and straight so
what<00:01:26.920> I<00:01:26.950> find<00:01:27.310> is<00:01:27.490> that<00:01:28.170> I'm<00:01:29.170> more<00:01:30.040> and<00:01:30.310> more

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
what I find is that I'm more and more

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.660 
what I find is that I'm more and more
attending<00:01:31.030> to<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.720> play<00:01:31.960> a<00:01:32.290> bit<00:01:33.130> of<00:01:33.160> an<00:01:33.310> accent

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
attending to to play a bit of an accent

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.700 
attending to to play a bit of an accent
on<00:01:33.910> the<00:01:34.360> on<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.690> hi-hat<00:01:34.840> particularly<00:01:35.530> on<00:01:35.620> the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
on the on the hi-hat particularly on the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.790 
on the on the hi-hat particularly on the
downbeats<00:01:36.450> sort<00:01:37.450> of<00:01:37.540> so<00:01:38.320> you<00:01:38.380> still<00:01:38.620> got<00:01:38.710> the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
downbeats sort of so you still got the

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.110 
downbeats sort of so you still got the
subdivision<00:01:39.310> happening<00:01:39.700> with<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:39.940> eighth

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
subdivision happening with the eighth

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.950 
subdivision happening with the eighth
notes<00:01:40.390> but<00:01:40.660> it<00:01:40.810> ends<00:01:40.990> up<00:01:41.020> being<00:01:41.200> more<00:01:41.350> like

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
notes but it ends up being more like

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.200 
notes but it ends up being more like
this<00:01:46.979> what<00:01:47.979> I<00:01:48.010> find<00:01:48.340> that<00:01:48.490> helps<00:01:48.820> is<00:01:48.970> just

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
this what I find that helps is just

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.300 
this what I find that helps is just
solidify<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.080> time<00:01:50.470> or<00:01:50.800> keep<00:01:50.979> it<00:01:51.100> nice<00:01:51.280> and

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
solidify the time or keep it nice and

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.330 
solidify the time or keep it nice and
nice<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:52.330> set<00:01:52.990> all<00:01:53.440> right<00:01:53.500> having<00:01:54.040> said<00:01:54.310> that

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
nice and set all right having said that

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.070 
nice and set all right having said that
you<00:01:54.700> can<00:01:54.850> also<00:01:55.030> start<00:01:55.479> to<00:01:55.600> muck<00:01:55.750> around<00:01:55.870> a

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080

you can also start to muck around a
little<00:01:56.140> bit<00:01:56.320> with<00:01:56.470> with<00:01:56.920> moving<00:01:57.250> on<00:01:57.430> to<00:01:57.520> off

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
little bit with with moving on to off
