00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.230
 how to make an object elevator in 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.230
 minecraft let's start 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.680
 the return auction touring the 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.690
 páramos the most extensive videos of this 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.670
 great world and of course I was 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.890
 back in search of his great friend 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.810
 I also left the brake to see if this time 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.460
 It takes you how to make you spotted a house 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.890
 quite curious in the god that was 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.780
 surrounded by emeralds and not clear to 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.850
 planes love emeralds and os 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.350
 it remains girl for the curiosity of a couple 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.940
 of emerald crops which 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.650
 it seemed something revolutionary and good 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.230
 some day they would like to plant that would be 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.910
 great but in the event that it 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.320
 complete was inside and of course 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.090
 they wanted to start a conversation or 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.260
 I thought I'm doing how you're friend look 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.430
 that I was looking for because I wanted that 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.990
 my ideas how to do an elevator 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.510
 objects because it is very cool and 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.010
 entertaining by measuring Cuba recently 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.380
 I invented a ticket elevator 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.240
 lines back there you can see how it works 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.280
 and once a little you get involved in the 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.229
 I'll show you how to do it without 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.090
 men more than jenson a look you'll see 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.090
 what fun is it good guys 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.530
 looking more like an object elevator 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.869
 process 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.280
 apart from good transportation 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.710
 guys as you can appreciate there in front 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.350
 the balls are propelled slide up 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.060
 and here we have the automatic system with 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.590
 which dispensers for the balls of 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.149
 year automatically as it is also 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.880
 pretty simple to do here on the brake 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.320
 Well, if it's good, you can take power 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.710
 explain less than one and I will propel 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.710
 the hybrid 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:02:01.509
 First of ice 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.860
 and of course any type of block 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.970
 and the valleys, well, guys, what 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.320
 first thing we have to do is the 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.300
 structure that comes on screen with the 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.010
 block later we will have to put 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.480
 blocks of ice in front of the dispenser 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.800
 until you reach the corner where you 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.390
 we put a block of ice but more 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.459
 forward we will put are more already two is 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.720
 perfect then when we put the berries 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.830
 the first fence can not be in 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.569
 contact with other blocks so 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.160
 we will have to put two blocks of 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.569
 crystal but then the second fence so 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.069
 that we have to put what is normal 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.630
 is one of those that we have chosen since yes 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.739
 that they have to interconnect and more 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.030
 after this what we would have to 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.980
 to do is to cover everything with glass 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.600
 up to the height that we want since not 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.790
 no limit and best of all is that the 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.260
 end of that structure we can put 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.269
 a hopper and a chest where it goes to 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.430
 collect all the objects is for me 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.019
 your position master deputy pérez or if 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.870
 guys who do not forget to put the cube 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.269
 of fair water 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.890
 in front of the dispenser so that as 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.799
 you see the objects take a speed 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.690
 hypersonic and they propel themselves up 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.610
 but if you also have to remember a 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.129
 very important thing is best to coat 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.349
 all the whole structure with him what 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.409
 you want since you have to swell the 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.030
 objects jump out of the circuit and 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.620
 Well obviously we do not want that but 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.060
 as you see if they resort super 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.560
 perfectly and to do the 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.659
 automatic dispenser you will have to 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.980
 replicate the circuit of this that you see in 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.750
 part in the county without needing 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.730
 repeaters and a comparator and a little bit 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.230
 of resistor is quite simple the truth 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.030
 As you can see, you put a block and it comes out 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.950
 automatically I recommend that you paris 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.910
 the video at the moment you see the 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.910
 circuit
