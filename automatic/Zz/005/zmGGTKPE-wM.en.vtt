00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 now nice children welcome 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.819
 again this is your channel 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.259
 remember that my name is fences and a 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.910
 video every week of 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.790
 identification as it says titles them 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.309
 I will teach to recycle these clothes with 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.780
 two ideas that I have for you so 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.490
 let's start so this does not come out 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.449
 very fast 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:25.599
 What we need is a jacket of 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:28.210
 denim that you do not use old lady in 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:31.390
 this time I chose this one that was from 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.770
 my mom and he no longer uses 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.770
 a shirt 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.630
 or shirt that is no longer 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:47.810
 you use and it is that this orange color 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:50.450
 pen scissors thread and needle applications 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.190
 and I chose these that are like diamonds 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.879
 and these peaks and a chain 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.860
 the silicone and silicon gun for the 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.649
 first idea let's place our 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.839
 t-shirt on a flat surface and let's go 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.780
 to draw the drawing that we want 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.049
 this time I'm going to work 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:15.000
 I'm going to draw a shirt on the 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.000
 back of my shirt 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.690
 This way doing once goes up 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.770
 and the sleeves I'm going to open 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.730
 and we're going to cut it just for the part 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.730
 behind 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.590
 once you have trimmed the mold 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.830
 of your play of your shirt like you the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.560
 I want what I did was cut him 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.710
 all the edges this way to all 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.869
 the shirt and I cut two strips of 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.020
 approximately one centimeter wide 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.270
 of the sleeves that I had left and what 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.340
 I'm going to do is going to be the next thing I'm going to 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.160
 flip my shirt 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.790
 and from the part of the sleeves I'm going to 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.770
 sew back with the strips that I 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.210
 left over 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.920
 A) Yes 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.920
 cross way 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.129
 towards here and in the other 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.129
 to dry 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:39.739
 here I'm just going to make a small 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.739
 sewing and we're going to decorate it with 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.790
 the studs and with the chain so 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.409
 let's see how the first option is 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.939
 for our next idea the only thing that 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.790
 we have to make the jacket of 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:53.769
 denim is to take off the sleeves of this 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.930
 way and decorate with the bolsters 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.239
 We do not throw these sleeves because 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.760
 later I will make a video of how 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.629
 reuse those making a portfolio like this 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:08.700
 let's see how our 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.700
 ideas to recycle our clothes 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:14.799
 in this way we build our two 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.959
 ideas of renewing our clothes and I'm going 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.629
 to explain more or less what happened 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.849
 What I did was cut my mold in the 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.010
 parts of the edges just cut 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.870
 in this way and what this 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.470
 chain sarkozy with the habits that 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.870
 I had and I hit these these pear trees 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.870
 cross way and it stays that way 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:46.010
 then the part of the cross remains and remains 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.010
 very father and our logical fact 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:54.040
 I did not want to clog stuff bag 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.099
 install papers in the parts of the 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:01.250
 neck and in the pouches and it's super 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:03.320
 super father our two cars 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.760
 then remember that if you liked it 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.930
 sometimes 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.120
 and then remember that if you are going to do 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.970
 one of those two ideas do not forget 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.780
 send me the photos to my facebook 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.840
 with the hashtag I'm up and I'm going to show 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.020
 very much to have seen that you 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.910
 they made a desalination of these ideas 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.610
 he also wants to tell you that I just 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.010
 receive a few minutes ago touched and I 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.620
 a package arrived and I'm going to show you that 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.460
 it is in fact already you will have it but I am going to 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.250
 teach 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.199
 is this portfolio that I asked for online 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.440
 truth is that I usually never 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:45.080
 bought nothing online because with the 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.530
 fear that my 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.849
 asked and with the fear that many of 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.819
 those times you buy it online 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:55.460
 in the picture it looks super cute and when 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:57.169
 they buy it because it does not turn out to be that way but 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.990
 here it was totally different because 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:04.220
 this portfolio is a wallet portfolio is 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:07.070
 a brand is Mexican 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.380
 they are super cheap and I am 100% of the 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.730
 hand and they are Mexican and the truth is that 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.230
 I highly recommend you buy in 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.840

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.790

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.710
 portfolio that your haughty I'm going to 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.510
 fix some of you and the only thing 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.730
 what they have to do is comment in the 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.910
 bottom part of the comments in 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:31.310

 who will be our wallet ok 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.620

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.960
