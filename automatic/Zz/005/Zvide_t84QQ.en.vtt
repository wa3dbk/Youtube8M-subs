00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
actually there were some specimens which

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.729 
actually there were some specimens which
had<00:00:59.940> characters<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> bus<00:01:00.690> but<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.469> were<00:01:01.590> dealing

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
had characters a bus but we were dealing

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.030 
had characters a bus but we were dealing
with<00:01:01.890> fragments<00:01:02.550> now<00:01:03.180> we<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.780> two<00:01:04.470> skeletons

is a an open question I know this kind

is a an open question I know this kind
of<00:01:24.900> research<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> painstaking<00:01:25.890> process<00:01:26.610> it

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
of research is a painstaking process it

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.230 
of research is a painstaking process it
takes<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.960> lot<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.259> time<00:01:28.710> at<00:01:29.040> some<00:01:29.640> point<00:01:30.000> is

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
takes a lot of time at some point is

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.910 
takes a lot of time at some point is
there<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> Eureka<00:01:30.900> moment<00:01:31.079> here<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.770> or

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
there a Eureka moment here for you or

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.280 
there a Eureka moment here for you or
does<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.189> gradually<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:33.329> come<00:01:33.659> together<00:01:33.869> a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
does it gradually all come together a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.679 
does it gradually all come together a
Eureka<00:01:35.009> moment<00:01:35.189> certainly<00:01:35.939> when<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.240> find<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
Eureka moment certainly when you find a

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.780 
Eureka moment certainly when you find a
new<00:01:36.720> fossil<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.950> recognize<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.670> as

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
new fossil and you recognize it as

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.490 
new fossil and you recognize it as
something<00:01:39.119> different<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.930> know<00:01:40.110> Charles

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
something different you know Charles

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.530 
something different you know Charles
Darwin<00:01:40.950> had<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.280> same<00:01:41.490> problem<00:01:41.909> when<00:01:42.180> he<00:01:42.329> had

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
Darwin had the same problem when he had

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.510 
Darwin had the same problem when he had
a<00:01:42.570> Eureka<00:01:42.810> moment<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.560> recognized<00:01:44.009> distinct

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
a Eureka moment and recognized distinct

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.730 
a Eureka moment and recognized distinct
species<00:01:44.759> things<00:01:45.600> were<00:01:45.750> easy<00:01:45.960> when<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> sample

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
species things were easy when the sample

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.100 
species things were easy when the sample
sizes<00:01:46.950> were<00:01:47.220> small<00:01:47.549> but<00:01:48.090> as<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.450> sample<00:01:48.869> sizes

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
sizes were small but as the sample sizes

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.920 
sizes were small but as the sample sizes
increase<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.640> find<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.329> boundaries

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
increase you find that boundaries

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.410

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
hominid fossils and yes there's a Eureka

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
moment when you find in something really

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.980 
moment when you find in something really

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
fiona's that was a Eureka moment it

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.780 
fiona's that was a Eureka moment it
confirmed<00:02:16.380> what<00:02:16.650> Charles<00:02:17.040> Darwin<00:02:17.070> had<00:02:17.520> said

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790

that Africa was the Cradle of Humankind

have had a Eureka moment in recognizing

have had a Eureka moment in recognizing
something<00:02:25.740> distinctly<00:02:26.520> different<00:02:26.760> but<00:02:27.690> what

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
something distinctly different but what

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.320 
something distinctly different but what
follows<00:02:28.470> from<00:02:28.740> that<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:29.220> my<00:02:29.640> goodness<00:02:30.060> how

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
follows from that is my goodness how

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.740 
follows from that is my goodness how
does<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.200> relate<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:33.180> nature<00:02:33.600> of

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
does this relate to the the nature of

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.260 
does this relate to the the nature of

the human family tree is it a tree

the human family tree is it a tree
is<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.930> bush<00:02:37.230> or<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.400> thicket<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:40.350> what

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
is it a bush or is it a thicket so what

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.490 
is it a bush or is it a thicket so what
