 Say directly upload to take a video from after a long time normally that mobile 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.230
 A very simple task 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.800
 What 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.360
 Let's go with it 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:48.110
 What should this give priority to negligence? 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.000
 I thought about how to prioritize time and update frequency , etc. 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.520
 Oh dear 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.750
 By goods 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.840
 Sometimes I want to go over while changing 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.500
 We decided to do I think it or say 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:06.320
 Finally does not let take is from even You're mobile today 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:09.580

 Masu Toka part we've put out in that shop 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:21.230
 I can not show my sister for a while because wrapping already lives 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:23.280
 You opponent will go that I think still want to introduce yet statements that are not doing anything 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.659
 Here it is 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.020
 Like a feeling in vogue without any great now 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.370
 6th a 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:37.180

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:40.940
 Arofusu key and I'm a heart charm 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.240
 Muha- tan is a little bit like Ju 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.240
 Good 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:53.110
 I know it 's an in-design thing 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:56.550
 Or now yellow of the color difference Do not pink 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:01.440
 Is also this feel different 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:05.670
 It's summer, so it's summer, so it's summer 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:10.610
 I thought it would be ok and I made it 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:14.140
 And here it is 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.970
 Such feeling pod pearl and black yo flower 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.710
 It is an angle to see this Swarovski is something after it is 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.310
 It looks transparent 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:28.580
 Very beautiful color that looks like blue blue 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.120
 I 'm sorry I forgot the name 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.120
 And 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.159
 The fit is also a bracelet 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.630
 A little feeling um 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:47.200
 I'm going home 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:48.430
 I made a life of a calm feeling in many pillars In the video of the four introductions uploaded yesterday 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.530
 Plastic parts 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.950
 Certainly 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.990
 If you 're happy 2 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.350
 That person too 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.350
 Said the name of 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.920
 Way of life 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.690
 And 8 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.010
 In the ear 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.010
 After 300 million Tai- 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.730
 This is caulking at the pressed flower origin of the viola 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.930
 Say by feeling 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.040
 Pearl beads for two 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.650
 Say Tsu had was to 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.650
 We network 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.740
 The picture is something that made a little measure for the order 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.050
 That's really summery 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.390
 Seashell 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.590
 You're 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.590
 Hey my throat is dead 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:47.690
 Recently the original will soon die, I guess it would be okay if I turned up 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.690
 Yes and gold 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:56.680
 But Pierce Day 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.680
 That long and thin stick beads in a triangle 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.930
 I say not a judge in Anne 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.600
 It is connected and it is Swallowo 6 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.980
 He says he has Rosky 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.980
 It feels so small 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.850
 Know that 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.190
 me too 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.350
 I made for summer 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.570
 Yasude star this guy 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.570
 It is a feeling of home straight with you 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.170
 I'm sorry So'll have is something amazing sound 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.340
 When 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:42.160
 Here is a breath, this is also a great prototype 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:47.139
 I ate it, but I think I'm going to put something in it 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:52.740
 It is a feeling that I think still a little bit still thinking 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.740
 This is a pattern I have never used before 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.950
 Screw-type end parts 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.520
 I have heard 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:06.409
 And 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:10.889
 8 Next I earrings It is the Czech beads I 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:14.099
 In this way it connects to the flowering pattern and in the middle cubic cubic zirconia 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:17.120
 I want to imagine the feeling that sand school petals dance 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.760
 It is this three colors that are connected by a chain 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:25.060
 Wrong 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:29.760
 Because it was big and there was an impact, not only the earlobe 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:32.820
 If you do not go to the cartilage of the upper one 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:37.790
 If you continue piercing 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:40.729
 I think that I wonder if a good way, I have not done towards the top 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:46.389
 Good luck then 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:46.389
 Here it's also a prototype was made with plastic van I 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.880
 Video made without wear Actually this lens 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.289
 In red ribbon type 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.219
 Yes 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.219
 In it 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:05.340
 From the top marked with the Tteyuu little open La in the middle with the color I acrylic paint 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.420
 It looks like a resin 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.770
 Much less because 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.770
 I feel like Kurino 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:18.900
 And this is a picture book detective 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.900
 Pressed flowers 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:26.630
 It is this middle that I make with feeling 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:30.200
 Cosmos is fine 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:33.990
 It was a beautiful color, but after all I was sucked into the cash register 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:38.120
 The color is so transparent 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.120
 wonder if there is no white paper I wonder if seen hiro 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:46.889
 I'm sorry I'm behind the cd case 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:50.030
 I do not know what kind of leaves 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:50.030
 It is a sweet pink 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:57.400
 If you say that I made this 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:58.840
 It is after 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.090
 later 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.830
 I have made a lot 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.569
 It is 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:09.339
 Very simple 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:09.339
 Since I use this on your own 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.420
 Love of the teeth 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:16.200
 One lucky yo Tteyuu only of 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.200
 It is piercing 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.870
 Right? 

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:25.409
 Such feeling or not-this time is it 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.800
 It therefore stands another 10 minutes I think I'll keep baked 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.770
 Not 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:38.580
 I say I'm making something like this lately 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:44.729
 Thank you for looking at the end of the introduction 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:47.720
 I would like to carry out the process of making a plavan in the same minute as the request. 

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:49.240
 Though I think 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.389
 Yes 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:58.180
 Hey there that I will do my best 

00:07:52.389 --> 00:08:03.160
 If you are writing or not, you have to edit the edition more and more 

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:08.080
 By all means in the do but I think that if a little of your time because I think that dont 

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:09.230
 Thank you for watching until the end that you think if you can wait for the nominee 

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.560
 There was a princess 

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.560
 was
