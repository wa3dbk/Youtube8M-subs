00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
point where national tournament was a

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.820 
point where national tournament was a
reality<00:01:14.300> and<00:01:14.450> we<00:01:14.810> can<00:01:14.990> try<00:01:15.259> to<00:01:15.380> build<00:01:15.649> this

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
reality and we can try to build this

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.859 
reality and we can try to build this
thing<00:01:15.890> for<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.340> last<00:01:16.520> for<00:01:17.300> me<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.509> last<00:01:17.600> eight

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
thing for the last for me the last eight

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.600 
thing for the last for me the last eight
years<00:01:18.080> but<00:01:18.380> realistically<00:01:19.070> probably<00:01:19.280> last

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
years but realistically probably last

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.760 
years but realistically probably last
three<00:01:19.909> so<00:01:20.470> just<00:01:21.470> with<00:01:21.560> all<00:01:21.680> the

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
three so just with all the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.340 
three so just with all the
infrastructures<00:01:22.340> let's<00:01:22.580> be<00:01:22.700> put<00:01:22.880> in<00:01:22.970> place

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
infrastructures let's be put in place

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.350 
infrastructures let's be put in place
seems<00:01:24.350> like<00:01:24.530> it's<00:01:25.250> coming<00:01:25.759> coming<00:01:26.210> together

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
seems like it's coming coming together

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
half and we were pretty confident that

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.480 
half and we were pretty confident that
if<00:02:05.840> we<00:02:05.930> could<00:02:06.049> do<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.229> we<00:02:06.439> were<00:02:06.979> deep<00:02:07.189> enough

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
if we could do that we were deep enough

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.660 
if we could do that we were deep enough
that<00:02:07.729> we<00:02:08.090> wouldn't<00:02:08.390> have<00:02:08.600> any<00:02:09.369> trouble<00:02:10.369> in<00:02:10.579> the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
that we wouldn't have any trouble in the

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:40.000 
that we wouldn't have any trouble in the
second<00:02:10.970> half

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.550 

I<00:02:40.730> thought<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.269> keep<00:02:41.450> running<00:02:41.599> your<00:02:42.019> post<00:02:42.319> and

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
I thought to keep running your post and

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.050 
I thought to keep running your post and
I<00:02:42.650> figured<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:42.980> might<00:02:43.099> as<00:02:43.159> well<00:02:43.250> try<00:02:43.489> it<00:02:43.610> and

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
I figured I might as well try it and

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.569 
I figured I might as well try it and
luckily<00:02:45.049> I<00:02:45.230> went<00:02:45.470> in<00:02:45.560> or<00:02:45.860> else<00:02:46.099> how<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.400> was

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
luckily I went in or else how it was

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.819 
luckily I went in or else how it was
like<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.760> fool<00:02:47.060> but<00:02:47.360> uh<00:02:47.420> but<00:02:48.379> I<00:02:48.439> went<00:02:48.680> in<00:02:48.799> and

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
like a fool but uh but I went in and

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.949 
like a fool but uh but I went in and
then<00:02:49.159> you<00:02:49.700> know<00:02:49.819> that's<00:02:50.239> what<00:02:50.480> we've<00:02:50.659> kind<00:02:50.900> of

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
then you know that's what we've kind of

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.860 
then you know that's what we've kind of
done<00:02:51.019> all<00:02:51.140> season<00:02:51.470> once<00:02:51.799> one<00:02:52.040> goes<00:02:52.370> in<00:02:52.750> kind<00:02:53.750> of

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
done all season once one goes in kind of

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.289
