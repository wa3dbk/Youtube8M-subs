00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
of you who aren't sure what's going on

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:14.110 
of you who aren't sure what's going on
here<00:01:10.450> so<00:01:11.450> inside<00:01:11.810> this<00:01:11.990> tube<00:01:12.260> we've<00:01:12.500> got<00:01:13.120> said

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
here so inside this tube we've got said

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.270 
here so inside this tube we've got said
this<00:01:14.300> pipe<00:01:14.540> I<00:01:14.720> should<00:01:14.900> call<00:01:15.110> it<00:01:15.229> a<00:01:15.290> pipe<00:01:15.500> we've

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
this pipe I should call it a pipe we've

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.000 
this pipe I should call it a pipe we've
got<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.670> three-eighths<00:01:17.180> inch<00:01:18.080> plastic

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
got the three-eighths inch plastic

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.210 
got the three-eighths inch plastic
tubing<00:01:19.960> with<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.080> air<00:01:21.200> stone<00:01:21.560> hanging<00:01:22.010> about

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
tubing with the air stone hanging about

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.370 
tubing with the air stone hanging about
at<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:22.790> point<00:01:23.030> where<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.360> tank<00:01:23.600> transitions

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
at the point where the tank transitions

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.680 
at the point where the tank transitions
from<00:01:24.680> a<00:01:24.800> straight<00:01:25.160> side<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:25.820> 45<00:01:26.479> degree<00:01:27.610> and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
from a straight side to 45 degree and

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.180 
from a straight side to 45 degree and
you've<00:01:29.690> got<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:29.900> lot<00:01:30.050> of<00:01:30.080> water<00:01:30.350> flow<00:01:30.650> happening

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
you've got a lot of water flow happening

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.240 
you've got a lot of water flow happening
from<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.700> bottom<00:01:32.080> manifold<00:01:33.080> up<00:01:33.320> through<00:01:33.830> this

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
from the bottom manifold up through this

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.150 
from the bottom manifold up through this
pipe<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:34.880> at<00:01:35.479> about<00:01:35.750> this<00:01:36.020> point<00:01:36.350> we're

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
pipe and at about this point we're

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.770 
pipe and at about this point we're
introducing<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.820> air<00:01:38.000> flow<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:38.450> it's<00:01:38.540> really

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
introducing the air flow and it's really

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.020 
introducing the air flow and it's really
starting<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:39.229> pick<00:01:39.410> the<00:01:39.530> water<00:01:39.710> up<00:01:40.039> over<00:01:40.340> the

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
starting to pick the water up over the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.469 
starting to pick the water up over the
top<00:01:41.240> of<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.509> tank<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:43.060> splashing<00:01:44.060> into<00:01:44.210> the

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
top of the tank and splashing into the

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.560 
top of the tank and splashing into the
top<00:01:44.660> of<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.869> tank<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:46.550> so<00:01:46.789> we're<00:01:46.940> not<00:01:47.060> using<00:01:47.119> a

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
top of the tank and so we're not using a

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.249 
top of the tank and so we're not using a
standard<00:01:48.020> pump<00:01:49.570> we're<00:01:50.570> using<00:01:50.780> an<00:01:50.990> air<00:01:51.110> lift

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
standard pump we're using an air lift

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:58.300 
standard pump we're using an air lift
system<00:01:54.700> this<00:01:55.700> is<00:01:55.910> a<00:01:55.940> preliminary<00:01:57.130> setup<00:01:58.130> I've

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
system this is a preliminary setup I've

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.830 
system this is a preliminary setup I've
just<00:01:58.520> moved<00:01:58.789> this<00:01:59.030> to<00:01:59.330> a<00:01:59.360> different<00:01:59.570> location

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
just moved this to a different location

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.370 
just moved this to a different location
so<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.680> I<00:02:00.710> got<00:02:01.039> enough<00:02:01.310> height<00:02:01.550> here<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:02.380> run

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
so that I got enough height here to run

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.410 
so that I got enough height here to run
it<00:02:03.500> down<00:02:03.530> into<00:02:04.009> my<00:02:04.160> truck<00:02:05.349> this<00:02:06.349> is<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:06.560> early

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
it down into my truck this is a early

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.530 
it down into my truck this is a early
stage<00:02:08.420> of<00:02:08.630> developing<00:02:09.200> this<00:02:10.420> getting<00:02:11.420> my

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
stage of developing this getting my

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.000 
stage of developing this getting my
compost<00:02:11.959> out<00:02:12.140> before<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:14.530> actually<00:02:15.530> do<00:02:15.830> some

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
compost out before I actually do some

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.960 
compost out before I actually do some
test<00:02:16.220> brews<00:02:16.520> here<00:02:18.130> there's<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.250> little<00:02:19.550> pump

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.550 

that's<00:02:22.970> my<00:02:23.180> Sweetwater

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.370 

going<00:02:28.130> from<00:02:28.340> this<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.989> over<00:02:29.989> into<00:02:30.290> the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
going from this to over into the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.589 
going from this to over into the
manifold<00:02:32.020> very<00:02:33.020> simple<00:02:33.349> system<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:34.569> we<00:02:35.569> can

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
manifold very simple system and we can

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:41.110 
manifold very simple system and we can
definitely<00:02:36.080> see<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.940> water<00:02:37.940> moving<00:02:40.120> we're

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
definitely see the water moving we're

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.020 
definitely see the water moving we're
getting<00:02:41.360> kind<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.630> high<00:02:41.959> state<00:02:42.380> of<00:02:42.500> order<00:02:43.030> in
