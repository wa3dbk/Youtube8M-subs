00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 Hi Guys so come and say a 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:15.240
 a little for you today and Monday 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:17.490
 on the 15th and 19th, and I started to make a 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.660
 project this week let's see if it gives 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.630
 sure to try to dry a little with 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.970
 fluid that I have in my body is 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.609
 We 'll send it away. 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.329
 so I designed a diet 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.010
 no one passed me myself made I will 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.100
 test her for this week to see if 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.700
 gives a legal right result that we 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.680
 Do you take measures so good? 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.899
 your measurements 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.270
 I'm going to test, I'll tell you, girl. 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.420
 also beg forgiveness for the notion that 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.570
 Sometimes I record it from this side. 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.660
 but as the light out here is very sunny 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.850
 so sometimes it does not give a legal reflection 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.409
 show asking you is this is that 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:08.090
 that the garlic comes with a bandinha its fight 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.090
 register the blow that I do 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.880
 it's too much training 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:19.630
 in August at last bagacinho 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.700
 Hi, girls, I 'm already in the room with 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.680
 camera battery cable however the theme 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.049
 dictionary quality will not stay even 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.969
 but I'll show you how it is 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:34.840
 It is close to the grilled salmon without 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:38.259
 no oil or olive oil in the river the people 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.649
 can you is pretty cool rice 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:47.340
 I fully put mine and together 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:49.659
 ok it is a Saladinha watercress with a 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.950
 palm and onion 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:59.619
 I did not put the one I put only lemon 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:02.170
 and one tiny bit and stuff but it's there 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.860
 this video today in law will make a 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:10.119
 channel created for you because I found 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:14.380
 this way best way to be faithful 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:18.130
 to a diet and achieve the result and even 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.440
 even from the beginning 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.859
 placing the videos counting the seals 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.010
 to keep track of the start of the 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:30.340
 half of the flu and I'm going to create this 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.889
 look but this is the first video 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.720
 I hope you liked me. 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:37.000
 I'll try to record every day of my trip. 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.440
 to the gym because I'm sure 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.410
 that in this way will be an incentive 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.639
 higher than I was going to make a 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.700
 exercise of making an argument 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:47.859
 cool at lunchtime I post my 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.280
 photos of me doing a nice diet 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:55.359
 at dinner and you 're following 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.760
 You're so cool, it'll be cooler . 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.319
 do your diet because I'm going to follow 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.180
 the videos also involving my 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.120
 trajectory and its majority of the 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.880
 that's it, people are the same and even 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.880
 now I 'm going to role of vehicle ram
