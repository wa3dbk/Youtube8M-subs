00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
enough greens I shot a couple across the

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:28.950 
enough greens I shot a couple across the
room<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.149> haven't<00:01:28.450> been<00:01:28.509> able<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.750> find

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
room and I haven't been able to find

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.450 
room and I haven't been able to find
them<00:01:29.140> yet<00:01:29.259> so<00:01:29.470> now<00:01:29.710> I'm<00:01:29.829> gonna<00:01:29.920> move<00:01:30.159> on<00:01:30.310> to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
them yet so now I'm gonna move on to

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:40.210 
them yet so now I'm gonna move on to
pink<00:01:30.880> ones<00:01:31.229> inside<00:01:32.229> of<00:01:32.439> this

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.580 

and<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.850> could<00:01:41.030> alternate<00:01:41.600> on<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.020> also<00:01:42.260> but<00:01:42.560> I

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
and I could alternate on this also but I

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:55.670 
and I could alternate on this also but I
think<00:01:42.980> I<00:01:43.130> have<00:01:43.280> enough<00:01:43.490> Pink's<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:45.110> do<00:01:45.380> it

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.820 
it almost looks like a flower so I'm
gonna<00:01:58.950> tap<00:01:59.370> everything<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.390> carefully<00:02:01.290> gently
