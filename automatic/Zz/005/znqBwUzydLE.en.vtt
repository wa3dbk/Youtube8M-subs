got the sliding glass doors in and we're

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.660 
got the sliding glass doors in and we're
gonna<00:00:09.690> frame<00:00:09.990> them<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.429> acoustically<00:00:11.429> seal

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
gonna frame them and acoustically seal

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.060 
gonna frame them and acoustically seal
that<00:00:11.880> tomorrow<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:13.080> now<00:00:13.469> we're<00:00:13.650> putting<00:00:13.860> up

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
that tomorrow and now we're putting up

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.300 
that tomorrow and now we're putting up
the<00:00:14.219> resilient<00:00:14.730> channels<00:00:15.650> track<00:00:16.650> here<00:00:16.980> to

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
the resilient channels track here to

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.779 
the resilient channels track here to
float<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.820> drywall<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:19.160> this<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.310> made<00:00:20.520> to

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
float the drywall and this is made to

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.599 
float the drywall and this is made to
absorb<00:00:22.760> vibrations<00:00:24.890> into<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.130> drywall<00:00:26.580> so

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
absorb vibrations into the drywall so

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.939 
absorb vibrations into the drywall so
the<00:00:26.939> drywall<00:00:27.359> connects<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.289> screws<00:00:28.769> in

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
the drywall connects and screws in

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.589 
the drywall connects and screws in
directly<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.519> these<00:00:29.640> channels<00:00:30.000> instead<00:00:30.480> of

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
directly to these channels instead of

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.999 
directly to these channels instead of
the<00:00:30.750> studs<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.439> doesn't<00:00:31.679> transmit

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
the studs so it doesn't transmit

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.700 
the studs so it doesn't transmit
vibrations<00:00:33.050> until<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> other<00:00:34.290> side<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
vibrations until the other side of the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.770 
vibrations until the other side of the
wall<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.160> these<00:00:35.940> give<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> little<00:00:36.420> bit<00:00:36.600> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
wall and these give a little bit and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.389 
wall and these give a little bit and
have<00:00:36.899> air<00:00:37.140> little<00:00:37.350> air<00:00:37.559> pocket<00:00:37.980> there

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
have air little air pocket there

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.229 
have air little air pocket there
and<00:00:39.379> so<00:00:40.379> when<00:00:41.070> sound<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.610> bass<00:00:41.760> hits<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and so when sound and bass hits the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.100 
and so when sound and bass hits the
drywall<00:00:42.719> goes<00:00:43.710> from<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> drywall<00:00:44.399> into<00:00:44.610> these

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
drywall goes from the drywall into these

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.590 
drywall goes from the drywall into these
Brazilian<00:00:46.110> channels<00:00:46.760> vibrates<00:00:47.760> but<00:00:48.300> never

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
Brazilian channels vibrates but never

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.139 
Brazilian channels vibrates but never
hits<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> studs<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.829> doesn't<00:00:50.610> transmit<00:00:50.940> to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
hits the studs and doesn't transmit to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.580 
hits the studs and doesn't transmit to
the<00:00:51.239> other<00:00:51.360> side<00:00:51.660> into<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.899> vocal<00:00:52.289> booth<00:00:52.440> or

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
the other side into the vocal booth or

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.680 
the other side into the vocal booth or
the<00:00:52.680> other<00:00:52.800> side<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.219> wall<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.510> that's

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the other side of the wall and so that's

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.660 
the other side of the wall and so that's
how<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.899> contain<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:56.120> soundproof<00:00:57.469> walls<00:00:58.670> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
how you contain a soundproof walls and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.520 
how you contain a soundproof walls and
then<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.910> have<00:01:01.250> this<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.609> also<00:01:02.730> used<00:01:03.090> as<00:01:03.239> a

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
then we have this can be also used as a

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.649 
then we have this can be also used as a
vocal<00:01:04.530> booth<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.400> another<00:01:06.090> window<00:01:06.330> here

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
vocal booth we have another window here

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.100 
vocal booth we have another window here
so<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:07.740> could<00:01:07.860> have<00:01:08.010> an<00:01:08.100> artist<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.549> here<00:01:09.110> and

glass<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:23.400> helps<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.989> vibration

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
glass and this helps the vibration

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.199 
glass and this helps the vibration
because<00:02:25.920> before<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.370> had<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.489> bit<00:02:26.730> major<00:02:26.909> ring

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
because before you had a bit major ring

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.199 
because before you had a bit major ring
and<00:02:27.830> then<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:29.250> know<00:02:29.370> you'd<00:02:29.580> have<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.819> lot<00:02:30.150> of

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
and then you know you'd have a lot of

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.440 
and then you know you'd have a lot of
base<00:02:30.500> problems<00:02:31.500> frequencies<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:32.450> rattling

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
base problems frequencies and rattling

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.140 
base problems frequencies and rattling
going<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.049> you<00:02:34.110> put<00:02:34.349> these<00:02:34.470> little<00:02:34.530> pads<00:02:35.150> on

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
going on so you put these little pads on

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.860 
going on so you put these little pads on
all<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.450> corners<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:37.110> little<00:02:38.040> tip<00:02:38.629> and<00:02:39.629> that

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
all the corners a little tip and that

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.390 
all the corners a little tip and that
helps<00:02:41.299> complete<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.480> read<00:02:43.069> sound<00:02:44.069> so<00:02:44.310> you

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
helps complete the read sound so you

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.550 
helps complete the read sound so you
don't<00:02:44.579> have<00:02:44.849> resonance<00:02:45.299> going<00:02:45.629> on<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:48.109> on<00:02:49.109> day

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
don't have resonance going on so on day

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.680 
don't have resonance going on so on day
six<00:02:49.920> I'll<00:02:50.459> show<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.730> how<00:02:50.879> far<00:02:51.150> we<00:02:51.299> get<00:02:51.480> and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
six I'll show you how far we get and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.839 
six I'll show you how far we get and
hopefully<00:02:51.870> uh<00:02:52.109> can<00:02:52.980> get<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.220> sheet<00:02:53.430> rock<00:02:53.579> up

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
hopefully uh can get the sheet rock up

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.200 
hopefully uh can get the sheet rock up
see<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.989> later
