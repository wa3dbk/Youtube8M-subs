back<00:01:39.280> in<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.640> package<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:40.270> reuse<00:01:40.540> them<00:01:40.750> over

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
back in the package and reuse them over

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.480 
back in the package and reuse them over
and<00:01:41.200> over<00:01:41.350> again<00:01:41.910> so<00:01:42.910> now<00:01:43.660> that<00:01:43.720> we<00:01:44.080> have<00:01:44.490> it

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
and over again so now that we have it

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.270 
and over again so now that we have it
adhesive<00:01:46.060> on<00:01:46.510> we're<00:01:47.200> put<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:47.470> cap<00:01:47.620> back<00:01:47.830> on<00:01:48.040> so

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
adhesive on we're put the cap back on so

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.490 
adhesive on we're put the cap back on so
we<00:01:48.370> don't<00:01:48.400> get<00:01:48.670> it<00:01:48.730> all<00:01:48.790> over<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:49.210> place<00:01:49.500> we're

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
we don't get it all over the place we're

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.109 
we don't get it all over the place we're
going<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.890> apply<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.190> eyelash

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.679 

so<00:01:54.509> using<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.079> applicator<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:56.610> hold<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.420> to

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
so using the applicator to hold on to

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.590 
so using the applicator to hold on to
the<00:01:57.780> eyelash<00:01:58.369> you're<00:01:59.369> going<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.970> place<00:02:00.299> and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the eyelash you're going to place and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.749 
the eyelash you're going to place and
hold<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.430> along<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.930> natural<00:02:04.460> eyelash<00:02:05.460> line

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
hold it along the natural eyelash line

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.309 
hold it along the natural eyelash line
and<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.689> idea<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:08.580> fake<00:02:09.360> eyelashes<00:02:10.050> are

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
and the idea is the fake eyelashes are

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.530 
and the idea is the fake eyelashes are
going<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:11.030> kind<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.090> blend<00:02:12.330> in<00:02:12.630> with<00:02:13.370> the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
going to kind of blend in with the

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.240 
going to kind of blend in with the
natural<00:02:15.540> eyelashes<00:02:16.200> if<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.470> get<00:02:16.769> it<00:02:16.890> on<00:02:17.040> there

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
natural eyelashes if you get it on there

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.430 
natural eyelashes if you get it on there
at<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.060> right<00:02:18.239> spot<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.900> open<00:02:19.680> your<00:02:19.830> eye<00:02:21.440> and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
at the right spot and open your eye and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.650 
at the right spot and open your eye and
we're<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.370> little<00:02:23.670> high<00:02:23.819> up<00:02:23.849> so<00:02:24.420> close<00:02:24.630> right

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
we're a little high up so close right

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.759 
we're a little high up so close right
again<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:26.180> these<00:02:27.180> are<00:02:27.360> cool<00:02:27.540> because<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:28.739> can

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
again and these are cool because you can

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.610 
again and these are cool because you can
adjust<00:02:29.310> them<00:02:29.690> with<00:02:30.690> using<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.200> glue<00:02:31.410> as

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
adjust them with using the glue as

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.850
