you<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.860> see<00:00:50.070> here<00:00:50.430> at<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.510> back<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> unit

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
you can see here at the back of the unit

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.619 
you can see here at the back of the unit
you've<00:00:52.410> got<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> very<00:00:52.890> nice<00:00:53.039> heatsink<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.940> how

you've got a very nice heatsink and how
this<00:00:54.780> goes<00:00:54.989> together<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.770> there<00:00:55.949> are<00:00:56.070> two

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
this goes together is that there are two

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.520 
this goes together is that there are two
screws<00:00:56.760> left<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.239> right<00:00:57.390> side<00:00:57.660> here<00:00:57.960> removal

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
screws left and right side here removal

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.680 
screws left and right side here removal
of<00:00:58.590> those<00:00:58.710> screws<00:00:59.100> allows<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.510> gain

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
of those screws allows you to gain

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.990 
of those screws allows you to gain
access<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.469> back<00:01:01.649> here<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.219> then<00:01:02.850> in

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
access to the back here that then in

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.119 
access to the back here that then in
turn<00:01:03.180> allows<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.809> mount<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.290> into<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
turn allows you to mount this into the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.910 
turn allows you to mount this into the
bodywork<00:01:05.610> with<00:01:06.000> respect<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.600> bracketry<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
bodywork with respect to bracketry that

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.039 
bodywork with respect to bracketry that
then<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> basically<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.119> flange<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.750> goes

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
then is a basically a flange that goes

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.260 
then is a basically a flange that goes
over<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> top<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.490> once<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> screws<00:01:12.119> are

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
over the top of this once the screws are

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.649 
over the top of this once the screws are
in<00:01:12.390> place<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.900> by<00:01:13.500> depressing<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.250> flange

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
in place and by depressing that flange

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.690 
in place and by depressing that flange
you<00:01:15.659> actually<00:01:16.110> seal<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.799> light<00:01:16.979> head<00:01:17.220> from

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
you actually seal the light head from

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.120 
you actually seal the light head from
the<00:01:17.850> flange<00:01:18.090> perspective<00:01:18.780> as<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.680> would<00:01:19.950> see

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the flange perspective as you would see

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.249 
the flange perspective as you would see
it<00:01:20.220> forward<00:01:20.580> right<00:01:21.119> now<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.630> again<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it forward right now and again to the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.249 
it forward right now and again to the
left<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.880> right<00:01:23.970> as<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.869> can<00:01:25.020> see

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
vehicle with the respective bracketry

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.930 
vehicle with the respective bracketry
the<00:02:34.440> bracketry<00:02:34.770> fits<00:02:35.070> onto<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.430> back<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.820> the

the bracketry fits onto the back of the
light<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.420> then<00:02:37.020> in<00:02:37.170> turn<00:02:38.300> connects

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
light and then in turn connects

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.600 
light and then in turn connects
something<00:02:40.140> similar<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.220> kind<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.460> hold

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
something similar to this I kind of hold

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.670 
something similar to this I kind of hold
it<00:02:41.730> up<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:41.970> can<00:02:42.120> see<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.450> here<00:02:42.680> something

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
it up so you can see it here something

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.830 
it up so you can see it here something
approximately<00:02:44.310> like<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.600> turn

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
approximately like that and that in turn

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.590 
approximately like that and that in turn
allows<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.530> hook<00:02:46.770> into<00:02:47.360> what<00:02:48.360> is

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
allows you to hook into what is

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.030 
allows you to hook into what is
essentially<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.350> front<00:02:49.590> hood<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:49.950> the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
essentially the front hood of the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.040 
essentially the front hood of the
vehicle<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:51.180> again<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.570> light<00:02:51.780> can<00:02:51.960> be

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
vehicle so again this light can be

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.260 
vehicle so again this light can be
mounted<00:02:52.380> externally<00:02:52.530> or<00:02:53.190> internally<00:02:53.270> should

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
mounted externally or internally should

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.870 
mounted externally or internally should
you<00:02:54.360> decide<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.810> do<00:02:54.990> so<00:02:55.310> all<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.520> technical

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
you decide to do so all the technical

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.820 
you decide to do so all the technical
specs<00:02:57.150> are<00:02:57.390> available<00:02:57.900> on<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.320> website<00:02:58.800> and

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
specs are available on the website and

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.440 
specs are available on the website and
are<00:02:59.070> quick<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.310> go<00:02:59.520> ahead<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.910> change<00:03:00.180> one<00:03:00.420> of
