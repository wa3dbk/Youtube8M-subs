00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
hi my name is Linda Sheppard and I'm

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.789 
hi my name is Linda Sheppard and I'm
talking<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.490> little<00:00:02.669> bit<00:00:02.850> about<00:00:03.419> twist<00:00:04.290> for

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
talking a little bit about twist for

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.750 
talking a little bit about twist for
hair<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.509> these<00:00:06.620> twists<00:00:07.620> you<00:00:08.099> can<00:00:08.340> do<00:00:08.519> either

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
hair and these twists you can do either

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.940 
hair and these twists you can do either
along<00:00:09.120> with<00:00:09.360> Eve<00:00:09.540> on<00:00:09.780> their<00:00:09.990> own<00:00:10.170> or<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:10.769> can

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
along with Eve on their own or you can

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.870 
along with Eve on their own or you can
twist<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.960> the<00:00:12.960> synthetic<00:00:13.259> hair<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:14.670> this

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
twist in the synthetic hair and so this

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.099 
twist in the synthetic hair and so this
hair<00:00:15.150> comes<00:00:15.509> like<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:17.240> this<00:00:18.240> particular

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
hair comes like this and this particular

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.200 
hair comes like this and this particular
kind<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.619> called<00:00:21.350> margin<00:00:22.430> dreadlocks<00:00:23.430> and

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
kind is called margin dreadlocks and

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.830 
kind is called margin dreadlocks and
it's<00:00:24.869> like<00:00:24.990> five<00:00:25.260> dollars<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.849> package<00:00:27.570> and

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
it's like five dollars and a package and

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.779 
it's like five dollars and a package and
because<00:00:28.410> she<00:00:28.619> doesn't<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.010> lot<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.250> hair<00:00:29.550> I

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
because she doesn't have a lot of hair I

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.110 
because she doesn't have a lot of hair I
just<00:00:30.000> cut<00:00:30.240> them<00:00:30.300> cut<00:00:30.660> them<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.590> half<00:00:32.120> the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
just cut them cut them in half the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.620 
just cut them cut them in half the
reason<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.899> twist<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.210> to<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> hair

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
reason that I twist this in to the hair

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.830 
reason that I twist this in to the hair
is<00:00:36.989> because<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.760> one<00:00:38.910> thing<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.180> lasts<00:00:39.570> longer

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
is because for one thing it lasts longer

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.209 
is because for one thing it lasts longer
and<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.800> also<00:00:40.980> easier<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:42.680> untwist<00:00:43.680> or<00:00:44.070> to

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and it's also easier to untwist or to

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.360 
and it's also easier to untwist or to
undo<00:00:44.700> her<00:00:44.879> hair<00:00:45.120> later<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:47.190> leave

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
undo her hair later so you can leave

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.270 
undo her hair later so you can leave
this<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.700> for<00:00:48.329> quite<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.899> long<00:00:49.140> time<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.980> already

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
this in for quite a long time I already

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.160 
this in for quite a long time I already

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
moisture in it and then you take the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.319 
moisture in it and then you take the
hair<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:42.750> take<00:01:43.560> her<00:01:43.829> hair<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.090> have

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
hair and you take her hair and you have

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.889 
hair and you take her hair and you have
basically<00:01:45.720> then<00:01:46.229> three<00:01:47.060> three<00:01:48.060> sections<00:01:48.659> and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
basically then three three sections and

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.850 
basically then three three sections and
what<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:50.540> start<00:01:51.540> with<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.810> braid<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.829> I

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
what I do is start with a braid so I

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.039 
what I do is start with a braid so I
just<00:01:53.130> braid<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.630> our<00:01:54.750> three

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
just braid it in so we have our three

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:02.870 
just braid it in so we have our three
sections<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:58.460> then<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.729> divide<00:02:00.079> her<00:02:01.079> hair<00:02:01.880> into

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
sections and then I divide her hair into

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.940 
sections and then I divide her hair into
two<00:02:04.310> so<00:02:05.310> now<00:02:05.579> we<00:02:05.640> have<00:02:05.969> two<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:07.469> we<00:02:07.710> twist

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
two so now we have two and then we twist

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.529 
two so now we have two and then we twist
so<00:02:08.399> we<00:02:08.489> twist<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:09.030> both<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.450> same<00:02:09.660> way<00:02:09.899> and

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
so we twist of both the same way and

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.309 
so we twist of both the same way and
turn<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:11.049> the<00:02:11.650> same<00:02:11.890> way<00:02:12.099> and<00:02:12.280> turn<00:02:12.519> it<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.480> we

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
turn it the same way and turn it and we

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.259 
turn it the same way and turn it and we
just<00:02:14.560> twist<00:02:14.799> it<00:02:15.129> all<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.400> way<00:02:15.489> down<00:02:15.519> the

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
just twist it all the way down the

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.559 
just twist it all the way down the
reason<00:02:16.569> I<00:02:16.659> start<00:02:17.230> with<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.189> braid<00:02:18.459> is<00:02:19.180> it

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
reason I start with the braid is it

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.830 
reason I start with the braid is it
holds<00:02:20.470> better<00:02:20.980> than<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.400> twist<00:02:21.730> but<00:02:22.390> this<00:02:22.599> is

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
holds better than the twist but this is

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.050 
holds better than the twist but this is
just<00:02:23.230> where<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.739> know<00:02:24.159> we're<00:02:24.670> having<00:02:24.970> the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
just where you know we're having the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.460 
just where you know we're having the
hair<00:02:25.180> twisted<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.230> then<00:02:26.319> we're<00:02:26.439> just

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
hair twisted and then we're just

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.280 
hair twisted and then we're just
overlapping<00:02:27.099> it<00:02:27.519> and<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:28.569> can<00:02:28.810> go<00:02:28.959> really

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
overlapping it and this can go really

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.369 
overlapping it and this can go really
really<00:02:30.069> really<00:02:30.280> fast<00:02:30.610> once<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.299> get<00:02:31.510> good<00:02:32.319> at

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
really really fast once you get good at

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.930 
really really fast once you get good at
the<00:02:32.650> twisting<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:34.299> it's<00:02:34.810> faster<00:02:35.319> than<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.980> lot

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
the twisting and it's faster than a lot

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.080 
the twisting and it's faster than a lot
of<00:02:37.090> other<00:02:37.319> other<00:02:38.319> things<00:02:38.680> like<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:40.030> know

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
of other other things like you know

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.020 
of other other things like you know
braiding<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.840> all<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.019> way<00:02:41.109> down<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.409> cornrows

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
braiding it all the way down to cornrows

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.500 
braiding it all the way down to cornrows
you<00:02:43.030> can<00:02:43.829> just<00:02:44.829> let<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.879> good<00:02:46.329> thing<00:02:46.480> about

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
you can just let it the good thing about

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.599 
you can just let it the good thing about
this<00:02:46.840> hair<00:02:47.079> is<00:02:47.319> it<00:02:47.530> stays<00:02:47.799> really<00:02:48.099> good<00:02:48.430> you

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
this hair is it stays really good you

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.500 
this hair is it stays really good you
can<00:02:48.639> just<00:02:49.060> leave<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:49.930> at<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.739> end<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.510> it

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
can just leave it at the end and it

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.649 
can just leave it at the end and it
would<00:02:52.690> just<00:02:52.720> hold<00:02:53.400> or<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.700> can<00:02:54.909> cut<00:02:55.209> it

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
would just hold or you can cut it

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.990 
would just hold or you can cut it
I<00:02:56.549> usually<00:02:57.549> actually<00:02:58.209> cut<00:02:58.690> it<00:02:58.780> off<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.790> just

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
I usually actually cut it off and just

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.710 
I usually actually cut it off and just
let<00:03:01.599> it<00:03:01.629> hang<00:03:01.840> like<00:03:02.139> that<00:03:02.290> or<00:03:02.769> you<00:03:02.859> can<00:03:03.069> also

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
let it hang like that or you can also

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.770 
let it hang like that or you can also
burn<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.959> ends<00:03:05.079> if<00:03:05.409> you<00:03:05.470> wanted<00:03:09.420> if<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:10.599> want

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
burn the ends if you wanted if you want

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.839 
burn the ends if you wanted if you want
it<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:11.079> hold<00:03:11.739> a<00:03:11.859> little<00:03:11.889> better<00:03:12.190> I'd<00:03:12.400> like

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
it to hold a little better I'd like

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.309 
it to hold a little better I'd like
barely<00:03:13.209> varnish<00:03:13.659> just<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.109> it<00:03:14.260> doesn't<00:03:14.560> like

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
barely varnish just so it doesn't like

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.680 
barely varnish just so it doesn't like
frazzled<00:03:17.319> I<00:03:17.650> don't<00:03:17.829> really<00:03:18.160> want<00:03:18.370> that<00:03:18.690> look

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
frazzled I don't really want that look

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.319 
frazzled I don't really want that look
where<00:03:19.959> it's<00:03:20.139> really<00:03:20.799> tough<00:03:21.220> on<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.609> end<00:03:21.730> and

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
where it's really tough on the end and

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.180 
where it's really tough on the end and
then<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:22.599> would<00:03:22.720> just<00:03:22.750> do<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.769> all<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.069> way

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
then I would just do that all the way

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.990 
then I would just do that all the way
through<00:03:24.579> and<00:03:25.299> probably<00:03:25.780> can<00:03:26.109> do<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:27.000> within

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
through and probably can do this within

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.939 
through and probably can do this within
a<00:03:28.030> couple<00:03:28.209> hours<00:03:28.389> in<00:03:28.840> there<00:03:29.049> lasts<00:03:29.290> about<00:03:29.680> two

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:29.949 
a couple hours in there lasts about two

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.849 
a couple hours in there lasts about two
months<00:03:30.220> Thanks
