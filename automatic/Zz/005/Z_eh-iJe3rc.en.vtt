every<00:00:00.690> one<00:00:00.870> I<00:00:00.989> wanted<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.290> do<00:00:01.680> an<00:00:01.920> update<00:00:02.310> on

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
every one I wanted to do an update on

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.329 
every one I wanted to do an update on
some<00:00:02.820> new<00:00:02.939> features<00:00:03.300> on<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.540> Porta<00:00:03.810> pie<00:00:04.339> the

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
some new features on the Porta pie the

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.320 
some new features on the Porta pie the
current<00:00:05.609> design<00:00:05.990> three<00:00:06.990> new<00:00:07.230> features<00:00:07.470> are

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
current design three new features are

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.360 
current design three new features are
you<00:00:09.330> no<00:00:09.540> longer<00:00:09.660> have<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.110> use<00:00:10.139> two<00:00:10.889> power

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
you no longer have to use two power

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.919 
you no longer have to use two power
supplies<00:00:11.580> so<00:00:12.179> that'll<00:00:12.420> be<00:00:12.509> one<00:00:12.540> for<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
supplies so that'll be one for the

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.680 
supplies so that'll be one for the
Raspberry<00:00:13.290> Pi<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.830> one<00:00:14.610> for<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.910> cabinet's

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
Raspberry Pi and one for the cabinet's

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.660 
Raspberry Pi and one for the cabinet's
modern<00:00:16.139> amplifier<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:17.369> now<00:00:17.460> been

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
modern amplifier so it's now been

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.269 
modern amplifier so it's now been
integrated<00:00:17.820> into<00:00:18.300> one<00:00:18.510> five<00:00:18.810> volt<00:00:19.050> supply

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
integrated into one five volt supply

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.179 
integrated into one five volt supply
second<00:00:20.279> feature<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.730> I've<00:00:21.119> changed<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
second feature is I've changed the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.290 
second feature is I've changed the
amplifier<00:00:23.189> for<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.490> speakers<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.150> now<00:00:24.269> a

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
amplifier for the speakers it's now a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.290 
amplifier for the speakers it's now a
two<00:00:24.630> watt<00:00:24.810> amplifier<00:00:25.640> which<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.820> plenty<00:00:27.060> loud

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
two watt amplifier which is plenty loud

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.480 
two watt amplifier which is plenty loud
enough<00:00:27.599> but<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.960> now<00:00:28.109> has<00:00:28.140> volume<00:00:28.890> control<00:00:29.460> so

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
enough but it now has volume control so

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.260 
enough but it now has volume control so
instead<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.269> adjusting<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.969> raspberry<00:00:32.969> PI's

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
instead of adjusting the raspberry PI's

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.170 
instead of adjusting the raspberry PI's
output<00:00:34.050> volume<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:35.340> old<00:00:35.550> amplifier<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
output volume the old amplifier was a

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.780 
output volume the old amplifier was a
fixed<00:00:36.570> gain<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.469> now<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.950> adjust<00:00:38.309> this

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
fixed gain you now can adjust this

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.119 
fixed gain you now can adjust this

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the inside of the cabinet and this is

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.740 
the inside of the cabinet and this is
our<00:01:27.270> SD<00:01:27.600> card<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.380> cut<00:01:28.799> out<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.950> little<00:01:29.130> bit

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
our SD card so it's cut out a little bit

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.330 
our SD card so it's cut out a little bit
oversized<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.560> get<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:32.009> fingers<00:01:32.310> in

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
oversized so you can get your fingers in

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.550 
oversized so you can get your fingers in
here<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.030> grab<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.509> hold<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.200> pull<00:01:34.530> it

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
here and grab a hold on it and pull it

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.800 
here and grab a hold on it and pull it
out<00:01:36.140> another<00:01:37.140> feature<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.270> new<00:01:39.270> amplifier

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
out another feature is the new amplifier

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.690 
out another feature is the new amplifier
board<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> old<00:01:40.619> amplifier<00:01:41.070> board<00:01:41.400> was

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
board so the old amplifier board was

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.810 
board so the old amplifier board was
eight<00:01:42.270> watts<00:01:42.600> which<00:01:43.320> was<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:44.340> was<00:01:44.460> very<00:01:44.640> loud

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
eight watts which was it was very loud

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.609 
eight watts which was it was very loud
and<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.570> little<00:01:45.750> bit<00:01:45.840> too<00:01:45.960> loud<00:01:46.110> but<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
and a little bit too loud but the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.069 
and a little bit too loud but the
downside<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.670> had<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> fixed<00:01:48.390> gain<00:01:48.780> so

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
downside to it it had a fixed gain so

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.210 
downside to it it had a fixed gain so
you<00:01:49.140> only<00:01:49.829> could<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.549> volume<00:01:51.090> was<00:01:52.220> before

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
you only could just a volume was before

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.980 
you only could just a volume was before
the<00:01:53.399> amplifier<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.210> that's<00:01:54.360> adjusting<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the amplifier so that's adjusting the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.600 
the amplifier so that's adjusting the
raspberry<00:01:55.560> pi's<00:01:56.360> output<00:01:57.530> of<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.880> audio<00:02:01.399> so<00:02:02.399> on

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
raspberry pi's output of the audio so on

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.560 
raspberry pi's output of the audio so on
this<00:02:02.759> clear<00:02:03.030> cabinet<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.259> see<00:02:05.479> here's<00:02:06.479> a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
this clear cabinet you can see here's a

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.229 
this clear cabinet you can see here's a
new<00:02:06.750> amplifier<00:02:07.229> board<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.340> cutout<00:02:08.759> to

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
new amplifier board and the cutout to

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
potentiometer so the adjustable output

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.860 
potentiometer so the adjustable output
you<00:02:44.030> have<00:02:44.060> 64<00:02:44.720> discrete<00:02:45.710> levels<00:02:46.130> of<00:02:46.280> output

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
you have 64 discrete levels of output

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.220 
you have 64 discrete levels of output
from<00:02:47.870> silence<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:49.670> maximum<00:02:50.600> volume<00:02:51.020> and

cabinet<00:03:17.480> amplifier<00:03:17.990> monitor<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:19.100> now<00:03:19.220> I've

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
cabinet amplifier monitor so now I've

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.830 
cabinet amplifier monitor so now I've
integrated<00:03:19.670> that<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.360> was<00:03:20.480> something<00:03:20.690> I

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
integrated that it was something I

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.930 
integrated that it was something I
always<00:03:20.900> wanted<00:03:21.320> to<00:03:21.410> do<00:03:21.560> but<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:22.040> didn't<00:03:22.850> have

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
always wanted to do but I didn't have

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.420 
always wanted to do but I didn't have
time<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.270> integrate<00:03:23.780> into<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.740> design<00:03:25.130> so

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
time to integrate into the design so

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.360 
time to integrate into the design so
right<00:03:26.150> now<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.800> cabinets<00:03:27.800> are<00:03:27.920> powered<00:03:28.340> from
