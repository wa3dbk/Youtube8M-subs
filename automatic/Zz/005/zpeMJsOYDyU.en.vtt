00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.960
 lead the dog the right way you must 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.540
 learn what is normal for 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.110
 the animal in their environment does not follow 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.350

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:13.920
 way of projecting oneself 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.240

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.340

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.780
