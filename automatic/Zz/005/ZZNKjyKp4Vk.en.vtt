00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.000
 they present the layout in nicaragua 

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:07.130
 definitive interoceanic channel 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.290
 Pharaonic work that will mark a before and after 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.030
 then in maritime trade when joining 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.240
 the Atlantic with the pacific as 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.970
 alternative to the panama canal the owner 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.160
 of the Chinese company that finances the 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.590
 project has wanted to make it public 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.380
 personally given its size the 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.480
 construction will begin at the end of 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.600
 this year and in it they will participate at least 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.149
 50,000 workers that in 2020 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.370
 they will leave ready for more than 5000 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.040
 ships pass it every year what 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.739
 accounts for 5% of international traffic 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.420
 of ships to get an idea of their 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.180
 magnitude of its magnitude we offer them 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.040
 compare it in figures with the one in panama 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.160
 let's see what the panama channel has 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.469
 a length of 80 kilometers while 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.180
 that the new interoceanic canal 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.950
 will more than triple in addition the 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.530
 old route is narrower to the channel 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.230
 Nicaragua will be twice as wide in 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.690
 reference to the transit of ships the 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.110
 Panamanian canal allows the passage of ships 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.270
 up to 65 thousand tons 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.100
 the new road will facilitate the traffic of 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.990
 larger vessels that 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.330
 weigh up to three times more last 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.820
 by the circular to ships that double the 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.310
 draft of those that go through the one of panama 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.260
 Russian companies could participate 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.700
 precisely in its construction according to 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.890
 Russian Chancellor SÃ©rguei LÃ¡vrov Russia 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.780
 will determine your contribution to the project 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.430
 of the interoceanic canal after 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.830
 carry out a feasibility study 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.479
 of it some analysts see this 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.580
 work as a great possibility for the 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.280
 development of nicaragua and the region a 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:42.950
 inconvenient for powers like usa 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.860
 Nicaragua will experience a change 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.080
 huge 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:53.210
 and Central America in particular true 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.580
 because the channel is going to be a huge 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.400
 development potential for the region 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:03.860
 will also mean that those ships 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.750
 of great draft that can not go through 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.050
 the panama channel can now 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.540
 transit through this new channel goes to 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.650
 suppose an important saving for 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.870
 the economy also stops for the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.870
 transport access to the coast 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.840
 Eastern USA in connection with the 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.740
 peaceful since it represents a saving of 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.180
 about 1000 kilometers relational 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.620
 Panama to the Panama Canal 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.690
 the US opposes because it does not want us not 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.010
 allows the sovereignty of the three has 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.870
 that now will build the channel is going to 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.510
 be much more sovereign because the envelope 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.700
 theory is basically that the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.250
 people control the wealth that 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.760
 they produce and they do not go to the countries 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.760
 imperialists
