00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
can drain all that water out because we

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:04.149 
can drain all that water out because we
don't<00:00:55.230> want<00:00:55.410> our<00:00:55.500> salad<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:56.219> runny<00:01:00.230> then

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
throw the lid away and this is where

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.560 
throw the lid away and this is where
you'll<00:01:08.070> get<00:01:08.220> your<00:01:08.400> mixing<00:01:08.880> bowl<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.420> can
