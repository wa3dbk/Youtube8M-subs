00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello people there are games that hate 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.600
 the player and want in return too 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.600
 hated by the player 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.320
 then again there are also the games 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.300
 the player in such a cute way and 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.640
 We hate that the game is easy 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.720
 only the more must have loved and one 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.720
 look and say about it 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.809
 gremlin interactive 1993 for the amiga 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.460
 CD 32 developed the first CD based 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.290
 game console focusing on the mainstream 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.059
 could assert by the high 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.070
 storage capacity was not possible 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.079
 to offer a large scope of play 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.460
 you could also detailed animations 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.089
 and a detailed soundtrack 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.440
 mitliefern 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.540
 at the same time the game also appeared for 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.519
 ms-dos before a year later, too 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.229
 jump on the inglorious cd of 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.360
 Philipp even made it there 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.040
 intro movies since last year 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.629
 you can even buy the game on steam 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.140
 in the following we will look at each other 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.550
 original dos version 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.590
 you slip into the role of the demon 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.750
 I do not quite understand the story 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.460
 somehow it's probably a question of some 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.979
 pull the demon tube to decide 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.929
 If you need a pizza, you have to maxi 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.550
 shorter and thus receives the honor 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:22.440
 through five floors tough 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.080
 labyrinthine dungeons to fight over 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.820
 to reach your goal and then lurk yourself 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.130
 In addition to numerous fall above all 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.569
 curious challenges and struggles 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.429
 the whole thing is briefly described one 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.800
 dungeon crawling the action adventure with 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.540
 fit and beat'em up deposits here 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.829
 most of the time you are busy 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.840
 to get away from the dungeon 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.850
 Keep falling while avoiding falling 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.229
 and besides gold also some items and 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.000
 collect goodies 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.649
 with the objects you with them 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.299
 it may be relevant in the quest 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.579
 tools are used in later ones 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.439
 irritate or fight still needed or 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.390
 also in the artefacts which one at 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.729
 finish this level needs this part 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.799
 is sometimes interesting sometimes called 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.409
 often had to and especially against 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.479
 later a bit caustic a reason for that 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.979
 the slight disorientation there 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.149
 only a small part of the map 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.039
 is displayed above 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.959
 another reason the monotony there 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.760
 the setting optically rarely varies 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.590
 and then most of redhenstein courses 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.660
 But above all, I see that 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.519
 Backtracking is a problem 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.440
 labyrinth on research can be found in the 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.390
 a corner an object in 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.250
 the completely different corner must use 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.930
 to go directly to the start of the levels a 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.730
 key to get the man up then 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.170
 the other side of the dungeon 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.120
 can 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.500
 that can be annoying especially when you 're in 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.860
 one more injury and one more 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.030
 a 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.030
 also looks like the poor one 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.680
 It is also important that you 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.390
 compulsorily collect all gold in the level 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.340
 must to complete it there at the end 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.660
 always a greedy goal right 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.670
 who does not have too little gold 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.260
 Satisfied either way it recommends 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.500
 Check the internet for a map 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.500
 rummage 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.120
 the whole dungeon crawling through 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.040
 minor challenges loosened up 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.810
 these are sometimes struggles, for example 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.549
 which are more about button mashing 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.200
 and partly more than combative 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.760
 can continue to exist every now and then 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.920
 puzzles or skill passages 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.700
 Again, timing is important 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.560
 but also a good one 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.230
 observation then a little bit more 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.000
 luck and you can do it from time to time 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.709
 you also need a subject 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.340
 you can buy in the dungeon own store 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.019
 can 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.819
 especially the puzzles are a lot of fun 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.380
 the nice thing is that you can not 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.390
 too much in the hand is taken 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.280
 the game requires you to get involved 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.530
 think a little bit in the logic and pure 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.329
 then just try it 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.190
 will fail a few times though 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.810
 It's nice to learn that too 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.489
 really different types of puzzles 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.590
 are even a hat-play a 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.690
 classic siemens it a switch 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.430
 Wetzel and so on we are looking now 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.030
 but something behind this new one 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.900
 great god no no no no no 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.900
 No no 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.370
 okay now I have calmed down 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.150
 is not bearable this 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.590
 scheiÃŸ by crawling one viecher dissolving 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.330
 one gets a challenge 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.920
 either an object or you may 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.000
 continue to have to happen further 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.470
 but in any case all 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.480
 mastered challenges in the country 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.070
 you will be turned on at once 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.880
 again at the door and loses something 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.740
 lebensenergie 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.330
 even if you fall into one of the many 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.800
 kick is my life energy 1 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.900
 and even if you just wait 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.120
 Slowly you lose that life energy 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.640
 means the game is somehow on time 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.770
 is the life energy gets extinguished 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:57.490
 you have a wonderful meadow against upper 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:05:00.130
 sequence as well as that still play me 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.810
 not enough had unfortunately too 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.300
 the control is not much help 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.010
 sometimes sometimes gets stuck somewhere 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.050
 your electricity button reacts a little late 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.400
 sometimes exact pixel-perfect 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.020
 placement are necessary to 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.240
 Arrow keys immediately take a big step 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.820
 trigger and above all it commits one 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.210
 big gameplay sin four way control 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.340
 from the iso perspective if it is the 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.170
 directions top right top left bottom 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.850
 right and bottom left and there 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.100
 my figure only in this direction 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.840
 then you can move the arrow keys 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.000
 no effective means of control 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.500
 sometimes I move so I was down 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.350
 right with left lower left 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.270
 how do I get it why not eight 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.000
 why control them at all 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.760
 perspective well they actually 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.350
 better off but have played at iso and 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.820
 I have always had the problem that 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.020
 the arrow keys are not after this 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.150
 concept work 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.840
 especially when dealing with abysses 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.990
 and precision asked is annoying that okay 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.640
 this retiree and car is the design 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.590
 a great strength of the game 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.120
 pleases and testifies humorous comic graphics 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.680
 of much love to detail the 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.630
 animations are super fluid and 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.040
 adapt to the comic style very well 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.290
 the music will become something over time 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.420
 monotonous but definitely succeeded 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.830
 the absurd black humor in little 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.940
 In between, devils takes care of it again and again 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.940
 to smile for something 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.889
 this saves the game quite well 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.150
 actually, they are the little ones 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:25.290
 challenges the real one 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.330
 highlight in the game 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.250
 the dungeon crawler is unfortunately 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.930
 was fast and the challenge 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.699
 I have not had the game before 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.750
 I am playing more often but rather level 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.669
 1 came out 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.410
 only in preparation for this video 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.220
 At least I have it in the fourth 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.229
 business 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.310
 the level of difficulty does not increase 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:43.500
 necessarily 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.669
 But the riddles will be ca and demand 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.680
 more and more patience then me 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.820
 At some point, every level has been missing 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.800
 So no Dauerbrenner 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.600
 and yes it has started in the dust 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.740
 Nevertheless, friends can be curious 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.510
 gameplays and medium difficulty 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.310
 challenges your fun with the 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.960
 yes it's not easy 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.580
 if you will always feel the same 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.620
 have that game have the player 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.160
 but for all the difficulty it is 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.990
 makeable 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.479
 even if the control is not additional 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.039
 the yellow of the egg is so conclusion already 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:09.690
 alone because of the unique 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:11.280
 It is quite a game concept 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.850
 worth trying and actually does 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.080
 mood 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.940
 but you can not hide that 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.680
 the game absolute merkel has to 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.910
 I want this beautiful warm words 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.680
 Just to emphasize that they are 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:23.300
 I have no idea at all 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.300
 video ended therefore was
