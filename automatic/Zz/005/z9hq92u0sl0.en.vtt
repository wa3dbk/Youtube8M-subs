00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
up the coil and the coil starts

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.440 
up the coil and the coil starts
radiating<00:01:36.590> so<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.399> starts<00:01:37.609> lighting<00:01:37.969> up<00:01:38.210> all

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
radiating so it starts lighting up all

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.870 
radiating so it starts lighting up all
that<00:01:38.869> is<00:01:39.049> still<00:01:39.439> heat<00:01:40.039> that's<00:01:40.340> doing<00:01:40.729> it

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
that is still heat that's doing it

that is still heat that's doing it
there's<00:01:41.210> only<00:01:41.329> a<00:01:41.479> small<00:01:41.810> portion<00:01:42.079> of<00:01:42.350> that

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
there's only a small portion of that

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.459 
there's only a small portion of that
actual<00:01:43.130> light<00:01:43.460> that<00:01:43.880> we<00:01:44.240> can<00:01:44.390> see<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:45.109> rest<00:01:45.289> of

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
actual light that we can see the rest of

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:48.249 
actual light that we can see the rest of
it<00:01:45.619> is<00:01:45.770> just<00:01:45.799> radiated<00:01:46.579> heat<00:01:46.810> an<00:01:47.810> LED<00:01:48.229> light

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
it is just radiated heat an LED light

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.849 
it is just radiated heat an LED light
will<00:01:48.799> take<00:01:49.929> properties<00:01:50.929> of<00:01:51.140> certain<00:01:51.320> metals

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
will take properties of certain metals

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.059 
will take properties of certain metals
and<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.789> runs<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.350> current<00:01:54.350> through<00:01:54.590> them<00:01:54.799> and

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
and it runs the current through them and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.819 
and it runs the current through them and
actually<00:01:55.999> excites<00:01:56.539> that<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.289> difference<00:01:57.679> in

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
actually excites that the difference in

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.120 
actually excites that the difference in
the<00:01:57.979> metals<00:01:59.049> basically<00:02:00.049> produce<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:00.679> photons

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
the metals basically produce the photons

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.219 
the metals basically produce the photons
of<00:02:01.340> light<00:02:01.399> it<00:02:02.149> takes<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.630> properties<00:02:03.200> of

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
of light it takes the properties of

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.779 
of light it takes the properties of
these<00:02:03.499> two<00:02:03.679> metals<00:02:04.009> and<00:02:04.189> turns<00:02:04.369> out<00:02:04.520> into

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
these two metals and turns out into

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.539 
these two metals and turns out into
light<00:02:05.020> so<00:02:06.020> dr.<00:02:06.409> Murdoch<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:07.009> his<00:02:07.100> colleagues

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
light so dr. Murdoch and his colleagues

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.749 
light so dr. Murdoch and his colleagues
came<00:02:07.789> up<00:02:07.969> with<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.210> SS<00:02:08.750> LM<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:10.009> solid-state

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
came up with the SS LM the solid-state

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.809 
came up with the SS LM the solid-state
lighting<00:02:11.060> module<00:02:11.740> this<00:02:12.740> picture<00:02:13.190> shows<00:02:13.430> two

module<00:02:19.790> what<00:02:20.030> we<00:02:20.270> do<00:02:20.450> is<00:02:20.660> we<00:02:20.810> use<00:02:20.990> LEDs<00:02:21.500> and

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770
