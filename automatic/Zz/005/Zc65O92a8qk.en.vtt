much I don't know let me just check that

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.830 
much I don't know let me just check that
hmm<00:03:09.389> the<00:03:10.290> right<00:03:10.769> now<00:03:11.010> LGD<00:03:11.760> are<00:03:12.060> five<00:03:12.449> and<00:03:12.659> one

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
hmm the right now LGD are five and one

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.990 
hmm the right now LGD are five and one
so<00:03:13.139> with<00:03:13.290> this<00:03:13.439> they'll<00:03:13.680> be<00:03:13.709> six<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.159> two<00:03:14.310> ear
