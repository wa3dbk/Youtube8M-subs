and little tiny runs like that there's

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.180 
and little tiny runs like that there's
enough<00:04:01.550> water<00:04:01.760> there<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:03.410> hardest<00:04:03.830> thing<00:04:03.980> is

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
enough water there the hardest thing is

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.740

these little streams what sort of fly

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.070 
these little streams what sort of fly
years<00:04:31.639> it's<00:04:32.639> more<00:04:33.240> important<00:04:33.690> that<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:33.870> asked

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
years it's more important that I asked

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.219 
years it's more important that I asked
to<00:04:34.199> see<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.440> fly<00:04:34.970> being<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.030> dry<00:04:36.270> fly<00:04:36.479> I<00:04:36.900> want<00:04:37.169> to

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229

just<00:04:57.310> sort<00:04:57.490> of<00:04:57.520> run<00:04:57.730> here<00:04:58.000> is<00:04:58.120> my<00:04:58.300> ideal<00:04:58.690> run

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
just sort of run here is my ideal run

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.500 
just sort of run here is my ideal run
maybe<00:04:59.230> a<00:04:59.320> little<00:04:59.440> bit<00:04:59.620> from<00:04:59.740> the<00:04:59.830> bigger<00:05:00.130> side

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
maybe a little bit from the bigger side

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.510 
maybe a little bit from the bigger side
but<00:05:01.510> lots<00:05:01.990> of<00:05:02.140> nice<00:05:02.320> bubbles<00:05:02.800> coming<00:05:03.100> down<00:05:03.280> big

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
but lots of nice bubbles coming down big

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.000 
but lots of nice bubbles coming down big
rocks<00:05:03.790> in<00:05:03.970> it<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.420> from<00:05:05.260> this<00:05:05.470> is<00:05:05.680> this

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
rocks in it and from this is this

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.120 
rocks in it and from this is this
overhanging<00:05:06.550> branch<00:05:06.940> on<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.180> back<00:05:07.420> path

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
overhanging branch on the back path

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.130 
overhanging branch on the back path
that's<00:05:09.130> all<00:05:09.280> right<00:05:09.430> we'll<00:05:09.670> just<00:05:09.820> work<00:05:10.750> around

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
that's all right we'll just work around

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.010 
that's all right we'll just work around
it<00:05:11.230> past<00:05:11.530> 100<00:05:12.070> moving<00:05:12.490> sideways<00:05:13.060> can<00:05:13.360> squish

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
it past 100 moving sideways can squish

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.930 
it past 100 moving sideways can squish
right<00:05:14.320> up<00:05:14.440> against<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:14.860> bank<00:05:15.100> you<00:05:15.310> can<00:05:15.340> is<00:05:15.610> so
