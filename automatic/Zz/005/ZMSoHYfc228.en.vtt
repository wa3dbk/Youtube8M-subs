hey guys so I found out I have a nine
point<00:00:02.340> seven<00:00:02.550> five<00:00:02.850> Rand<00:00:03.360> in<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.629> f-150<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.620> I

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
point seven five Rand in the f-150 and I

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.309 
point seven five Rand in the f-150 and I
am<00:00:05.549> going<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.879> change<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.839> fluid<00:00:07.020> in<00:00:07.230> it

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
am going to change the fluid in it

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.410 
am going to change the fluid in it
because<00:00:07.470> it's<00:00:07.620> probably<00:00:07.799> never<00:00:08.099> been<00:00:08.309> done<00:00:08.490> so

to the bumpkin
well<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.460> differential<00:00:20.970> cover<00:00:21.769> now<00:00:22.769> what<00:00:22.980> you

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
well the differential cover now what you

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.310 
well the differential cover now what you
want<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.310> do<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.750> loosen<00:00:24.750> all<00:00:25.019> your<00:00:25.170> bolts

pry the bottom off a little bit so all

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.560 
pry the bottom off a little bit so all
the<00:00:34.110> fluid<00:00:34.410> dry<00:00:34.590> drips<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.550> then<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.450> can

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
the fluid dry drips out and then you can

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:50.270 
the fluid dry drips out and then you can
take<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.809> full<00:00:36.960> cover<00:00:37.200> off<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:49.100> just<00:00:50.100> want<00:00:50.219> to

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.970 
and you can loosen the top ones as well
this<00:00:54.809> looks<00:00:54.960> actually<00:00:55.230> does<00:00:55.500> look<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:55.800> it's

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
this looks actually does look like it's

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.340 
this looks actually does look like it's
been<00:00:56.100> changed<00:00:56.460> before<00:00:56.789> because<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.350> RTV

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
been changed before because it's RTV

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
sealant come out I think it's our

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.670 
sealant come out I think it's our
sealant<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:02.989> now<00:01:03.989> what<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.199> want<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.409> do<00:01:04.530> is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
between the differential cover here on

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:33.289 
between the differential cover here on
the<00:01:15.960> bottom<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.670> axle

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
know if differentials fluid is supposed

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.570 
know if differentials fluid is supposed
to<00:03:32.080> stink<00:03:32.380> but<00:03:32.680> this<00:03:32.830> stuff<00:03:33.010> stinks<00:03:33.340> really

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
to stink but this stuff stinks really

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.880 
to stink but this stuff stinks really
bad<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:37.450> it's<00:03:37.900> real<00:03:38.170> thick<00:03:38.470> it<00:03:38.590> looks<00:03:38.740> like<00:03:38.860> a

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
bad and it's real thick it looks like a

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:46.620 
bad and it's real thick it looks like a
milkshake<00:03:44.760> theory<00:03:45.760> so<00:03:46.060> now<00:03:46.180> we<00:03:46.240> get<00:03:46.450> all<00:03:46.540> the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
milkshake theory so now we get all the

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.570 
milkshake theory so now we get all the
bolts<00:03:46.900> out<00:03:47.400> now<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:50.800> pinch<00:03:51.220> it's

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
bolts out now the pinch it's

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.580 
bolts out now the pinch it's
theoretically<00:03:52.440> hot<00:03:53.440> water<00:03:53.739> without<00:03:54.519> anything

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
theoretically hot water without anything

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:07.750 
theoretically hot water without anything
major<00:03:56.590> in<00:03:57.220> this<00:03:57.550> first

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.490 

all<00:04:08.760> right<00:04:09.030> there<00:04:09.270> we<00:04:09.360> go<00:04:09.540> pans<00:04:09.900> off<00:04:10.140> and

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
all right there we go pans off and

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.059 
all right there we go pans off and
that's<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.739> rear<00:04:10.920> differential<00:04:11.340> oh<00:04:13.069> yeah

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
that's the rear differential oh yeah

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.870 
that's the rear differential oh yeah
this<00:04:14.280> pan<00:04:14.760> is<00:04:14.910> very<00:04:14.959> rusty<00:04:16.639> even<00:04:17.639> on<00:04:17.760> the

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
this pan is very rusty even on the

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.479 
this pan is very rusty even on the
inside<00:04:18.739> guess<00:04:19.739> we'll<00:04:19.950> be<00:04:20.040> getting<00:04:20.280> another

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
inside guess we'll be getting another

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.240 
inside guess we'll be getting another
one<00:04:23.389> now<00:04:24.389> it<00:04:24.600> snapped<00:04:24.990> off<00:04:25.169> in<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.590> bowl<00:04:25.740> well

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
one now it snapped off in the bowl well

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:35.240 
one now it snapped off in the bowl well
that's<00:04:26.460> cool<00:04:31.400> alright<00:04:32.400> guys<00:04:33.050> so<00:04:34.050> this<00:04:34.320> is<00:04:34.590> what

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
that's cool alright guys so this is what

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.940 
that's cool alright guys so this is what
is<00:04:35.370> inside<00:04:35.550> of<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:37.770> Ford<00:04:38.720> 9.75<00:04:39.720> rear<00:04:40.110> end<00:04:40.410> and

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
is inside of the Ford 9.75 rear end and

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.040 
is inside of the Ford 9.75 rear end and
I<00:04:40.979> really<00:04:41.910> know<00:04:42.030> totally<00:04:42.450> how<00:04:42.540> it<00:04:42.660> works<00:04:42.900> but

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
I really know totally how it works but

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.870 
I really know totally how it works but
these<00:04:46.050> are<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.260> C<00:04:46.440> clips<00:04:46.740> that<00:04:46.919> I<00:04:47.250> guess<00:04:47.610> are

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
these are the C clips that I guess are

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.070 
these are the C clips that I guess are
common<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.300> break<00:04:48.540> and<00:04:48.810> they<00:04:48.870> look<00:04:49.050> like

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
common to break and they look like

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.280 
common to break and they look like
they're<00:04:49.350> alright<00:04:49.740> on<00:04:49.919> mine<00:04:50.990> but<00:04:51.990> I<00:04:52.020> can't

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
they're alright on mine but I can't

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.510 
they're alright on mine but I can't
really<00:04:52.410> tell<00:04:54.830> this<00:04:55.830> actually<00:04:56.280> doesn't<00:04:56.430> look

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
really tell this actually doesn't look

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.820 
really tell this actually doesn't look
too<00:04:56.790> bad<00:04:56.820> at<00:04:57.180> all<00:04:57.330> I<00:04:57.600> was<00:04:57.870> actually<00:04:58.050> expecting

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
too bad at all I was actually expecting

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.190 
too bad at all I was actually expecting
to<00:04:59.220> see<00:04:59.370> some<00:04:59.580> quite<00:05:00.479> a<00:05:00.540> bit<00:05:00.720> of<00:05:00.810> we're<00:05:00.990> in

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
to see some quite a bit of we're in

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.900 
to see some quite a bit of we're in
there<00:05:01.410> with<00:05:01.800> mileage<00:05:02.280> it's<00:05:02.490> on<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.729> rear<00:05:02.880> end

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
there with mileage it's on the rear end

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.390 
there with mileage it's on the rear end
but<00:05:03.210> it<00:05:03.330> could<00:05:03.720> not<00:05:04.590> be<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.950> original<00:05:05.220> rear

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
but it could not be the original rear

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.060 
but it could not be the original rear
end<00:05:05.550> -<00:05:05.729> I<00:05:05.760> don't<00:05:06.060> know<00:05:06.210> I<00:05:06.800> don't<00:05:07.800> know<00:05:07.860> what<00:05:07.950> the

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
pan itself is pretty nasty looking see

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.969 
pan itself is pretty nasty looking see

that rust on the inside of it so I'm

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.659 
that rust on the inside of it so I'm
going<00:05:53.130> to<00:05:53.160> have<00:05:53.310> to<00:05:53.460> replace<00:05:53.760> it<00:05:55.460> so<00:05:56.460> now<00:05:56.580> that

I get almost all of the old oil out
here's<00:06:01.050> a<00:06:01.110> little<00:06:01.349> lack<00:06:01.500> of<00:06:01.680> thinner<00:06:01.860> to<00:06:02.340> clean

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
here's a little lack of thinner to clean

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.360 
here's a little lack of thinner to clean
up<00:06:02.700> the<00:06:03.080> edges<00:06:04.080> here<00:06:04.560> and<00:06:04.740> put<00:06:04.889> some<00:06:04.919> new<00:06:05.160> glue

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
up the edges here and put some new glue

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:16.790 
up the edges here and put some new glue
on<00:06:05.550> it

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:24.900 

you<00:06:17.800> may<00:06:18.010> also<00:06:18.220> need<00:06:18.490> a<00:06:18.550> scraper<00:06:18.910> tool<00:06:23.910> just

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
you may also need a scraper tool just
