and obviously we peel this off and this

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.929 
and obviously we peel this off and this
is<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> part<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.110> sticks<00:01:07.740> onto<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.729> car

the that peep it suck it into place and

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.749 
the that peep it suck it into place and
we've<00:01:17.970> then<00:01:18.119> got<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> actual<00:01:18.689> worm<00:01:19.700> sort<00:01:20.700> of

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
we've then got the actual worm sort of

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.580 
we've then got the actual worm sort of
bracket<00:01:21.450> at<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.600> base<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.350> there

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
bracket at the base and this is there

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.670 
bracket at the base and this is there
you<00:01:22.740> can<00:01:22.890> slip<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.310> swivel<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.939> around<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
you can slip the swivel this around to a

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.030 
you can slip the swivel this around to a
point<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.890> direction<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.490> want<00:01:28.040> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
point it in the direction you want and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.609 
point it in the direction you want and
then<00:01:32.540> it<00:01:33.540> looks<00:01:33.689> like<00:01:33.840> we've<00:01:33.960> got<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.110> spare<00:01:34.439> one

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
then it looks like we've got a spare one

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.580 
then it looks like we've got a spare one
of<00:01:34.710> those<00:01:34.860> which<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.759> good<00:01:36.170> now<00:01:37.170> how<00:01:37.290> does<00:01:37.350> this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
of those which is good now how does this

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.440 
of those which is good now how does this
fix<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.159> 15<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:38.759> there<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.119> presume<00:01:39.390> that

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
fix on 15 it's there I presume that

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.069 
fix on 15 it's there I presume that
slides<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.759> so<00:01:41.759> oh<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.119> does<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.600> then

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
slides on like so oh it does and then

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.639 
slides on like so oh it does and then
you<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.439> suppose<00:01:44.100> if<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.430> wanted<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.649> they

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
you I suppose if you wanted to you they

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.080 
you I suppose if you wanted to you they
probably<00:01:46.950> don't<00:01:47.159> use<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> screws<00:01:47.729> what<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
probably don't use the screws what the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.149 
probably don't use the screws what the
screws<00:01:48.299> are<00:01:48.450> for<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:49.020> would<00:01:49.320> imagine<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.829> for

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
screws are for I would imagine is for

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.179 
screws are for I would imagine is for
you<00:01:50.220> already<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.610> young<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:52.009> proclip<00:01:53.009> mount

this<00:02:04.229> back<00:02:04.469> together<00:02:04.729> get<00:02:05.729> get<00:02:06.090> back<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.390> track

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
this back together get get back on track

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.839 
this back together get get back on track
James<00:02:07.099> okay<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.399> once<00:02:08.520> that's<00:02:08.729> on

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
verifone and that's its

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.650 
verifone and that's its
in<00:02:14.380> there<00:02:15.380> like<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:15.920> got<00:02:16.340> there<00:02:16.460> in<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.610> end<00:02:16.730> as

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
in there like so got there in the end as

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.900 
in there like so got there in the end as
I<00:02:17.810> say<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:17.990> can<00:02:18.230> position<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:19.520> can<00:02:19.700> change

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
I say you can position you can change

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.610 
I say you can position you can change
the<00:02:20.000> position<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.570> to<00:02:21.080> suit<00:02:21.290> your<00:02:21.410> needs

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
the position of it to suit your needs

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.570 
the position of it to suit your needs
and<00:02:21.920> various<00:02:22.280> angles<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.920> I'm<00:02:25.250> going<00:02:25.550> to

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
and various angles so I'm going to

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.030 
and various angles so I'm going to
sticks<00:02:25.820> in<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.000> motor<00:02:26.180> now<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.860> test<00:02:27.860> it<00:02:27.950> out

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
sticks in the motor now and test it out

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.530 
sticks in the motor now and test it out
right<00:02:30.190> here<00:02:31.190> we<00:02:31.310> are<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.550> car<00:02:31.790> we've<00:02:32.390> got

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
right here we are in the car we've got

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.560 
right here we are in the car we've got
the<00:02:33.130> proclip<00:02:34.130> mounted<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.700> wind<00:02:35.300> screen

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
the proclip mounted to the wind screen

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.570 
the proclip mounted to the wind screen
and<00:02:35.810> it's<00:02:35.900> just<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.110> case<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.290> grabbing<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.890> the

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
and it's just a case of grabbing the the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.020 
and it's just a case of grabbing the the
q10<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.150> sliding<00:02:39.020> it<00:02:39.110> into<00:02:39.260> place<00:02:39.590> like<00:02:39.740> so

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
q10 and sliding it into place like so

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.080 
q10 and sliding it into place like so
that<00:02:41.030> fits<00:02:41.270> nice<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.480> snug<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.590> can

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
that fits nice and snug and you can

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.650 
that fits nice and snug and you can
position<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.560> whatever<00:02:45.560> angle<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.070> want

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
position that whatever angle you want

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.780 
position that whatever angle you want
that<00:02:47.660> moves<00:02:47.870> 30<00:02:48.260> degrees<00:02:48.710> in<00:02:48.920> each<00:02:49.070> way<00:02:49.310> move

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
that moves 30 degrees in each way move

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.640 
that moves 30 degrees in each way move
it<00:02:49.910> up<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.120> down<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:51.200> can<00:02:51.380> even<00:02:51.500> rotate

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
it up and down and you can even rotate

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.400 
it up and down and you can even rotate
it<00:02:52.220> which<00:02:52.370> is<00:02:52.550> a<00:02:52.780> bit<00:02:53.780> pointless<00:02:53.960> with<00:02:54.260> the

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
it which is a bit pointless with the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.940 
it which is a bit pointless with the
cute<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:54.860> but<00:02:55.750> all<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.900> other<00:02:57.020> Pro<00:02:57.380> clips<00:02:57.680> for

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
cute in but all the other Pro clips for

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.980 
cute in but all the other Pro clips for
the<00:02:57.980> touch<00:02:58.610> devices<00:02:58.940> that's<00:02:59.240> a<00:02:59.360> super<00:02:59.720> feature

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
the touch devices that's a super feature

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.750 
the touch devices that's a super feature
and<00:03:00.440> so<00:03:01.010> that's<00:03:01.130> how<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.430> earth<00:03:03.310> how<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.370> unit

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
and so that's how the earth how the unit

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.940 
and so that's how the earth how the unit
looks<00:03:04.970> one<00:03:05.900> expanded<00:03:06.380> in<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:07.250> car<00:03:08.950> absolutely

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
looks one expanded in the car absolutely

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.080 
looks one expanded in the car absolutely
perfect<00:03:10.340> if<00:03:10.460> you<00:03:10.550> ask<00:03:10.700> me<00:03:10.880> see<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:11.900> later
