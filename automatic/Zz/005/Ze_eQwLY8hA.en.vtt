treatment now as for the gasoline in

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.719 
treatment now as for the gasoline in
your<00:04:39.840> boats<00:04:40.020> internal<00:04:40.560> tank<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:41.370> general

your boats internal tank the general

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.490 
your boats internal tank the general
consensus<00:04:41.879> is<00:04:42.449> to<00:04:42.479> drain<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.289> tank

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
consensus is to drain the tank

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.159 
consensus is to drain the tank
completely<00:04:44.400> of<00:04:44.669> any<00:04:44.789> fuel<00:04:45.090> that<00:04:45.780> way<00:04:45.960> there's

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
completely of any fuel that way there's

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.409 
completely of any fuel that way there's
no<00:04:46.229> ethanol<00:04:46.650> in<00:04:47.129> the<00:04:47.280> fuel<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:47.909> absorb<00:04:48.270> any

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
no ethanol in the fuel to absorb any

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.210 
no ethanol in the fuel to absorb any
water<00:04:48.629> during<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:48.990> winter<00:04:49.259> now<00:04:49.530> most<00:04:49.949> of<00:04:50.069> us

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
water during the winter now most of us

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.770 
water during the winter now most of us
don't<00:04:50.370> have<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.759> luxury<00:04:50.879> of<00:04:51.180> draining<00:04:51.629> our

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
don't have the luxury of draining our

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.510 
don't have the luxury of draining our
tanks<00:04:52.379> at<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.500> end<00:04:52.680> of<00:04:52.710> every<00:04:52.919> season<00:04:53.069> so<00:04:53.400> the

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
tanks at the end of every season so the

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.879 
tanks at the end of every season so the
next<00:04:53.879> best<00:04:54.000> thing<00:04:54.330> is<00:04:54.539> to<00:04:54.780> top<00:04:55.139> off<00:04:55.379> the<00:04:55.409> tank

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
next best thing is to top off the tank

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.980 
next best thing is to top off the tank
leaving<00:04:56.789> just<00:04:57.060> enough<00:04:57.150> room<00:04:57.539> to<00:04:57.750> allow<00:04:57.960> for

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
leaving just enough room to allow for

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.260 
leaving just enough room to allow for
expansion<00:04:58.289> of<00:04:58.800> the<00:04:58.860> gasoline<00:04:59.370> due<00:04:59.610> to<00:04:59.729> changes

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
expansion of the gasoline due to changes

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.710 
expansion of the gasoline due to changes
in<00:05:00.389> air<00:05:01.050> temperature<00:05:01.650> after<00:05:02.240> that<00:05:03.240> add<00:05:03.449> the

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
in air temperature after that add the

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.839 
in air temperature after that add the
conditioner<00:05:04.259> and<00:05:04.500> stabilizer<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.580> the

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
conditioner and stabilizer and the

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.430 
conditioner and stabilizer and the
ethanol<00:05:06.270> treatment<00:05:06.720> of<00:05:06.780> your<00:05:06.870> choice<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.380> you

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
ethanol treatment of your choice and you

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.849 
ethanol treatment of your choice and you
should<00:05:07.650> be<00:05:07.680> good<00:05:07.800> to<00:05:07.979> go<00:05:08.099> for<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.580> winter
