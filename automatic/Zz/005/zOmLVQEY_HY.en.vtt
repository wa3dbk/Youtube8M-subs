00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
reduce the cost of lizard to 20 this is

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:35.480 
reduce the cost of lizard to 20 this is
good

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:44.410 

so<00:03:36.480> yeah<00:03:37.970> not<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.000> very<00:03:42.110> exciting<00:03:43.110> skill<00:03:43.800> is<00:03:43.980> it

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
so yeah not a very exciting skill is it

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.820 
so yeah not a very exciting skill is it
when<00:03:45.420> it<00:03:45.540> doesn't<00:03:45.720> look<00:03:46.050> different<00:03:46.560> for<00:03:46.680> one

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
when it doesn't look different for one

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:55.050 
when it doesn't look different for one
another<00:03:47.040> it's<00:03:47.490> just<00:03:47.730> not<00:03:47.820> very<00:03:48.210> good<00:03:48.330> visually

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.610 

and<00:03:55.660> if<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.870> does<00:03:56.050> look<00:03:56.260> different<00:03:56.380> for

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
and if it does look different for

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:06.150 
and if it does look different for
another<00:03:56.890> I<00:03:57.040> can't<00:03:57.310> really<00:03:57.459> got<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.849> Intel<00:04:05.160> all

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
another I can't really got the Intel all

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.510 
another I can't really got the Intel all
right<00:04:06.430> so<00:04:07.300> next<00:04:07.780> start<00:04:08.440> a<00:04:08.620> winter<00:04:09.069> increase

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
right so next start a winter increase

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.220 
right so next start a winter increase
the<00:04:09.640> size<00:04:09.880> of<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.090> blizzard<00:04:10.330> to<00:04:10.510> cover<00:04:10.690> 22

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
the size of the blizzard to cover 22

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.080 
the size of the blizzard to cover 22
yards<00:04:11.590> yielding<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.099> same<00:04:12.280> damage<00:04:12.580> over<00:04:12.970> the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
yards yielding the same damage over the

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.420 
yards yielding the same damage over the
same<00:04:13.269> second<00:04:16.410> why<00:04:17.410> could<00:04:17.620> why<00:04:17.980> couldn't<00:04:18.340> they

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
same second why could why couldn't they

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.270 
same second why could why couldn't they
just<00:04:18.459> said<00:04:18.760> increases<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.600> area<00:04:20.019> of<00:04:20.109> effect

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
just said increases the area of effect

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.220 
just said increases the area of effect
why<00:04:21.280> do<00:04:21.340> they<00:04:21.489> have<00:04:21.579> to<00:04:21.639> reiterate<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.990> same

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
why do they have to reiterate the same

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:32.840 
why do they have to reiterate the same
damage<00:04:23.530> in<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:24.070> same<00:04:24.340> time

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.820 

as<00:04:33.850> you<00:04:34.120> can<00:04:34.240> obviously<00:04:34.870> sleep<00:04:35.110> Blizzard<00:04:35.710> is

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
as you can obviously sleep Blizzard is

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.110 
as you can obviously sleep Blizzard is
now<00:04:36.090> massively<00:04:37.090> covering<00:04:37.660> an<00:04:37.780> area<00:04:39.120> still

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
now massively covering an area still

00:04:40.120 --> 00:05:00.619 
now massively covering an area still
weak<00:04:40.300> as<00:04:40.479> but

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:00.629 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:08.610 

maybe<00:05:01.629> this<00:05:01.870> will<00:05:01.900> help<00:05:05.190> last<00:05:07.169> under<00:05:08.169> letting

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
maybe this will help last under letting

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.860 
maybe this will help last under letting
storm<00:05:09.039> increase<00:05:09.669> the<00:05:09.789> duration<00:05:10.090> of<00:05:10.419> lizard<00:05:10.780> to

deal 280 weapon damage over 8 seconds

00:05:14.159 --> 00:06:06.810 
deal 280 weapon damage over 8 seconds
this<00:05:15.159> is<00:05:15.310> an<00:05:15.430> overall<00:05:15.940> increase<00:05:15.970> in<00:05:16.419> damage

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820
