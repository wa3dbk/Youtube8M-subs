 Because look at that Japan but this Ne I'm just a Red Bull I'm a Red Blue 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:29.529

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:33.890
 Japan's pattern was written as high-end European 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:37.880
 It is said that this is a practite turn for minor 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.870
 There are a lot of things written like etc but I actually drink it and try it a little bit 2 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.100
 I'm reviewing and watching 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.210

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.970

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.910
 First of all 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.150
 It's not a turn 3 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.030

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.560
 The taste is the same as normal Red Bull. 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.130
 Somehow it is pretty sweet 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.579

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.890
 It may be doing something like this 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.890
