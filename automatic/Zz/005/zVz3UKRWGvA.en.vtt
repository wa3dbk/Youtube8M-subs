playing<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.500> background<00:00:22.710> first<00:00:23.130> because

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
playing in the background first because

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.830 
playing in the background first because
I<00:00:23.550> know<00:00:23.670> there's<00:00:23.939> gonna<00:00:24.029> be<00:00:24.119> questions<00:00:24.420> about

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840

I know there's gonna be questions about
that<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.680> it's<00:00:25.890> basically<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.849> powder<00:00:27.150> day

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
that so it's basically just a powder day

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.000

jump just for practicing some fern flips
and<00:00:35.610> backflips<00:00:36.120> it's<00:00:36.660> not<00:00:36.840> really<00:00:37.079> big<00:00:37.320> enough

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
and backflips it's not really big enough

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.709 
and backflips it's not really big enough
for<00:00:37.620> them<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.920> learn<00:00:38.550> anything<00:00:38.850> else<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.390> did

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
for them to learn anything else I did

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.260 
for them to learn anything else I did
try<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> coke<00:00:40.350> five<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.219> even<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:42.000> was

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
try a coke five of it but even that was

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.720 
try a coke five of it but even that was
a<00:00:42.300> little<00:00:42.600> bit<00:00:42.899> too<00:00:43.230> small<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.129> get<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> full

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
a little bit too small to get the full

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.119 
a little bit too small to get the full
rotation<00:00:45.210> around<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.710> some<00:00:46.950> good

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
rotation around but it's just some good

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.709 
rotation around but it's just some good
looking<00:00:47.399> footage<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.879> thought<00:00:48.120> use<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.570> as

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
looking footage so I thought use it as

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.209 
looking footage so I thought use it as
background<00:00:49.079> footage<00:00:49.500> while<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.710> answer<00:00:49.890> some

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
background footage while I answer some

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.400 
background footage while I answer some
questions<00:00:50.579> okay<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.600> let's<00:00:51.930> get<00:00:52.050> into<00:00:52.289> the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
but a lot I think it's a lot easier to

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.479 
but a lot I think it's a lot easier to
find<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.459> job<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.810> can<00:03:23.079> do<00:03:23.290> that<00:03:24.010> lets<00:03:24.310> you

have the free time to snow but a lot so

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.229 
have the free time to snow but a lot so
it<00:03:27.160> doesn't<00:03:27.400> have<00:03:27.519> to<00:03:27.639> be<00:03:27.760> directly<00:03:28.120> related

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
it doesn't have to be directly related

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.750 
it doesn't have to be directly related
to<00:03:28.690> snowboarding<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.440> mean<00:03:30.190> even<00:03:30.459> what<00:03:30.609> I<00:03:30.639> do

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760
