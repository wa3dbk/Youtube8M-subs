understood the challenge of researching
developing<00:04:14.500> finding<00:04:15.500> out<00:04:15.620> what<00:04:15.829> I<00:04:15.859> need<00:04:16.039> to<00:04:16.160> do

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.560 

I<00:04:20.229> called<00:04:21.229> this<00:04:21.350> car<00:04:21.590> for<00:04:21.919> logic<00:04:22.340> deco<00:04:22.699> echo

I called this car for logic deco echo
because<00:04:23.780> my<00:04:24.080> original<00:04:24.560> concept<00:04:24.710> sketches

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
because my original concept sketches

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.430 
because my original concept sketches
looked<00:04:25.610> like<00:04:25.760> a<00:04:25.789> gecko<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.720> for<00:04:27.020> logic

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
looked like a gecko and for logic

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.900 
looked like a gecko and for logic
because<00:04:27.680> it<00:04:27.710> represents<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.400> four<00:04:28.669> key

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
because it represents the four key
