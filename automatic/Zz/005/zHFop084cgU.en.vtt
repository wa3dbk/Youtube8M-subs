think today guys showing up I say that
was<00:02:17.490> our<00:02:17.640> goal<00:02:17.670> was<00:02:18.000> just<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.300> try<00:02:18.930> and

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
was our goal was just to try and

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.080 
was our goal was just to try and
encourage<00:02:19.320> both<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.070> kids<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.550> family<00:02:20.700> I

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
think it's really rather than on both

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.290 
think it's really rather than on both
