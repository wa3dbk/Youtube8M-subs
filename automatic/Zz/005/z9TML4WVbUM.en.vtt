00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.790
 absolutely nothing and we also continue 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.590
 knowing issues related to 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.080
 the world of fashion that if I do like 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.599
 these times well and good I hope that 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.639
 trip pretty much better because always 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.529
 we have been talking about good fashion 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.720
 Beauty stereotypes of physicists 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.070
 of the models on occasion 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.260
 we were talking about the diets of 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.910
 Victoria's models secrets by 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.070
 example that has been quite controversial 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.779
 well in this case I have to tell you that 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.369
 It has been announced very good news and 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.080
 that has to do with one of the 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.360
 most important publications that have 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.059
 what to see with style and fashion and we are 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.130
 talking about box has 19 publications 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.809
 around the world and set trends 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.270
 they are constantly discovering 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.860
 models anna wintour is the person who 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.360
 we talk about the devil dresses fashion 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.789
 Well, she is the one that marks 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.050
 definitely the trends and in this 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.879
 case that announcement that they are not going to 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.660
 work with models that have less than 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.160
 16 years old or it seems that his body is 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.340
 unhealthy has some kind of 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.170
 food disorder anorexia season 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.170
 release to the medium exactly that 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.540
 anorexia but it 's a very good news 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.870
 received and what is expected is that other 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.600
 public 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.930
 also join this initiative that you 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.240
 story that not only has to do with 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.000
 these two things but it is also like 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.250
 an integral plan because they also pretend 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.160
 that good for example when you make a 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.870
 backstage or a photo shoot the 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.720
 models or not do not work in schedules that 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.850
 that are out there or not long at night or 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.100
 many hours that is not so 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.470
 intensive and also accompany you with 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.790
 healthy food nothing of a carrot and 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.880
 a glass of water 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.590
 good they pretend that the feeding is 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.780
 a little bit better and that's also 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.050
 they want to encourage what they are to 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.880
 designers what good do you do is 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.700
 a little bit bigger because they say their 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.590
 designs come in very very thin people 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.120
 then that made them too 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.230
 I'm going to look for these kind of people 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.440
 we know that there is a 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.870
 carve sml can put a the any 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.760
 model not totally or an xl to be able 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.200
 accommodate it and to be able to adapt things 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.550
 what about what you are 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.380
 mentioning there are up to 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.729
 television that mark what are the 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.470
 possibilities and alternatives 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.880
 about what you can eat and not 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.540
 can eat a suck 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.570
 that model specifically and this of not 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.090
 I know how to feast and eat at 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.550
 better a succulent dish of food or 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.590
 be able to repeat some portion and others 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.020
 almost almost like they have it incorporated 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.880
 as a forbidden issue that does not 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.190
 can do not good and when this 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.500
 it looks like it's going to start changing the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.230
 situation and with regard to what it has 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.120
 they do with children under 16 had 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.230
 generated or this we're seeing this 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.090
 moment I want to comment before 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.760
 explain all the values ​​these girls 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.530
 her name is karlie kloss and she is a model and 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.860
 was the one that sparked the controversy 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.180
 look at this photo shoot look at the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.980
 ours that are not so directly the 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.620
 key the basic clavicle that I made is 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.900
 good is a thinness the hip that is 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.930
 proposes as a stereotype or as an ideal to 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.490
 king through a magazine that is that 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.980
 has the highest sales worldwide 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.750
 So what they want to propose is this 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.880
 influence that directly or indirectly 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.710
 is generated on the young woman or on 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.450
 women who are watching and buy 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.970
 magazines good to change a bit what 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.190
 are the stereotypes yes and with respect to 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.640
 the minors also this publication the 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.880
 year 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.980
 I had a situation with a girl of 10 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.000
 years that was cover of the magazine but 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.850
 the problem was in what is the 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.770
 sexualization of the minors then it 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.360
 proposed from different areas by 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.770
 example from the brain having 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.290
 apologized inside there are images that 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.420
 these are unpleasant follow 66 because 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.700
 let's agree that beyond what I can 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.360
 make the possibility of putting something like 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.340
 a sample or as a model of something I 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.810
 it seems that it is bordering on what 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.010
 practically bad taste 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.840
 well this is the mine that I 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.850
 spoke and those images that we saw that 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.680
 they say that babe is 10 years old by 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.390
 you except two of them who arrest there 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.300
 this is the girl is 10 years old then 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.519
 with a makeup and some pretty poses 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.000
 suggestive that at 10 years does not have 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:09.160
 why be doing if then upload 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.680
 that creature gets it is not 10 years old 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.510
 that is, he does not have 10 years in life 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.519
 we refer clearly but good the subject 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.950
 of not to not allow minors 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.209
 are also participating in this type 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.190
 of sessions has to do with that 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.750
 they interrupt what their studies are 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.360
 also in a problem sometimes of 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.090
 financial exploitation 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.009
 good takes advantage is entered in a 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.259
 world that are lines do not have to 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.030
 know at the moment are the adults 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.740
 that they have to have although the brand 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.199
 enough because we agree that the 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.509
 black do not go alone yes exactly and you 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.789
 I tell you that this measure was already accompanied 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.039
 from before by some other 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:46.379
 organizations in Milan for example and in 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.479
 Italy in fashion organizations does not 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:50.520
 allow models to define if not 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.650
 they have certain muscle mass for 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.330
 example or the government of israel also 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.789
 promotes a law recently that does not 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.319
 allows models too thin and 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.750
 all that has to do in a certain way 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:03.509
 with a change of stereotypes and because 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.250
 before the average age a fat person 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.960
 was considered healthy today 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.060
 fat person is out of what is 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.849
 aesthetic and what is the stereotype 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.500
 then well we celebrate this and of 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:15.449
 we also encourage other 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.370
 publications in our country are added to 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.139
 this initiative seems fantastic and 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.810
 beyond having part of what is the 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.759
 body image let's agree that this 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.319
 go and help for what is a better 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:27.300
 quality of life as such but good to 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:29.370
 we, although we like to follow 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.300
 certain stereotypes without going crazy 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.389
