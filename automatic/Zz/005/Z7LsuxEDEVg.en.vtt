00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
going on with that map there's it's

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.889 
going on with that map there's it's
actually<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> challenging<00:01:53.070> zombies<00:01:53.659> you<00:01:54.659> can't

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
actually a challenging zombies you can't

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.749 
actually a challenging zombies you can't
really<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.380> post<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:55.979> one<00:01:56.130> spot<00:01:56.369> it's

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
really like post up in one spot it's

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.380 
really like post up in one spot it's
really<00:01:57.000> hard<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.630> know<00:01:57.750> train<00:01:58.500> circles

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
really hard to do you know train circles

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.450 
really hard to do you know train circles
which<00:02:00.390> makes<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.810> even<00:02:00.930> more<00:02:01.189> complicated<00:02:02.189> for

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
which makes it even more complicated for

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.249 
which makes it even more complicated for
me<00:02:02.490> because<00:02:03.060> I'll<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.479> keep<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.229> know

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
me because I'll have to keep you know

me because I'll have to keep you know
running<00:02:04.649> get<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.549> stay<00:02:05.759> mobile<00:02:06.619> but<00:02:07.619> maybe

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
running get to stay mobile but maybe

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.410 
running get to stay mobile but maybe
later<00:02:08.190> down<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.520> road<00:02:08.700> I'll<00:02:09.000> figure<00:02:09.179> out<00:02:09.300> a

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
later down the road I'll figure out a

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.470 
later down the road I'll figure out a
good<00:02:09.629> spot<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.950> pretty<00:02:11.160> cool<00:02:11.370> though

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
good spot it's pretty cool though

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.690 
good spot it's pretty cool though
as<00:02:13.170> far<00:02:13.379> as<00:02:13.409> the<00:02:13.590> maps<00:02:13.830> are<00:02:13.980> concerned<00:02:14.400> up<00:02:14.550> I

do<00:02:31.709> like<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.250> maps<00:02:32.519> but<00:02:32.970> it's<00:02:33.269> just<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
do like the maps but it's just the

people that are that are playing them

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.869 
people that are that are playing them
it's<00:02:36.299> really<00:02:36.629> slow<00:02:37.170> gameplay<00:02:37.739> it's<00:02:38.670> really

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
it's really slow gameplay it's really

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.789 
it's really slow gameplay it's really
hard<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.299> find<00:02:39.569> people<00:02:39.780> especially<00:02:40.440> when

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
hard to find people especially when

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.300 
hard to find people especially when
they're<00:02:40.980> using<00:02:41.340> counter<00:02:41.909> UAVs<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.510> ghosts<00:02:43.310> it

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
they're using counter UAVs and ghosts it

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.650 
they're using counter UAVs and ghosts it
makes<00:02:44.519> it<00:02:44.670> really<00:02:44.910> challenging<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.629> find

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
makes it really challenging to find

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.900 
there and think that this you know is
going<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.959> be<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.170> crazy<00:03:07.829> rushing<00:03:08.459> game<00:03:08.640> its

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.449 
going to be a crazy rushing game its
domination<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:09.980> it's<00:03:10.980> going<00:03:11.129> to<00:03:11.220> take<00:03:11.430> a

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
domination so it's going to take a

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.400 
domination so it's going to take a
minute<00:03:11.760> for<00:03:11.879> me<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.269> adjust<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:13.049> figure<00:03:13.349> out

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
minute for me to adjust and figure out

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.640 
minute for me to adjust and figure out
you<00:03:13.709> know<00:03:13.769> which<00:03:14.239> routes<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.540> take<00:03:15.750> are<00:03:16.019> the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
you know which routes to take are the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.220 
you know which routes to take are the
best<00:03:16.889> in<00:03:17.359> lately<00:03:18.359> I<00:03:18.480> haven't<00:03:18.690> been<00:03:18.900> playing

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.960 
guys I guess haven't got a map pack just
yet<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.209> most<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.930> my<00:03:25.430> my<00:03:26.430> friends<00:03:26.819> are

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
yet and most of my my friends are

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.159 
yet and most of my my friends are
usually<00:03:27.720> on<00:03:27.870> ps3<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:29.130> game<00:03:29.400> was<00:03:29.639> so<00:03:30.169> that

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
usually on ps3 that I game was so that

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.750 
usually on ps3 that I game was so that
actually<00:03:31.620> makes<00:03:31.829> it<00:03:31.919> challenging<00:03:32.130> for<00:03:32.430> me

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
actually makes it challenging for me

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.120 
actually makes it challenging for me
because<00:03:33.090> when<00:03:33.299> I<00:03:33.359> jump<00:03:33.720> into<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:34.049> match<00:03:34.380> it's

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
because when I jump into a match it's

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.300 
because when I jump into a match it's
either<00:03:35.340> already<00:03:35.760> started<00:03:36.269> or<00:03:36.859> the<00:03:37.859> whole<00:03:38.069> team

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
either already started or the whole team

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.159 
either already started or the whole team
is<00:03:38.489> using<00:03:38.669> ghost<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.450> know<00:03:39.599> and<00:03:39.840> I'm<00:03:39.989> not

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
is using ghost you know and I'm not

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.890 
is using ghost you know and I'm not
kidding<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.590> mean<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:41.190> really<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.900> frustrating

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
kidding I mean it really is frustrating

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.809 
kidding I mean it really is frustrating
I<00:03:43.470> don't<00:03:43.889> want<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.069> complain<00:03:44.459> about<00:03:44.669> it

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
I don't want to complain about it

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.069 
I don't want to complain about it
everybody<00:03:45.750> knows<00:03:46.019> but<00:03:47.239> it's<00:03:48.239> it's<00:03:48.569> worse<00:03:48.870> than

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
everybody knows but it's it's worse than

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.530 
everybody knows but it's it's worse than
nuke<00:03:49.319> tubing<00:03:49.739> it<00:03:50.040> really<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.489> i<00:03:50.790> mean<00:03:51.000> new

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
tubing is a different story in this game

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.879 
tubing is a different story in this game
it<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.419> could<00:03:54.959> shoot<00:03:55.109> somebody<00:03:55.379> with<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.650> new

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
it you could shoot somebody with a new

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.699 
it you could shoot somebody with a new
tube<00:03:56.129> and<00:03:56.370> not<00:03:56.790> even<00:03:57.030> die<00:03:57.209> off<00:03:57.569> of<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:57.989> but<00:03:58.560> when

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
tube and not even die off of it but when

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.099 
tube and not even die off of it but when
you<00:03:58.829> have<00:03:58.889> ghosts<00:03:59.459> and<00:03:59.549> use<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.819> UAV<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.690> counter

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
you have ghosts and use a UAV a counter

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.650 
you have ghosts and use a UAV a counter
UAV<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.799> even<00:04:02.400> if<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:02.639> use<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.790> blackbird<00:04:03.389> just

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
UAV and even if you use a blackbird just

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.330 
UAV and even if you use a blackbird just
try<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:04.019> combination<00:04:04.349> you<00:04:04.739> just<00:04:04.919> try<00:04:05.099> it<00:04:05.160> out

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
try that combination you just try it out

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.000 
try that combination you just try it out
it<00:04:05.579> is<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:06.389> overpowered<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.379> is<00:04:07.470> not<00:04:07.829> even

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
it is so overpowered it is not even

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.890 
it is so overpowered it is not even
funny<00:04:08.160> like<00:04:08.579> if<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.910> have<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.180> whole<00:04:09.419> team<00:04:09.449> do
