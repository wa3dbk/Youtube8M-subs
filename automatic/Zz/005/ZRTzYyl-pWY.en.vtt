put the fork in and remove it so you

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.160

messy the skins will just slide right

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.220 
messy the skins will just slide right
off<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.379> can<00:00:52.379> place<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.940> flesh<00:00:54.300> inside<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
off and you can place the flesh inside a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.540 
off and you can place the flesh inside a
food<00:00:56.100> processor<00:00:56.579> or<00:00:56.610> blender<00:00:58.340> you<00:00:59.340> want<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
food processor or blender you want to

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.860 
food processor or blender you want to
break<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.850> apart<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.390> make<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.719> little

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
break it apart to make it a little

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.649 
break it apart to make it a little
easier<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.469> turn<00:01:03.110> and<00:01:05.060> you'll<00:01:06.060> add<00:01:06.240> just<00:01:06.479> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
easier to turn and you'll add just a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.140 
easier to turn and you'll add just a
little<00:01:06.689> bit<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.320> water<00:01:07.640> because<00:01:08.640> sweet

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
little bit of water because sweet

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.810 
little bit of water because sweet
potatoes<00:01:09.630> are<00:01:09.840> starchy<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:11.130> will<00:01:11.400> help<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
potatoes are starchy it will help the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.980 
potatoes are starchy it will help the
blending<00:01:12.210> process<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:14.330> then<00:01:15.330> you'll<00:01:15.600> puree

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
blending process and then you'll puree

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:35.470 
blending process and then you'll puree
this<00:01:16.850> for<00:01:17.850> about<00:01:17.970> 20<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.869> 35<00:01:19.290> seconds

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.310 

so<00:01:36.480> you<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:36.810> see<00:01:38.000> that<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.210> makes<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.900> very

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
so you can see that this makes a very

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.420 
so you can see that this makes a very
very<00:01:40.620> nice<00:01:40.950> smooth<00:01:41.550> consistency<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.430> baby

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
that's just brand new to eating and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.420 
that's just brand new to eating and
needs<00:01:47.370> the<00:01:47.640> puree<00:01:48.000> extra<00:01:48.480> thin<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.920> next<00:01:50.160> I'm

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
needs the puree extra thin so next I'm

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.330 
needs the puree extra thin so next I'm
going<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.730> review<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.510> puree<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:53.130> will<00:01:53.250> be
