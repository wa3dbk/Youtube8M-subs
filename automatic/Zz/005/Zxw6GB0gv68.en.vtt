forward<00:01:47.520> from<00:01:47.700> year<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.299> year<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.869> use<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.530> a

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
forward from year to year and use as a

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.800 
forward from year to year and use as a
basis<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.220> future<00:01:50.520> assessments<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.360> so

basis for the future assessments and so

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
obviously as you pointed out if we start

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.280 
obviously as you pointed out if we start
out<00:01:53.850> with<00:01:53.880> an<00:01:54.119> assessment<00:01:54.630> that's<00:01:54.810> too<00:01:55.020> high

out with an assessment that's too high

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.440 
out with an assessment that's too high

get<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.740> down<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.700> something<00:02:08.849> that's<00:02:09.179> more

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
get it down to something that's more

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.969 
get it down to something that's more
reasonable<00:02:09.569> yeah<00:02:10.349> into<00:02:10.619> something<00:02:10.920> that's

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
reasonable yeah into something that's

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.710 
reasonable yeah into something that's
basically<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> market<00:02:11.940> value<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.209> your<00:02:12.330> home

why should you pay taxes on a price that

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.290 
why should you pay taxes on a price that
maybe<00:02:16.230> let's<00:02:16.530> say<00:02:16.590> was<00:02:16.940> $500,000<00:02:17.940> two<00:02:18.090> years

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
maybe let's say was $500,000 two years

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.450 
maybe let's say was $500,000 two years
ago<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.720> now<00:02:18.840> you're<00:02:19.020> worth<00:02:19.170> 350<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.280> want

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
ago and now you're worth 350 so you want

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.610 
ago and now you're worth 350 so you want
your<00:02:20.550> tax<00:02:20.820> bill<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.240> be<00:02:21.390> on<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:22.050> current<00:02:22.440> price

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
your tax bill to be on the current price

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.860 
your tax bill to be on the current price
not<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.370> old<00:02:23.520> price<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.180> Tracy<00:02:24.420> what<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
not the old price so Tracy what is the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.130 
not the old price so Tracy what is the
first<00:02:25.290> step<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.910> take<00:02:27.180> if<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.930> need

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
first step that you can take if you need

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.070 
first step that you can take if you need
to<00:02:28.260> challenge<00:02:28.500> an<00:02:28.860> older<00:02:29.220> assessment<00:02:30.080> well

right away so I wasn't paying for it for

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.690 
right away so I wasn't paying for it for
the<00:03:55.049> next<00:03:55.170> ten<00:03:55.470> years<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.830> come<00:03:56.010> yeah<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.489> that

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
the next ten years to come yeah and that

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.880 
the next ten years to come yeah and that
was<00:03:56.850> based<00:03:57.060> on<00:03:57.269> an<00:03:57.390> assessment<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.870> your<00:03:58.500> home

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
was based on an assessment of your home

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.949 
was based on an assessment of your home
that<00:03:59.100> went<00:03:59.310> down<00:03:59.610> basically<00:04:00.330> around<00:04:00.630> eleven

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
that went down basically around eleven

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.720 
that went down basically around eleven
thousand<00:04:01.380> dollars<00:04:01.739> so<00:04:01.890> just<00:04:02.100> imagine<00:04:02.220> there

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
thousand dollars so just imagine there

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.400 
thousand dollars so just imagine there
are<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.850> lot<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.030> people<00:04:03.570> out<00:04:03.660> there<00:04:03.720> whose

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
are a lot of people out there whose

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.320 
are a lot of people out there whose
homes<00:04:04.680> have<00:04:04.830> gone<00:04:05.040> down<00:04:05.310> one<00:04:05.910> hundred

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
homes have gone down one hundred

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.289 
homes have gone down one hundred
thousand<00:04:06.750> dollars<00:04:06.780> in<00:04:07.200> value<00:04:07.230> in<00:04:07.920> one<00:04:08.280> year<00:04:08.880> so

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
thousand dollars in value in one year so

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.970 
thousand dollars in value in one year so
that<00:04:09.540> can<00:04:09.720> be<00:04:09.750> translated<00:04:10.170> into<00:04:10.410> really<00:04:10.799> big

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
that can be translated into really big

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.860 
that can be translated into really big

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
and that's exactly what I did there are

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.450 
and that's exactly what I did there are
other<00:04:53.259> town<00:04:53.680> houses<00:04:53.979> in<00:04:54.310> my<00:04:54.430> neighborhood
