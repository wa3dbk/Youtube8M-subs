00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.100
 youtube friends of this speaks miguel 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.370
 angel rocha below I'm going to 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.460
 teach how we can extract a wine from 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.910
 a cade zetas of him and the 9 for so 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.910
 later to be able to modify it and 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.780
 to be able to make our mistake in 19 without 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.420
 import what header we have if not 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.270
 They know how to modify a wine and make it 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.650
 error until 79 I recommend that you 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:34.970
 visit my videos and look for the how 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:38.450
 modify it well and how to make rice to it 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.520
 and 9 in any way I in the 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.910
 description I leave the links of my 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.970
 videos this is very easy to do what 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.130
 only we need is the header 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.010
 previously downloaded 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.870
 and this folder called ton header 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.420
 points 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.510
 good description I leave the link to 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.460
 download the folder and the link of the 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.220
 page where you can download the 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.000
 headers that you like once you have 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.990
 downloaded his header and the folder 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.560
 C치diz is all going to decompress the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.560
 binder 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.939
 and he's going to give us a folder with the name 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:26.969
 same here says tat칩n we go in the beginning 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.200
 team to dislodge and we're going to move it 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.390
 here 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.719
 once they have moved it we are going to 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.579
 express to the folder and we will move the 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.820
 call of z that we download 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.500
 previously done this let's go to 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.189
 start and let's write cmd we give 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.189
 enter 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.100
 I move this a little bit here 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.360
 now 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.360
 let's proceed to write the following 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.890
 cd enter bar 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:11.130
 from space 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:12.780
 sometimes they are people and we write 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.770
 brock 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.980
 the recipe space and here we go to 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.459
 write the name of the cade z in my case 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.910
 it's a version is a 20 jones went down 0 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.770
 two 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.620
 it's up to you that every time 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.070
 that they have you is an example and here I have 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.840
 another that is a best and is and a low 00 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.350
 depending on which one you have written 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.350
 name 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.760
 in my baby 20 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.620
 john under 0 2 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.409
 once they had written large space 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.900
 next we are going to write the 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:59.940
 model to which the cade z corresponds in 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:04.049
 my case is a linyi of 768 if you 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:08.940
 they were never downloaded from z 1765 puts 65 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:12.150
 if they downloaded one of 760 they put 760 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.220
 always putting the gp and in a number to 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.070
 It is corresponding expensive 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.790
 once this is done we give space and 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:24.540
 we wrote the version of the header 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:29.520
 simple is to say 20 to unwritten 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:33.270
 the 0 2 or the 0 0 write see the number of 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:37.980
 c치diz eta and its letter once this is done 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:40.290
 give people and start hades compile the 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.900
 C치diz eta this process takes 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.700
 approximately 5 to 10 minutes is 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.700
 a while more I return with you 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.900
 here back with you as you can 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:00.510
 see the process is over 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.030
 we can close the cmd this window 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.900
 now inside the header folder 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.450
 The tone that we moved before being placed was created 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.819
 a folder with the name of bill here 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.129
 we are to her as you can see here already 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.739
 the bits of the cade z appear only 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.620
 it would be necessary to choose the one that they wish to modify 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.930
 already in order to make the mistake and not 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.150
 they know how to modify psuv and I turn them to 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.460
 remember to visit my videos of how 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.310
 modify a wine and so they can already 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.410
 rootear to go up and that of 9 I hope there is 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.720
 liked anything they do not have 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.720
 questions that have an excellent day
