at first you think there's a lot of

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.720 
at first you think there's a lot of
paperwork<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:13.769> not<00:04:13.890> that<00:04:14.010> easy<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.370> get

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
paperwork and it's not that easy to get

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.120 
paperwork and it's not that easy to get
in<00:04:14.910> but<00:04:15.510> I<00:04:15.570> think<00:04:15.660> when<00:04:16.230> you<00:04:16.410> just<00:04:16.769> start

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130
