and<00:01:52.920> then<00:01:53.069> I<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.190> just<00:01:53.489> move<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.759> up<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.060> down

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
and then I can just move it up and down

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.270 
and then I can just move it up and down
from<00:01:54.360> there<00:01:54.660> so<00:01:55.289> as<00:01:55.410> you<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.619> see<00:01:55.770> there<00:01:56.069> is<00:01:56.250> a

from there so as you can see there is a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.279 
from there so as you can see there is a

fits together fairly well with the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.250 
fits together fairly well with the
exception<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.880> one<00:02:39.390> piece<00:02:39.720> which<00:02:39.959> I'll<00:02:40.080> talk

about in a minute the sword here or not
the<00:02:43.319> sword<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.680> sheath<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.600> also<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.630> separate

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
the sword the sheath is also a separate

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.140 
the sword the sheath is also a separate
piece<00:02:46.319> that<00:02:46.800> comes<00:02:47.069> up<00:02:47.220> around<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.670> back<00:02:47.850> and

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
piece that comes up around the back and

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.110 
piece that comes up around the back and
that<00:02:48.270> connects<00:02:49.050> over<00:02:49.290> here<00:02:50.040> on<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.670> hip<00:02:50.880> so

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
that connects over here on the hip so

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.030 
that connects over here on the hip so
that<00:02:51.270> just<00:02:51.450> pegs<00:02:51.690> in<00:02:51.870> there<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.319> then<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:52.860> is

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
that just pegs in there and then this is

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.880 
that just pegs in there and then this is
all<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.190> separate<00:02:53.670> piece<00:02:54.200> it's<00:02:55.200> not<00:02:55.350> usable<00:02:55.709> of

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
all a separate piece it's not usable of

all a separate piece it's not usable of
course<00:02:56.100> it's<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.489> for<00:02:56.700> looks<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.120> knife

alternate<00:03:10.170> this<00:03:10.350> piece<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.950> have<00:03:11.040> to

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
alternate this piece you have to

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.280 
alternate this piece you have to
assemble<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:11.790> yourself<00:03:11.819> or<00:03:12.239> put<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.540> on<00:03:12.720> so

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
assemble it yourself or put that on so

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.780 
assemble it yourself or put that on so

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.130 
in or snaps in up there the only thing
that<00:03:17.160> bothers<00:03:17.550> me<00:03:17.580> about<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.300> it<00:03:18.810> doesn't

anyway<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:29.430> maybe<00:03:29.880> that<00:03:30.120> was<00:03:30.269> intentional<00:03:30.900> I

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
anyway so maybe that was intentional I

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.710 
anyway so maybe that was intentional I
don't<00:03:31.769> know<00:03:31.890> it<00:03:32.370> does<00:03:32.700> bother<00:03:32.940> me<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.239> bit<00:03:33.329> but

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
don't know it does bother me a bit but

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.960 
don't know it does bother me a bit but
it's<00:03:33.870> not<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.049> huge<00:03:34.440> problem<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:35.190> don't<00:03:35.579> mind

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
it's not a huge problem I don't mind

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.699 
it's not a huge problem I don't mind
that<00:03:36.090> much<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.810> then<00:03:36.900> of<00:03:37.019> course<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.350> base<00:03:37.500> is

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
that much and then of course the base is

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.830 
that much and then of course the base is
a<00:03:37.739> separate<00:03:38.190> piece<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.090> do<00:03:39.150> believe<00:03:39.450> this

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
a separate piece and I do believe this

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.600 
a separate piece and I do believe this
base<00:03:40.079> is<00:03:40.320> not<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.739> same<00:03:40.950> as<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.310> one<00:03:41.459> that

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
base is not the same as the one that

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.970 
base is not the same as the one that
this<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:41.820> a<00:03:42.030> recast<00:03:42.630> of<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.530> that's<00:03:43.739> also

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
this is a recast of so that's also

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.560 
this is a recast of so that's also
something<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.579> note<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:45.000> does<00:03:45.150> have<00:03:45.329> a<00:03:45.360> little

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
something to note it does have a little

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.430 
something to note it does have a little
gathering<00:03:46.880> sticker<00:03:47.880> placard<00:03:48.660> thing<00:03:48.989> on<00:03:49.170> their
