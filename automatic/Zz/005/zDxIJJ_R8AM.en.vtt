00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
video on Captain America I was thinking

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.819 
video on Captain America I was thinking
yellow<00:01:39.479> jacket<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.290> already<00:01:40.409> did<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.680> video

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
yellow jacket but we already did a video

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.160 
yellow jacket but we already did a video
on<00:01:41.040> yellow<00:01:41.340> jacket<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:41.970> guess<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:42.899> should<00:01:43.049> do

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.990 
on yellow jacket so I guess we should do
a<00:01:43.200> video<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.560> Captain<00:01:44.310> America<00:01:44.670> since<00:01:44.850> he's
