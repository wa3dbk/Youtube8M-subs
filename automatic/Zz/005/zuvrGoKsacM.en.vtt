00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 good morning everyone today I am going to teach you 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.350
 to prepare a quick custard and very 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.929
 easy to do what they need 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.969
 4 egg yolks are worth the clear egg 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.469
 we've separated it here with this 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.660
 I'm going to make meringues then I have it 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.359
 in a video uploaded in case you dare to 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.720
 make them so that he took advantage of it half 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.849
 liter of vanilla essence milk 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.220
 the peel of a lemon as you can see 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.829
 has almost nothing of the white because if 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.320
 do not sour custard 250 grams of 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:35.560
 sugar a teaspoon of cornstarch 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.300
 and if you want to extract cinnamon stick 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.160
 I also like cinnamon so I do not 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.170
 he had done what we do first 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:47.239
 what we do that puts in a pot to fire 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.239
 the stone put in this that the best 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.329
 we put it to the fire do not put 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.860
 very strong fire is worth it because we do not 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.750
 Interested that if he wants to go to milk what 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.030
 What interests us is that it is tempered to 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.450
 that is caught with the aromas then 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.840
 we throw the milk we throw the shells 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.880
 and how I 'm going to use cinnamon because I do not 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.020
 I like it so I'm not going to throw cinnamon 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.900
 so 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.330
 we take the essence of vanilla 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.960
 and we let it go trembling 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.210
 catsup and no more and now the yolks the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.690
 punctured 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.810
 the model not beaten well but more moved 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.920
 and we are adding sugar 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.920
 little by little 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.610
 and we add the sugar 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.820
 this also that's me I say 150 grams 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.170
 but it does not need to be 250 grams 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.540
 because that's already how you like it 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:58.090
 sweet then it already separated it and we throw the 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.280
 cornstarch the cornstarch is a 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.110
 Normal teaspoon cornstarch is used 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.930
 then while thickener 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.630
 we are moving, we are adding it to 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.310
 that we do not get lumps 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.340
 because you have to leave it the softest 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.340
 possible 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.219
 there are people who throws sugar to vanilla 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.200
 I have made it to vanilla sugar 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:22.450
 because to use vanilla essence that is 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.409
 the same there are people who throw the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.760
 nuggets vanilla pod 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.370
 vanilla because I do not because I use the 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.370
 vanilla essence as I said 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.240
 then it is faster still see it 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.910
 This we going moving 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.710
 and with a teaspoon of wood 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.000
 this as I imagine that there will be 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.010
 tempered to know it may the account a 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.380
 so now I'm going to leave you a 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.510
 jiffy while tuning a 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.140
 little bit better it's going to be nothing two 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.170
 seconds 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.760
 good as you will see we have already tempered the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.410
 milk then what we are going to do is 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.700
 to add is a little bit like 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.860
 It is not hot because it is only 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.050
 tempered as it is very difficult to be 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.470
 I set the egg then I do not know either 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.290
 to curdle the egg 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.960
 is that if you do not have to 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.870
 the grass because it is boiled in the case of 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.400
 that you had vanilla pod that 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.400
 then there so that they take flavor to 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.200
 vanilla if you have to boil it 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.270
 little bit but let's go as it is not 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.620
 served on the tempered what we do 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.799
 is to add what 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.190
 as you see so that everything more is mixed 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.190
 than nothing 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.920
 I'm sick now so now what 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.260
 let's put in the same case 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.680
 we're going to throw him out and we 're going to put him 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.680
 fire 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.930
 and so that all the sugar falls out and 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.930
 all the egg well 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.750
 and now with the spoon or with one of 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.780
 these rods the rods are put 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.770
 to fire until you are thinking that and 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.770
 it will be seen by you 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.810
 then this is already moving until 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.250
 go thinking now when you have 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.260
 I thought a little and I teach it again 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.760
 because they have no ministry alone 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.620
 you have to leave what you go 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.209
 expressing while it 's heating up and 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.280
 that yes always moving and towards the same 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.230
 side so that it does not stick in the pot 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.450
 ok and now when it is already a 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.880
 little the good thing to teach 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.560
 as you will see already weighed then what 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.200
 I will do as I do not like that 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.390
 are very thick because if they are too 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.240
 Thick then the fridge when it cools 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.400
 it is worse then I retire them because 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.550
 when it cools it is thick mass you see 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.480
 as you see it is like a pastry cream 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.480
 then our molds are going 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.139
 a custard 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.910
 custard 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.050
 three miles and with this addition but this 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.630
 is for you to see it with the 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.760
 molds then now 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.139
 who likes cinnamon and biscuit 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.539
 Now I'm going to teach you 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.069
 As you will see, they are already in their mold with their 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.449
 cookies and I'm going to throw a cinnamon 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:13.240
 only one because it's the one that I'm not going to 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:16.469
 I eat all the others are for me like that 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.469
 that we throw the cinnamon 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.210
 What do you like? Come on, why not? 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.460
 I kicked him and this gets into the fridge what 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.780
 it happens that I will not be there getting 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.240
 the fridge 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.310
 do not forget to share my videos if you 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.840
 like my recipes share it because 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.910

 subscribe to my channel remind you of the 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.100
 up hand it is good down the 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.900
 always the top floor 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.560
 As you can see, all my recipes are very 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.910
 easy and it actually keeps going up more 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.650
 what happens if I have to climb a 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.000
 every week for not uploading and all the 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.690
 days but since he does not have enough 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.720
 reproduction still does not let me youtube is 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:02.220
