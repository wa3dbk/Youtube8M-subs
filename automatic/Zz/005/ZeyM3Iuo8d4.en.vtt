00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.960
 very good in this video we present you 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.450
 Prime numbers 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.049
 the law in mathematics tells us that 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:18.730
 a prime number is a number greater than 1 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:21.820
 and that is a natural number let's start 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.449
 the number 3 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:29.529
 it is a prime number also the other law 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:31.470
 is that it can only be divisible between 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.100
 two 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.430
 between the numbers that is 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.650
 between kisses between himself and between one 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:46.050
 then the 3 meets why 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:51.580
 the 3 is only divisible by 3 and between 1 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:55.680
 also the 5 just like the 3-d is only 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:59.870
 divisible between 5 and between 1 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.870
 also the 7 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:09.240
 we can see that being in 909 does not 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.420
 because it's a number that can be 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.270
 divisible by 3 between 1 and between 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:21.439
 same then this does not meet 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.439
 the number 11 also the 13 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:32.650
 15 also fails because it is 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.550
 can divide by 5 between 3 between 1 and 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.930
 between the same then it does not meet 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.930
 The 17 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.939
 19 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.770
 the 21 also does not comply because 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:53.910
 it can be divisible / / divided by 7 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.900
 and between 3 yes that meets it 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.900
 on 23 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.260
 the 25 also meets it because it is 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:11.460
 divisible by 5 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:15.210
 the 27 29 and so on 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:18.510
 remember for a bone number to be 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.900
 cousin it is necessary that it be greater than 1 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.060
 that is a natural number and that it does not 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.630
 can be divided among other more than 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.050
 between it and between 1 that's that's 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:36.750
 what the law tells us and as you already know 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:39.540
 that even numbers like 2 4 6 8 and 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.610
 successively these are not cousins â€‹â€‹because 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.490
 they are even numbers and even numbers 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.250
 they are always divisible by 2 so 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.110
 this does not fulfill but that has served them 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.110
 and thanks
