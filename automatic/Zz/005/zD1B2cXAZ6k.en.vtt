the fastest way to cut long hair the
same<00:04:16.880> I<00:04:16.940> do<00:04:17.060> on<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.299> other<00:04:17.390> side<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:19.100> that<00:04:19.250> all

same I do on the other side and that all

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.450 
same I do on the other side and that all
the<00:04:19.640> try<00:04:19.940> and<00:04:20.180> solve<00:04:20.390> and<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:21.890> length<00:04:22.130> will

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
the try and solve and the length will

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.760 
the try and solve and the length will
look<00:04:22.700> wrong<00:04:22.940> but<00:04:23.890> of<00:04:24.890> course<00:04:26.410> the<00:04:27.410> layers

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
look wrong but of course the layers

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:38.560 
look wrong but of course the layers
connected<00:04:28.610> better<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:36.280> this<00:04:37.280> sister<00:04:38.270> seals

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
people think it grows faster that's not

growing<00:04:47.030> is<00:04:47.150> always<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.720> same<00:04:48.700> speed<00:04:49.700> but

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
growing is always the same speed but

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.210 
growing is always the same speed but
when<00:04:50.600> you<00:04:50.750> couldn't<00:04:51.200> tell<00:04:51.530> me<00:04:51.590> over<00:04:51.860> with<00:04:52.160> a

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
when you couldn't tell me over with a

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.450 
when you couldn't tell me over with a
hot<00:04:52.550> scissor<00:04:53.300> you<00:04:54.020> close<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:55.010> ends<00:04:55.280> and<00:04:55.370> the

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
hot scissor you close the ends and the

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.810 
hot scissor you close the ends and the
ends<00:04:55.640> don't<00:04:55.970> split<00:04:56.690> for<00:04:57.140> about<00:04:57.860> six<00:04:58.280> months<00:04:58.490> so

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
ends don't split for about six months so

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.990 
ends don't split for about six months so
your<00:04:59.660> hair<00:04:59.900> is<00:05:00.110> growing<00:05:00.380> more<00:05:00.770> than<00:05:00.830> when<00:05:01.610> that

your hair is growing more than when that

your hair is growing more than when that
normally<00:05:02.479> grows<00:05:02.690> because<00:05:03.490> normally<00:05:04.490> it<00:05:04.760> takes

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
enough now I just call the hair to the

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:41.559 
enough now I just call the hair to the
back<00:05:37.449> now<00:05:38.449> only<00:05:39.080> take<00:05:39.259> off<00:05:39.789> the<00:05:40.789> ends<00:05:41.150> on<00:05:41.449> the

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:41.569 
back now only take off the ends on the

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:47.730 
back now only take off the ends on the
back<00:05:41.720> to<00:05:42.020> get<00:05:42.199> a<00:05:42.620> nice<00:05:42.949> straight<00:05:43.340> line<00:05:43.639> and

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.100 

then<00:05:48.740> I'm<00:05:48.919> very<00:05:49.190> sure<00:05:49.940> that<00:05:50.569> there<00:05:50.780> is<00:05:50.900> no

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
then I'm very sure that there is no

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.089 
then I'm very sure that there is no
split<00:05:51.680> ends<00:05:51.919> anymore<00:05:54.940> now<00:05:55.940> come<00:05:56.270> to<00:05:56.479> try<00:05:56.750> it

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
split ends anymore now come to try it

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:59.890 
split ends anymore now come to try it
that<00:05:58.099> you<00:05:58.280> already<00:05:58.460> know<00:05:58.849> how<00:05:59.090> that<00:05:59.300> goes<00:05:59.539> and

straight it with an iron and show you
our<00:06:06.169> wonderful<00:06:06.500> errors<00:06:07.130> prison<00:06:08.030> before<00:06:08.210> a

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
our wonderful errors prison before a

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.140 
our wonderful errors prison before a
little<00:06:09.050> bit<00:06:09.139> but<00:06:09.800> what<00:06:10.520> we<00:06:10.639> did<00:06:10.789> this<00:06:10.940> we

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
little bit but what we did this we

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.050 
little bit but what we did this we
explain<00:06:11.449> it<00:06:11.569> with<00:06:11.780> Rafa<00:06:12.289> have<00:06:12.500> to<00:06:12.979> and<00:06:13.490> this

explain it with Rafa have to and this

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.559 
explain it with Rafa have to and this
tool<00:06:14.680> brings<00:06:15.680> proteins<00:06:16.219> into<00:06:16.550> the<00:06:16.669> hair<00:06:16.849> so

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:17.569 
tool brings proteins into the hair so

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:20.219 
tool brings proteins into the hair so
you<00:06:17.630> carefully<00:06:18.110> put<00:06:19.039> about<00:06:19.250> 15<00:06:19.789> centimeters

pump<00:06:22.099> up<00:06:22.250> the<00:06:22.759> proteins<00:06:23.380> put<00:06:24.380> them<00:06:24.469> into<00:06:24.620> the

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
pump up the proteins put them into the

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.740 
pump up the proteins put them into the
hair<00:06:25.009> you<00:06:25.430> see<00:06:25.610> a<00:06:25.639> wonderful<00:06:26.060> they're<00:06:26.389> close

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750

and this could block of string to that

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.420 
and this could block of string to that
because<00:06:29.779> the<00:06:30.080> proteins<00:06:30.500> are<00:06:30.740> coming<00:06:31.039> into<00:06:31.219> the
