what people do in the movies it's to
leave<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.099> note<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.640> her<00:02:09.000> locker<00:02:10.790> although

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
leave a note in her locker although

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.850 
leave a note in her locker although
that's<00:02:11.940> usually<00:02:12.750> not<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.930> really<00:02:13.290> good<00:02:13.470> idea

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
that's usually not a really good idea

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.160 
that's usually not a really good idea
and<00:02:13.920> always<00:02:14.400> ends<00:02:14.700> up<00:02:14.790> really<00:02:15.000> bad<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.750> movies

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
and always ends up really bad in movies

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.420 
and always ends up really bad in movies
but<00:02:17.690> try<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.720> out<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.230> might<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.250> possibly

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
but try it out it might just possibly

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.589 
but try it out it might just possibly
working<00:02:20.940> your<00:02:21.239> life

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
working your life

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.509 
working your life
I<00:02:23.000> guess<00:02:24.000> well<00:02:24.450> or<00:02:25.349> you<00:02:25.890> could<00:02:26.069> always<00:02:26.220> just

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
I guess well or you could always just

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.360 
I guess well or you could always just
leave<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.760> note<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.420> her<00:02:28.380> book<00:02:28.680> for<00:02:29.069> first

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
leave a note in her book for first

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
leave a note in her book for first
period<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.709> hopefully<00:02:31.709> no<00:02:32.040> one<00:02:32.280> else<00:02:32.610> decides

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
period and hopefully no one else decides

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.809 
period and hopefully no one else decides
to<00:02:33.599> borrow<00:02:33.810> her<00:02:34.019> book<00:02:34.459> if<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:35.640> get

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819

significant other it's a meal it's

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.390 
significant other it's a meal it's
really<00:02:38.549> simple<00:02:38.940> go<00:02:39.690> up<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.319> guy<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.100> say

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400
