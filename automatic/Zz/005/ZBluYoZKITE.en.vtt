00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.160 
shorts so I don't want my pockets being
weighted<00:01:00.270> down<00:01:00.390> too<00:01:00.660> much<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:00.989> that's

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
weighted down too much so that's

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.380

you're<00:02:26.610> probably<00:02:26.820> thinking<00:02:27.270> but<00:02:28.020> this<00:02:28.200> is

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
you're probably thinking but this is

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.830 
you're probably thinking but this is
titanium<00:02:28.850> as<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:30.000> can<00:02:30.090> see<00:02:30.240> it's<00:02:30.390> polished<00:02:30.720> on

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
titanium as you can see it's polished on

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.650 
titanium as you can see it's polished on
one<00:02:30.960> side<00:02:31.170> blue<00:02:31.410> anodized<00:02:31.800> on<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> other

one side blue anodized on the other
basically<00:02:33.660> all<00:02:33.690> these<00:02:34.110> little<00:02:34.350> grooves<00:02:34.710> in

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
basically all these little grooves in

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.720 
basically all these little grooves in
here<00:02:35.160> our<00:02:35.970> sizes<00:02:36.570> of<00:02:36.720> metric<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.680> normal<00:02:38.400> US

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
here our sizes of metric and normal US

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.510 
here our sizes of metric and normal US
standard<00:02:39.530> bolts<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.740> nuts<00:02:40.770> so<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.280> can

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
standard bolts and nuts so you can

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.010 
standard bolts and nuts so you can
tighten<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.150> loosen<00:02:42.300> it's<00:02:42.600> basically<00:02:42.930> a

tighten and loosen it's basically a

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.290 
tighten and loosen it's basically a
little<00:02:43.290> wrench<00:02:43.560> then<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.400> have<00:02:44.610> centimeter

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
little wrench then you have centimeter

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.050 
little wrench then you have centimeter
marks<00:02:45.750> millimeter<00:02:46.440> marks<00:02:46.830> on<00:02:47.010> each<00:02:47.700> side

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
marks millimeter marks on each side

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.640 
marks millimeter marks on each side
there's<00:02:48.450> like<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.690> little<00:02:48.840> grid<00:02:49.140> pattern<00:02:49.500> as

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
there's like a little grid pattern as

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.290 
there's like a little grid pattern as
you<00:02:49.740> can<00:02:49.860> see<00:02:49.980> there<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.730> got<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:50.910> really<00:02:51.120> nice

you can see there you got a really nice

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.290 
you can see there you got a really nice
pry<00:02:51.750> bar<00:02:52.020> on<00:02:52.260> this<00:02:53.040> end<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.460> it's<00:02:53.670> nice<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.880> cut

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
pry bar on this end so it's nice to cut

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.720 
pry bar on this end so it's nice to cut
open<00:02:54.330> boxes<00:02:54.990> you<00:02:55.140> know<00:02:55.260> pry<00:02:55.590> anything<00:02:56.040> Prine
