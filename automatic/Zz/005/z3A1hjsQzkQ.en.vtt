00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.940 
but I also saw and it was aware of the
weakness<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.360> sculpting<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.410> so<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.680> thought

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
weakness and sculpting and so I thought

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.380 
weakness and sculpting and so I thought
when<00:02:25.099> I<00:02:25.130> came<00:02:25.220> home<00:02:25.610> I'd<00:02:25.819> like<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.150> take<00:02:26.329> a

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
when I came home I'd like to take a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.140 
when I came home I'd like to take a
really<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.840> stab<00:02:27.200> at<00:02:27.470> doing<00:02:27.769> a<00:02:28.010> major<00:02:28.579> sculpture

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
really a stab at doing a major sculpture

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.059 
really a stab at doing a major sculpture
of<00:02:29.360> an<00:02:29.480> eagle<00:02:30.519> when<00:02:31.519> I<00:02:31.579> did<00:02:32.360> my<00:02:32.540> first<00:02:32.750> one<00:02:32.900> I

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
of an eagle when I did my first one I

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.170 
of an eagle when I did my first one I
realized<00:02:34.069> that<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.370> had<00:02:34.519> to<00:02:34.640> put<00:02:34.849> a<00:02:34.879> lot<00:02:35.060> of

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
realized that you had to put a lot of

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.360 
realized that you had to put a lot of
time<00:02:35.390> into<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.780> so<00:02:35.959> I<00:02:35.989> actually<00:02:36.170> spent<00:02:36.590> eight

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
time into it so I actually spent eight

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.119 
time into it so I actually spent eight
