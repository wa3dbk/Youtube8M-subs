today we will prepare the salad versione of french toast,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.600
The original version is sweet and it’s idea for breakfast

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.600
but we maybe talk about in one of next video

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.200
well…

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.200
for this recipe we need

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.200
sliced bread, egg, oil, breadkrumbs, butter

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.200
milk, emmenthal, salt, paprika

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.400
Today we will show you the simple version,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.200
ideal for snack, aperitif, appetizer, 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.700
and the stuffed version that’s good for appetizer

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.700
but also like principal dish.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.000
how filling  we use the emmenthal light

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.000
for avoid that AmicoOrso going to fatty

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.000
gready bear…

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
but you could use, brie, mozzarella cheese

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.200
or any type of cheese you want

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.000
but there is not to flabby

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
no stracchino cheese, 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.600
let’s start doing the batter

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.600
with oil, flour and milk

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600
You help me, yes?

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.600
See, I Beat it well because there is no lumps

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.900
pass me paprika, please

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.900
paprika, thanks.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.900
Add a little paprika

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.900
and a pinch of salt

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.000
the batter is ready, let’s go breading

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.300
you can use a normal slice of bread

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.700
I no, because i have a bear in my house

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.800
so, I must beary my sliced of bread,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.300
o my…

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.800
Let’s go breading

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.800
quickly

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.800
it must press but not so much, because it could break

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.800
make it two times

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
et voilà

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.800
ok, the simple version is ready

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.800
now, we going to see the stuffed version

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.000
for me is all more complicated naturally

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.800
because all my ingredients must be beary

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.800
for you not

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.800
slice of bread, and cheese inside, cover,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.800
press a little

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.800
if you want to makes all tasty

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.200
put parmesan into the breadkrumbs

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.200
and let’s bread

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.200
press well but be careful to no break the slice

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.200
two times

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.200
make attention that all the spaces allround are well sealed 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200
et voilà

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.200
ok it’s ready, let’s go fry

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.200
we heat oil and butter in a little pan

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.200
and fry well on two sides

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.500
and now we will fry the double one

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.500
cook it well also at the sides

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.500
when it ready, the french toast is ready

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.000
put it in the paper napkin

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
for absorbing extra oil

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
