00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.520
 good afternoon dear friends your girlfriend 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.500
 varieties 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.090
 and yet I will show more than three percent 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.199
 farm partner 

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:09.489
 hire 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:11.099
 how actually thousands 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.729
 these are the portfolios 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:16.079
 these are abrasions of the left panel now i'm here 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.320
 missing resident piracy 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.159
 because with the open immediately to this 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:23.489
 and immediately adapted only afterwards 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.060
 see how to do this 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.570
 I put two trunks in such a way that 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.349
 a gap formed here 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.770
 very comfortable large spaces 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.620
 for western or almost 4 meters and to 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.080
 put in principle 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.230
 here 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.230
 so if you suddenly panel board Ukraine 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.080
 again being afraid 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.150
 in this case, a short one before 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.490
 country 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.490
 it succeeded 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.930
 shell 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.450
 are popular 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.450
 and they enjoy cars 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.530
 enjoy the benefits because all the time 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.620
 will be taking away the jetta will repeat the democrats 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.750
 so do not need 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.120
 take a look 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.910
 made 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.600
 after this year 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.040
 here look after this i want to draw 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.860
 Attention 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.840
 on the threshold 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.050
 what a shame you do 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.060
 it should be small small 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.790
 of teeth 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.110
 but it is extremely important 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.600
 after that I will read before the fact 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.700
 way 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.860
 so here 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.180
 the edge of the city hall did not match just 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.140
 analyzing steel 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.920
 Yes, and here is one little secret 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.340
 secret did not seem my father 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.790
 when it starts and nag start from 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.390
 this part with a little 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.970
 because you won't have a strong 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.750
 pressure in AvtoVAZ will be adjustment 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.970
 see how it turns out 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.730
 however turkak 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.480
 Yes, the players in the movements here and so here the question 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.900
 accenture begins 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.560
 until it looks better than any pressure 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.030
 you will not be as a result of the transfer 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.940
 in year 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.900
 and another ten years it will be unclear how 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.900
 way in exchange for tough 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.919
 after just a year 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.579
 still would 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.579
 to the new government 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.979
 and when you do will contribute 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.189
 gaaretz newspaper 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.949
 as he noted he 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.949
 titus 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:36.519
 all this comes from the place of residence 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.669
 on Friday to do exactly describes 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:40.219
 because that information is about 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:41.019
 place 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.150
 I'm good if 326 is difficult because 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.429
 priests 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:48.429
 156 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.419
 if questions 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.220
 it was very easy to hit 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.220
 good stretches 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:03.429
 pipes 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.839
 Baku 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.839
 book and also included in the package 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:14.279
 House master 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.599
 hope it was then what a beauty
