would be the end of this guy's I was

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.069 
would be the end of this guy's I was
I've<00:00:44.370> been<00:00:44.399> trying<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.879> think<00:00:45.000> if<00:00:45.690> there<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:45.960> a

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
I've been trying to think if there is a

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.069 
I've been trying to think if there is a
as<00:00:46.980> big<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> star<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.940> television<00:00:48.239> today<00:00:48.840> as

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
as big a star on television today as

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.229 
as big a star on television today as
Johnny<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.219> don't<00:00:50.399> think<00:00:50.670> so

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
Johnny and I don't think so

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.689 
Johnny and I don't think so
I<00:00:51.270> tell<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.170> who<00:00:52.649> comes<00:00:52.920> close<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.489> mine<00:00:53.670> and

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
I tell you who comes close to mine and

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.189 
I tell you who comes close to mine and
people<00:00:53.969> will<00:00:54.239> probably<00:00:54.570> laugh<00:00:54.719> about<00:00:55.020> this

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
people will probably laugh about this

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.139 
people will probably laugh about this
but<00:00:55.410> somebody<00:00:55.590> who<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.100> nearly<00:00:56.550> as<00:00:56.760> good<00:00:56.969> as

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
but somebody who is nearly as good as

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.360 
but somebody who is nearly as good as
johnny<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.809> Regis<00:00:58.230> Philbin<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.129> think

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
johnny is Regis Philbin and I think

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.520 
johnny is Regis Philbin and I think
Regis<00:00:59.760> does<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> tremendous<00:01:00.300> job<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
Regis does a tremendous job but the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.020 
Regis does a tremendous job but the
difference<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.399> pointed<00:01:02.730> out<00:01:02.850> is

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
difference that you just pointed out is

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:12.120 
difference that you just pointed out is
you<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.660> push<00:01:03.840> Regis<00:01:04.229> around<00:01:10.460> Johnny<00:01:11.460> or

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
you can push Regis around Johnny or

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
you can push Regis around Johnny or

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
that's right and it's fun to push Regis

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.740
