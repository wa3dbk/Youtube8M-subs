00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.270
 Speak a little and play beauty today. 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.390
 came to mogi guaÃ§u in sao paulo 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.090
 test track of mitsubishi face is a 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.560
 circuit and I came here by launching 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.900
 Gran Turismo 6 which is a unique 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.730
 playstation 3 but we left the game 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.550
 a little aside what you go 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.160
 follow me now I'm taking a walk 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.160
 gallorghini's gallardo binds 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.129
 so this is a gallorghini 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.670
 560 horsepower lp560 model with engine 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.110
 v10 rear to give a in balance 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.270
 higher in the car to better enter the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.400
 curves for him to take care of on the floor 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.110
 it is a car that hits several in 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.030
 less than four seconds more 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.920
 precisely in three points seven 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.180
 you know how to change the gear in the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.950
 Okay, I'm afraid and a car. 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.780
 which reaches a maximum speed up to 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.080
 330 kilometers per hour 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.270
 the recital has already finished the production of it 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.450
 latest model was produced this year 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.229
 by lamborghini and we are going to give 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.820
 back now on the veils on a racetrack 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.820
 speed up with emotion this emotion 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.820
 birth 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.380
 the start of the curve the moment people 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.100
 reaches about 160 kilometers per 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.250
 hour 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.840
 the first curve made in second gear 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.090
 today we are doing a circuit 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.340
 within the proposed safety margin 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:12.550
 by the sony second curve of the racetrack 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:16.630
 easy to do also always stepping on the 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.519
 accelerator is to make the curve and third 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.060
 right bend the first elbow that 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:25.380
 harder class to do the racetrack 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.380
 is to get see on another left 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.079
 it was a mess 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.380
 it's very cool 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.060
 the individual highlight where it's to start 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.060
 to brake 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.570
 in this line where we have access that 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.570
 reaches 200 kilometers per hour 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.690
 this curve in s 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.860
 soon after this curve we reach the 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.860
 end of the circuit 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.069
 Not only did you just run into the 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.220
 mitsubishi speedway 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:50.400
 with a lamborghini gallardo lp560 on 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.400
 who thinks of a singer's performance 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.590
 I hope it was an experience 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.770
 Nice to you, how was it for me? 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.330
 the first time was much is much better 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.330
 It's very cool. 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.730
 it is striking that it has some 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.040
 points not seen right not 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.140
 You have to know the clue to know. 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.260
 where you can weigh where you made a turn 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.360
 recognition actually had it 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.040
 occurred would be much faster and much more 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.549
 The faster we made a 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.100
 security 100% security 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.550
 this was the orientation we have been given 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.550
 on here 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.539
 I am thank you for 1 to 0 on the hour 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:37.610
 said 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:39.349
 already good success after this turn 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.419
 Face sat the boot 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:44.779
 I got a little naughty I confess but 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.849
 was a horny 250 madness on the line 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:49.490
 I think one of the most 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.020
 I've had with the car 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.939
 I'll wait for the launch of the 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.610
 granturismo 16 and to have fun at 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.139
