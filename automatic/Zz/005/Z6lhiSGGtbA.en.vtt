00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
opponents coming into it it's just a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.530

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
together and I don't think it's as

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.960 
together and I don't think it's as
brutal<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.439> was<00:01:19.650> last<00:01:20.009> year<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:20.400> last

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
brutal as it was last year because last

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.210 
brutal as it was last year because last

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.760 
didn't really like the schedule at all
in<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.720> fact<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.079> they<00:01:34.290> came<00:01:34.500> out<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
in the fact that they came out and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.370 
in the fact that they came out and

schedule seems a little more generous in
the<00:01:42.600> beginning<00:01:42.829> but<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:44.040> tough<00:01:44.340> at<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.610> end

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
good so you just never know so

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.649 
good so you just never know so
predicting<00:02:23.159> a<00:02:23.280> schedule<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.879> kind<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.330> stupid

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
predicting a schedule is kind of stupid

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.369 
predicting a schedule is kind of stupid
but<00:02:25.110> I'm<00:02:25.230> going<00:02:25.379> to<00:02:25.440> do<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.769> anyway<00:02:25.970> so<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.750> think

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
but I'm going to do it anyway so I think

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.470 
but I'm going to do it anyway so I think
they<00:02:28.560> should<00:02:28.769> have<00:02:28.950> no<00:02:29.129> problem<00:02:29.580> home<00:02:29.940> opener

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
they should have no problem home opener

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.839 
they should have no problem home opener
against<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.930> Jaguars<00:02:31.379> that's<00:02:32.099> a<00:02:32.310> game<00:02:32.519> that<00:02:32.730> I

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
against the Jaguars that's a game that I

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.839 
against the Jaguars that's a game that I
meant<00:02:33.120> more<00:02:33.329> than<00:02:33.390> likely<00:02:33.780> will<00:02:34.110> be<00:02:34.260> going<00:02:34.590> to

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
meant more than likely will be going to

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.460 
meant more than likely will be going to
me<00:02:35.849> and<00:02:36.000> my<00:02:36.090> wife<00:02:36.269> usually<00:02:36.599> go<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.230> home

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
me and my wife usually go to the home

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.610 
me and my wife usually go to the home
openers<00:02:38.060> every<00:02:39.060> season<00:02:39.299> trying<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.230> make<00:02:40.379> it<00:02:40.530> a

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
openers every season trying to make it a

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.229 
openers every season trying to make it a
point<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.920> go<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.159> two<00:02:41.430> different<00:02:41.579> games<00:02:41.940> this

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
point to go to two different games this

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.350 
point to go to two different games this
year<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.860> one<00:02:44.159> it<00:02:44.489> more<00:02:45.000> than<00:02:45.150> likely

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
year so that one it more than likely

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.479

night<00:02:47.730> football<00:02:47.760> on<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.690> road<00:02:49.010> against<00:02:50.010> the

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.470 
night football on the road against the
colts<00:02:50.489> i<00:02:50.579> think<00:02:50.790> that's<00:02:51.000> going<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.209> be<00:02:51.359> a<00:02:51.390> very

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
colts i think that's going to be a very

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.520 
colts i think that's going to be a very
tough<00:02:52.079> game<00:02:52.410> for<00:02:52.440> them<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:53.040> win<00:02:53.780> but<00:02:54.780> i<00:02:54.989> think

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
tough game for them to win but i think

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.509 
tough game for them to win but i think
they're<00:02:55.709> definitely<00:02:55.890> up<00:02:56.250> for<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.459> challenge

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
they're definitely up for the challenge

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.030 
they're definitely up for the challenge
it's<00:02:57.180> just<00:02:57.510> Indianapolis<00:02:58.349> is<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.530> tough<00:02:58.799> place

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
it's just Indianapolis is a tough place

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.339 
it's just Indianapolis is a tough place
to<00:02:59.069> play<00:02:59.370> they're<00:03:00.090> obviously<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.930> Colts<00:03:01.230> are

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
to play they're obviously the Colts are

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.410 
to play they're obviously the Colts are
a<00:03:01.379> good<00:03:01.650> team<00:03:01.890> with<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:02.940> Andrew<00:03:03.180> Luck<00:03:03.390> and

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420

49ers<00:03:41.599> that's<00:03:42.599> a<00:03:42.780> game<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.199> would<00:03:43.260> chalk<00:03:43.650> up<00:03:43.859> as

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
49ers that's a game I would chalk up as

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.789 
49ers that's a game I would chalk up as
a<00:03:44.069> loss<00:03:44.340> right<00:03:44.669> now<00:03:44.730> but<00:03:45.359> at<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.319> same<00:03:46.530> time<00:03:46.739> I

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
a loss right now but at the same time I

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.949 
a loss right now but at the same time I
don't<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.340> think<00:03:47.669> the<00:03:47.790> 49ers<00:03:48.150> may<00:03:48.629> have<00:03:48.750> missed

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
don't I think the 49ers may have missed

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.240 
don't I think the 49ers may have missed
their<00:03:49.169> window<00:03:50.389> after<00:03:51.389> a<00:03:51.780> while<00:03:52.019> I<00:03:52.049> think<00:03:52.560> teams

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
their window after a while I think teams

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.250 
their window after a while I think teams
are<00:03:53.639> going<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.819> start<00:03:54.090> figuring<00:03:54.389> Kaepernick

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
are going to start figuring Kaepernick

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.970 
are going to start figuring Kaepernick
out<00:03:55.970> Frank<00:03:56.970> Gore's<00:03:57.239> older<00:03:57.810> Patrick<00:03:58.500> Willis<00:03:58.709> is

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
out Frank Gore's older Patrick Willis is

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.159 
out Frank Gore's older Patrick Willis is
getting<00:03:59.280> older<00:03:59.639> they<00:04:00.540> still<00:04:00.870> haven't

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
getting older they still haven't

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.500 
getting older they still haven't
improved<00:04:01.500> their<00:04:01.769> secondary<00:04:02.389> you<00:04:03.389> know

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
improved their secondary you know

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.330 
improved their secondary you know
NaVorro<00:04:03.930> Bowman<00:04:04.019> is<00:04:04.470> coming<00:04:04.769> off<00:04:04.919> a<00:04:05.069> huge

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
NaVorro Bowman is coming off a huge

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.559 
NaVorro Bowman is coming off a huge
injury<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:06.239> just<00:04:06.569> don't<00:04:06.900> think<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.349> the<00:04:07.620> 49ers

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
injury I just don't think that the 49ers

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.449 
injury I just don't think that the 49ers
are<00:04:09.569> going<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.840> be<00:04:09.989> as<00:04:10.139> dominant<00:04:10.440> as<00:04:10.889> they<00:04:11.250> have

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
are going to be as dominant as they have

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.150 
are going to be as dominant as they have
been<00:04:11.489> in<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.180> past<00:04:12.389> so<00:04:12.810> I'm<00:04:13.410> going<00:04:13.889> to<00:04:13.919> say

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
been in the past so I'm going to say

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.920 
been in the past so I'm going to say
it's<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.459> loss<00:04:14.669> but<00:04:14.910> I<00:04:15.000> think<00:04:15.239> that's<00:04:15.389> a<00:04:15.510> team<00:04:15.720> a

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
it's a loss but I think that's a team a

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.589 
it's a loss but I think that's a team a
team<00:04:16.229> they<00:04:16.709> can<00:04:16.829> certainly<00:04:17.039> beat<00:04:17.519> but<00:04:18.510> they

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
team they can certainly beat but they

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.900 
team they can certainly beat but they
don't<00:04:18.780> play<00:04:18.959> well<00:04:19.199> on<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.680> west<00:04:19.859> coast<00:04:19.979> all

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
don't play well on the west coast all

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.610 
don't play well on the west coast all
the<00:04:21.239> time<00:04:21.449> so<00:04:21.719> we'll<00:04:21.870> see<00:04:22.109> if<00:04:22.140> so<00:04:22.289> i'll<00:04:22.409> say

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
the time so we'll see if so i'll say

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.810 
the time so we'll see if so i'll say
they're<00:04:22.800> going<00:04:22.890> to<00:04:22.979> start<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.340> season<00:04:23.490> off<00:04:23.760> to

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
they're going to start the season off to

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.540 
they're going to start the season off to
and<00:04:24.180> to<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.930> next<00:04:25.260> two<00:04:25.409> games<00:04:25.650> I<00:04:26.039> think<00:04:26.400> they

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
and to the next two games I think they

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.410 
and to the next two games I think they
should<00:04:26.760> win<00:04:26.940> their<00:04:27.180> bowl

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
should win their bowl

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.710 
should win their bowl
at<00:04:27.630> home<00:04:28.070> number<00:04:29.070> one<00:04:29.250> for<00:04:29.970> week<00:04:30.150> five<00:04:30.390> would

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
at home number one for week five would

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.420 
at home number one for week five would
be<00:04:30.750> against<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.380> rams<00:04:31.620> they<00:04:31.950> should<00:04:32.190> beat<00:04:32.400> the

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
be against the rams they should beat the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.470 
be against the rams they should beat the
rams<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.210> then<00:04:33.810> week<00:04:34.110> six<00:04:34.530> at<00:04:35.090> home<00:04:36.090> again

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
rams and then week six at home again

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.000 
rams and then week six at home again
against<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.050> New<00:04:37.170> York<00:04:37.410> Giants<00:04:37.830> on<00:04:37.980> Sunday

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.310 
invictus folds out for the rest of the

seven weeks eight and nine on the road

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.200 
seven weeks eight and nine on the road
at<00:05:06.990> Cardinals<00:05:07.680> at<00:05:07.830> texans<00:05:08.490> if<00:05:08.670> they<00:05:08.880> can<00:05:09.060> come

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
at Cardinals at texans if they can come

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.350 
at Cardinals at texans if they can come
off<00:05:09.390> the<00:05:09.540> x<00:05:09.720> and<00:05:09.960> get<00:05:10.170> both<00:05:10.500> of<00:05:10.740> those<00:05:10.890> games<00:05:11.360> on

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
off the x and get both of those games on

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.420 
off the x and get both of those games on
the<00:05:12.690> road<00:05:12.870> as<00:05:13.140> winds<00:05:13.440> that<00:05:13.710> would<00:05:13.920> be<00:05:14.070> pretty

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
the road as winds that would be pretty

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.360 
the road as winds that would be pretty
good<00:05:14.730> I<00:05:15.000> would<00:05:15.750> probably<00:05:16.020> expect<00:05:16.800> them<00:05:17.100> to

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
good I would probably expect them to

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.340 
good I would probably expect them to
lose<00:05:17.820> against<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.360> Cardinals<00:05:18.840> and<00:05:19.020> beat<00:05:19.200> the

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
lose against the Cardinals and beat the

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.650 
lose against the Cardinals and beat the
Texans<00:05:19.860> so<00:05:20.580> that<00:05:20.760> would<00:05:20.940> put<00:05:21.090> them<00:05:21.270> at<00:05:21.420> five

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
Texans so that would put them at five

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.850 
Texans so that would put them at five
and<00:05:21.870> three<00:05:22.200> then<00:05:22.830> November<00:05:23.520> 10<00:05:24.350> they<00:05:25.350> have<00:05:25.590> a

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
and three then November 10 they have a

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.030 
and three then November 10 they have a
Monday<00:05:26.460> night<00:05:26.490> game<00:05:27.080> at<00:05:28.080> home<00:05:28.470> against<00:05:28.950> the

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
Monday night game at home against the

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.190

there the Seahawks got to travel across
the<00:06:31.680> country<00:06:31.860> for<00:06:32.370> that<00:06:32.550> game<00:06:33.350> luckily<00:06:34.350> it

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
the country for that game luckily it

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.050 
the country for that game luckily it
doesn't<00:06:34.740> look<00:06:35.130> like<00:06:35.190> for<00:06:35.640> them<00:06:35.820> that<00:06:36.030> they

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
doesn't look like for them that they

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.730 
doesn't look like for them that they
made<00:06:36.330> it<00:06:36.450> a<00:06:36.510> one<00:06:36.690> o'clock<00:06:36.810> game<00:06:37.350> so<00:06:37.590> the

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
made it a one o'clock game so the

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.130 
made it a one o'clock game so the
Seahawks<00:06:38.130> kind<00:06:38.430> of<00:06:38.550> luck<00:06:38.730> out<00:06:38.910> there<00:06:39.110> but<00:06:40.110> I

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.140 
Seahawks kind of luck out there but I

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.390 
Seahawks kind of luck out there but I
really<00:06:40.230> do<00:06:40.710> think<00:06:40.950> that<00:06:41.070> we

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
really do think that we

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.460 
really do think that we
can<00:06:41.610> beat<00:06:41.850> them<00:06:42.120> if<00:06:42.389> they<00:06:42.720> will<00:06:42.930> I<00:06:42.960> don't<00:06:43.290> know

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470 
can beat them if they will I don't know

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.730 
can beat them if they will I don't know
and<00:06:43.740> then<00:06:44.310> to<00:06:44.460> round<00:06:44.699> out<00:06:44.940> the<00:06:45.150> season<00:06:45.740> three

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
and then to round out the season three

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.590 
and then to round out the season three
divisional<00:06:47.310> games<00:06:47.580> at<00:06:47.940> home<00:06:48.180> against<00:06:48.509> the

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 
divisional games at home against the

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.450 
divisional games at home against the
cowboys<00:06:49.110> and<00:06:49.410> then<00:06:49.500> on<00:06:49.710> the<00:06:49.889> roads<00:06:50.130> to<00:06:50.310> the

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
cowboys and then on the roads to the

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.909 
cowboys and then on the roads to the
Redskins<00:06:51.120> and<00:06:51.360> the<00:06:51.539> Giants<00:06:51.570> that's<00:06:52.380> going<00:06:52.800> to

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 
Redskins and the Giants that's going to

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:55.550 
Redskins and the Giants that's going to
be<00:06:53.039> a<00:06:53.070> really<00:06:53.490> really<00:06:53.669> tough<00:06:54.000> finish<00:06:54.300> on<00:06:54.690> but

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 
be a really really tough finish on but

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.020 
be a really really tough finish on but
all<00:06:55.710> in<00:06:55.860> all<00:06:55.949> I<00:06:56.009> think<00:06:56.190> this<00:06:56.550> team<00:06:56.729> could<00:06:56.970> win

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
all in all I think this team could win

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.740 
all in all I think this team could win
ten<00:06:57.449> games<00:06:57.660> again<00:06:58.280> possibly<00:06:59.280> more<00:06:59.910> I'm<00:07:00.479> just

ten games again possibly more I'm just
really<00:07:01.080> excited<00:07:01.580> I'm<00:07:02.580> not<00:07:02.759> excited<00:07:03.090> that<00:07:03.389> we

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 
really excited I'm not excited that we

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:05.180 
really excited I'm not excited that we
