mainstay of the range the 255 that

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.700 
mainstay of the range the 255 that
compares<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.070> 295<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> rock<00:01:21.630> light<00:01:21.869> so

compares to the 295 in the rock light so

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.859 
compares to the 295 in the rock light so
it<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.159> little<00:01:23.369> bit<00:01:23.549> lighter<00:01:23.820> by<00:01:24.689> not

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
it is a little bit lighter by not

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.969 
it is a little bit lighter by not
significantly<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> new<00:01:27.390> range<00:01:27.689> has<00:01:28.650> all

the other aspect of the soul is that
they're<00:02:35.769> actually<00:02:35.890> three<00:02:36.489> different<00:02:36.519> rubbers

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
they're actually three different rubbers

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.860 
they're actually three different rubbers
used<00:02:37.660> here<00:02:37.989> we've<00:02:38.709> got<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:39.420> groupie<00:02:40.420> rubber<00:02:40.660> a

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
used here we've got a groupie rubber a

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.870 
used here we've got a groupie rubber a
softer<00:02:41.410> rubber<00:02:41.590> which<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.130> used<00:02:42.340> in<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.670> toe

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
softer rubber which is used in the toe

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.780 
softer rubber which is used in the toe
area<00:02:42.910> which<00:02:43.450> is<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.750> take<00:02:43.989> off<00:02:44.230> point<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:45.459> red

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.680 
area which is you take off point the red
portion<00:02:46.180> is<00:02:46.890> an<00:02:47.890> endurance<00:02:48.400> rather<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.120> the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
portion is an endurance rather and the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.050 
portion is an endurance rather and the
gray<00:02:49.930> portion<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.709> a<00:02:50.739> harder<00:02:51.250> rubber<00:02:51.489> so<00:02:51.820> now

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
gray portion is a harder rubber so now

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.030 
gray portion is a harder rubber so now
that's<00:02:52.480> protection<00:02:53.320> where<00:02:53.470> you<00:02:53.590> hit<00:02:53.769> a<00:02:53.800> rock

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
that's protection where you hit a rock

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.880 
that's protection where you hit a rock

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
or something with your instep so it's

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.009

difference thing that the EV a layer is

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.370 
difference thing that the EV a layer is
actually<00:03:26.470> injected<00:03:27.220> with<00:03:27.700> this<00:03:28.000> new<00:03:28.329> range<00:03:29.170> of

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.900 
shoes as opposed to blonde with the rock
like<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.200> means<00:03:32.680> basically<00:03:33.070> that<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:33.730> get

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
like that means basically that you get

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.940 
like that means basically that you get
more<00:03:34.090> bang<00:03:34.390> for<00:03:34.660> your<00:03:34.720> buck<00:03:34.780> you<00:03:35.380> get<00:03:35.590> more

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
more bang for your buck you get more

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
cushioning for a thinner layer so we're

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.360 
cushioning for a thinner layer so we're
pretty<00:03:39.760> impressed<00:03:40.239> with<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.690> cushioning<00:03:41.370> the

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
durability of the shoes and that's going

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.220 
durability of the shoes and that's going
to<00:04:02.620> take<00:04:02.799> some<00:04:02.859> time<00:04:03.130> until<00:04:03.670> our<00:04:04.239> testers<00:04:05.079> have

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
and the to 350 there is also as we go

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.880 
and the to 350 there is also as we go
down<00:04:26.820> through<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.330> range<00:04:27.570> a<00:04:27.870> little<00:04:27.900> less<00:04:28.590> and

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
down through the range a little less and

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.140 
down through the range a little less and
the<00:04:28.950> cushioning<00:04:29.840> we<00:04:30.840> anticipate<00:04:31.650> that<00:04:32.150> the

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
the cushioning we anticipate that the

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.450 
the cushioning we anticipate that the
majority<00:04:33.330> of<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.170> trail<00:04:34.410> rocks<00:04:34.680> that<00:04:34.980> we<00:04:35.160> sell

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
majority of the trail rocks that we sell

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.210 
majority of the trail rocks that we sell
are<00:04:35.910> going<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.540> be<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:37.370> 255<00:04:38.370> model<00:04:38.880> because

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
are going to be the 255 model because

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.310 
are going to be the 255 model because
they<00:04:41.220> have<00:04:41.580> this<00:04:42.270> little<00:04:42.540> extra<00:04:43.110> bit<00:04:43.260> of

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
they have this little extra bit of

that when we fit people to the shoes and

that when we fit people to the shoes and
remember<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:35.880> they've<00:05:36.030> built<00:05:36.270> on<00:05:36.450> a

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
remember that they've built on a

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.750 
remember that they've built on a
different<00:05:36.900> blast<00:05:37.190> so<00:05:38.190> it's<00:05:38.430> slightly

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
different blast so it's slightly

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.850 
different blast so it's slightly
different<00:05:39.330> shape<00:05:39.570> of<00:05:39.780> foot<00:05:39.990> that<00:05:40.350> about<00:05:40.620> one

in<00:05:40.890> five<00:05:41.220> or<00:05:41.520> one<00:05:41.669> and<00:05:41.790> six<00:05:42.060> people<00:05:42.510> it<00:05:42.660> still

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
in five or one and six people it still

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.380 
in five or one and six people it still
feels<00:05:43.620> better<00:05:44.130> to<00:05:44.430> have<00:05:44.550> the<00:05:44.730> rock<00:05:44.940> light<00:05:45.180> on

feels better to have the rock light on

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.320 
feels better to have the rock light on
