wrong people are eating their children
in<00:01:30.329> Jerusalem<00:01:30.960> they<00:01:31.500> need<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.770> know<00:01:31.979> there's

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
in Jerusalem they need to know there's

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.069 
in Jerusalem they need to know there's
bounty<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.509> mile<00:01:33.720> away

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
bounty just a mile away

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.010 
bounty just a mile away
what<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.579> you'd<00:01:35.729> kind<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.299> put<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.570> each<00:01:36.810> of

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
what and so you'd kind of put on each of

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.569 
what and so you'd kind of put on each of
these<00:01:37.110> events<00:01:37.560> under<00:01:37.829> an<00:01:37.920> arc<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.369> just

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
these events under an arc and you just

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.700 
these events under an arc and you just
ask<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.970> why<00:01:39.150> question<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.840> how<00:01:40.290> they<00:01:40.530> all

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
ask the why question of how they all

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.550 
ask the why question of how they all
relate<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.369> make<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.030> big<00:01:42.240> narrative<00:01:42.570> point

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
relate to make the big narrative point

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.580 
relate to make the big narrative point
so<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.700> same<00:01:44.909> principle<00:01:45.180> but<00:01:45.720> you're

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
so it's the same principle but you're

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.469 
so it's the same principle but you're
dealing<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:47.040> larger<00:01:47.399> chunks<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.390> you're

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
dealing in larger chunks and you're

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.800 
dealing in larger chunks and you're
asking<00:01:49.130> narrative<00:01:50.360> relationship<00:01:51.360> questions

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
asking narrative relationship questions

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.789 
asking narrative relationship questions
rather<00:01:51.990> than<00:01:52.170> mere<00:01:52.649> logic<00:01:53.189> questions<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.090> a

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
rather than mere logic questions in a

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:03.210 
rather than mere logic questions in a
exposition<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.860> Paul

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.280
