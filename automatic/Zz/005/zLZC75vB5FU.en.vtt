00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
van I just got done with a sliding door

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.439 
van I just got done with a sliding door
started<00:00:27.320> putting<00:00:27.529> in<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:27.739> panel's<00:00:28.360> one<00:00:29.360> of

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
started putting in the panel's one of

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:30.939 
started putting in the panel's one of
the<00:00:29.539> issues<00:00:29.869> that<00:00:29.900> I<00:00:30.019> noticed<00:00:30.500> that<00:00:30.920> I

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
the issues that I noticed that I

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.100 
the issues that I noticed that I
actually<00:00:31.250> solved<00:00:31.880> a<00:00:32.029> couple<00:00:32.689> of<00:00:32.750> weeks<00:00:32.930> back

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
actually solved a couple of weeks back

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.049 
actually solved a couple of weeks back
was<00:00:33.350> that<00:00:33.379> I<00:00:33.500> kept<00:00:33.769> getting<00:00:33.890> check<00:00:34.879> engine

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
was that I kept getting check engine

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.819 
was that I kept getting check engine
codes<00:00:36.610> for<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:37.699> o2<00:00:37.970> sensor<00:00:38.720> for<00:00:39.260> air<00:00:39.530> fuel

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
codes for the o2 sensor for air fuel

codes for the o2 sensor for air fuel
mixture<00:00:41.379> intake<00:00:42.379> leak<00:00:42.739> and<00:00:43.100> I'm<00:00:43.370> like<00:00:43.579> you

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
mixture intake leak and I'm like you

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.840 
mixture intake leak and I'm like you
know<00:00:44.720> what's<00:00:45.320> going<00:00:45.559> on<00:00:45.650> because<00:00:45.829> I<00:00:46.190> have<00:00:46.760> a

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
know what's going on because I have a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.740 
know what's going on because I have a
rebuilt<00:00:47.390> motor<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.430> I<00:00:49.489> did<00:00:49.750> initially

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
rebuilt motor and and so I did initially

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
rebuilt motor and and so I did initially
believed<00:00:51.620> it<00:00:51.859> was<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.940> o2<00:00:53.300> sensor<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:54.109> I

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
believed it was the o2 sensor and I

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.490 
believed it was the o2 sensor and I
actually<00:00:55.219> thought<00:00:55.609> that<00:00:55.670> um<00:00:56.559> it<00:00:57.559> was<00:00:58.340> a<00:00:59.350> it<00:01:00.350> was

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
actually thought that um it was a it was

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.610 
actually thought that um it was a it was
the<00:01:00.530> upstream<00:01:01.370> I<00:01:01.640> knew<00:01:02.539> I<00:01:02.570> had<00:01:02.870> one<00:01:03.379> of<00:01:03.500> them

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
the upstream I knew I had one of them

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.900 
the upstream I knew I had one of them
replaced<00:01:03.980> and<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.369> cat<00:01:04.550> replace<00:01:04.910> as<00:01:05.119> well<00:01:06.910> when

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
replaced and a cat replace as well when

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.749 
replaced and a cat replace as well when
I<00:01:07.940> passed<00:01:08.270> emissions<00:01:08.810> but<00:01:09.679> I<00:01:09.710> totally<00:01:10.490> forgot

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
I passed emissions but I totally forgot

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.359 
I passed emissions but I totally forgot
which<00:01:10.970> one<00:01:11.179> until<00:01:11.810> I<00:01:11.840> just<00:01:12.080> did<00:01:12.800> a<00:01:12.830> quick<00:01:13.070> look

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
which one until I just did a quick look

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:21.240 
which one until I just did a quick look
and<00:01:13.670> I'll<00:01:13.789> show<00:01:13.850> you<00:01:14.000> really<00:01:19.450> there's<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.780> cat

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
and I'll show you really there's the cat

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.300 
and I'll show you really there's the cat
there's<00:01:22.250> a<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.910> upstream<00:01:23.569> Oh<00:01:23.810> two<00:01:23.990> sensor<00:01:24.410> you

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
there's a the upstream Oh two sensor you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.620 
there's a the upstream Oh two sensor you
can<00:01:25.490> tell<00:01:25.670> those<00:01:25.819> are<00:01:26.000> brand<00:01:26.240> new<00:01:28.929> so<00:01:30.280> Wow<00:01:31.630> when

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
can tell those are brand new so Wow when

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.380 
can tell those are brand new so Wow when
I<00:01:32.660> got<00:01:32.929> one<00:01:33.140> underneath<00:01:33.590> I<00:01:34.060> found<00:01:35.060> out<00:01:35.239> that

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
I got one underneath I found out that

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.199 
I got one underneath I found out that
one<00:01:35.569> of<00:01:35.599> these<00:01:35.810> hoses<00:01:36.310> was<00:01:37.310> this<00:01:37.489> easy<00:01:37.819> to<00:01:37.940> pull

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:38.209 
one of these hoses was this easy to pull

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:40.660 
one of these hoses was this easy to pull
off<00:01:38.239> so<00:01:38.750> that's<00:01:39.619> what<00:01:40.009> it<00:01:40.130> was

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
off so that's what it was

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.419 
off so that's what it was
I<00:01:40.700> bought<00:01:41.179> some<00:01:41.479> extra<00:01:41.750> hoses<00:01:42.319> and<00:01:42.530> I'm<00:01:43.280> going

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
I bought some extra hoses and I'm going

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.460 
I bought some extra hoses and I'm going
to<00:01:43.489> go<00:01:43.640> underneath<00:01:43.819> a<00:01:43.910> van<00:01:44.179> and<00:01:44.450> show<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:44.810> what

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
to go underneath a van and show you what

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.120 
to go underneath a van and show you what
the<00:01:45.590> deal<00:01:45.770> was

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.490 

so<00:01:49.130> this<00:01:49.520> is<00:01:49.640> what<00:01:49.910> actually<00:01:50.720> love<00:01:51.170> about<00:01:51.410> the

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
underneath where I took the hoses off

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.140 
underneath where I took the hoses off
and<00:02:09.259> you<00:02:09.349> can<00:02:09.500> see<00:02:09.830> right<00:02:10.190> here<00:02:11.170> um<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.910> top

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.880 
and you can see right here um the top
spot<00:02:14.950> was<00:02:15.950> where<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.970> hose<00:02:17.500> could<00:02:18.500> come<00:02:18.739> and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
spot was where the hose could come and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.030 
spot was where the hose could come and
loose<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.870> I<00:02:20.959> didn't<00:02:21.110> realize<00:02:21.379> until<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:21.709> came

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040
