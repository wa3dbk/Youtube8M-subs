particular<00:01:10.880> setup<00:01:11.360> is<00:01:11.840> organic<00:01:12.440> farming<00:01:12.880> but

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
particular setup is organic farming but

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.520 
particular setup is organic farming but
it's<00:01:14.090> it<00:01:14.390> is<00:01:14.540> actually<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.990> higher<00:01:15.229> tech

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
it's it is actually a higher tech

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.160 
it's it is actually a higher tech
organic<00:01:16.520> farming<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.090> we<00:01:17.300> try<00:01:17.810> to<00:01:17.869> get<00:01:18.020> the

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
organic farming so we try to get the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.080 
organic farming so we try to get the
most<00:01:18.440> production<00:01:19.040> out<00:01:19.280> of<00:01:19.310> at<00:01:19.580> least<00:01:19.759> amount

of<00:01:23.990> water<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:25.700> roots<00:01:26.000> just<00:01:26.660> freely<00:01:27.880> go

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
of water and the roots just freely go

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.430 
of water and the roots just freely go
down<00:01:29.119> right<00:01:29.420> into<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.840> water

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.530 

to<00:01:32.800> get<00:01:32.980> all<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.340> new<00:01:33.460> dirty<00:01:33.640> sounding<00:01:34.120> soil

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
to get all the new dirty sounding soil

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.600 
to get all the new dirty sounding soil
they<00:01:34.750> don't<00:01:34.930> need<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.110> be<00:01:35.140> inside<00:01:35.530> we<00:01:36.280> start

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
they don't need to be inside we start

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.250 
they don't need to be inside we start
them<00:01:36.760> in<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:37.060> little<00:01:37.270> bit<00:01:37.510> of<00:01:37.630> soil<00:01:37.870> this<00:01:38.110> is

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
them in a little bit of soil this is

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.740 
them in a little bit of soil this is
called<00:01:38.470> a<00:01:38.590> net-front<00:01:38.800> right<00:01:39.280> here<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.600> we

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
called a net-front right here so we

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.660 
called a net-front right here so we
start<00:01:41.110> it<00:01:41.230> in<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.350> soil<00:01:41.710> how<00:01:42.220> did<00:01:42.400> they<00:01:42.490> not

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
start it in the soil how did they not

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.590 
start it in the soil how did they not
get<00:01:42.880> flooded<00:01:43.750> or<00:01:44.110> drown<00:01:44.940> certain<00:01:45.940> plants<00:01:46.390> do

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
get flooded or drown certain plants do

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:57.510 
get flooded or drown certain plants do
well<00:01:46.810> just<00:01:47.110> have<00:01:47.410> an<00:01:47.530> olive<00:01:47.620> oil<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.470> so<00:01:57.220> what

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
well just have an olive oil and so what

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.720 
well just have an olive oil and so what
are<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.700> benefits<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:58.450> growing<00:01:59.290> produce<00:01:59.920> with

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
are the benefits of growing produce with

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.300 
are the benefits of growing produce with
the<00:02:00.760> fish<00:02:01.510> waste<00:02:01.780> as<00:02:02.200> fertilizer<00:02:02.710> as<00:02:02.980> opposed

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
the fish waste as fertilizer as opposed

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.100 
the fish waste as fertilizer as opposed
to<00:02:03.550> in<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.760> ground<00:02:04.030> or<00:02:04.420> with<00:02:04.570> synthetic

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
to in the ground or with synthetic

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.800 
to in the ground or with synthetic
fertilizers<00:02:05.800> one<00:02:06.130> benefit<00:02:06.580> is<00:02:06.940> that<00:02:07.180> we<00:02:07.660> don't

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
fertilizers one benefit is that we don't

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.800 
fertilizers one benefit is that we don't
have<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.260> discard<00:02:08.770> that<00:02:09.040> fish<00:02:09.880> waste<00:02:10.119> into<00:02:10.780> the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
have to discard that fish waste into the

another event that happens in nature and

another event that happens in nature and
that's<00:02:46.120> what<00:02:46.300> we<00:02:46.390> try<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:46.630> do<00:02:46.840> here<00:02:47.200> so<00:02:47.739> on<00:02:47.920> the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
that's what we try to do here so on the

that's what we try to do here so on the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
fish which they're now doing and then we

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.920 
fish which they're now doing and then we
don't<00:03:14.260> do<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.560> hormonal<00:03:14.950> manipulation<00:03:15.459> and

very often in traditionally raised fish

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.090 
very often in traditionally raised fish
they're<00:03:19.510> using<00:03:19.870> hormones<00:03:20.350> to<00:03:20.620> stimulate

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
they're using hormones to stimulate

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.400 
they're using hormones to stimulate
growth<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.850> then<00:03:22.480> they<00:03:22.630> also<00:03:22.810> do<00:03:23.200> what's

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
growth and then they also do what's

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.680 
growth and then they also do what's
called<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.709> sex<00:03:23.950> reverse<00:03:24.220> process<00:03:24.519> in<00:03:25.000> tilapia

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
called a sex reverse process in tilapia

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.540 
called a sex reverse process in tilapia
the<00:03:25.840> males<00:03:26.050> grow<00:03:26.290> faster<00:03:26.830> so<00:03:27.250> they

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
the males grow faster so they

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.180 
the males grow faster so they
change<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.940> females<00:03:28.390> to<00:03:29.110> mail<00:03:29.350> and<00:03:29.710> that

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
change the females to mail and that

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.390 
change the females to mail and that
makes<00:03:30.430> them<00:03:31.030> then<00:03:31.420> grow<00:03:31.690> faster<00:03:32.320> so<00:03:33.160> that's

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
makes them then grow faster so that's

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
makes them then grow faster so that's
why<00:03:33.640> we<00:03:33.670> spawn<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.570> fish<00:03:35.340> ourselves<00:03:36.390> so<00:03:37.390> that

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
why we spawn the fish ourselves so that

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.070 
why we spawn the fish ourselves so that
we<00:03:37.600> can<00:03:37.900> ensure<00:03:38.140> that<00:03:38.710> there's<00:03:38.920> no<00:03:40.080> hormonal

we can ensure that there's no hormonal
manipulation<00:03:41.530> down<00:03:42.100> if<00:03:42.580> I<00:03:42.730> do<00:03:42.790> anything<00:03:43.060> to

manipulation down if I do anything to

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.750 
manipulation down if I do anything to
the<00:03:43.390> plants<00:03:43.810> it'll<00:03:44.680> affect<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.070> fish<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:45.610> if

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
the plants it'll affect the fish and if

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.580 
the plants it'll affect the fish and if
I<00:03:45.850> do<00:03:45.910> anything<00:03:46.360> to<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.570> fish<00:03:46.840> it'll<00:03:47.380> affect

I do anything to the fish it'll affect
the<00:03:47.680> plans<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.220> so<00:03:48.820> I<00:03:48.850> have<00:03:49.390> to<00:03:49.570> keep<00:03:49.810> a

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
the plans and so I have to keep a

00:03:50.080 --> 00:04:00.330 
the plans and so I have to keep a
balance<00:03:56.040> there's<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.130> little<00:03:57.370> kitty<00:03:59.220> hiding<00:04:00.220> in
