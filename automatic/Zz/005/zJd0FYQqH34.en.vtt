00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
next up we have the Man of Steel version

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.919 
next up we have the Man of Steel version
of<00:00:06.299> Superman<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:08.030> there<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.269> with<00:00:09.510> his<00:00:09.630> pops

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
of Superman and there is with his pops

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.450 
of Superman and there is with his pops
so<00:00:11.179> the<00:00:12.179> other<00:00:12.599> version<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.230> Superman<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.950> here

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
so the other version of Superman is here

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.510 
so the other version of Superman is here
we<00:00:15.120> can<00:00:15.150> look<00:00:15.420> out<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.599> both<00:00:15.839> side<00:00:16.170> by<00:00:16.199> side<00:00:16.710> and

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
we can look out on both side by side and

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.900 
we can look out on both side by side and
see<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:18.029> there<00:00:18.210> are<00:00:18.240> minimal<00:00:18.900> differences

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
see that there are minimal differences

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.050 
see that there are minimal differences
obviously<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.750> Man<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.260> Steel<00:00:22.590> Superman<00:00:23.060> has

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
obviously the Man of Steel Superman has

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.570 
obviously the Man of Steel Superman has
a<00:00:24.090> little<00:00:24.449> bit<00:00:24.539> more<00:00:24.779> color<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:26.039> it

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
a little bit more color in it

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.919 
a little bit more color in it
there<00:00:27.060> they<00:00:27.210> are<00:00:27.359> having<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.949> hair<00:00:28.949> off<00:00:29.869> but<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
there they are having a hair off but I

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.639 
there they are having a hair off but I
mean<00:00:31.109> overall<00:00:31.500> it's<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.399> very<00:00:32.759> slightly

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
mean overall it's just a very slightly

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.350 
mean overall it's just a very slightly
different<00:00:34.760> change<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:37.530> way<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.850> Superman

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
different change to the way the Superman

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.410 
different change to the way the Superman
figure<00:00:40.140> looks<00:00:40.700> they<00:00:41.700> both<00:00:41.850> pretty<00:00:42.120> much<00:00:42.270> do

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
figure looks they both pretty much do

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.690 
figure looks they both pretty much do
the<00:00:42.540> same<00:00:42.570> thing<00:00:43.050> they<00:00:43.800> both<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.430> freeze

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
the same thing they both have the freeze

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.130 
the same thing they both have the freeze
breath<00:00:47.149> they<00:00:48.149> both<00:00:48.390> have<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.780> heat-ray

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
breath they both have the heat-ray

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.810 
breath they both have the heat-ray
vision<00:00:52.789> Superman<00:00:53.789> does<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.660> melee<00:00:55.079> attacks

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
vision Superman does do melee attacks

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.290 
vision Superman does do melee attacks
and<00:00:56.899> he<00:00:57.899> flies

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.630 

so<00:01:03.020> I<00:01:03.050> mean<00:01:03.380> obviously<00:01:03.620> you<00:01:04.010> can't<00:01:04.220> have<00:01:04.340> a<00:01:04.370> Man

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
so I mean obviously you can't have a Man

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.180 
so I mean obviously you can't have a Man
of<00:01:04.670> Steel<00:01:04.820> DLC<00:01:05.600> pack<00:01:05.870> without<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.980> Man<00:01:07.160> of

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
of Steel DLC pack without the Man of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.800 
of Steel DLC pack without the Man of
Steel<00:01:07.310> himself<00:01:10.090> but<00:01:11.090> it's<00:01:11.330> not<00:01:11.510> really<00:01:11.780> that

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
Steel himself but it's not really that

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.500 
Steel himself but it's not really that
big<00:01:12.110> of<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.290> deal<00:01:13.010> or<00:01:13.640> difference<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.480> only

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
big of a deal or difference the only

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.820 
big of a deal or difference the only
real<00:01:14.810> reason<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:15.290> should<00:01:15.440> get<00:01:15.560> them<00:01:15.710> in<00:01:15.800> a

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
real reason you should get them in a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.650 
real reason you should get them in a
sealed<00:01:16.100> packs<00:01:16.430> if<00:01:16.700> you<00:01:16.790> want<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.210> play<00:01:17.450> the

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
sealed packs if you want to play the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.170 
sealed packs if you want to play the
extra<00:01:18.020> level<00:01:18.380> which<00:01:19.100> isn't<00:01:19.490> necessarily<00:01:20.060> very

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
extra level which isn't necessarily very

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.930 
extra level which isn't necessarily very
long<00:01:20.600> but<00:01:21.320> you<00:01:22.160> know<00:01:22.250> it's<00:01:22.490> another<00:01:22.700> level

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
long but you know it's another level

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.780 
long but you know it's another level
nonetheless<00:01:23.590> until<00:01:24.590> 1899<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:25.400> comes<00:01:25.580> with<00:01:25.729> a

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
nonetheless until 1899 it comes with a

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.700 
nonetheless until 1899 it comes with a
bunch<00:01:25.940> of<00:01:26.060> other<00:01:26.180> characters<00:01:26.390> you<00:01:26.960> don't

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
bunch of other characters you don't

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.380 
bunch of other characters you don't
really<00:01:27.800> want<00:01:28.040> to<00:01:28.100> do<00:01:28.310> it<00:01:28.430> because<00:01:28.610> of<00:01:28.880> Superman

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
really want to do it because of Superman

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.190 
really want to do it because of Superman
I<00:01:29.420> guess<00:01:30.790> because<00:01:31.790> he's<00:01:32.420> really<00:01:32.690> like<00:01:32.840> I<00:01:32.960> said

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
I guess because he's really like I said

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.430 
I guess because he's really like I said
not<00:01:33.410> all<00:01:33.440> that<00:01:33.770> different<00:01:34.280> from<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:35.440> Superman

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
not all that different from the Superman

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.640 
not all that different from the Superman
that<00:01:36.680> comes<00:01:36.920> in<00:01:37.160> game<00:01:37.400> but<00:01:38.290> he<00:01:39.290> does<00:01:39.470> look

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
that comes in game but he does look

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.330 
that comes in game but he does look
pretty<00:01:39.710> cool<00:01:40.160> I<00:01:40.399> mean<00:01:41.119> it<00:01:41.390> looks<00:01:41.660> for

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
pretty cool I mean it looks for

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.469 
pretty cool I mean it looks for
everything<00:01:43.340> in<00:01:43.490> this<00:01:43.610> video<00:01:43.910> game<00:01:44.119> then

everything in this video game then

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.120 
everything in this video game then
