pics he threw were honestly my fault for
the<00:03:14.230> most<00:03:14.410> part<00:03:14.650> he<00:03:14.859> pretty<00:03:15.160> much<00:03:15.250> got<00:03:15.519> the

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
the most part he pretty much got the

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.550 
the most part he pretty much got the
ball<00:03:15.790> where<00:03:15.819> I<00:03:15.970> needed<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.299> go<00:03:16.420> whenever<00:03:17.170> I

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
ball where I needed to go whenever I

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.170 
ball where I needed to go whenever I
made<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:17.950> right<00:03:18.069> reads<00:03:18.370> so<00:03:18.609> I'm<00:03:18.760> not<00:03:18.880> I'm<00:03:19.120> not

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
made the right reads so I'm not I'm not

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.240 
made the right reads so I'm not I'm not
necessarily<00:03:19.840> trying<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.560> place<00:03:20.829> with<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.069> fat

a<00:03:21.280> necessity<00:03:21.790> for<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.840> team<00:03:23.079> I<00:03:23.470> think<00:03:24.130> that's

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
a necessity for the team I think that's

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.830 
a necessity for the team I think that's
about<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.489> though<00:03:24.639> guys<00:03:24.910> pretty<00:03:25.329> much<00:03:25.420> the

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
about it though guys pretty much the

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.289 
about it though guys pretty much the
pressing<00:03:26.440> needs<00:03:26.709> for<00:03:27.069> this<00:03:27.250> team<00:03:27.519> I<00:03:27.760> need<00:03:28.269> a

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
quarterbacks but honestly is crazy I saw

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.520 
quarterbacks but honestly is crazy I saw
all<00:03:36.489> my<00:03:36.670> big<00:03:36.880> ticket<00:03:37.209> players<00:03:37.480> i<00:03:37.870> think<00:03:38.350> i<00:03:38.410> got

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
all my big ticket players i think i got

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.620 
all my big ticket players i think i got
like<00:03:38.709> almost<00:03:39.430> two<00:03:39.790> million<00:03:40.030> coins<00:03:40.359> from

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
like almost two million coins from

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.629 
like almost two million coins from
something<00:03:40.989> crazy<00:03:41.290> like<00:03:41.440> that<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.069> my<00:03:42.400> team

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
something crazy like that and my team

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.190 
something crazy like that and my team
overall<00:03:42.910> only<00:03:43.299> went<00:03:43.450> down<00:03:43.569> two<00:03:43.780> points<00:03:43.989> so

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
overall only went down two points so

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.020 
overall only went down two points so
apparently<00:03:44.590> they<00:03:44.709> weren't<00:03:44.829> that<00:03:44.950> great<00:03:45.310> since

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
apparently they weren't that great since

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.940 
apparently they weren't that great since
it<00:03:46.150> didn't<00:03:46.450> affect<00:03:46.510> my<00:03:46.870> overall<00:03:47.319> too<00:03:47.560> much<00:03:47.709> but

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
it didn't affect my overall too much but

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.410 
it didn't affect my overall too much but
yeah<00:03:48.160> let<00:03:48.519> me<00:03:48.579> know<00:03:48.670> what<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:48.850> guys<00:03:48.940> gonna<00:03:49.150> see

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
the most part once again cornerback I

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.360 
the most part once again cornerback I
just<00:03:53.049> want<00:03:53.200> somebody<00:03:53.349> faster<00:03:54.010> than<00:03:54.130> catch

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
just want somebody faster than catch

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.390

like<00:03:54.639> I<00:03:54.730> won't<00:03:54.910> rely<00:03:55.209> on<00:03:55.269> hands<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.400> cromarty

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
like I won't rely on hands and cromarty

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.009 
like I won't rely on hands and cromarty
for<00:03:57.579> some<00:03:57.730> reason<00:03:58.030> his<00:03:58.150> hands<00:03:58.420> were<00:03:58.630> fat

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
for some reason his hands were fat

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.140 
for some reason his hands were fat
reliant<00:03:59.620> so<00:03:59.829> if<00:04:00.280> we<00:04:00.579> could<00:04:00.700> get<00:04:00.760> some<00:04:00.940> good

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
reliant so if we could get some good

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.180 
reliant so if we could get some good
catching<00:04:01.660> players<00:04:01.959> on<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.410> defense<00:04:02.829> even<00:04:03.099> at

free safety I might have to do that his

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.559 
free safety I might have to do that his
captive<00:04:11.980> cards<00:04:12.190> or<00:04:12.310> bees<00:04:12.489> I'm<00:04:12.819> not<00:04:13.180> against
