00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.299
 from here the tech operations center 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.370
 where they are provided to users 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.570
 better information and if you want this 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.240
 video start with the best energy 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.460
 We give away a super like down there for 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.990
 help this great community and I think that 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.199
 today we are going to be analyzing this 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.300
 monitor well flatron model in 23 42 its 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.789
 main characteristics its pros and 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.170
 its cons and some video shots on 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.730
 the darkness for you to decide 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.189
 finally if you want to acquire this 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.189
 product or something similar let's see it 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.410
 well here I have the monitor talking to 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.780
 some images so that you can 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.830
 appreciate its quality and in this section 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.470
 I have some of the features 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.450
 techniques by which some of you 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.700
 wants to know specifically what is it 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.920
 that brings this team we have a mentor 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.590
 of 23 inches as you can see with a 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.540
 type of panel tn that are those that makes 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.940
 that there are no ghost effects after 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.270
 we have good looks of 16 9 a 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.570
 resolution of 1920 x 1080 a brightness of 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.520
 about 250 candles per square meter that 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.830
 is perfect because with more than 200 already 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.740
 it's very good we have a contrast of 5 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.810
 millions to one on a led screen a 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.780
 response time of 5 milliseconds a 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.540
 160 viewing angle that's more or 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.850
 less should be 170 superior and 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.979
 then we have good 16.7 million 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.869
 colors and an antich reading surface 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.810
 with respect to the entrances and the exit 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.630
 we have the south that is old age to the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.850
 from the hdmi we have a boss exit 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.100
 to connect it but only when it's 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.840
 plugged in through hdmi the others do not 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.940
 they work because they do not transmit a sound 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.920
 then we have good 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.260
 that comes externally that is a 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.590
 particularity very good because it makes 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.960
 this teacher so small that brings a 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.550
 consumption of only 24 watts and in one consumption 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.920
 Knit 3 watts when on standby 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.650
 and then we find in the frequency 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.880
 digital that we are interested in 30 83 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.260
 keyloggers bar 56 75 hertz so 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.670
 now let's move on with a test of 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.130
 dark video so that you can 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.760
 appreciate the leaks of lights and all that to 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.760
 your to your liking 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.250
 change asthma 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.250
 and the king Huawei 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.090
 well here I brought you a little monitor 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.539
 more closely first I brought it here to 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.820
 that they see how narrow it is is very finite 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.710
 as you can see there having the 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.250
 Transformer outside goes with a cable 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.919
 finite the transformer has has 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.900
 much more space to put it out and 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.300
 that this is much more finite that is a 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.030
 of the characteristics that the 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.910
 model than this model that compared 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.650
 from the previous one is a bit like that much more 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.470
 thick because it has transformed inside 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.520
 of an older technology after 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:53.830
 here they have it with a background of an audi 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.300
 so you can see it looks very good and the 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.250
 pro and cons this monitor has 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.229
 first is that it is very unstable is 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.550
 also they know there not be rigid 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.120
 no problem but the other time that what 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:07.210
 I took my other house moved a lot 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.130
 when I supported myself or something well that did not 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.840
 it is very rigid that is a characteristic 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.849
 against which is very very bad is what 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.770
 I had older monitor before I was 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.420
 super stiff I moved the table and the 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.900
 monitor not 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.070
 and he noticed but this one even though 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.610
 sometimes has that habit of moving the 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.610
 leg or touch the table 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.889
 It is very unpleasant because it moves 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.509
 too much and then good everything else 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.099
 it is very well the only thing there is 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.169
 have a little care because having 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.419
 from the transformer to outside these cables 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.969
 they are very very delicate like the cable 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.159
 the printer then if it breaks in a 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:43.770
 normal monitor goes one buy another cable 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:45.629
 of 10 pesos of 220 and nothing happens but 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.460
 it almost breaks this cable come out over 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:49.169
 600 pesos and if it manages to get it 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.000
 because you have to buy the cable and the 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.099
 transformer then those are the two 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.259
 issues against and for the truth 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:57.840
 it has got all the brightness when one 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:06:00.389
 puts it to 90 it already burns the eyes is very 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.159
 good and then one sees all the 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.629
 technical characteristics then the 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:05.639
 contrasts with reality and in the 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:09.150
 monitor how well it looks and the truth is 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:11.460
 amazing so I leave you with this 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.439
 video so they can see it and analyze it and 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.930
 if you like the monitor you already know 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:18.419
 a price of one thousand 500 pesos in Argentina 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.800
 so it's very very economical I hope that 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.710
 you liked the video if you liked it 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.139
 Roe to like and subscribe here 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.800
 down I am the one of you see us in the 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.800
 next video 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:50.030
 point 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.030
