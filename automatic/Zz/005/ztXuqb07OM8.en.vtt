00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.670
 until today 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.009

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.110

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.719
 an iron holder that I placed on the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.629
 my backpack puts on my back there 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.820
 tied and went out pulling a 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.579
 my first rolling backpack on the 4th 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.620
 series and I'm proud to go with her. 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.480
 to school I was proud of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.879
 show everyone I had 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.379
 also a rollaway backpack and left me 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.390
 Finding the driver then was a 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.940
 generation all deceived by that 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.970
 blue and orange rubber that said that 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.850
 erase pen and tear the paper more 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.460
 taking it after what everyone had 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.770
 a studio in the studio and even 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.110
 knowing he did not pay for a pen you had 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.110
 there was no way there was not 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.250
 to the pleasure of that time comes down to 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.830
 to count the time to open the 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.680
 salgadinho and see what tasso that would arrive 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.350
 time would be repeated or not and also 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.780
 was scattered and playing 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.490
 cases and beating the 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.490
 snack used if that juice of 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.290
 passion fruit with that stuffed biscuit 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.200
 when it was not the clear salt that is 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.690
 the toast was the essential old me 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.910
 I counted the hours to get to 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.490
 time to open and see what the 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.039
 toast plus what a child who 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.289
 The package was never 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.940
 find two taboos in the same salty snack 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.880
 old and you'd better win in the mega 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.050
 sena to sicredi used to be very 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.050
 longing bubble 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.789
 the classroom at that time was very 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.430
 crazy to us who was who had the pencil 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.269
 of 40 colors and that is with 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.220
 pencil is ink pen ink was considered 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.820
 the king of the scallop room could send in 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.860
 all 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.080
 else the bets in the classroom 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.000
 that you finished copying first or 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.769
 so who changed another one's notebook 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.709
 Like I copy in your tone copying my 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.720
 it was crazy and at the time of proof that the 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.400
 test was done on the spot live and 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.160
 I would smell alcohol in the whole room 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.079
 was very good with the mimeograph and another 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.630
 thing he could not use in the room was that 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.299
 the teacher took the pencil out of the hand 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.019
 was right and when we did not have 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.810
 cell phone 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.900
 We used to play stop because it was the 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.120
 way to spend old time type a 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.430
 pick a letter the words age 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.110
 name these things and also another game 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.600
 who was famous that one of the dots 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.400
 which had to form a square and in the 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.680
 half put the letter of your name 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.610
 It was a good sight to see that time. 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.610
 I miss you 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.290
 the model was one of the things I most 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.420
 I did in my school in childhood 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.849
 Who does not remember to take that box? 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.730
 put the cardstock around and made a 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.909
 building or else pick up blue hair gel 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.730
 and making a lake is one of those 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.709
 plastic that came in memory of the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.530
 birthday make the old population 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.439
 It was another thing 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.230
 like region in cotton planting beans 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:38.709
 cotton that never and also make that 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.799
 volcano of putting experience 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.079
 baking soda and vinegar to make choice and 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.569
 I also did a lot of modeling of the system 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.159
 with styrofoam balls simulating the 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.829
 planets 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:54.319
 Geez, I did a lot of old work. 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.609
 of science do in the fair of ashes 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:00.290

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.909
 so guys this was a quick video 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.250

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:07.629
