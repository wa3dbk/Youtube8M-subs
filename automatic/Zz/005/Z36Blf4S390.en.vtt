00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.170 
does have the voice it is sort of
irritating<00:03:31.530> but<00:03:31.919> this<00:03:32.160> is<00:03:32.340> much<00:03:32.519> more<00:03:32.700> simpler

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
irritating but this is much more simpler

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.750 
irritating but this is much more simpler
