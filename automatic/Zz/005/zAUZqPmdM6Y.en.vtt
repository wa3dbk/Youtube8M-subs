00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:08.160
 People, in 2013 Motorola proved that it knows how to innovate, and launched the Moto X. And soon it has conquered 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.150
 several fans. With a 4.7 inch screen that guarantees 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.630
 super-bright and brilliant images, dual core processor and camera that shoots at Full 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.259
 HD, it really rocked in Brazil! That's why Motorola could not stop there, not 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.859
 really?! So come with Lu to meet the new Moto X. 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.380
 What you call attention right away, is your look. The design is supermodern with coating 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.980
 in high quality materials. Everything so that the device fits right in the palm 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.660
 of hand. It's pure style! And the performance? Ah, at that point the Moto X 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.620
 not to be missed! In addition to having the Pure Android experience in the latest version, 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.110
 with an advanced quad-core processor, which has an impressive speed. You go 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.409
 feel the difference when it comes to browsing the web, opening applications and doing 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.969
 need. And the screen then ?! It is bigger and with a quality 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:13.939
 incredible, Full HD. You can already imagine the videos and photos on your screen. A lot 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.390
 resolution for a smart! I loved it! And speaking of videos and photos, the camera 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:27.759
 has 13MP and records videos in 4K, that's right! With definition 4 times bigger than Full HD. 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.130
 Is not that amazing ?! And there's more! The intelligent voice command function 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.390
 it's even better! Remember, in Moto X 1st generation you could only start the phone 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.210
 with the "OK, Google Now?" command? So now you can customize your command 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.289
 ask questions, turn on the camera, take a selfie, open applications, send 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.439
 posts on WhatsApp, post to Facebook, schedule alarms and notes and more, everything 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.679
 this without having to touch the smartphone, just talk. 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:03.780
 And if you prefer you can still interact with the new Moto X using only gestures. Moving 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.190
 your hand over the phone, it silences calls or alarms, and to turn on the camera, that's all. 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.990
 make two movements with the wrist. Cool huh? 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.000
 The interesting thing is that he learns the needs of his day to day life. It recognizes when you 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.830
 driving, whether you are in a meeting or even sleeping, and behave accordingly. 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.110
 with the situation, such as silencing the device alone. 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.150
 Now a question, who likes to take the cell phone to the bathroom while bathing, 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.730
 or even at the edge of the pool to take pictures and listen to music? If you answered that 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.510
 yes, you will love to know that the new Moto X comes with a splash resistant cover 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.560
 of water. And it's no use having all this, if you 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.060
 You need to be a slave to take it, do not you? This is why the battery is long 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.020
 duration. He accompanies you all day long, until you need to stretch out for a happy 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.900
 hour. Guys, you've got a sense that the 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.920
 new Moto X came to leave everyone in the mood to have one, right? So do not lose 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.050
 time, buy now in Magazine Luiza. What's up? Hope this helps! So, 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.050
