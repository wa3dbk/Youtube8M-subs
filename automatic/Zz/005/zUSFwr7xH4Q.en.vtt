fun part of the mission as I was talking

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.370 
fun part of the mission as I was talking
about<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:25.450> know<00:03:25.540> when<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:25.780> do<00:03:26.200> this

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
I think actually you don't get any

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.020 
I think actually you don't get any
skilled<00:03:29.590> with<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:29.920> mac-10<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.550> don't<00:03:30.790> think

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
skilled with the mac-10 I don't think

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.120
