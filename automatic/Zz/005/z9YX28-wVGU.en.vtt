pictures saved to jpg so when you take a
picture<00:03:24.230> if<00:03:24.470> I<00:03:24.560> just<00:03:24.769> going<00:03:25.069> to<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.489> camera

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
picture if I just going to the camera

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.839 
picture if I just going to the camera
application<00:03:26.540> it<00:03:27.169> immediately<00:03:27.620> allows<00:03:28.280> us<00:03:28.609> to

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
application it immediately allows us to

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.370 
application it immediately allows us to
to<00:03:29.329> to<00:03:29.870> pick<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:31.480> brightness<00:03:32.480> or<00:03:32.690> a<00:03:32.720> skin<00:03:33.109> tone

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
to to pick a a brightness or a skin tone

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.280 
to to pick a a brightness or a skin tone
and<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:34.389> correction<00:03:35.389> and<00:03:35.569> if<00:03:35.690> I<00:03:35.780> tap<00:03:36.049> on<00:03:36.200> it

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
and and correction and if I tap on it

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.629 
and and correction and if I tap on it
instead<00:03:36.709> of<00:03:36.769> just<00:03:36.919> taking<00:03:37.099> the<00:03:37.340> picture

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
instead of just taking the picture

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.520 
instead of just taking the picture
directly<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.389> will<00:03:38.569> wait<00:03:38.780> a<00:03:38.810> few<00:03:39.109> seconds

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
directly it will wait a few seconds

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.870 
directly it will wait a few seconds
before<00:03:39.739> actually<00:03:40.310> taking<00:03:40.519> a<00:03:40.549> picture<00:03:40.700> so<00:03:40.849> you

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
before actually taking a picture so you

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.000 
before actually taking a picture so you
can<00:03:40.970> actually<00:03:41.150> hold<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.840> stable<00:03:42.470> shot<00:03:42.680> as<00:03:42.859> well

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
can actually hold a stable shot as well

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.580 
can actually hold a stable shot as well
so<00:03:43.220> really<00:03:43.519> some<00:03:44.000> usability<00:03:44.720> enhancements<00:03:45.079> in

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
so really some usability enhancements in

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.140 
so really some usability enhancements in
that<00:03:45.709> you<00:03:45.799> don't<00:03:45.980> shoot<00:03:46.130> camera<00:03:46.579> so<00:03:46.819> it's

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
that you don't shoot camera so it's

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.670 
that you don't shoot camera so it's
because<00:03:47.630> you've<00:03:47.780> got<00:03:47.930> this<00:03:48.079> extra<00:03:48.380> processing

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
because you've got this extra processing

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.259 
because you've got this extra processing
inspecting<00:03:49.519> it's<00:03:49.669> able<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:49.940> use<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.150> main

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
inspecting it's able to use the main

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.789 
inspecting it's able to use the main
camera<00:03:50.480> process<00:03:50.959> so<00:03:51.109> then<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:51.349> can<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.650> can

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
camera process so then you can you can

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.440 
camera process so then you can you can
almost<00:03:51.950> use<00:03:52.130> it<00:03:52.310> more<00:03:52.489> like<00:03:52.639> the<00:03:53.030> main<00:03:53.209> camera

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
almost use it more like the main camera

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.690 
almost use it more like the main camera
it<00:03:53.900> can<00:03:53.959> do<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.440> can<00:03:54.560> do<00:03:54.680> few<00:03:55.040> more<00:03:55.190> tricks<00:03:55.459> with

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
it can do it can do few more tricks with

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.309 
it can do it can do few more tricks with
the<00:03:55.940> white<00:03:56.150> balance<00:03:56.180> that's<00:03:56.569> not<00:03:56.690> a<00:03:56.720> processor

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
the white balance that's not a processor

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.900 
the white balance that's not a processor
it's<00:03:57.470> actually<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:57.859> image<00:03:58.129> ship<00:03:58.340> itself<00:03:58.639> will

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
it's actually the image ship itself will

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.250 
it's actually the image ship itself will
allow<00:03:59.090> you<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.359> do<00:03:59.480> that<00:03:59.510> error<00:03:59.780> Corrections

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
allow you to do that error Corrections

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.020 
allow you to do that error Corrections
it's<00:04:00.650> not<00:04:00.889> on<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.099> application<00:04:01.579> process<00:04:01.609> but

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
it's not on the application process but

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.550 
it's not on the application process but
yes<00:04:02.239> you<00:04:02.450> allow<00:04:02.599> you<00:04:02.660> to<00:04:02.840> actually<00:04:02.989> take

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
yes you allow you to actually take

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.990 
yes you allow you to actually take
better<00:04:03.889> shots<00:04:04.040> from<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.459> front<00:04:04.700> facing

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
better shots from the front facing

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.360 
better shots from the front facing
camera<00:04:05.269> got<00:04:05.720> you<00:04:05.930> thank<00:04:06.260> you<00:04:06.440> and<00:04:06.620> let's<00:04:07.190> just

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
camera got you thank you and let's just

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.979 
camera got you thank you and let's just
ask<00:04:07.519> one<00:04:07.790> last<00:04:07.819> question<00:04:08.060> I<00:04:08.480> mean<00:04:08.599> what<00:04:08.840> do<00:04:08.930> you

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
ask one last question I mean what do you

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.530 
ask one last question I mean what do you
think<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.319> biggest<00:04:09.500> benefit<00:04:10.010> of<00:04:10.540> increasing

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
think the biggest benefit of increasing

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.909 
think the biggest benefit of increasing
the<00:04:11.750> clock<00:04:11.930> speed<00:04:12.169> of<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.379> processor<00:04:12.530> is

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919 
the clock speed of the processor is

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.379 
the clock speed of the processor is
going<00:04:13.190> to<00:04:13.280> be<00:04:13.370> that<00:04:13.579> extra<00:04:13.849> performance<00:04:14.000> who

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
going to be that extra performance who

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.240 
going to be that extra performance who
really<00:04:14.660> needs<00:04:14.870> that<00:04:14.959> so<00:04:15.650> in<00:04:15.769> terms<00:04:15.919> of<00:04:16.099> that

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
really needs that so in terms of that

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.940 
really needs that so in terms of that
performance<00:04:16.760> itself<00:04:17.299> so<00:04:17.570> obviously<00:04:18.289> with<00:04:18.919> the

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
performance itself so obviously with the

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.860 
performance itself so obviously with the
development<00:04:19.700> of<00:04:19.729> games<00:04:20.030> exerted<00:04:20.690> to<00:04:20.780> the

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
development of games exerted to the
