it for a couple hours but I'm going to
show<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.540> some<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.960> things<00:00:10.170> I've<00:00:10.349> been

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
show you some of the things I've been

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.240 
show you some of the things I've been
doing<00:00:10.500> with<00:00:10.860> it

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
doing with it

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.999 
doing with it
it<00:00:11.519> looks<00:00:11.670> like<00:00:11.820> Darth<00:00:12.120> Vader<00:00:12.380> the<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.769> the

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
it looks like Darth Vader the is the

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.160 
it looks like Darth Vader the is the
grill<00:00:14.309> basically<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.240> have<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.389> trap<00:00:15.660> loaded<00:00:16.020> up

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
grill basically I have a trap loaded up

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.040 
grill basically I have a trap loaded up
loaded<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.830> slot<00:00:17.039> here<00:00:17.070> by<00:00:17.490> pressing<00:00:21.050> and

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
loaded on this slot here by pressing and

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.050 
loaded on this slot here by pressing and
then<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.830> can<00:00:23.010> hit<00:00:23.189> stop<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.519> they<00:00:23.760> happen<00:00:24.000> to

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
then I can hit stop and they happen to

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.599 
then I can hit stop and they happen to
have<00:00:24.119> set<00:00:24.420> up<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.600> very<00:00:24.840> convenient<00:00:25.609> Ableton

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
have set up a very convenient Ableton

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.179 
have set up a very convenient Ableton
Live<00:00:26.820> mapping<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:28.170> behaves<00:00:28.500> quite<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.949> bit

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
Live mapping that behaves quite a bit

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.919 
Live mapping that behaves quite a bit
like<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> launch<00:00:29.699> pad<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.480> that's<00:00:30.570> sort<00:00:30.810> of

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
like the launch pad and that's sort of

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.860 
like the launch pad and that's sort of
on<00:00:31.019> bank<00:00:31.230> nine<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.920> each<00:00:32.040> pad<00:00:32.369> actually<00:00:33.239> has

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
on bank nine and each pad actually has

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.959 
on bank nine and each pad actually has
four<00:00:34.380> different<00:00:34.739> clips<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.940> can

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
four different clips that you can

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.850 
four different clips that you can
control<00:00:36.840> first<00:00:37.079> thing<00:00:37.260> I'm<00:00:37.350> going<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.620> is

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
control first thing I'm going to do is

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.770 
control first thing I'm going to do is
create<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> eat<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.969> layer<00:00:39.180> over<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
create a eat that I can layer over the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.990 
create a eat that I can layer over the
track<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:41.070> do<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.370> I'm<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.760> switch

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
track and to do that I'm going to switch

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.420 
track and to do that I'm going to switch
presets<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.930> preset<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:43.590> which<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> custom

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
presets to preset one which is a custom

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.580 
presets to preset one which is a custom
one<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.760> I've<00:00:44.850> set<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.840> I'm<00:00:45.989> using<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.379> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
one that I've set up and I'm using it to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:01:25.850 
one that I've set up and I'm using it to
control<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.670> 808<00:00:48.270> here<00:01:24.439> what<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.470> want<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.710> do

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
control the 808 here what I want to do

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.410 
control the 808 here what I want to do
now<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.070> take<00:01:26.460> advantage<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:27.090> some<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.360> these

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
now is take advantage of some of these

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.210 
now is take advantage of some of these
awesome<00:01:28.049> touch<00:01:28.320> strips<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.950> pressure

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
sensitivity thing to create some cool

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.469 
sensitivity thing to create some cool
effects<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> track<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.790> drag<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> little

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
effects on the track and drag a little

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.969 
effects on the track and drag a little
Auto<00:01:33.780> filter<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.829> beat<00:01:35.280> repeat<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.890> now<00:01:37.890> I'm

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
Auto filter and beat repeat and now I'm

Auto filter and beat repeat and now I'm
going<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.159> go<00:01:38.250> about<00:01:38.430> making<00:01:38.640> my<00:01:38.850> mini

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
going to go about making my mini

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.230 
going to go about making my mini
assignment<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.810> om<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.189> want<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.670> control<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
assignment so om I want to control the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.300 
assignment so om I want to control the
repeat<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.460> grid<00:01:44.720> for<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.780> repeat<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.380> want

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
repeat and grid for the repeat I want

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.429 
repeat and grid for the repeat I want
minimum<00:01:47.790> volume<00:01:48.000> down<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.930> turns<00:01:49.200> on

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
minimum volume down so it just turns on

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.649 
minimum volume down so it just turns on
right<00:01:49.770> when<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.920> start<00:01:50.220> hitting<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.000> then

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
right when I start hitting it and then

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.660 
right when I start hitting it and then
the<00:01:51.869> grid<00:01:52.110> value<00:01:53.040> I'm<00:01:53.159> gonna<00:01:53.369> convert<00:01:54.500> and

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
the grid value I'm gonna convert and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.620 
the grid value I'm gonna convert and
change<00:01:56.670> these<00:01:57.060> values<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.479> little<00:01:57.750> bit<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.140> I

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
change these values a little bit to I

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.300 
change these values a little bit to I
also<00:02:00.630> want<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> sweet<00:02:01.950> thing<00:02:02.810> here

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
also want to do like a sweet thing here

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.669 
also want to do like a sweet thing here
here<00:02:05.539> so<00:02:06.539> I<00:02:06.570> don't<00:02:06.840> want<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.080> to<00:02:07.259> go<00:02:07.409> all<00:02:07.649> the

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
here so I don't want this to go all the

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.270 
here so I don't want this to go all the
way<00:02:07.799> here<00:02:08.519> and<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:09.000> want

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:23.290 

[Music]

[Music]

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:48.410 
[Music]
so<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:24.390> can<00:02:24.540> use<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:46.670> one<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.880> strengths

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
so you can use this one of the strengths

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.010 
so you can use this one of the strengths
of<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:49.470> q<00:02:50.430> neo<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.850> its<00:02:51.120> pressure<00:02:51.390> sensitivity

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
of the q neo is its pressure sensitivity

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.280 
of the q neo is its pressure sensitivity
and<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:53.430> ability<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.850> just<00:02:54.570> use<00:02:54.930> all<00:02:55.140> these

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
and the ability to just use all these

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.910 
and the ability to just use all these
different<00:02:55.350> new<00:02:56.310> input<00:02:57.240> sources<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:58.470> modify

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
different new input sources to modify

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.680 
different new input sources to modify
it's<00:02:59.070> in<00:02:59.220> action<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.940> switch<00:03:00.180> between<00:03:00.390> my<00:03:00.630> two

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
it's in action and switch between my two

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.080 
it's in action and switch between my two
oscillators

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.460 

pressure<00:03:06.090> set<00:03:06.510> up<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.780> control<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.290> frequency

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
pressure set up to control the frequency
