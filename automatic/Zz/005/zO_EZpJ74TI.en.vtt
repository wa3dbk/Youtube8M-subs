00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:51.817
I used to be nice, soft and tender,
but if I keep going crazy like this

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:55.652
You'll change me into something bad

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.222
I have put a spell again on a puppet that looks like you

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.355
I beg you to break up with her

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:02.190
break up with her

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:06.405
Every night I'll be with you

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.304
Do you love her?

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.165
Do you love her?

00:01:10.624 --> 00:01:13.925
Everyday I dream of you

00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:15.824
Do you love me?

00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:17.607
Do you love me?

00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:18.862
Bring, bring

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:21.485
I want to hold you in my arms

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:25.244
I will do anything and even more

00:01:25.623 --> 00:01:26.457
Bling, bling

00:01:26.648 --> 00:01:29.155
You are my fantasy

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:33.207
I'll put everything on stake to have you

00:01:33.474 --> 00:01:36.629
I need to stop thinking about you,
because I can't take it no more

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.502
In the name of God, why do I worry about you?
You're stuck in my heart!

00:01:40.808 --> 00:01:44.302
I've put a spell again on the torn picture of us

00:01:44.454 --> 00:01:46.315
I beg you drop her

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:47.188
drop her

00:01:48.238 --> 00:01:50.984
Every night I'll be with you

00:01:51.896 --> 00:01:53.264
Do you love her?

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.162
Do you love her?

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.884
Every day in my dreams

00:01:59.344 --> 00:02:00.748
Do you love me?

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:02.732
Do you love me?

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.833
Bring, bring

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:06.529
I want to hold you in my arms

00:02:06.872 --> 00:02:10.214
I will do anything and even more

00:02:10.632 --> 00:02:11.431
Bling, bling

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:14.585
You are my fantasy, yeah

00:02:14.814 --> 00:02:17.700
I'll put everything on stake to have you

00:02:17.714 --> 00:02:19.234
I`m in the Voodoo Island

00:02:19.463 --> 00:02:20.944
I do it for the sake for my plan to get you back

00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:22.810
Almost every day you make me cry,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.676
My last step towards you

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:25.424
yeah, yeah

00:02:25.653 --> 00:02:28.994
She holds your arm and she kisses your lips

00:02:29.275 --> 00:02:30.983
And I hate it that you are in her imagination

00:02:31.212 --> 00:02:32.769
In this spell I have the desire to hold you

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:34.042
lalalalala

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:36.359
lalalala

00:02:36.803 --> 00:02:38.132

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.146

00:02:41.935 --> 00:02:43.834

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:47.500
abracadabra execute it all

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.175
Let's go

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.656
uh uhuhuh!

00:02:49.924 --> 00:02:51.517
ha hahaha!

00:02:51.824 --> 00:02:54.025
Yeah,
I'll cast a spell again

00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:56.634
I`m like a supervisor

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.494
I control you, I am the emperor

00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:01.077
You can't get away from me

00:03:02.146 --> 00:03:02.988
from me

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.982
Bring, bring

00:03:04.137 --> 00:03:06.413
I want to hold you in my arms

00:03:06.794 --> 00:03:10.249
I will do anything and even more

00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:11.312
Bling, bling

00:03:11.505 --> 00:03:14.502
You are my fantasy, yeah

00:03:14.731 --> 00:03:18.195
I'll put everything on stake to have you

00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:21.535
I used to be nice, soft and tender,
but if I keep going crazy like this

00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:25.228
You'll change me into something bad

00:03:25.608 --> 00:03:28.948
I pretend to be cool,
what a surprise

00:03:29.253 --> 00:03:31.235
Pretending to leave and go meet someone

00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:32.248
yeah
