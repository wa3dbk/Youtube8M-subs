00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:12.630 

let's<00:03:00.580> go<00:03:00.760> back<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:04.480> here<00:03:04.750> we<00:03:04.840> go

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.450 

well<00:03:13.300> I<00:03:13.540> think<00:03:13.690> it's<00:03:13.990> pretty<00:03:14.110> obvious<00:03:14.460> both

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
well I think it's pretty obvious both

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.810 
well I think it's pretty obvious both
are<00:03:15.730> very<00:03:15.880> good<00:03:16.060> but<00:03:16.660> without<00:03:16.930> a<00:03:16.990> doubt<00:03:17.820> the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
are very good but without a doubt the

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.370 
are very good but without a doubt the
dr.<00:03:19.240> pepper<00:03:19.420> made<00:03:20.410> with<00:03:20.680> sugar<00:03:21.600> it<00:03:22.600> wins<00:03:22.960> I

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
dr. pepper made with sugar it wins I

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.310 
dr. pepper made with sugar it wins I
would<00:03:23.980> say<00:03:24.220> I<00:03:24.580> would<00:03:25.300> put<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.720> dot<00:03:25.870> if<00:03:25.990> I<00:03:26.140> was

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
would say I would put the dot if I was

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.900 
would say I would put the dot if I was
comparing<00:03:26.740> them<00:03:26.980> I<00:03:27.070> would<00:03:27.250> say<00:03:27.430> this<00:03:27.640> is<00:03:27.880> a

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
comparing them I would say this is a

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.500 
comparing them I would say this is a
five<00:03:28.240> and<00:03:28.860> I<00:03:29.860> would<00:03:30.040> put<00:03:30.220> this<00:03:30.400> at<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.850> four<00:03:31.180> I

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
five and I would put this at a four I

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.160 
five and I would put this at a four I
mean<00:03:31.870> there<00:03:32.740> is<00:03:32.770> a<00:03:32.920> difference<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:34.600> me<00:03:34.720> this<00:03:34.960> is

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
mean there is a difference to me this is

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.110 
mean there is a difference to me this is
a<00:03:35.200> little<00:03:35.500> bit<00:03:35.620> flatter<00:03:35.950> actually<00:03:36.670> compared

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
a little bit flatter actually compared

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.060 
a little bit flatter actually compared
to<00:03:37.330> the<00:03:37.420> one<00:03:37.660> made<00:03:37.990> with<00:03:38.230> real<00:03:38.440> sugar<00:03:38.470> the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
to the one made with real sugar the

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.670 
to the one made with real sugar the
flavors<00:03:39.850> pop<00:03:39.880> more<00:03:42.660> excuse<00:03:43.660> me<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.200> flavors

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.830 
I don't know if I'm beating a glass
bottle<00:03:56.290> makes<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.650> difference<00:03:57.040> but<00:03:57.840> there's

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
bottle makes the difference but there's

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.810 
bottle makes the difference but there's
no<00:03:59.050> doubt<00:03:59.260> about<00:03:59.290> it<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.830> dr.<00:04:00.280> pepper<00:04:00.459> made

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
no doubt about it the dr. pepper made

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.420 
no doubt about it the dr. pepper made
with<00:04:01.030> sugar<00:04:01.270> wins<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.530> taste<00:04:02.770> test<00:04:03.070> so<00:04:03.130> that's

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
with sugar wins the taste test so that's

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.600 
with sugar wins the taste test so that's
that's<00:04:03.880> two<00:04:04.239> videos<00:04:04.750> in<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:05.050> row<00:04:05.489> where<00:04:06.489> the

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
that's two videos in a row where the

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.690 
that's two videos in a row where the
soda<00:04:07.090> made<00:04:07.450> with<00:04:07.660> real<00:04:07.870> sugar<00:04:08.170> has<00:04:08.590> one<00:04:09.040> so<00:04:09.670> I

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
soda made with real sugar has one so I

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.410 
soda made with real sugar has one so I
think<00:04:09.850> it's<00:04:10.180> pretty<00:04:10.330> obvious<00:04:10.739> even<00:04:11.739> though

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
think it's pretty obvious even though

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.420 
think it's pretty obvious even though
even<00:04:13.420> though<00:04:13.750> Americans<00:04:14.560> have<00:04:14.770> been<00:04:14.950> drinking

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
even though Americans have been drinking

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.460 
even though Americans have been drinking
these<00:04:15.880> beverages<00:04:16.269> with<00:04:16.750> these<00:04:16.930> additives

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
these beverages with these additives

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.890

still taste is better with this the make

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.540 
still taste is better with this the make
of<00:04:27.669> the<00:04:27.729> sugar<00:04:28.030> real<00:04:28.660> sugar<00:04:28.960> stuff<00:04:29.350> so<00:04:29.710> it's
