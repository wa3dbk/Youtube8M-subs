00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.160 
go over to auction house but one of the
things<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.250> realize<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.300> two<00:00:30.810> elite

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
things I realize is that the two elite

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.780 
things I realize is that the two elite
collectibles<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.009> get<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.279> your<00:00:32.399> reward

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
collectibles that you get in your reward

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.729 
collectibles that you get in your reward
packs<00:00:33.059> they're<00:00:33.630> actually<00:00:34.050> not<00:00:34.079> worth<00:00:34.530> all

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
packs they're actually not worth all

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.299 
packs they're actually not worth all
that<00:00:34.829> much<00:00:35.399> all<00:00:35.670> too<00:00:35.880> much<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.329> um<00:00:37.020> at<00:00:37.860> first<00:00:37.890> I

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
that much all too much so um at first I

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.470 
that much all too much so um at first I
was<00:00:38.460> thinking<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.969> could<00:00:39.000> definitely

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
was thinking that you could definitely

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.630 
was thinking that you could definitely
get<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.899> lot<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.290> coins<00:00:40.710> off<00:00:40.829> your<00:00:41.010> jumbo<00:00:41.309> reward

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
get a lot of coins off your jumbo reward

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.639 
get a lot of coins off your jumbo reward
PacBio<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.480> watched<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.899> couple<00:00:43.020> people<00:00:43.260> open

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
PacBio I watched a couple people open

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.260 
PacBio I watched a couple people open
theirs<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.010> they<00:00:44.100> got<00:00:44.250> all<00:00:44.579> they<00:00:44.789> got<00:00:44.910> was<00:00:44.940> two

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
theirs and they got all they got was two

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.940 
theirs and they got all they got was two
elite<00:00:45.570> collectibles<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.289> two<00:00:46.410> gold<00:00:46.649> players

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
elite collectibles and two gold players

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.400 
elite collectibles and two gold players
so<00:00:47.640> at<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.450> moment<00:00:48.510> I'm<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.079> might<00:00:49.230> not<00:00:49.350> even

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
so at this moment I'm it might not even

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.010 
so at this moment I'm it might not even
be<00:00:49.680> worth<00:00:50.070> doing<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.940> collection<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.780> might

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
be worth doing the collection it might

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.299 
be worth doing the collection it might
be<00:00:52.170> better<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.649> wait<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.890> out<00:00:52.980> but<00:00:53.219> you'll

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
be better just to wait it out but you'll

to<00:01:12.479> flipping<00:01:12.869> cards<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:14.070> all<00:01:14.280> about

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
to flipping cards it's not all about

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.060 
to flipping cards it's not all about
getting<00:01:14.640> one<00:01:15.030> big<00:01:15.390> huge<00:01:15.810> flip<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.409> making<00:01:16.979> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
getting one big huge flip and making a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.740 
getting one big huge flip and making a
lot<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.250> profit<00:01:17.490> off<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.790> one<00:01:18.030> flip<00:01:18.240> especially

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
lot of profit off of one flip especially

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.179 
lot of profit off of one flip especially
that's<00:01:18.900> really<00:01:19.200> hard<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> do<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.830> year<00:01:20.040> with

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
that's really hard to do this year with

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.520 
that's really hard to do this year with
the<00:01:20.280> ten<00:01:20.490> percent<00:01:20.850> tax<00:01:21.320> making<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> lot<00:01:22.500> of

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
the ten percent tax making a lot of

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.170 
the ten percent tax making a lot of
coins<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.950> usually<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.340> off<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> bunch<00:01:24.030> a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
coins is usually just off a bunch a

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.270 
coins is usually just off a bunch a
