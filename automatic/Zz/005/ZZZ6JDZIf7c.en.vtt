00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:06.730 
and the whole moral that story is about
final<00:01:05.269> wave<00:01:05.449> is<00:01:05.689> like<00:01:05.899> they're<00:01:06.139> right<00:01:06.439> there

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
final wave is like they're right there

final wave is like they're right there
you<00:01:07.490> know<00:01:07.639> but<00:01:08.950> look<00:01:09.950> there<00:01:10.189> was<00:01:10.310> an<00:01:10.429> hour<00:01:10.670> out

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:11.389 
you know but look there was an hour out

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:16.320 
you know but look there was an hour out
of<00:01:11.450> that<00:01:12.020> day<00:01:12.409> that<00:01:12.740> that<00:01:12.770> way<00:01:13.069> if<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:13.340> worked

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.080 

I<00:01:19.410> always<00:01:20.410> say<00:01:20.710> let's<00:01:21.070> go<00:01:21.250> find<00:01:21.490> something<00:01:21.880> new

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
I always say let's go find something new

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.730 
I always say let's go find something new
then<00:01:22.660> go<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:22.900> something<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:23.470> we've<00:01:23.590> art

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
then go to something that we've art

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.340 
then go to something that we've art
again<00:01:23.920> before<00:01:24.160> I<00:01:24.670> was<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.060> discovery<00:01:25.420> itself<00:01:26.110> at

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
again before I was a discovery itself at

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.780 
again before I was a discovery itself at
2001<00:01:27.570> Cortez<00:01:28.570> mission<00:01:29.020> on<00:01:29.530> I<00:01:29.800> think<00:01:30.580> I<00:01:30.640> was

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
2001 Cortez mission on I think I was

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.520 
2001 Cortez mission on I think I was
like<00:01:31.120> the<00:01:31.360> first<00:01:31.510> time<00:01:31.630> I<00:01:31.810> served<00:01:32.260> in<00:01:32.470> the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
like the first time I served in the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.870 
like the first time I served in the
middle<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.800> ocean<00:01:33.220> that<00:01:33.370> was<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.580> first<00:01:33.760> time

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
middle the ocean that was the first time

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.070 
middle the ocean that was the first time
I'd<00:01:34.260> gone<00:01:35.260> that<00:01:35.590> fast<00:01:35.800> on<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.160> wave<00:01:36.430> or<00:01:37.240> so<00:01:37.930> many

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
I'd gone that fast on a wave or so many

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.560 
I'd gone that fast on a wave or so many
unknowns<00:01:38.260> with<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:38.920> you're<00:01:39.520> on<00:01:39.670> complete

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
unknowns with that you're on complete

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.760 
unknowns with that you're on complete
alert<00:01:41.070> very<00:01:42.070> very<00:01:42.550> aware<00:01:43.050> and<00:01:44.050> it's<00:01:44.290> based<00:01:44.560> out

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
alert very very aware and it's based out

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.760 
alert very very aware and it's based out
of<00:01:44.800> fear<00:01:45.190> and<00:01:45.640> so<00:01:45.970> you<00:01:46.240> know<00:01:46.270> if<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:46.720> don't<00:01:46.900> die

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.160 

discovering<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.909> new<00:01:53.939> wave<00:01:54.359> actually<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.899> would

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
discovering a new wave actually I would

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.050 
discovering a new wave actually I would
like<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.350> say<00:01:55.679> yes<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.219> 95<00:01:57.030> me<00:01:57.840> r<00:01:58.439> India's<00:01:59.340> David

know one of those DreamTrips it was
probably<00:02:09.479> four<00:02:09.750> or<00:02:09.780> five<00:02:10.019> different<00:02:10.170> ways

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
probably four or five different ways

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.830 
probably four or five different ways
that<00:02:10.739> we<00:02:10.830> serve<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.879> had<00:02:12.120> never<00:02:12.360> really<00:02:12.720> even

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
that we serve that had never really even

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.530 
that we serve that had never really even
been<00:02:13.080> surfed<00:02:13.349> before<00:02:13.500> we<00:02:14.459> named<00:02:14.730> burger<00:02:15.330> world

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
been surfed before we named burger world

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.890 
been surfed before we named burger world
and<00:02:16.849> there<00:02:17.849> was<00:02:17.940> another<00:02:18.180> place<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.810> we

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
and there was another place that we

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.360 
and there was another place that we
named<00:02:19.170> it's<00:02:19.349> beautiful<00:02:19.890> as<00:02:19.980> I've<00:02:20.099> never

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
named it's beautiful as I've never

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.940 
named it's beautiful as I've never
actually<00:02:20.670> seen<00:02:20.879> again<00:02:24.620> Huntington<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.769> could

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
actually seen again Huntington you could

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.410 
actually seen again Huntington you could
load<00:02:26.190> up<00:02:26.220> your<00:02:26.400> board<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:26.970> go<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.239> beach

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
load up your board and go to the beach

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.930 
load up your board and go to the beach
and<00:02:27.660> put<00:02:28.590> on<00:02:28.709> your<00:02:28.739> wet<00:02:28.980> suit<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.190> go<00:02:29.400> surf<00:02:29.670> and

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
and put on your wet suit and go surf and

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.900 
and put on your wet suit and go surf and
that's<00:02:30.390> why<00:02:30.599> it's<00:02:30.780> crowded<00:02:31.019> you<00:02:31.739> go<00:02:31.950> travel<00:02:32.790> on

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
that's why it's crowded you go travel on

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.660 
that's why it's crowded you go travel on
a<00:02:32.940> plane<00:02:33.299> where<00:02:33.690> no<00:02:33.930> crowds<00:02:34.410> are<00:02:34.709> you're<00:02:35.519> going

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
a plane where no crowds are you're going

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.520 
a plane where no crowds are you're going
