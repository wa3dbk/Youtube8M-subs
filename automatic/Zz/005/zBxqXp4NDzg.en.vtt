00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
bag by the handles I like to put the

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.150 
bag by the handles I like to put the
strap<00:04:08.060> over<00:04:08.269> my<00:04:08.540> shoulder<00:04:09.019> because<00:04:09.260> your

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
strap over my shoulder because your

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.949 
strap over my shoulder because your
hands<00:04:10.430> are<00:04:10.519> always<00:04:10.700> full<00:04:11.299> when<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:11.810> have

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
hands are always full when you have

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.050 
hands are always full when you have
babies<00:04:12.350> so<00:04:12.380> it's<00:04:12.650> nice<00:04:12.860> to<00:04:13.010> have<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.850> long

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
babies so it's nice to have the long

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.670 
babies so it's nice to have the long
strap<00:04:14.570> as<00:04:15.380> well<00:04:16.269> but<00:04:17.269> later<00:04:17.930> when<00:04:18.289> the<00:04:18.470> kids

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680
