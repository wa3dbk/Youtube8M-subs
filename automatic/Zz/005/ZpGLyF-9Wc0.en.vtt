to cardiac disease whether in this case
it<00:02:01.770> was<00:02:01.829> due<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.189> low<00:02:02.310> heart<00:02:02.579> rate<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.939> can

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
it was due to a low heart rate it can

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.789 
it was due to a low heart rate it can
also<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.420> due<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.990> congestive<00:02:04.500> heart<00:02:04.560> failure

or a poor pump the heart may not be
pumping<00:02:08.160> as<00:02:08.280> normally<00:02:09.119> as<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.330> should<00:02:09.539> so

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
pumping as normally as it should so

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.700 
pumping as normally as it should so
Scotty<00:02:10.560> fainted<00:02:11.220> and

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
Scotty fainted and

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.160 
Scotty fainted and
his<00:02:12.310> family<00:02:12.700> veterinarian<00:02:13.240> diagnosed<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.840> very

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
his family veterinarian diagnosed a very

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.350 
his family veterinarian diagnosed a very
low<00:02:14.350> heart<00:02:14.590> rate<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.980> abnormal<00:02:15.640> rhythm<00:02:15.910> right

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
low heart rate and abnormal rhythm right

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.480 
low heart rate and abnormal rhythm right
he<00:02:16.570> presented<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.350> our<00:02:17.380> emergency<00:02:17.920> services

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
he presented to our emergency services

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.050 
he presented to our emergency services
and<00:02:18.730> he<00:02:18.820> fainted<00:02:19.000> more<00:02:19.900> Wow<00:02:20.770> in<00:02:21.160> our<00:02:21.310> hospital

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
and he fainted more Wow in our hospital

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.240 
and he fainted more Wow in our hospital
and<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:22.840> we<00:02:22.990> did<00:02:23.290> some<00:02:23.350> basic<00:02:23.860> diagnostic

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
and so we did some basic diagnostic

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.820 
and so we did some basic diagnostic
tests<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.940> day<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.480> we<00:02:26.170> actually<00:02:26.380> implanted

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
tests that day and we actually implanted

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.280 
tests that day and we actually implanted
a<00:02:27.100> pacemaker<00:02:27.430> later<00:02:27.970> on<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.270> day<00:02:28.450> hon'ble<00:02:29.140> so

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
a pacemaker later on that day hon'ble so

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.550 
a pacemaker later on that day hon'ble so
it's<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.770> extremely<00:02:30.550> rewarding<00:02:30.910> surgery<00:02:31.840> it's

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
it's a extremely rewarding surgery it's

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.260 
it's a extremely rewarding surgery it's
minimally<00:02:33.070> invasive<00:02:33.580> we<00:02:33.730> don't<00:02:33.940> have<00:02:34.150> to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
minimally invasive we don't have to

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.570 
minimally invasive we don't have to
enter<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.660> chest<00:02:34.930> or<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.350> heart<00:02:35.560> directly<00:02:36.400> I

can implant the pacemaker into his heart

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.160 
can implant the pacemaker into his heart
it's<00:02:45.460> not<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.820> very<00:02:46.090> long<00:02:46.270> procedure<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:46.960> as

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
it's not a very long procedure and as

it's not a very long procedure and as
soon<00:02:47.650> as<00:02:47.800> he's<00:02:47.950> awake<00:02:48.220> from<00:02:48.370> anesthesia<00:02:48.760> is<00:02:49.000> a

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
soon as he's awake from anesthesia is a

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.430 
soon as he's awake from anesthesia is a
higher<00:02:49.270> heart<00:02:49.540> rate<00:02:49.690> he<00:02:49.840> feels<00:02:50.050> much<00:02:50.230> better

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
higher heart rate he feels much better

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.650 
higher heart rate he feels much better
he's<00:02:50.740> no<00:02:50.890> longer<00:02:51.040> fainting<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:51.820> he<00:02:52.150> has<00:02:52.330> good

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
he's no longer fainting and he has good

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.440 
he's no longer fainting and he has good
blood<00:02:53.170> flow<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.890> be<00:02:54.550> able<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.940> walk<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.330> play

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.840 
blood flow to be able to walk and play
and<00:02:55.720> be<00:02:56.080> his<00:02:56.200> normal<00:02:56.530> self<00:02:56.700> unbelievable<00:02:57.700> now

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
and be his normal self unbelievable now

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.030 
and be his normal self unbelievable now
you<00:02:57.910> have<00:02:58.450> brought<00:02:58.630> an<00:02:58.810> example<00:02:59.320> of<00:02:59.410> an<00:02:59.530> acre

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
you have brought an example of an acre

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.230 
you have brought an example of an acre
so<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:01.240> is<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.420> similar<00:03:02.140> setup<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.740> what

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
so this is a similar setup to what

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.660 
so this is a similar setup to what
Scotty<00:03:04.240> has<00:03:04.540> this<00:03:04.810> is<00:03:05.020> an<00:03:05.140> actual<00:03:05.670> pacemaker

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
Scotty has this is an actual pacemaker

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.020 
Scotty has this is an actual pacemaker
generator<00:03:07.270> and<00:03:07.900> it's<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.560> computer<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.190> it's

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
generator and it's a computer and it's

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.940 
generator and it's a computer and it's
identical<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:10.750> what's<00:03:11.020> implanted<00:03:11.530> in<00:03:11.650> human

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
identical to what's implanted in human

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.800 
identical to what's implanted in human
beings<00:03:12.250> all<00:03:12.490> of<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.850> Pacemakers<00:03:13.450> that<00:03:13.660> we

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
beings all of the Pacemakers that we

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.800 
beings all of the Pacemakers that we
implant<00:03:14.170> are<00:03:14.380> brand<00:03:14.620> new<00:03:14.830> but<00:03:15.400> they<00:03:15.550> are

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
implant are brand new but they are

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.060 
implant are brand new but they are
produced<00:03:16.810> for<00:03:16.960> humans<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:17.440> this<00:03:17.620> actually

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
produced for humans so this actually

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.480 
produced for humans so this actually
connects<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:20.140> lead<00:03:20.380> and<00:03:20.650> this<00:03:21.190> is<00:03:21.340> the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
connects to the lead and this is the

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.120 
connects to the lead and this is the
portion<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:21.940> goes<00:03:22.360> into<00:03:22.600> his<00:03:22.840> heart<00:03:23.080> so<00:03:23.620> this

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
portion that goes into his heart so this

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.100 
portion that goes into his heart so this
gets<00:03:24.370> fed<00:03:24.670> down<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.180> jugular<00:03:25.570> vein<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:25.900> into

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
gets fed down the jugular vein and into

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.360 
gets fed down the jugular vein and into
his<00:03:26.200> heart<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.620> this<00:03:26.800> will<00:03:27.010> then<00:03:27.130> make

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
his heart and this will then make

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.390 
his heart and this will then make
contact<00:03:27.910> with<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.150> muscle<00:03:28.840> itself<00:03:28.960> I<00:03:29.470> can

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
contact with the muscle itself I can

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.730 
contact with the muscle itself I can
screw<00:03:30.880> in<00:03:31.090> this<00:03:31.300> piece<00:03:31.600> into<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.290> computer

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
screw in this piece into the computer

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.720 
screw in this piece into the computer
and<00:03:33.610> from<00:03:34.480> here<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:35.020> can<00:03:35.350> now<00:03:35.740> use<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.400> remote

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
and from here I can now use a remote

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.100 
and from here I can now use a remote
control<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.300> basically<00:03:37.570> talk<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:38.020> the

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
control and basically talk to the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.990
