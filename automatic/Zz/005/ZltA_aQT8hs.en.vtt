not one of my favorite textures I did

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.759 
not one of my favorite textures I did
find<00:00:51.010> it<00:00:51.159> a<00:00:51.280> little<00:00:51.600> challenging<00:00:52.600> to<00:00:52.809> till<00:00:53.739> the

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
find it a little challenging to till the

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.160 
find it a little challenging to till the
land<00:00:53.859> is<00:00:54.280> a<00:00:54.429> little<00:00:54.760> bit<00:00:54.940> because<00:00:55.149> it's<00:00:55.749> more

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
land is a little bit because it's more

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.049 
land is a little bit because it's more
of<00:00:56.319> a<00:00:58.829> guess<00:00:59.829> and<00:00:59.979> the<00:01:00.069> curly<00:01:00.460> state<00:01:00.699> is<00:01:00.850> more

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
of a guess and the curly state is more

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.860 
of a guess and the curly state is more
of<00:01:01.179> a<00:01:01.300> high<00:01:01.510> Lester<00:01:01.809> um<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.760> meet<00:01:03.940> no<00:01:04.150> medium<00:01:04.629> to

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
of a high Lester um to meet no medium to

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.389 
of a high Lester um to meet no medium to
high<00:01:05.050> luster<00:01:05.350> and<00:01:06.250> when<00:01:07.030> it's<00:01:07.240> dry<00:01:07.869> it<00:01:08.399> can

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
high luster and when it's dry it can

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:19.859 
high luster and when it's dry it can
look<00:01:09.549> very<00:01:11.130> dry<00:01:12.130> so<00:01:13.350> um<00:01:17.909> also<00:01:18.909> someone<00:01:19.450> asks<00:01:19.840> me

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
look very dry so um also someone asks me

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.510 
look very dry so um also someone asks me
about<00:01:21.630> how<00:01:22.630> my<00:01:22.930> hair<00:01:23.259> doesn't<00:01:23.619> look<00:01:23.890> like<00:01:24.250> peak

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
about how my hair doesn't look like peak

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.149 
about how my hair doesn't look like peak
meals<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.240> I<00:01:25.990> didn't<00:01:26.710> know<00:01:26.799> what<00:01:26.920> they<00:01:27.039> were

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
meals and I didn't know what they were

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.859 
meals and I didn't know what they were
saying<00:01:27.430> at<00:01:27.549> first<00:01:27.729> but<00:01:27.969> actually<00:01:28.420> I<00:01:28.450> looked

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
saying at first but actually I looked

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.889 
saying at first but actually I looked
and<00:01:29.079> I<00:01:29.229> checked<00:01:29.619> out<00:01:29.829> Pete<00:01:30.159> Mills<00:01:30.490> video<00:01:31.329> again

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
and I checked out Pete Mills video again

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.010 
and I checked out Pete Mills video again
and<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:33.430> definitely<00:01:33.729> did<00:01:34.180> not<00:01:34.210> a<00:01:34.600> little<00:01:34.840> tight

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
and it definitely did not a little tight

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.090 
and it definitely did not a little tight
pics<00:01:35.350> in<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.619> peak<00:01:36.130> mills<00:01:36.520> here<00:01:37.060> so<00:01:37.840> her<00:01:38.829> hair

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
pics in the peak mills here so her hair

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.450 
pics in the peak mills here so her hair
was<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.399> more<00:01:39.729> tighter<00:01:40.409> curl<00:01:41.409> their<00:01:41.890> minds<00:01:42.100> kind

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
was a more tighter curl their minds kind

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.279 
was a more tighter curl their minds kind
of<00:01:42.549> like<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.670> more<00:01:42.939> of<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.060> spiral<00:01:43.390> this<00:01:44.109> is

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
of like a more of a spiral this is

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.039 
of like a more of a spiral this is
definitely<00:01:44.890> more<00:01:45.399> of<00:01:45.460> a<00:01:45.640> wave<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:46.869> when<00:01:47.020> I

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
definitely more of a wave and so when I

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.020 
definitely more of a wave and so when I
purchases<00:01:47.770> here<00:01:48.189> i<00:01:48.369> was<00:01:48.969> looking<00:01:49.329> to<00:01:49.359> get<00:01:49.719> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
purchases here i was looking to get the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.029 
purchases here i was looking to get the
type<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.060> pattern<00:01:52.420> that<00:01:52.780> peakmill<00:01:53.380> had

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
type of pattern that peakmill had

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.840 
type of pattern that peakmill had
although<00:01:54.609> i<00:01:55.240> know<00:01:55.359> that<00:01:56.159> Milton<00:01:57.159> donors<00:01:57.579> are

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
although i know that Milton donors are

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.480 
although i know that Milton donors are
saying<00:01:58.270> no<00:01:58.869> donors<00:01:59.259> aren't<00:01:59.469> st.<00:01:59.710> at<00:01:59.890> all<00:02:00.130> I

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
saying no donors aren't st. at all I

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.950 
saying no donors aren't st. at all I
still<00:02:01.359> expected<00:02:02.079> to<00:02:02.109> get<00:02:02.380> that<00:02:02.649> type<00:02:02.920> of<00:02:03.960> curl

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
still expected to get that type of curl

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.370 
still expected to get that type of curl
pattern<00:02:05.409> so<00:02:06.100> ya<00:02:06.549> microcon

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
pattern so ya microcon

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.880 
pattern so ya microcon
it<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.649> definitely<00:02:08.069> not<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.700> peak<00:02:08.970> Mills<00:02:09.270> um

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
it is definitely not like peak Mills um

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.740 
it is definitely not like peak Mills um
her<00:02:10.890> hair<00:02:11.130> looks<00:02:11.370> very<00:02:11.880> very<00:02:12.000> good<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.599> her

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
her hair looks very very good in her

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.729 
her hair looks very very good in her
video<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.590> when<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.160> looked<00:02:14.459> at<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:15.750> comparison

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
video and when I looked at a comparison

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.300 
video and when I looked at a comparison
to<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.069> hair<00:02:17.599> looks<00:02:18.599> totally<00:02:19.200> different<00:02:19.310> and

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
to this hair looks totally different and

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.140 
to this hair looks totally different and
I<00:02:20.760> know<00:02:20.849> she<00:02:21.000> got<00:02:21.300> more<00:02:21.630> bundles<00:02:21.930> but<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.280> don't

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
I know she got more bundles but I don't

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.820 
I know she got more bundles but I don't
think<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.569> this<00:02:24.870> hair<00:02:25.200> should<00:02:25.590> look<00:02:25.800> like

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
think that this hair should look like

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.820 
think that this hair should look like
this<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.900> if<00:02:28.050> you're<00:02:28.140> going<00:02:28.349> on<00:02:28.530> peakmill

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
this so if you're going on peakmill

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.070 
but also when it is dry I can see what
peakmill<00:02:55.140> was<00:02:55.410> talking<00:02:55.739> about<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.130> how<00:02:57.080> is

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
peakmill was talking about and how is

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.339 
peakmill was talking about and how is
denser<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:59.640> hair<00:02:59.819> is<00:02:59.940> denser<00:03:00.360> at<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:00.720> top<00:03:00.989> of

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
denser the hair is denser at the top of

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.009 
denser the hair is denser at the top of
the<00:03:02.010> west<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.430> towards<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.060> end<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.630> gets<00:03:03.810> the

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
the west and towards the end it gets the

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.390 
the west and towards the end it gets the
a<00:03:04.049> very<00:03:04.440> thing<00:03:04.769> very<00:03:05.610> very<00:03:06.269> soon<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:08.160> I

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
a very thing very very soon so and I

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.569 
a very thing very very soon so and I
thought<00:03:08.760> why<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.569> because<00:03:09.950> they<00:03:10.950> packed<00:03:11.340> the

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
thought why is because they packed the

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.380 
thought why is because they packed the
hair<00:03:11.940> shorter<00:03:12.660> strands<00:03:13.079> of<00:03:13.380> hair<00:03:13.549> at<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:15.180> top

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
hair shorter strands of hair at the top

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.080 
hair shorter strands of hair at the top
of<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.690> last<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.620> it's<00:03:16.829> more<00:03:17.400> hair<00:03:17.700> at<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.880> top

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
of the last so it's more hair at the top

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.000 
of the last so it's more hair at the top
of<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.299> web<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.750> then<00:03:18.989> there<00:03:19.230> may<00:03:19.440> be<00:03:19.470> one

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
of the web and then there may be one

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.090 
of the web and then there may be one
long<00:03:20.310> strand<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:21.239> other<00:03:21.959> hair<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.590> longer

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
long strand of other hair that is longer

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.849 
long strand of other hair that is longer
than<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:23.639> it<00:03:23.970> makes<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.450> seem<00:03:24.720> like<00:03:25.109> it's

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
than that so it makes it seem like it's

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.660 
than that so it makes it seem like it's
all<00:03:26.190> one<00:03:26.730> full<00:03:27.180> track<00:03:27.989> but<00:03:28.739> but<00:03:29.069> really<00:03:29.459> it's

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
all one full track but but really it's

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.440 
all one full track but but really it's
not<00:03:29.940> it's<00:03:30.269> actually<00:03:31.340> Paris<00:03:32.340> packed<00:03:32.730> at<00:03:33.030> the

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
not it's actually Paris packed at the

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.110 
not it's actually Paris packed at the
top<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.079> get<00:03:34.230> less<00:03:34.470> hair<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:35.639> get<00:03:35.760> more<00:03:36.000> in

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
top so you get less hair you get more in

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.550 
top so you get less hair you get more in
there<00:03:36.269> at<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.420> top<00:03:36.600> it's<00:03:36.870> back<00:03:37.139> to<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.319> top

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
there at the top it's back to the top

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.039 
there at the top it's back to the top
and<00:03:37.769> less<00:03:38.609> hair<00:03:38.880> as<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.329> go<00:03:39.480> down<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.870> the

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
and less hair as you go down to the

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.949 
and less hair as you go down to the
bottom<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.889> actually<00:03:41.310> is<00:03:41.639> less<00:03:42.239> hair<00:03:42.630> on

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
bottom so it actually is less hair on

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.559 
bottom so it actually is less hair on
there<00:03:43.560> i<00:03:43.889> noticed<00:03:44.430> that<00:03:44.549> because<00:03:45.090> when<00:03:45.239> i<00:03:45.299> pull

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
there i noticed that because when i pull

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.170 
there i noticed that because when i pull
my<00:03:45.600> hair<00:03:46.019> up<00:03:46.230> into<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.530> ponytail<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:47.400> noticed

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
my hair up into a ponytail I noticed

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.440 
my hair up into a ponytail I noticed
that<00:03:48.269> hair<00:03:48.959> short<00:03:49.709> pieces<00:03:49.920> of<00:03:50.160> hair<00:03:50.519> was

sticking<00:03:51.870> out<00:03:52.109> and<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.410> thought<00:03:52.650> that<00:03:52.709> maybe

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
sticking out and I thought that maybe

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.940 
sticking out and I thought that maybe
you<00:03:53.819> know<00:03:53.850> I<00:03:53.970> cut<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.569> I<00:03:54.780> realized<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.739> they
