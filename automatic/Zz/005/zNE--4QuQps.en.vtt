on this because the fact is a lot of us

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.280 
on this because the fact is a lot of us
lost<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.210> first<00:00:39.420> time<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:39.840> played<00:00:40.020> enemy

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
lost the first time that we played enemy

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.260 
lost the first time that we played enemy
Unknown<00:00:40.559> an<00:00:40.710> enemy<00:00:41.010> within<00:00:41.160> including<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
Unknown an enemy within including the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.299 
Unknown an enemy within including the
developers<00:00:42.750> ourselves<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:43.800> we<00:00:43.950> thought<00:00:44.160> it

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
developers ourselves so we thought it

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.430 
developers ourselves so we thought it
was<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> very<00:00:44.640> cool<00:00:44.910> premise<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.420> say<00:00:45.570> okay<00:00:45.899> what

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
was a very cool premise to say okay what

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.770 
was a very cool premise to say okay what
if<00:00:46.559> XCOM<00:00:46.950> did<00:00:47.190> lose<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.969> first<00:00:48.149> third<00:00:48.629> of

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
if XCOM did lose in the first third of

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.299 
if XCOM did lose in the first third of
the<00:00:48.899> game<00:00:48.930> approximately<00:00:49.860> where<00:00:50.010> they<00:00:50.100> didn't

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the game approximately where they didn't

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.830 
the game approximately where they didn't
even<00:00:50.460> get<00:00:50.579> past<00:00:50.700> conventional<00:00:51.090> weapons<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
even get past conventional weapons and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.200 
even get past conventional weapons and
XCOM<00:00:52.559> had<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.860> go<00:00:52.949> underground<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.820> we

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
XCOM had to go underground and we

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.369 
XCOM had to go underground and we
thought<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.420> was<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:54.780> really<00:00:55.260> cool

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
thought that was a really really cool

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.350 
thought that was a really really cool
stage<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> odds<00:00:56.550> stacked<00:00:56.730> against

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
stage to have the odds stacked against

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.000 
stage to have the odds stacked against
you<00:00:57.449> even<00:00:57.570> more<00:00:57.960> 20<00:00:58.440> years<00:00:58.649> into<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> future

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
you even more 20 years into the future

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.610 
you even more 20 years into the future
with<00:00:59.609> XCOM<00:01:00.000> 2<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.750> say<00:01:00.930> you're<00:01:01.199> now<00:01:01.350> tasked

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
with XCOM 2 to say you're now tasked

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.529 
with XCOM 2 to say you're now tasked
with<00:01:02.219> not<00:01:02.399> only<00:01:02.430> bringing<00:01:02.850> back<00:01:03.120> XCOM

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
with not only bringing back XCOM

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.640 
with not only bringing back XCOM
together<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.110> building<00:01:04.439> an<00:01:04.530> entire

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
together but building an entire

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.530 
together but building an entire
resistance<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.519> get<00:01:05.640> those<00:01:05.790> resources<00:01:06.150> back

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
resistance to get those resources back

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.170 
resistance to get those resources back
in<00:01:06.720> place<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.710> things<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.310> meld<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.939> and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
in place so things like meld and and

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.030 
in place so things like meld and and
mechs<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:10.080> lot<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> cool<00:01:10.560> stuff<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:10.799> did

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
mechs and a lot of the cool stuff we did

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.010 
mechs and a lot of the cool stuff we did
with<00:01:11.189> enemy<00:01:11.460> within<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:12.360> didn't<00:01:12.630> even<00:01:12.720> really

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
with enemy within we didn't even really

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.590 
with enemy within we didn't even really
get<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.650> an<00:01:14.159> enemy<00:01:14.549> Unknown<00:01:14.820> storyline<00:01:15.390> so

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
get to in an enemy Unknown storyline so

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.570 
get to in an enemy Unknown storyline so
it's<00:01:15.720> very<00:01:16.080> much<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.320> clean<00:01:16.650> slate<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.130> allows

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
it's very much a clean slate and allows

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.340 
it's very much a clean slate and allows
you<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.880> rebuild<00:01:18.299> an<00:01:18.509> organization<00:01:19.110> from<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
you to rebuild an organization from the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.430 
you to rebuild an organization from the
ground<00:01:19.530> up

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.610 

again<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:25.490> was<00:01:25.730> really<00:01:26.240> just<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:27.020> lot<00:01:27.230> of<00:01:27.260> talk

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
again it was really just a lot of talk

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.590 
again it was really just a lot of talk
and<00:01:27.650> community<00:01:28.310> feedback<00:01:28.460> that<00:01:28.940> we<00:01:29.030> got<00:01:29.180> sort

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
and community feedback that we got sort

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.900 
and community feedback that we got sort
of<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:30.500> whole<00:01:30.650> consequence<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:31.370> challenging

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
of the whole consequence and challenging

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.370 
of the whole consequence and challenging
with<00:01:32.030> enemy<00:01:32.300> Unknown<00:01:32.540> was<00:01:32.690> very<00:01:32.870> interesting

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
with enemy Unknown was very interesting

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.770 
with enemy Unknown was very interesting
to<00:01:33.620> us<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:33.980> we<00:01:34.010> we<00:01:34.610> came<00:01:35.120> up<00:01:35.150> with<00:01:35.360> I<00:01:35.390> premise

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
to us so we we came up with I premise

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.720 
to us so we we came up with I premise
ourselves<00:01:36.260> of<00:01:36.410> okay<00:01:36.860> what<00:01:37.040> happens<00:01:37.370> if<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.610> do

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
ourselves of okay what happens if you do

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.490 
ourselves of okay what happens if you do
lose<00:01:37.940> that's<00:01:38.300> a<00:01:38.390> world<00:01:38.570> where<00:01:38.750> X<00:01:38.870> comms<00:01:39.110> needed

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
lose that's a world where X comms needed

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.870 
lose that's a world where X comms needed
the<00:01:39.680> team<00:01:39.860> did<00:01:40.070> watch<00:01:40.250> things<00:01:40.490> like<00:01:40.610> Elysium

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
the team did watch things like Elysium

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.760 
the team did watch things like Elysium
Elysium<00:01:41.540> was<00:01:41.660> a<00:01:41.690> big<00:01:41.870> inspiration<00:01:42.050> for<00:01:42.650> some

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
Elysium was a big inspiration for some

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.290 
Elysium was a big inspiration for some
of<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:42.890> visual<00:01:43.190> elements<00:01:43.640> some<00:01:43.910> of<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.120> some

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
of the visual elements some of the some

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.520 
of the visual elements some of the some
of<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.450> weaponry<00:01:44.720> you'll<00:01:44.990> see<00:01:45.140> in<00:01:45.230> the<00:01:45.320> game

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
of the weaponry you'll see in the game

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.130
