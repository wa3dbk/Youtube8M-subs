00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
now in the acquisition phase let's get

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.960 
now in the acquisition phase let's get
imaging<00:02:26.380> which<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:26.650> what<00:02:26.800> we<00:02:26.920> like<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.100> do<00:02:27.370> this

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
imaging which is what we like to do this

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.570 
imaging which is what we like to do this
is<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.360> simple<00:02:28.660> in<00:02:29.410> this<00:02:29.650> phase<00:02:29.950> you're<00:02:30.520> going

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
is so simple in this phase you're going

is so simple in this phase you're going
to<00:02:30.730> automatically<00:02:31.210> go<00:02:31.420> down<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.930> very

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
to automatically go down to the very

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.390 
to automatically go down to the very
bottom<00:02:32.230> make<00:02:32.740> sure<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.040> take<00:02:33.220> your

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
bottom make sure that you take your

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.580 
bottom make sure that you take your
images<00:02:33.760> in<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:33.940> proper<00:02:34.540> catalog<00:02:35.170> we<00:02:35.320> now<00:02:35.410> have

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
doing this you can really get in a lot

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.340 
doing this you can really get in a lot
of<00:04:09.610> trouble<00:04:09.970> or<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.690> can<00:04:10.810> blow<00:04:10.989> apart<00:04:11.200> your

because you're taking too much material
away<00:04:14.350> but<00:04:15.100> this<00:04:15.220> is<00:04:15.370> a<00:04:15.400> good<00:04:15.549> way<00:04:15.670> to<00:04:15.730> clean<00:04:15.940> up

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060

we'll<00:04:20.010> go<00:04:20.190> over<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.370> different<00:04:20.699> video<00:04:20.880> on<00:04:21.150> how

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
we'll go over a different video on how

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.159 
we'll go over a different video on how
to<00:04:21.299> use<00:04:21.419> those<00:04:21.750> later<00:04:22.820> alright<00:04:23.820> so<00:04:24.600> a<00:04:24.630> red<00:04:24.960> line

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
to use those later alright so a red line

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.840 
to use those later alright so a red line
the<00:04:25.650> very<00:04:25.830> bottom<00:04:26.040> in<00:04:26.310> your<00:04:26.430> step<00:04:26.610> mean<00:04:26.760> you're

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
the very bottom in your step mean you're

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.390 
the very bottom in your step mean you're
going<00:04:26.970> to<00:04:27.030> indicate<00:04:27.360> a<00:04:27.540> mandatory<00:04:28.139> step<00:04:28.680> okay

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
going to indicate a mandatory step okay

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.250 
going to indicate a mandatory step okay
you<00:04:29.460> trimming<00:04:30.240> is<00:04:30.330> not<00:04:30.479> mandatory<00:04:30.720> but<00:04:31.080> we're

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
you trimming is not mandatory but we're

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.510 
you trimming is not mandatory but we're
just<00:04:31.290> going<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.530> show<00:04:31.680> you<00:04:31.740> how<00:04:31.889> to<00:04:32.010> do<00:04:32.130> it<00:04:32.160> here

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
just going to show you how to do it here

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.939 
just going to show you how to do it here
and<00:04:33.419> I<00:04:33.540> don't<00:04:33.720> really<00:04:33.930> trim<00:04:34.229> too<00:04:34.380> many<00:04:34.560> models

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
and I don't really trim too many models

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.860 
and I don't really trim too many models
to<00:04:35.040> be<00:04:35.160> honest<00:04:35.400> with<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:35.729> but<00:04:36.389> I<00:04:36.449> think<00:04:36.630> it's

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
to be honest with you but I think it's

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.909 
to be honest with you but I think it's
important<00:04:37.169> to<00:04:37.229> know<00:04:37.290> how<00:04:37.320> to<00:04:37.410> do<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.590> it's<00:04:37.740> just

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
important to know how to do it it's just

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.140 
important to know how to do it it's just
like<00:04:37.979> margining<00:04:38.400> double<00:04:38.669> click<00:04:38.820> to<00:04:38.940> start

fast double click on the ghost image
it's<00:04:52.949> going<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.160> then<00:04:53.310> correct<00:04:53.789> it<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.389> bring

it's going to then correct it and bring
that<00:04:54.660> proper<00:04:55.169> thing<00:04:55.350> up<00:04:55.530> it's<00:04:55.919> very<00:04:56.130> important

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
that proper thing up it's very important

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.250 
that proper thing up it's very important
to<00:04:56.820> trimming<00:04:57.330> models<00:04:57.720> to<00:04:57.810> make<00:04:57.960> sure<00:04:58.110> the

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
to trimming models to make sure the

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.439 
to trimming models to make sure the
ghost<00:04:58.440> image<00:04:58.740> is<00:04:58.860> gone<00:04:59.039> drawing<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.030> margin

we<00:05:00.600> got<00:05:00.720> great<00:05:00.930> enhancements<00:05:01.530> with

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
we got great enhancements with

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.080 
we got great enhancements with
margination<00:05:02.130> I<00:05:02.430> think<00:05:02.580> it's<00:05:02.699> even<00:05:02.820> more

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
margination I think it's even more

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.360 
margination I think it's even more
accurate<00:05:03.510> if<00:05:03.720> possible<00:05:04.289> than<00:05:04.410> before<00:05:04.560> you

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
accurate if possible than before you

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.029

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
you have manual and you have the high

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.110 
you have manual and you have the high
intensity<00:05:10.800> which<00:05:11.190> works<00:05:11.400> very<00:05:11.490> very<00:05:11.850> well

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.629
