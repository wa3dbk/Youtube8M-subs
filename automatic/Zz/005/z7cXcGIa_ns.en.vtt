00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the only thing I noticed was a few of

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.140 
the only thing I noticed was a few of
the<00:01:40.230> times<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.770> seems<00:01:40.980> like<00:01:41.190> he<00:01:41.820> almost<00:01:41.910> lost

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the times it seems like he almost lost

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.670 
the times it seems like he almost lost
the<00:01:42.360> puck<00:01:42.540> five<00:01:42.810> hole<00:01:43.050> but<00:01:43.260> he<00:01:43.320> was<00:01:43.440> able<00:01:43.560> to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the puck five hole but he was able to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.430 
the puck five hole but he was able to
squeeze<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
squeeze it the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.260 
squeeze it the
obviously<00:01:46.220> squeezing<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.670> cheeks<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.120> maybe

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
obviously squeezing the cheeks and maybe

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.230 
obviously squeezing the cheeks and maybe
save<00:01:47.570> but<00:01:48.530> like<00:01:49.040> I<00:01:49.160> said<00:01:49.190> sometimes<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:50.090> was

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
save but like I said sometimes it was

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.550 
save but like I said sometimes it was
like<00:01:51.280> then<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.550> didn't<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.410> obviously<00:01:54.410> he

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
like then it didn't so obviously he

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.380 
like then it didn't so obviously he
stopped<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:54.950> pox<00:01:55.190> but<00:01:55.460> yeah<00:01:55.730> for<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.210> most

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
stopped the pox but yeah for the most

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.630 
stopped the pox but yeah for the most
part<00:01:56.630> other<00:01:57.170> than<00:01:57.440> that<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:58.010> only<00:01:58.130> really

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
part other than that the only really

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.400 
part other than that the only really
probable<00:01:59.030> I<00:01:59.090> really<00:01:59.390> saw<00:01:59.600> was<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.990> five-hole

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
probable I really saw was the five-hole

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.070 
probable I really saw was the five-hole
just<00:02:00.740> trying<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.430> squeeze<00:02:01.790> it<00:02:01.970> in<00:02:02.120> but<00:02:02.360> he<00:02:02.930> did

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
just trying to squeeze it in but he did

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.170 
just trying to squeeze it in but he did
stop<00:02:03.380> them<00:02:03.620> you<00:02:04.190> know<00:02:04.340> but<00:02:04.820> other<00:02:04.970> than<00:02:05.090> that

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
stop them you know but other than that

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.410 
stop them you know but other than that

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
for the most part the only thing I

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.680 
for the most part the only thing I
noticed<00:03:10.160> was<00:03:10.250> even<00:03:10.790> though<00:03:10.910> he's<00:03:11.150> got<00:03:11.180> pretty

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
noticed was even though he's got pretty

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.580 
noticed was even though he's got pretty
high<00:03:12.080> skating<00:03:13.209> average<00:03:14.209> is<00:03:14.360> he<00:03:15.350> was<00:03:15.440> that<00:03:15.560> I

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
high skating average is he was that I

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.810 
high skating average is he was that I
found<00:03:15.860> him<00:03:15.980> he<00:03:16.130> was<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.280> little<00:03:16.489> bit<00:03:16.580> slow

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
found him he was a little bit slow

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.479 
found him he was a little bit slow
honestly<00:03:17.540> like<00:03:18.470> I<00:03:18.560> said<00:03:18.739> his<00:03:18.830> handling<00:03:19.220> his

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
honestly like I said his handling his

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.190 
honestly like I said his handling his
passing<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:19.940> stuff<00:03:20.180> was<00:03:20.330> really<00:03:20.480> good<00:03:20.720> but<00:03:20.930> I

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
passing and stuff was really good but I

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.070 
passing and stuff was really good but I
found<00:03:21.650> him<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.800> little<00:03:22.010> bit<00:03:22.100> slow<00:03:22.370> personally

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
found him a little bit slow personally

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.830 
found him a little bit slow personally
but<00:03:24.080> again<00:03:24.560> he<00:03:24.800> still<00:03:25.100> really<00:03:25.400> saw<00:03:25.640> like<00:03:25.970> he

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
but again he still really saw like he

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.810 
but again he still really saw like he
could<00:03:27.080> technically<00:03:27.590> be<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:28.070> first-line

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
could technically be a first-line

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.090 
could technically be a first-line
centreman<00:03:29.600> if<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:30.290> got<00:03:30.440> if<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.680> if<00:03:31.010> you

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
centreman if you got if you if you

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.530 
centreman if you got if you if you
really<00:03:31.370> needed<00:03:31.550> it<00:03:31.760> on<00:03:31.880> a<00:03:31.910> Hutt<00:03:32.150> team<00:03:32.360> like

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
really needed it on a Hutt team like

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.650 
really needed it on a Hutt team like
he's<00:03:32.930> pretty<00:03:33.260> solid<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:34.910> yell<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.510> only

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
he's pretty solid and yell the only

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.900 
he's pretty solid and yell the only
other<00:03:35.720> thing<00:03:35.930> I<00:03:36.230> noticed<00:03:36.590> was<00:03:37.160> one<00:03:37.580> time<00:03:37.760> he

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
other thing I noticed was one time he

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.210 
other thing I noticed was one time he
just<00:03:38.120> like<00:03:38.269> missed<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.840> pass<00:03:39.230> which<00:03:39.739> didn't

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
just like missed a pass which didn't

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.250 
just like missed a pass which didn't
really<00:03:40.250> make<00:03:40.489> any<00:03:40.550> sense<00:03:40.940> but<00:03:41.180> again<00:03:42.050> that

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
really make any sense but again that

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.259 
really make any sense but again that
could<00:03:42.410> just<00:03:42.620> be<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:43.130> know<00:03:43.250> one-off<00:03:43.790> kind<00:03:44.150> of

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
could just be you know one-off kind of

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:44.720 
could just be you know one-off kind of
thing
