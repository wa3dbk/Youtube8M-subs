 It is a system of the head of the research center representative of the movement 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:17.150

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:20.550
 Here are some tips on how to get your feet off without catching them 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:24.810
 This time rather than practicing while walking 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.420
 Residence yearly income with a stance standing for a certain Pooh 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.420
 We will explain the say 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.730
 Let's buy a little 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:40.990
 We will explain this as paralysis ger as the right-hand Nam hear 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:45.570
 The thing is firmly support Toka to win the spray time to practice in the future 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:49.150
 Please support it by the left wording. Please do it by safety first. 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.880
 You are one of the legs of this side 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:56.770
 Any time to be Daso sell it is when walking seems disadvantageous 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.470
 Do you feel or do you understand Bonume ? 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.850
 Surely everyone E 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.570
 Because my feet are so heavy 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.740
 I'll lift it at once 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.920
 Because the knee does not bend 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:13.770
 Bump outside 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.870
 Since the last finger tip takes with the moon, it descends like a drag just after a while 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.550
 Or gone 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.320
 Will not you Many people say 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.450
 These small things are 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.060
 If there is no way because many people there is a paralysis 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:33.190
 There may be many who think in such a way 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:36.409
 However, in the rehabilitation of bones of movement now that I can not swing back mark 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:43.130
 And it does not mean that there is no so-called color way 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:44.070
 The brain thinks that it shakes well and I do not understand how to use the leg well 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.190
 I will 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:53.350
 So if we found a called wonder if one by one correct square one it 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:58.270
 Things like getting down easier than I thought 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.390
 We will explain one Then a little glowing to say from that point 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.390
 Let's 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:11.350
 This time point is center of gravity movement when standing 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.350
 When we try to put out foot of the paralysis side 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.120
 And pulling out a but try a little stopped immediately before the issue or figure at this time 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.020
 Let's go 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.040
 I've been doing song it from the paralysis is 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:34.700
 I wonder if it's about to come out, I think it's about to come out 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.600
 Please carefully check the condition of your feet at that time . 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.670
 It is a kit 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.960
 Toka or not knee waist or a have or great legs taut Cikarang 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.930
 I think so 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:52.180
 After Please check the right and left the other one of the points the weight of the consuming condition 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:57.700
 How about when you try to put your feet out 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.410
 It is a kit paralysis would not it remain, but say not buy is still the Tteyuu None 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.569
 Or 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.980
 It is the point that this entered 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.990
 The correct way to walk 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.880
 Mr. Horner 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.490
 Before you begin to get off almost around window 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.940
 The better of the foot 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:19.860
 I'm using my weight on the other leg 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.060
 If you decide to put this out, it's about to float almost here by putting it firmly on this foot 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.740
 It is not 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.910
 It is 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:30.069
 So we put out by far the Abburanto force 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:35.409
 If it easily from this example as in the sense now says 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:41.200
 Really just before the Serve many it is of those who are have a morning paralysis 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:43.210
 If you have to be hard before the time you put out, there is actually no weight remaining in Hiller 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.340
 There are many things 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:50.790
 It is often the case that the remaining power also remains 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.980
 I 'm stuck because I'm going to leave it as it is 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.150
 I can lift it 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.490
 I'm going to be jealous 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.720
 So one point is 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:06.960
 If your side legs 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:09.890
 To put the weight on to say how the leg until firm and lightly 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.890
 Let's start today 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.019
 It took the first standing position Let's doing facing sideways It is a practice slowly 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.019
 You will receive 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:25.450
 It's the paralysis over the Gu' and weight towards good on it that Tteyuu I wish what I made lightly 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.850
 Please check firmly 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.840
 so 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:35.760
 Feet lighter also can see that say I wish that can relax 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:40.800
 It does not take N blur without lifting 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:45.340
 At this time, when it would catapult out Okibondo a lot or lift the transient referred to in the usual habit 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:49.270
 Since the real is not accustomed does not work 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.650
 You may not even get damage to the flower location 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:57.980
 With a small stride 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:05:00.280
 When the firm is illegal to put in paralysis Let's start from the fact that I'll to make sure is painful 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.120
 I'm library 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.230
 How about that 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:09.310
 Those who said if I did go well well 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:13.910
 Out and Buran from down from if 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.550
 How is it compared to the condition of the foot at that time ? 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:23.409
 More than the first 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:28.119
 It may become soft and knee hair or have decreased feel like work and the power of the knee Toka stars take 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:29.969
 Eva, such as Dari done without Furimawase from the fact that from the outside 

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:35.699
 It is a great success 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:40.590
 This is also difficult to do while walking at first, so it's hard to get used to it so the club 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:43.070
 Swinging out and back in a standing posture 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:49.840
 such as learn and put back 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:49.840
 I think that I can do in that but please use this has been accustomed at a slow walk from the form 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:06:00.630
 We will introduce the because comfortably begin to rain Tips for the Nikkawa pear in the standing this time was attitude 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:04.680
 Of course when you can not practice while practicing alone 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:08.970
 By adding a little thing today and giving me a little advice 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:13.540
 There are a lot of things that go well with cucumber It's a knack 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:16.410
 Please feel free to consult if there is anything that does not go well 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.410
 Well today is over
