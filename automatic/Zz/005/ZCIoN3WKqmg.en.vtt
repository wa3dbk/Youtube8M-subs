00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 500 units of whips and a round of the first link 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.809
 most often the last matches went on 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:14.570
 cornering 10 but deferred fear 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.570
 Putiners open an account in this meeting 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.390
 over the shield 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.670
 alexander vine yes even this is peaceful 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.710
 pointed to Matyushev in principle from on 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:34.620
 place and I am now on the ice link Yuri 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.240
 Trumpeter 20 more but I would not be surprised if 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.760
 even now 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.340
 Anatoly Emelin will replace Alexander 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.840
 this air was not from the discharge 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.560
 of course there is a little bit 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.750
 closed and the visibility of alexander la zush 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.670
 but also at the moment of the throw 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.240
 he had to see her puck so 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:59.140
 in a tricky way 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:03.370
 further the bezel and mouth arch are birch and 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.660
 now counterattack exit one single throw 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.020
 on land 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:11.350
 with an uncomfortable hand threw Nikita filatov 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:16.860
 that the tire vine didn't exactly crumble but 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.860
 what error toba fila picks up 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.000
 won throwing 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.030
 throw bar 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.050
 and anyway the appearance of something young 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.240
 player lineup 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.280
 in the Kuznetsk metallurgist this season 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:42.050
 Filat in the cast has time to reduce the flaps 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:42.050
 xander wicker tires 30 plant the second time 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.970
 he does not hand over la juzhe he is july trumpeter cop 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.400
 indeed he has a chance in the next 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.100
 here is an excellent transfer inversion throw 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.390
 touches of filat 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.670
 yes this moment is just starting 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.899
 move 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.310
 the tire vines had a bit of a chance 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:05.200
 Novokuznetsk first period but were at 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.200
 their possibilities and tarkas are great 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.970
 let's see again 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.150
 yes philip mid hatch can only strange in 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.010
 Klyuchnikov world 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:27.580
 put it mildly you see what's going on 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.580
 sure thing 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.010
 You can certainly skip the counterattack 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.180
 easy and in my opinion it now turns out 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.180
 if not 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:51.629
 worked Alexander Islam tanks banks 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.930
 great climbed the gate misses 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.930
 washer 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.720
 you are here skrestnye and movement Randy Ruby 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.580
 Tile arranged 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.420
 rebound which helps print 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.770
 gate and glad arches 13 for 1 minute and 35 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.450
 seconds before the end of the second period 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.310
 heaven good luck want there in my here 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.680
 specifically on the stick 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.380
 put in an hour I will look at the paper but then 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.010
 there is no kagarlitsky this dmitry mega 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.570
 Linsky and the defender was on the patch 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.790
 Framed the stick precisely from his stick 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.560
 the puck was at the gate 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.670
 Hypnosis aerator zooms out seems very 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.459
 talented 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.590
 player birozkin not bad transfer blindly 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.130
 giraffe with uncomfortable hands where washer 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.260
 the outer side of the varrot is another 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.670
 opportunity 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:52.980
 let's take a look at duck throw 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.980
 great playing pancake tarki 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.099
 them sharp and all pass ahead 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.930
 kaglaritsky 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:10.780
 angle and look paper reduces the gap 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:13.069
 to the minimum the sounds of that 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.780
 there are dissatisfied apparently on 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.780
 bench at the Finnish Salavat Yulaev 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.370
 Well, Alexander Alexander paper 2 points for where 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:30.830
 He never missed a washer toss 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:32.660
 tarki steel sander la zush he appeared 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.220
 Yury Klyuchnikov 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.220
 but no longer missed 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:40.879
 your gate will not work 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.750
 here is one of the last moments throw and 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:56.550
 siren sounds 32 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.530
 minimal and yet tell that 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.669
 Well, as they say victory does not smell three 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:06.919
 points in the piggy bank the team Venus Safin 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.919
