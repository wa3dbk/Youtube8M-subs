would have guessed first and foremost we
wanted<00:00:51.190> to<00:00:51.250> know<00:00:51.370> wireline<00:00:52.000> social<00:00:52.690> all<00:00:53.350> the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
things at a group level so over the

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.570 
things at a group level so over the
years<00:01:01.480> students<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:02.620> myself<00:01:02.800> have<00:01:03.370> worked

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
years students and myself have worked

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.280 
years students and myself have worked
together<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:04.030> try<00:01:04.330> to<00:01:04.390> figure<00:01:04.600> out<00:01:04.720> if<00:01:05.020> they

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
together to try to figure out if they

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.650 
together to try to figure out if they
were<00:01:05.350> social<00:01:05.980> because<00:01:06.640> of<00:01:07.030> advantages<00:01:07.510> of

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
were social because of advantages of

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.360 
were social because of advantages of
hunting<00:01:07.990> in<00:01:08.080> groups<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:11.950> answer<00:01:12.220> there

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
hunting in groups and the answer there

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.420 
hunting in groups and the answer there
is<00:01:12.430> no<00:01:12.550> is<00:01:13.060> it<00:01:13.780> because<00:01:14.080> they<00:01:14.560> can<00:01:14.770> raise<00:01:15.100> their

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
is no is it because they can raise their

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.820 
is no is it because they can raise their
cubs<00:01:15.700> more<00:01:16.060> successfully<00:01:16.869> and<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.530> answer<00:01:17.740> to

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
cubs more successfully and the answer to

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.590 
cubs more successfully and the answer to
that<00:01:17.860> is<00:01:18.190> yes<00:01:18.550> but<00:01:18.910> it's<00:01:19.030> a<00:01:19.090> complicated

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
that is yes but it's a complicated

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.070 
that is yes but it's a complicated
answer<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:21.760> real<00:01:21.940> reason<00:01:22.270> why<00:01:22.420> lions<00:01:22.840> live<00:01:22.990> in

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
answer the real reason why lions live in

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.340 
answer the real reason why lions live in
groups<00:01:23.380> is<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:24.070> fact<00:01:24.310> that<00:01:24.460> they<00:01:24.729> have<00:01:25.350> access

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
groups is the fact that they have access

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.550 
groups is the fact that they have access
to<00:01:26.979> very<00:01:27.280> valuable<00:01:27.760> territory<00:01:28.150> that's<00:01:29.110> often

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
to very valuable territory that's often

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.950 
to very valuable territory that's often
centered<00:01:29.979> around<00:01:30.100> key<00:01:30.880> hotspots<00:01:31.630> in<00:01:31.840> the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
centered around key hotspots in the

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.680 
centered around key hotspots in the
environment<00:01:32.610> usually<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.729> confluences<00:01:34.510> of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
environment usually the confluences of

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.800 
environment usually the confluences of
tributaries<00:01:35.380> where<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.700> prey<00:01:37.060> become<00:01:37.540> more

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
tributaries where the prey become more

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.499 
tributaries where the prey become more
abundant<00:01:40.830> so<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:41.950> Lions<00:01:42.280> have<00:01:42.490> food<00:01:42.940> water

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
abundant so the Lions have food water

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:51.960 
abundant so the Lions have food water
and<00:01:43.810> shelter<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:51.070> pride<00:01:51.369> to<00:01:51.399> be<00:01:51.670> able<00:01:51.820> to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
and shelter and a pride to be able to

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.510 
and shelter and a pride to be able to
reproduce<00:01:52.570> successfully<00:01:53.100> needs<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.340> have

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
reproduce successfully needs to have

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.430 
reproduce successfully needs to have
several<00:01:54.940> of<00:01:55.119> those<00:01:55.240> hotspots<00:01:55.899> so<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.229> can<00:01:56.320> have

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
several of those hotspots so it can have

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.169 
several of those hotspots so it can have
enough<00:01:56.710> food<00:01:56.979> over<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.340> two<00:01:57.520> years<00:01:57.789> it<00:01:58.000> takes

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
enough food over the two years it takes

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.060 
enough food over the two years it takes
to<00:01:58.570> raise<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:59.050> new<00:01:59.289> cohort<00:01:59.530> of<00:01:59.800> young
