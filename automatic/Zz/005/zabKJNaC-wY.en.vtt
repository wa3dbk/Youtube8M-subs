00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
to neutral meaning there's a little bit

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.330

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
you have a little bit more room for a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.660 
you have a little bit more room for a
wider<00:00:48.780> face<00:00:49.110> or<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.620> did<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.100> purpose<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.610> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
wider face or I did that on purpose as a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.459 
wider face or I did that on purpose as a
comparison<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> vector<00:00:51.960> 2<00:00:52.079> or<00:00:52.199> something

comparison to the vector 2 or something

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.200 
comparison to the vector 2 or something
