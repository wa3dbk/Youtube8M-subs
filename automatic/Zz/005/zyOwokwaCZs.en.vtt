00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.960
 I'm here at the neo-nutritional booth. 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.080
 expo nutrition come on 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.849
 You changed your body, man, what was it like? 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.830
 castilho said 'you've been training 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.809
 You woke up one day to my do not want. 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.699
 more be chicken with contribution now all 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.500
 cost that was in fact the following is 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.070
 was a natural evolution of the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.350
 things 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.730
 I always trained I started to train with 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.529
 20 years old 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.750
 in fact before even more serious 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.510
 so with 20 years 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.500
 throughout this year along with 34 I never 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.630
 I stopped training 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.280
 I always had a healthy diet 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.700
 and has always been inserted in my always 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.140
 I always liked attracted interest but 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.850
 I honestly did not know that I could 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.210
 living can take on a lifestyle 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.860
 the symbolic one on your head body 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.219
 exactly when it was even a change 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.960
 internally so the result is what I 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.210
 So I say the legal body is a 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.579
 Bonus so well together when you 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.960
 does the math account do 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.219
 physical activity will take care of my 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.989
 of my food 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.890
 I'm going after a more 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.720
 healthy, cool body is good, right? 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.580
 because it 's a cool bonus as hell 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.320
 because no one who woke up and was 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.030
 to my belly full of goals that 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.500
 What do I do to get these 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.350
 blows to the belly will never get fat 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.860
 now never had then is a motivation 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.070
 very cool but I really started to 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.320
 ami cercade professionals 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.360
 to learn more about the leading 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.290
 for us to set up the company team more 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.290
 less than a year in office 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.930
 in fact it is a group of people are 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.119
 the guys that I brought to close to me 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.460
 when I decided to dive headlong into the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.899
 bodybuilder universe that the first 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.880
 thing that no one needs to be afraid of 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.490
 speak the word bodybuilder h why 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.979
 everyone goes to the gym and builds the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.200
 body that makes exercise is a tourist 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.290
 english they speak bodybuilding wants 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.439
 build the body or is a movement 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.869
 much larger than is already restricted to the 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:11.069
 that very big guys image is 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.280
 obvious that this is the elite squadron of the 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.750
 blog building more 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.550
 everyone who goes to the gym can 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.319
 participate in this movement may have 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.240
 these characteristics and I do not speak only 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.760
 in the body I take the things I 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.190
 I learned from bodybuilding doctrines 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.440
 for my life so when I started to 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.440
 to go deeper into this world I went 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.290
 behind the people I knew were 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.840
 the top of the middle and then I got together 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.610
 they ended up forming a company that is 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.250
 this type of people are paulo music 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.660

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.670

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.160
 Train with me there, the Eduardo Correia. 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.840

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.380

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.930
 his coach took a lot the thing is 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.360
 very positive because so until the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.630
 for the visibility it has in the media 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.370
 you ended up infecting 11 a range 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.989
 very large of people to have a life 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.880

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.480

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.940

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.050
