00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.140
 hello everybody, what the teacher is AndrÃ© 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:08.839
 Welcome one more video lesson of 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.259
 today will be made on the question of a 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:15.799
 written on the channel, there is 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.840
 the front audio connection of your 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.930
 computer 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.650
 someone who does not know who we are going to have 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.650
 here for you 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:33.140
 this front of the cabinet next to it. 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:36.770
 we have here a connector for the 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.140
 microphone and another to the headset 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.370
 so depending on the person you set up 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.370
 your computer 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.500
 often it does not connect the 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.770
 front audio and then you can not 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.660
 use the microphone and not even a 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.760
 sound or earphone year the connections 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.210
 here on the front or just the motherboard 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.920
 in the back that works in the room 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.559
 complete for you 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.290
 teaching how to correctly 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.260
 front audio arm attachment 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.920
 then the chance to show that the 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.409
 computer has a motherboard're here 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.720
 showing that the location 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.330
 it may be on that part of the motherboard 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.800
 or here below 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.229
 how is the identification going to be done? 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.150
 first is the front audio when it 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.009
 it is not used it usually has two 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:34.790
 jean pears he has five tires here 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.969
 below and 4 above but there are two games 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.840
 then you must do the withdrawal 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:44.180
 these two helmets to the front is the 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.799
 which makes the union of two pins to change 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:57.680
 some configuration and here I have the 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:02:00.439
 move audio f pins to the side and let's 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:06.909
 identify these nine pins 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:09.819
 then right at the bottom have 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:14.620
 five pins 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.060
 You're going to show these five little dots here. 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:25.349
 these tires 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:25.349
 they are what matters is the 3 5 7 and 9 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:34.450
 the top 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.129
 I have one two three four children here 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:43.409
 I'll make the little box they do not have 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:43.409
 penalty is the pairs 2 4 6 8 and 10 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:53.049
 has two pins that do not use is the 7 and 8 not 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:03:03.760
 are used to connect audio 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:03:05.340
 front the pin you will connect the mic 2-1 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:14.430
 l 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:14.430
 nick 2-1 on pin 3 that will turn the mip 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:30.609
 2-1 r 15 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:37.109
 you will call online out is the 7 you do not 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:43.209
 is cheated and in the online lobby out 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:47.879
 he stayed in r 5 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:52.630
 there and move me iml 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:04:02.470
 the paris pins here you will call 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:09.370
 the alt gnd no 4 the jd audio 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:16.420
 alt + 5 see the pin 6 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:37.170
 I like it online at tr 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:41.890
 or is it an audio gm d10 online out out 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.960
 gnv so you know the correct connection and 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.620
 No problem, it 's good to have you. 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.170
 a manual of the motherboard in hands like 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.340
 your motherboard in hand you go 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.900
 know is is the identification of each pin and 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.930
 communicate correctly here I am 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.910
 passing the link from the front album 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:07.840
 separately computer that I have 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:09.030
 here is easier because it is already 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.690
 all together 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:16.260
 what I have here on board the morning 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.260
 part of 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.360
 the audio we have two dined I go 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.360
 take these two ample 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:38.430
 io 2011 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:41.910
 and here I have the top connector 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.700
 military and if you sin bar minc 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.430
 you identify it because it is a 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:52.670
 part has five holes and in the other part 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.670
 there are only 43 streets at last plus one 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.810
 it is the only one that fit correctly 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:02.310
 here that comes back different from the 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.900
 the USB connections on the front panel 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.450
 In this case, on my computer, it was 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.010
 very easy to hang up because he's coming 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:13.740
 together but have computers that he is 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:16.290
 all separate an album and then you can 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.710
 follow this favela 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:22.560
 you write in google audio front - 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.750
 full audio audio front audio connection 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:29.120
 will take a lot of table you can 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:31.890
 printing will help you make the call 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.990
 front if your computer means the 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.840
 his cabinet he comes all together 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.669
 this here is well together with the cabinet 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.340
 press office that you 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:44.130
 found cabinet that you use 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:47.430
 It could be that everything is together and it stays there. 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:52.919
 easier to call just put it here and 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:56.960
 ready now separate will complicate a 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:07:00.729
 little else connected here 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:06.279
 the front audio 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:09.219
 in the rock motherboard is convicted and Calvi 

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:15.729
 it will work correctly when 

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:18.219
 connect the microphone and speakers to the 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:20.559
 headset and full of sun 

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:22.419
 the same thing I do not have in the case 

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:26.169
 another wing who explained to those of 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:27.909
 sbt also many people who do not 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:31.360
 nothing works up here because the 

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:33.909
 person who did the assembly of the computer 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.069
 the motherboard switch did not turn on 

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:38.830
 correctly the wires 

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:40.740
