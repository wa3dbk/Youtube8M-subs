00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
if you look to some some athletes also

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.300 
if you look to some some athletes also
another<00:00:22.689> sport<00:00:23.110> they<00:00:23.290> were<00:00:23.410> really<00:00:23.740> badly<00:00:24.009> hit

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
another sport they were really badly hit

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.540 
another sport they were really badly hit
on<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:24.580> head<00:00:24.759> and<00:00:25.000> then<00:00:25.689> the<00:00:25.990> way<00:00:26.170> they<00:00:26.500> have<00:00:27.369> I

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
on the head and then the way they have I

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.480 
on the head and then the way they have I
would<00:00:27.610> say<00:00:27.910> to<00:00:27.970> survive<00:00:28.480> and<00:00:28.900> live<00:00:29.500> with<00:00:29.770> with

would say to survive and live with with

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.130 
would say to survive and live with with
this<00:00:30.669> concussion

this concussion

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.710 
this concussion
I<00:00:32.169> think<00:00:33.070> the<00:00:33.160> IHF<00:00:33.610> has<00:00:33.760> to<00:00:33.910> be<00:00:34.030> responsible

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
I think the IHF has to be responsible

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.080 
I think the IHF has to be responsible
here<00:00:34.960> in<00:00:35.320> this<00:00:35.590> case<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:36.130> IHF<00:00:36.550> does<00:00:36.790> have<00:00:37.030> a

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
here in this case the IHF does have a

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.690 
here in this case the IHF does have a
rule<00:00:37.360> that<00:00:37.390> is<00:00:37.780> specific<00:00:38.440> for<00:00:38.470> anything<00:00:39.040> any

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
rule that is specific for anything any

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.090 
rule that is specific for anything any
type<00:00:40.030> of<00:00:40.059> a<00:00:40.270> hit<00:00:40.450> that<00:00:40.600> is<00:00:40.719> targeted<00:00:41.320> at<00:00:41.440> the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
type of a hit that is targeted at the

type of a hit that is targeted at the
the<00:00:42.520> head<00:00:42.730> of<00:00:42.880> the<00:00:42.969> neck<00:00:43.149> area<00:00:43.390> actually

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
about the future health of the players

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.430 
about the future health of the players
and<00:01:55.850> we<00:01:55.940> just<00:01:56.270> have<00:01:56.479> to<00:01:56.659> eliminate<00:01:56.840> this<00:01:57.229> from

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
and we just have to eliminate this from

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.719 
and we just have to eliminate this from
the<00:01:57.590> game<00:01:57.740> in<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.009> same<00:01:58.220> way<00:01:58.429> that<00:01:58.610> we

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
the game in the same way that we

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.730 
the game in the same way that we
eliminated<00:01:59.299> hitting<00:01:59.899> from<00:02:00.020> behind<00:02:00.440> so<00:02:00.709> that

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
eliminated hitting from behind so that

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.630 
eliminated hitting from behind so that
there's<00:02:01.039> no<00:02:01.250> neck<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.030> head<00:02:02.209> injuries<00:02:02.509> again

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
there's no neck and head injuries again

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.400 
there's no neck and head injuries again
we're<00:02:04.640> hoping<00:02:05.270> that<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.840> message<00:02:06.170> gets

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
we're hoping that the message gets

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.770 
we're hoping that the message gets
through<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.679> the<00:02:07.160> players<00:02:07.459> to<00:02:07.610> coaches<00:02:08.360> to
