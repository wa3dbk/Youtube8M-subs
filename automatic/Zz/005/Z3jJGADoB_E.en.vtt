also a theft deterrent as well

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.360 
also a theft deterrent as well
also<00:02:31.730> comes<00:02:32.090> with<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.780> storage<00:02:33.290> pouch<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.890> the

also comes with a storage pouch and the
beauty<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.730> Avis<00:02:35.030> one<00:02:35.209> of<00:02:35.299> the<00:02:35.360> other<00:02:35.480> things

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
beauty of Avis one of the other things

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.539 
beauty of Avis one of the other things
is<00:02:35.870> these<00:02:36.319> locks<00:02:36.650> are<00:02:36.890> typically<00:02:37.310> almost

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
is these locks are typically almost

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.130 
is these locks are typically almost
twice<00:02:37.790> as<00:02:37.819> strong<00:02:38.239> as<00:02:38.420> something<00:02:38.720> comparable

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
twice as strong as something comparable

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.600 
twice as strong as something comparable
from<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.379> competitor<00:02:39.799> but<00:02:40.099> they're<00:02:40.250> forty<00:02:40.519> to

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
from the competitor but they're forty to

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.640 
from the competitor but they're forty to
sixty<00:02:40.730> percent<00:02:40.939> lighter<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.989> really<00:02:42.500> makes

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
sixty percent lighter that really makes

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.929 
sixty percent lighter that really makes
a<00:02:42.769> difference<00:02:42.799> when<00:02:43.099> you<00:02:43.280> get<00:02:43.430> into<00:02:43.549> chains

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
a difference when you get into chains

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.449 
a difference when you get into chains
like<00:02:44.120> this<00:02:44.329> and<00:02:45.319> you<00:02:45.439> see<00:02:45.590> this<00:02:45.769> is<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:45.980> squared

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
like this and you see this is a squared

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.360 
like this and you see this is a squared
chain<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:47.000> comes<00:02:47.629> with<00:02:47.810> an<00:02:47.930> eyelet<00:02:48.409> this<00:02:49.250> is

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
chain it comes with an eyelet this is

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.619 
chain it comes with an eyelet this is
going<00:02:49.489> to<00:02:49.549> be<00:02:49.670> between<00:02:50.030> your<00:02:50.239> hundred<00:02:50.540> and

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
going to be between your hundred and

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:51.759 
going to be between your hundred and
fifty<00:02:50.840> dollar<00:02:51.019> and<00:02:51.230> two<00:02:51.349> hundred<00:02:51.650> dollar

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
fifty dollar and two hundred dollar

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.649 
fifty dollar and two hundred dollar
range<00:02:52.010> but<00:02:52.670> really<00:02:53.090> it's<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.269> same<00:02:53.510> thing

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
range but really it's the same thing

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.330 
range but really it's the same thing
it's<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.870> slightly<00:02:54.200> longer<00:02:54.620> bolt<00:02:55.040> in<00:02:55.190> the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
it's a slightly longer bolt in the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.410 
it's a slightly longer bolt in the
middle<00:02:55.610> but<00:02:55.940> you're<00:02:56.030> going<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.180> be<00:02:56.269> able<00:02:56.329> to

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420
