burner assembly and on this particular
unit<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:14.020> flame<00:01:14.320> is<00:01:14.560> actually<00:01:15.040> going<00:01:15.220> down

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
unit the flame is actually going down

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.690 
unit the flame is actually going down
and<00:01:16.330> we<00:01:16.509> have<00:01:16.690> to<00:01:16.990> heat<00:01:17.350> exchangers<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.280> this

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
and we have to heat exchangers and this

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.760 
and we have to heat exchangers and this
is<00:01:18.910> where<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.420> water<00:01:19.720> heating<00:01:20.229> is<00:01:20.350> actually

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
is where the water heating is actually

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.270 
is where the water heating is actually
taking<00:01:21.159> place<00:01:21.190> as<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:23.710> getting<00:01:23.890> down<00:01:24.220> to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
taking place as it's getting down to

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.249 
taking place as it's getting down to
here<00:01:24.759> this<00:01:24.910> is<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.119> final<00:01:25.630> heat<00:01:25.810> exchange

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
here this is the final heat exchange

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.740 
here this is the final heat exchange
situation<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.390> that's<00:01:28.390> where<00:01:28.630> the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
situation and that's where the

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.779 
situation and that's where the
conversation<00:01:29.500> will<00:01:29.619> take<00:01:29.800> place<00:01:30.009> and<00:01:30.399> we're

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
conversation will take place and we're

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.450
