00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:18.300
 this exhibition has a special nuance 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.580
 which is to try to put the visitor 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.289
 a little inside the eyes of one's own 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.789
 painter make you think about what 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:32.390
 represents being watching something and 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.390
 put it in a tooth 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.190
 I was just a painter who always had 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.200
 an obsession for the natural throughout 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.660
 of his life he had contact with the 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.080
 impressionism with the pross 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.330
 impressionism with the avant-garde and 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.309
 So let 's say you are living is 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.830
 breathing that goes breathing that 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.699
 environment but never wanted to let go 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.699
 from the natural 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.570
 in the pictures of the developing sea 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.119
 it is particularly attractive 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.810
 because it is the theme that he most 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.780
 interested was the subject that most challenged 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.259
 his technique because really the sea is what 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.140
 that is never still not and what what 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.890
 more changing and in that resides its 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.890
 fascination 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.210
 we started the exhibition with a section 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.149
 which is called the incessant show 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.630
 water because water is the show 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.850
 that fascinates sorolla and gets involved 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.299
 he gets very deeply into the 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.460
 study of water 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:53.090
 to the thread of that immersion in the water the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.329
 Sorolla technique acquires 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.460
 need for speed acquires a 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.649
 freedom and a lightness that we say you 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.549
 they push towards the painting towards the 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.549
 modern painting 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.060
 and then there is another section called 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.260
 the hours of the blue in which the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.810
 attention on 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.959
 and the way in which the different hours 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.790
 of the day or times of the year or latitudes 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.549
 it depends on whether it is the evil of courage or 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.860
 are the seas of the north coast such as 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.900
 atmospheres of light atmospheres of 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.209
 color that only she captures with much 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.610
 precision not and that moves to your 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.290
 canvases let's say in ranges in harmonies 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.290
 very different colors 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.140
 the last section of the exhibition that 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.959
 we call from nature to painting 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.330
 we call attention precisely to 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.120
 in that moment when only she and a 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.790
 Little uses natural as a pretext 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.250
 for the box but let's say that it 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.019
 Quite a bit from the reason for the reason 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.060
 original although the reason is always 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.040
 represented there but it is clear that the 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.190
 interest in light itself and by one's own 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.190
 color outweigh the interest in myth 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:28.800
 and nadal the one of jÃ¡vea is a picture of 1905 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:33.090
 and it's a good picture Javier is a place 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.520
 that he likes a lot is a place where 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.269
 the coast breaks a lot there are cliffs 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.739
 there those activities appear illuminated 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.250
 Shadows are produced on the water 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:47.069
 produce brightness and reflections and also the 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.950
 as there are many cliffs, many 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.860
 Sometimes children are bathing 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.959
 he sees them from above in a chopped view 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.660
 then it has much simpler 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.970
 be that idea of â€‹â€‹flipping the plane or of 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.100
 work in a space where 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.290
 important is the color the light the 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.730
 composition the shape the drawing all this 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.330
 we see a phenomenon like that of the 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:13.110
 refraction the body of the two children is 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.599
 sees broken under water by the tide not 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.250
 by the ripple of water we see how 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.709
 the legs disappear a little 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.510
 undone and how the form goes 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.510
 undoing with the powers of water 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.510
 all 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.030
 ah
