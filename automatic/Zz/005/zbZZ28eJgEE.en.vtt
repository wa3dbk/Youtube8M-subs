00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.099
 call the impossible card then of 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.369
 all you need is a normal deck 52 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:22.220
 cards and some ability to do 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:25.350
 missouri fake and break mind that is 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.750
 this is my fifth video in the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.550
 fifth game and a little more difficult than the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.669
 others that I showed you in others 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.520
 video however in the end is very 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.239
 fascinating fun 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.190
 well then let's start taking the risk 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.000
 to the viewer or mix you like 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.649
 you want if you trust not to create doubts 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.940
 in fact there is no need or light 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.190
 need early preparation 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.840
 march ok ok then first 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.420
 what do you choose the vacuum card 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.489
 they choose at random I am now of hearts 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.159
 for example 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.580
 ok he just sees it the card you don't 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.340
 you see 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.000
 but now I show the tutorial ok 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.090
 see the paper you take it and my thesis 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.060
 on the hub and then told us but leave a 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.860
 break vinci explained about this break 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.420
 if you don't know how to do it , you must see it 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.970
 specific videos on youtube 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.130
 I tell you only what it is for 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.180
 lose track of cards for 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.619
 take it to the top of the deck ok okay fairies 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.439
 this movement not to be noticed 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.240
 nothing in fact before you see nothing 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:43.890
 just nothing like the deck you decide 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:46.240
 at this point from the acts you do so and the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.630
 card is obtained if that deck 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.520
 I revise it again 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.220
 security in the card you see it 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.920
 viewer why eat bunch 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:09.239
 close break then move 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:11.440
 cut 123 and the paper over kill ok 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.870
 so here we are 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.370
 at this point you have to position the 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.150
 deck in this way 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.730
 asca you see that goes on even here years 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.200
 on ok positioned the maximum this 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.420
 way 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.239
 and you have to make me say I'm doing 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:33.220
 scrolls the cards this way while 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.420
 say then you must now do miss 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.299
 top while you tell it 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.720
 slide the first card, ie 9 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:43.030
 of hearts with thumbs down to 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.730
 you will benefit so 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.190
 ok when you did it slide 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.310
 the stop mile deck 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.690
 I say I'm right now and take everything 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:59.590
 the bunch between the first card between the 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.150
 9 of hearts you see and find yourself in 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.640
 top of the deck they see us with once 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.450
 positioned the deck this way 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.130
 see then tell now of the two stops 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.579
 and while they straighten you slide 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.760
 the card so then done so and stop 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:23.970
 those are the card of the deck and the 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:26.980
 I will participate at this point 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.290
 first take the first card then the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.480
 second, put it under the first card 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.680
 the third is the second and fourth 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:41.530
 put it on top of the first ok at this 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:43.239
 point and turn now you find yourself a 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.799
 this point in press the deck so in 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.120
 these two truths here and the thumb you 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:52.540
 so and take the boulder this way 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.449
 the lives according to me in these four 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.450
 cards there is your card indeed 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:04:01.660
 in fact the word uses paper 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.459
 is the 6 of hearts ok as you slide 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.650
 the third card 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.900
 put a big break with these too 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.750
 two fingers see break 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.480
 ok and while you run the fourth 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.919
 paper then literally paired the 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.440
 deck at 6 take it with the march is 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.020
 same and the card is located under the 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.360
 March his hearts and we have only here 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:32.800
 three cards I have one more review 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:35.860
 ok time then stay like this 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.410
 scroll once in my opinion though 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.389
 these four cards will be yours 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:46.510
 done and now do so 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:49.960
 ok we got to this point that 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.479
 we have three spectator cards in hand 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.490
 asks that we have four for not 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.530
 to point out that we have four that is 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.210
 that we have three we must do this 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.900
 in this movement the first one is the la 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:05.160
 first card and the average of take 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.160
 the second card 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:16.680
 then take the first and last card 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:19.180
 you see there are 27 Jun and then this one then 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:24.160
 having done this you must then say second 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:28.479
 me your unfair card in my opinion 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:31.200
 your card is not even here but 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.490
 I think your card is this one 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.919
 in fact this thing has it instead 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.830
 how should you put your hand in front of 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.750
 spectator without making you see emits the 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.070
 paper or right under your hand then 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.200
 you immediately pull it away 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:50.440
 see here there is nothing the house yes 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:53.380
 find do so and via pert is indeed 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.270
 as an advantage because you have three cards 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.590
 it seems that the fourth gardasil i and ii 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:03.220
 say then your card is not this 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:06.250
 this is not even a part and it is not 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.780
 not even this if your home 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.950
 it is not among these markets 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:17.230
 the paper envelope is not even here 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:22.030
 here if the paper is not even here yes 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:24.180
 he will find himself in the middle of the low and the game is 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.180
 done 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.260
 then you can then on the tube channel the 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:33.150
 Century alley post more videos you 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:38.080
