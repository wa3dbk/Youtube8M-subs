00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.110
 sand instructions black errors 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.180
 Waiting pretty long

 American action phone 6 4 1 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.170
 although 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.330
 4 2 and 4 3 and firmware modem also works for years 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.630
 stitched all at the moment 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.310
 are supported 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.610
 any american foundation 4 can be 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.610
 blocked in this way 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.299
 four 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.299
 our pirates 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.499
 that's our pirates 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.499
 congress race evaluations telecom operator 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.669
 here are the legs 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:37.829
 see the arrangement that 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:38.579
 us 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.569
 American 4 1 share then American means 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.779
 true modem 2 10 4 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.339
 We had concerns that when the signal was lost 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:48.979
 will need to do it all again 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:51.569
 therefore conducted a series of tests 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.369
 trust held withdraw because he 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:54.959
 network lost 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.069
 per year, respectively, the form you see as we 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.689
 go blitz this phone 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.289
 and then 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:02.279
 units 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:03.809
 or century I do not remember 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.089
 skated in different directions 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:08.789
 depend on lost then see what 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:11.279
 will it be found or not why us 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:14.309
 there were fears because there were thoughts that 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:15.220
 code which 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.260
 the phone they steal there gets more accurate 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.439
 Kokoity Jesse steals gets 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.889
 during the call 112 for which then 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.039
 slip 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:26.299
 Raikkonen so that he could work 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.989
 all these operators 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.499
 in which it is not intended 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.599
 maybe like there 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.719
 gets stuck or let's say sawn there a few 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:37.979
 times during the day 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.079
 therefore carried out different tests like 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.559
 drove the elevator on top make 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:42.499
 Alekseev 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:45.219
 so for example put the phone at home 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.369
 connected to the network and assume 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:49.919
 went into the elevator that lose touch through 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.919
 some time after 10 hours 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.620
 he but 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.319
 while everything is fine, that is, while we are not 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.230
 managed to do this 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.579
 phone what is the network 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.469
 yesterday to the investigator that this is the same 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:03.249
 the phone we had 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:04.829
 if you want you can proceed under 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.049
 arrest 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.919
 senya who then and stuff like that 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:09.309
 work
