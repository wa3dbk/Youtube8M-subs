00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
smoke so before I was running good it

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.060 
smoke so before I was running good it
seemed<00:01:32.880> fine<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.470> think<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.560> went<00:01:34.740> out<00:01:34.830> of<00:01:34.980> my

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
seemed fine I think you went out of my

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.020 
seemed fine I think you went out of my
hole<00:01:35.190> pressure<00:01:35.400> though<00:01:35.580> I<00:01:35.610> should<00:01:35.820> have<00:01:35.910> kept

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
hole pressure though I should have kept

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.880 
hole pressure though I should have kept
my<00:01:36.090> eye<00:01:36.210> my<00:01:36.570> pressure<00:01:36.870> ice<00:01:37.440> change<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.710> short

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
my eye my pressure ice change the short

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.590 
my eye my pressure ice change the short
buck<00:01:38.010> for<00:01:38.190> now<00:01:38.280> maybe<00:01:38.490> well<00:01:39.240> hopefully<00:01:39.420> my

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
buck for now maybe well hopefully my

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.720 
buck for now maybe well hopefully my
head's<00:01:39.780> good<00:01:39.980> put<00:01:40.980> in<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.130> short<00:01:41.340> block<00:01:41.490> and

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
head's good put in the short block and

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.650 
head's good put in the short block and
then<00:01:41.820> shot<00:01:42.150> runs<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.690> then<00:01:44.000> if<00:01:45.000> not<00:01:45.150> maybe<00:01:45.330> put

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
then shot runs and then if not maybe put

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.730 
then shot runs and then if not maybe put
a<00:01:45.690> case<00:01:45.870> reason<00:01:46.170> it
