00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
it's most likely what's that's mostly

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.320 
it's most likely what's that's mostly
what<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.500> looks<00:02:55.710> like<00:02:55.830> in<00:02:56.010> real<00:02:56.040> life<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:57.150> can

what it looks like in real life you can

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.820 
what it looks like in real life you can
decide<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:57.900> can<00:02:58.080> choose<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.410> leave<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.680> white

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
but as for me I think it personally

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.100

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.439 
they kind of feel like exactly the same
the<00:04:18.579> hold<00:04:18.789> I<00:04:18.879> think<00:04:19.030> we're<00:04:19.120> gonna<00:04:19.209> go<00:04:19.419> with

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:20.909 
the hold I think we're gonna go with
fabric<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.079> be<00:04:20.169> honest<00:04:20.349> with<00:04:20.440> you<00:04:20.560> guys<00:04:20.739> and

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.499 
saying now what the license we're
definitely<00:04:26.379> going<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:26.740> put<00:04:26.889> the<00:04:27.039> laces<00:04:27.509> onto

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
definitely going to put the laces onto

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.649 
definitely going to put the laces onto
mesh<00:04:29.169> so<00:04:29.770> yeah<00:04:30.280> we'll<00:04:30.460> get<00:04:30.580> them<00:04:30.729> places<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.479> go

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:31.659 
mesh so yeah we'll get them places to go

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:34.350 
mesh so yeah we'll get them places to go
with<00:04:31.810> mesh<00:04:32.139> and<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:33.550> gives<00:04:34.030> it<00:04:34.150> a<00:04:34.210> good

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
with mesh and it gives it a good

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.420 
with mesh and it gives it a good
contrast<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:35.289> then<00:04:35.590> after<00:04:36.039> that<00:04:36.190> we're<00:04:36.340> going

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
contrast and then after that we're going

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.189 
contrast and then after that we're going
