00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.580 
for doing that and I think it's going to
only<00:01:11.909> lead<00:01:12.210> them<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.930> bigger<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.380> better

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590

and game types
so<00:02:05.299> one<00:02:06.290> thing<00:02:06.409> I<00:02:06.500> want<00:02:06.680> to<00:02:06.710> talk<00:02:06.920> about

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
so one thing I want to talk about

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.229 
so one thing I want to talk about
domination<00:02:07.850> it's<00:02:08.709> it's<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:10.489> tough<00:02:10.729> game<00:02:10.970> type

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
domination it's it's a tough game type

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.510 
domination it's it's a tough game type
basically<00:02:12.020> it's<00:02:12.230> split<00:02:12.560> into<00:02:12.590> two<00:02:12.980> halves<00:02:13.250> and

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
basically it's split into two halves and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.120 
basically it's split into two halves and
you<00:02:14.209> play<00:02:14.420> one<00:02:14.810> side<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.380> then<00:02:15.560> another<00:02:15.830> and

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
you play one side and then another and

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.510 
you play one side and then another and
you<00:02:16.640> calculate<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.330> total<00:02:17.510> amount<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:18.020> points

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
you calculate the total amount of points

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.940 
you calculate the total amount of points
accumulated<00:02:19.520> on<00:02:19.760> both<00:02:20.030> sides<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:21.319> avoid<00:02:21.680> any

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
accumulated on both sides to avoid any

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.970 
accumulated on both sides to avoid any
sort<00:02:22.250> of<00:02:22.370> one-sided<00:02:23.030> map<00:02:23.390> play<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.920> a

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
sort of one-sided map play this is a

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.880 
sort of one-sided map play this is a
good<00:02:25.459> idea<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:26.120> they<00:02:26.870> did<00:02:27.080> this<00:02:27.230> in<00:02:27.440> ecology

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
good idea and they did this in ecology

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.430 
good idea and they did this in ecology
for<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.489> I<00:02:28.850> think<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:29.239> really<00:02:29.270> landed<00:02:30.170> for

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
for and I think it really landed for

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.860 
for and I think it really landed for
some<00:02:30.650> great<00:02:31.069> matches<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:32.150> took<00:02:32.450> out<00:02:32.630> the

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
some great matches and took out the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.940 
some great matches and took out the
whole<00:02:33.250> factor<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.430> having<00:02:34.819> one<00:02:34.849> sided<00:02:35.630> maps<00:02:35.950> so

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
whole factor of having one sided maps so

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.790 
whole factor of having one sided maps so
you<00:02:37.880> know<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.239> being<00:02:38.450> said<00:02:38.840> teams<00:02:39.440> are

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
you know that being said teams are

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.120 
you know that being said teams are
really<00:02:40.550> adapting<00:02:41.209> differently<00:02:42.019> lots<00:02:42.980> of

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
really adapting differently lots of

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.199 
really adapting differently lots of
different<00:02:43.400> teams<00:02:43.580> are<00:02:43.790> playing<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.180> very

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
different teams are playing it very

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.559 
different teams are playing it very
different<00:02:45.340> reasons<00:02:46.340> being<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:47.180> know<00:02:47.299> some

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
different reasons being you know some

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.840 
different reasons being you know some
teams<00:02:47.810> are<00:02:48.019> more<00:02:48.290> comfortable<00:02:48.650> with<00:02:49.400> triple

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
teams are more comfortable with triple

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.350 
teams are more comfortable with triple
Cathy<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.360> just<00:02:51.049> floating<00:02:51.530> around<00:02:51.650> and

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
Cathy and just floating around and

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.090 
Cathy and just floating around and
watching<00:02:53.360> spawns<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.900> watching<00:02:54.319> Flags<00:02:54.650> get

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
watching spawns and watching Flags get

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.729 
watching spawns and watching Flags get
take<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.610> then<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.450> get<00:02:56.600> other<00:02:56.840> teams<00:02:57.170> that

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
take and then you get other teams that

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.750 
take and then you get other teams that
really<00:02:58.190> want<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.269> just<00:02:59.510> take<00:03:00.260> two<00:03:00.500> flags<00:03:00.830> run

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
really want to just take two flags run

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.910 
really want to just take two flags run
between<00:03:01.940> two<00:03:02.330> of<00:03:02.360> them<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:02.930> just<00:03:03.380> secure<00:03:03.769> the

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
between two of them and just secure the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
between two of them and just secure the
win<00:03:04.069> and<00:03:04.340> be<00:03:04.549> cautious<00:03:05.269> about<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:06.580> now<00:03:07.580> what

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
win and be cautious about it now what

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.759 
win and be cautious about it now what
we're<00:03:08.090> seeing<00:03:08.239> here<00:03:08.390> is<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.870> more<00:03:09.440> cautious

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
we're seeing here is a more cautious

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.599 
we're seeing here is a more cautious
approach<00:03:10.989> obviously<00:03:11.989> we're<00:03:12.170> playing<00:03:12.440> two<00:03:13.160> top

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
approach obviously we're playing two top

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.880 
approach obviously we're playing two top
teams<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.540> know<00:03:14.570> team<00:03:14.930> equinox<00:03:15.380> for<00:03:15.620> his<00:03:15.709> team

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
teams you know team equinox for his team

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.590 
teams you know team equinox for his team
static<00:03:16.340> team<00:03:16.549> static<00:03:16.850> is<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.000> very<00:03:17.359> well-known

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
static team static is a very well-known

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.199 
static team static is a very well-known
team<00:03:18.019> and<00:03:18.260> got<00:03:18.980> some<00:03:19.190> great<00:03:19.400> players<00:03:19.730> on<00:03:20.030> there

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
so you cannot go into this type of game

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.840
