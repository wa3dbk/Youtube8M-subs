00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:02.830
 Hello everyone who watches this dispatch 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.819
 this week i want to show you my 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.450
 next homemade 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.979
 this is she river 

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:11.979
 no batteries or bize carmen 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.519
 here the other day 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.759
 I twisted this one 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:20.890
 stepper motor 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.350
 and an idea occurred to me 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.460
 to make 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.300
 without this step he engine flashlight without 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.710
 batteries 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.190
 he doesn't have batteries 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.190
 because the stepper motor itself 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.450
 favors 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.460
 we are in the role 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.180
 energy source is kind of and 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.420
 I am not happy with the engine 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.420
 let's see how it works 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.890
 so that he earned what to do 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.270
 just twist 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.050
 this engine but also looks 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.050
 on 4 superbright LEDs 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.500
 and let's cover we see how she 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.160
 Alexey 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.550
 you can twist 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.910
 not much and not fast 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.360
 usually 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.210
 and the flashlight shines very brightly 4 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.650
 LEDs 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.590
 and do not work very well 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.200
 no batteries no 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.200
 batteries do not charge anything 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.660
 but slowly and everything 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.820
 this flashlight was whipped up 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.689
 of course 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.689
 its form can be better 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.479
 I just decided to show you and 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.899
 demonstrate what can be done from 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.080
 such a step langley after all 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.100
 this stepper motor 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.620
 bribes 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.430
 from old computer to old computer 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.030
 have five days 3 inch 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.360
 low here 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.050
 for disks earlier were five-inch 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.510
 disks of this size 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.590
 and in every picket and in many ways 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.510
 low is not such a stepper 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.390
 engine 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.480
 I'm glad I took it off 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.400
 and all 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.009
 drink ate a few 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.929
 and ate 4 LEDs 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.929
 and see how everything is done 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.829
 everything is very simple 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.439
 and everything works 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:24.510
 really need 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.559
 film dilogy include 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:29.449
 so it is necessary to include 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.449
 as a result, new km 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.219
 here's how to include within your limits 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.929
 lower amount 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.589
 plus minus sequential 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.659
 water turns on as you see 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.949
 surprisingly it requires stepper 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:50.980
 there are engines 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.909
 five outputs and that's it for the price and all 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.929
 will work fine 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:58.829
 no need to be any source 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.719
 power supply 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.719
 This is how you see strong men glowing brightly. 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.299
 everything is super 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.719
 a great 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.119
 budget flashlight 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:13.119
 for the house, in principle, intelligible 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.209
 principle, at night, the road and always be able 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.749
 shine a flashlight 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:22.979
 see i twist without straining 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.329
 works great 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.639
 so so i want to say about others 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.979
 stepper motor 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.049
 in sum, there is such a stepper 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.899
 engine I'm doing it, too, flashlights but 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:36.620
 principle shines but 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.639
 the result is also as good as 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.689
 Here it is a motor 6 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.549
 I also 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.070
 the flashlight tried to do here from this 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.699
 here's the engine charm 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.099
 but also 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.559
 there you see something wrong there 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:53.699
 Motors its result not especially 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.699
 so good but still it shines 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:00.249
 in principle, from any step 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:01.379
 engine 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.759
 make lights without batteries 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:07.129
 but the best is this 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.559
 motor like five other drive 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:13.559
 film critics all lit 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:17.789
 this one is the best 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.009
 small efforts 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.009
 if you work 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.849
 in general, all who liked and we see 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.529
 put likes subscribe to 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:32.199
 who liked the channel 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.039
 repeat 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.349
 overall a decent budget fanatic 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.349
 not all batteries 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.139
 Thanks for attention
