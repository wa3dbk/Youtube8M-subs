training<00:00:09.210> program<00:00:09.860> the<00:00:10.860> hand<00:00:11.099> has<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.280> whole

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
training program the hand has a whole

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.430 
training program the hand has a whole
bunch<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.000> joints<00:00:12.389> just<00:00:12.540> like<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.840> spine<00:00:13.110> and

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
bunch of joints just like the spine and

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.169 
bunch of joints just like the spine and
the<00:00:13.530> feet<00:00:13.769> however<00:00:14.219> most<00:00:14.730> people<00:00:14.820> don't<00:00:15.089> think

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
the feet however most people don't think

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.330 
the feet however most people don't think
about<00:00:15.360> training<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.020> hands<00:00:16.470> if<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.160> think

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
about training the hands if you think

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.980 
about training the hands if you think
about<00:00:17.400> finger<00:00:17.940> tension<00:00:18.359> then<00:00:18.810> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
about finger tension then the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.140 
about finger tension then the
intelligence<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.160> joints<00:00:20.730> within<00:00:21.029> your

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
intelligence of the joints within your

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.910 
intelligence of the joints within your
hands<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.689> actually<00:00:21.869> really<00:00:22.320> important<00:00:22.800> and

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
hands is actually really important and

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.380 
hands is actually really important and
it's<00:00:23.070> an<00:00:23.189> amazing<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.670> we<00:00:23.910> don't<00:00:24.090> train<00:00:24.240> it

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
it's an amazing that we don't train it

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.700 
it's an amazing that we don't train it
more<00:00:24.510> often<00:00:24.779> what<00:00:25.260> are<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.380> gonna<00:00:25.470> train<00:00:25.680> with

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
more often what are you gonna train with

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.859 
more often what are you gonna train with
me<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.460> you're<00:00:27.029> gonna<00:00:27.119> start<00:00:27.390> with<00:00:27.510> your<00:00:27.689> hand

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
me so you're gonna start with your hand

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:28.910 
me so you're gonna start with your hand
just<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.619> you're<00:00:28.710> just<00:00:28.740> gonna

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
just like this and you're just gonna

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.120 
just like this and you're just gonna
move<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:30.260> just<00:00:31.260> like<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:33.950> either<00:00:34.950> do<00:00:35.070> it

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
move it just like this either do it

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.530 
move it just like this either do it
about<00:00:35.250> two<00:00:35.460> or<00:00:35.579> three<00:00:35.610> times<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:36.149> can<00:00:36.239> rotate

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
about two or three times you can rotate

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.410 
about two or three times you can rotate
and<00:00:37.020> do<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> same<00:00:37.829> thing<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.250> way<00:00:38.430> some<00:00:39.390> of

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and do the same thing this way some of

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.119 
and do the same thing this way some of
these<00:00:39.660> ranges<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.290> motion<00:00:40.440> may<00:00:40.770> seem<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> little

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
these ranges of motion may seem a little

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.639 
these ranges of motion may seem a little
weird<00:00:41.480> it's<00:00:42.480> because<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:42.899> are<00:00:43.079> if<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.559> don't

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
weird it's because they are if you don't

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.170 
weird it's because they are if you don't
use<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> range<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.399> motion<00:00:44.520> then<00:00:44.820> your<00:00:44.910> body

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
use a range of motion then your body

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.389 
use a range of motion then your body
will<00:00:45.390> take<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.780> out<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.020> its<00:00:46.230> usable<00:00:46.920> movement

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
will take it out of its usable movement

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.369 
will take it out of its usable movement
vocabulary<00:00:47.690> you're<00:00:48.690> gonna<00:00:48.780> take<00:00:49.020> your<00:00:49.140> hands

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
vocabulary you're gonna take your hands

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.439 
vocabulary you're gonna take your hands

if you can see them and you're going to

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.689 
if you can see them and you're going to
circle<00:00:52.020> your<00:00:52.140> thumb<00:00:52.440> now<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> goal<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
circle your thumb now the goal is to

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.450 
circle your thumb now the goal is to
circle<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.960> hand<00:00:55.230> without<00:00:55.949> moving

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
circle just the hand without moving

finger and then ring fingers always the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.020 
finger and then ring fingers always the
hardest<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.229> get<00:01:13.530> going<00:01:14.010> without<00:01:14.549> moving
