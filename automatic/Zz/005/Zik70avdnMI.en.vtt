00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.720 
I just think during the transition
adding<00:03:58.250> ginger<00:03:58.519> and<00:03:59.299> spicy<00:04:00.200> green<00:04:00.799> vegetables

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
or green leafy greens is probably pretty

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.000 
or green leafy greens is probably pretty
good<00:04:05.170> strengthen<00:04:06.170> that<00:04:06.260> immune<00:04:06.530> system

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
good strengthen that immune system

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.619 
good strengthen that immune system
during<00:04:07.190> times<00:04:07.549> where<00:04:07.849> others<00:04:08.120> are<00:04:08.329> running
