00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:24.869
 This maybe we 'll make a 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.320
 see silva at the root of the valleys arraes dela 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.020
 and the accounts and we go there will have to 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.629
 lobster that keeps curly 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.550
 so we will make a progressive 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.239
 here at the root and at the ends we go 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.210
 make a botox all at once but let's 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.230
 show that a-ha the temperature of the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.140
 It 's important so she wants to 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.170
 keep these curls is one of the boxes 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.840
 pretty cool her box 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.840
 we go now this hair and root it 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.289
 is well crisped note that it has a 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.930
 three or four of natural root and here 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.610
 from now on already has a hair one 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.460
 little smoother that has already been made of 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.890
 other times he comes back but he comes back 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.440
 offensive 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.880
 he comes back but not a little bit and the 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.350
 sound tips is more curly 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.869
 in the end we will go there and establish 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.080
 how he was and how he is at the end of 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.080
 video 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.870
 I know her hair, people. 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.030
 100% progressive this theme works 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.380
 with the root 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:44.720
 I say with dry hair 100% as talks 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:47.450
 it would have to be a damp hair about 30% 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.200
 with the bills of that hair are 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.910
 united 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.330
 so we're going to work with the root 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:59.450
 dry and wet ends to have a 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:01.369
 work to do a job is the way 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:09.460
 the client wants 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:09.460
 the ESL isa and accounts when mines 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:18.530
 the application of the product is as I have done in 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:22.780
 other videos is normal 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.780
 click on the root and pull the ends 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.030
 just like all the other videos already 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.030
 I taught 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:02.260
 yesterday we applied the whole hair 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:06.600
 from the root to the tips we do not leave 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.600
 the excess of product 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.829
 with a normal progressive one 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.409
 now we show how we will do with the 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.510
 curling iron 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:20.560
 only we left now 30 minutes 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.560
 the product in her hair 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:30.090
 Good, but we already have hair drying . 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:33.890
 we show that the root and the curly 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:37.110
 how do we use a driving brush 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.540
 of the accounts is a stretch because 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.570
 of the progressive one that already has her hair 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.280
 Now we're going to make some show 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.520
 How do you make that kind of chapel? 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.520
 of hair 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:58.490
 Let's work with two plates with this one. 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:04:03.680
 330 degrees and this one with 170 degrees 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.220
 I was showing here on camera 170 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.270
 degrees 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.520
 the law and that maximum 150 that goes only in the 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.610
 root 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.610
 come on 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:24.830
 this mecha make this is the first plate 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.830
 two hundred and thirty degrees arrays 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.580
 we analyzed well arraes 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:45.030
 is the tv channel 13 which determine the 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:47.310
 government will in this 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.950
 important for you to pull your hair're the 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.350
 do the work of people who use 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.760
 comb to make a shape that the 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:59.070
 hair comes already classic for chapinha 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.100
 airport will not work even with 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.760
 This glove is very important for this alone. 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:09.570
 I'm pulling on the hair 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:12.270
 besides the sun in the root I take the other plate 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:17.670
 which is at 170 degrees 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:21.960
 step once or twice only in the account 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:25.110
 She's going to have a great time. 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.810
 carry out this account and then what happens 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.150
 No, she will not want her hair there. 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.050
 goes to a problem in making one more 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.050
 fuse for you to see 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:47.560
 note that here it is already smoother too 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:55.680
 screen and the root is already is the natural root 230 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:58.840
 gauss come on, pull with your hand 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:08.280
 this doubt that is cheap costs that 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:08.280
 a real $ 2 uses only arraes 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.810
 You have to pay but here the fastest. 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:28.210
 can spend a couple of times a little 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.210
 faster and ready 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.380
 We finished the plate on her fringe. 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.170
 let me show the fringe 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:41.050
 we made with the hottest plate 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.790
 because she wants a smooth fringe not 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.870
 realize that the window fan will stay 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:49.500
 different from the tips and now we're going 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.500
 wash the hair 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:07:03.310
 hair straight from root to tip curly 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:05.940
 and the smooth fringe as I said I already arrived 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.940
 the fringe 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:15.380
 the tips 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.380
 continuous in flames
