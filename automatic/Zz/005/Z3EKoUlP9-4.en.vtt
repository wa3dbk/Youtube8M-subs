00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.400
 everyone here we are again with new 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.220
 bitriÃ¡n on this occasion at the request of 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.240
 some users some writers the 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.439
 channel that are presenting problems or 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.050
 errors that come to them at the time of 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.259
 try to update or install some 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.340
 application in the store windows store and 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:38.090
 be in windows 8 or windows 8.1 for it 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.510
 let's use a command to 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.330
 reset what the store is and solve 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.750
 these problems that are presenting in 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.490
 this operating system is this command 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.390
 we can use the key or the 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.210
 combination of the windows + r key that 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.480
 will show us what the command is 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.920
 execute to write w 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.760
 s 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.850
 13 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.640
 point excel 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.920
 we can use this command 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.790
 or we can also access it 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.060
 by making the modern interface by 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.979
 here using the search engine and 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.170
 let's type then paste in this case 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.640
 the same command as you can see here 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.350
 this we can remove it from the screen 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:33.130
 let's go back to the search engine we are going to paste 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.560
 the command as you can see here is this 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.300
 we're just going to reset it once 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.800
 is reset is going to eliminate everything 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.800
 these problems you have to restart the 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.930
 operating system using this command does not 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.570
 it does not hurt anything, you do not have to start 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.590
 session and delete any application 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:54.860
 we are simply going to return it to its form 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.710
 default or default to the store 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.100
 to eliminate all the errors of 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.820
 update errors that can be 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.430
 present when trying 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.979
 update any application or try 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.300
 install application 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.250
 this is all I hope you like this 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.930

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.690
