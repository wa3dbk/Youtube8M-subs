give myself some Endermen pearl and now
i<00:00:41.510> can<00:00:41.900> now<00:00:42.079> i<00:00:42.350> can<00:00:42.710> now<00:00:42.920> do<00:00:42.980> this<00:00:45.910> teleport<00:00:46.910> yes

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
i can now i can now do this teleport yes

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.960 
i can now i can now do this teleport yes
that<00:00:47.870> is<00:00:48.050> right<00:00:48.340> wherever<00:00:49.340> you<00:00:49.520> throw<00:00:49.790> the

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
that is right wherever you throw the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.990 
that is right wherever you throw the
Endermen<00:00:50.300> pearl<00:00:51.070> wherever<00:00:52.070> it<00:00:52.160> lands<00:00:52.460> it

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
Endermen pearl wherever it lands it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.990 
Endermen pearl wherever it lands it
basically<00:00:53.809> teleports<00:00:54.410> you<00:00:54.559> it<00:00:55.309> does<00:00:55.579> damage

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
basically teleports you it does damage

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.910 
basically teleports you it does damage
you<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.820> it<00:00:58.820> doesn't<00:00:59.239> matter<00:00:59.300> where<00:00:59.719> you<00:01:00.110> throw

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
you so it doesn't matter where you throw

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.030 
you so it doesn't matter where you throw
it<00:01:01.040> from<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:02.570> basically<00:01:02.750> get<00:01:03.170> damaged<00:01:03.680> so

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
it from and you basically get damaged so

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.510 
it from and you basically get damaged so
i<00:01:04.369> guess<00:01:05.360> this<00:01:06.259> one<00:01:06.979> thing<00:01:07.219> is<00:01:07.520> make<00:01:08.030> sure<00:01:08.060> you

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
i guess this one thing is make sure you

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.840 
i guess this one thing is make sure you
have<00:01:10.520> a<00:01:10.549> full<00:01:11.509> health<00:01:11.799> full<00:01:12.799> hunger<00:01:13.670> bar

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
have a full health full hunger bar

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.800 
have a full health full hunger bar
whatever<00:01:14.810> it's<00:01:15.109> called<00:01:15.319> and<00:01:16.270> have<00:01:17.270> fun<00:01:17.509> with

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
whatever it's called and have fun with

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.300 
whatever it's called and have fun with
your<00:01:18.229> teleporting<00:01:18.859> maybe<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.700> can<00:01:21.159> so<00:01:22.159> it's

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
your teleporting maybe you can so it's

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.699 
your teleporting maybe you can so it's
definitely<00:01:22.639> not<00:01:22.759> cute<00:01:23.209> like<00:01:23.479> you<00:01:23.509> i<00:01:23.959> guess<00:01:24.560> you

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:24.709 
definitely not cute like you i guess you

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.779 
definitely not cute like you i guess you
can't<00:01:24.979> cube<00:01:25.549> this<00:01:25.990> orb<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.499> it<00:01:28.189> won't<00:01:28.369> move

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
can't cube this orb and it won't move

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.730 
can't cube this orb and it won't move
you<00:01:29.060> you<00:01:29.270> actually<00:01:29.600> have<00:01:29.689> to<00:01:29.840> right<00:01:30.200> click<00:01:30.229> on

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
you you actually have to right click on

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.219 
you you actually have to right click on
now<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.850> thing<00:01:32.029> about<00:01:32.060> creative<00:01:32.600> is<00:01:32.810> creative

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
now the thing about creative is creative

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.419 
now the thing about creative is creative
doesn't<00:01:33.499> really<00:01:33.619> let<00:01:33.829> you<00:01:33.979> right<00:01:34.249> click

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
can be used for let's say going down

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.940 
can be used for let's say going down
long<00:02:15.420> shafts<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.380> are<00:02:16.500> created<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:18.950> don't

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
long shafts that are created I don't

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.550 
long shafts that are created I don't
know<00:02:20.040> like<00:02:20.070> there<00:02:20.880> can<00:02:21.090> be<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.510> bunch<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.320> things
