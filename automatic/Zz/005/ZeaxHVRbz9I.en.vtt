00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
example so let's say we'll use

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.830 
example so let's say we'll use
californication<00:00:29.099> season<00:00:29.130> 3<00:00:29.880> episode<00:00:29.910> 11<00:00:30.390> it

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
californication season 3 episode 11 it

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.440 
californication season 3 episode 11 it
sits<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.410> tv<00:00:31.710> turns<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.250> last<00:00:32.460> 24<00:00:33.059> hours<00:00:33.090> so

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
sits on tv turns in the last 24 hours so

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.610 
sits on tv turns in the last 24 hours so
it<00:00:33.540> shows<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:33.930> probably<00:00:34.230> something<00:00:34.410> that's

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
it shows it's probably something that's

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.780 
it shows it's probably something that's
fairly<00:00:34.739> popular<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.550> want<00:00:35.760> to

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
promote so we'll go with that now the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.920 
promote so we'll go with that now the
first<00:00:38.579> step<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.360> need<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.570> find<00:00:39.840> a
