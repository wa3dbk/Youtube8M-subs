00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 What are the smartphones that are currently the most comparisons online? 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:13.309
 It's just Galaxy cf and Obsidian look 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:18.990
 It's a 5-inch-large smartphone and has a dedicated stylus. 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:26.269
 And there is a competition between Samsung and LG . 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.269
 So let's take a look at how our two-part smartphone differs from ours. 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.750
 U 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.620
 we 5 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:48.050
 222 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:51.160
 2 smartphones all equipped with a 5-inch display, but a little in aspect ratio 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.160
 I'm showing iron. 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.430
 Galaxy scares 1280 y 16 to 10 aspect ratios on 800 mountain trails 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.559
 While 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:06.009
 Have a look opji enabled 1024 4 3 ratio by 768 support groups 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.009
 There is 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.060
 Ilmo the Galaxy Note itjyo contact other English when I saw 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:25.720
 to our 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.720
 i was more of a relief prison pyeonhaejyeot when you view the US or magazine 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:40.000
 On 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:51.590
 So ot Bees screen of the application because the different rate and resolution 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.619
 No or Galaxy Real Screen Drippers can be seen wide 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.619
 on 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.360
 Completing the resolution of your apps application will give you a higher score in the Optimus view. 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:07.100
 I want to give it. 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:11.740
 Optimus View is a place where you can match your application resolution 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.740
 Because it provides a solution for 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:26.570
 Outside of the display, I went past the op mart ticket. 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:29.500
 Under bright light, it's better than Optimus 2 Galaxy Note 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.500
 I looked good. 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:37.890
 If both of these products are not satisfactory, you can also use one hand 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.880
 It was difficult to manipulate . 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:47.100
 It was slippery in meaning for the dragon-type Galaxy . 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:52.290
 The Optimus View uses rough textures, but the aspect ratio 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:56.550
 The Galaxy Note tube felt like a flux because it widened . 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:01.380
 0 Both products were inconvenient to operate with one hand 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:06.270
 or a little bit of tag 2 I could feel the naturalness 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:11.070
 In the battery section, Notimont ships do not lose the same as the iPhone 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:13.050
 If you consider the fact that the battery runs fast due to the nature of lte, 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.680
 That's the part. 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:22.650
 Galaxy Note uses the pen as a dedicated stylus. 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:26.260
 The Galaxy Note can be mounted on the body, which makes it portable, but small in size 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:30.160
 It can be a little frustrating to operate. 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:35.350
 On the other hand, Optimus View uses a rubber team. 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.270
 The only one left to fall hard, because cell spacing can not be the main body 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.920
 It is in a rubber material 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:46.960
 Because dm2 is not attracted, it is excellent in play feeling 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.240
 And the other thing about the 2 pens is that the Galaxy Note 2 s pen has a hip- 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.410
 It is possible 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:58.800
 Because the pressure of the user is recognized and the swelling can be adjusted 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.800
 More detailed line processing is possible to represent the picture 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:10.210
 Optimus also different views and wear gloves and a menu with x Pen button 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:13.420
 Write it was the best advantage of the buttons can be operated 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:18.130
 How about a very programmed pen ? 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:20.460
 Both products offer quick memo functionality, but there are some differences in how it works. 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.460
 I was there. 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:30.730
 First, Optimus View provides a physical button at the top, 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.500
 Because users can capture and leave notes, pin memo feature makes mistakes 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.910
 You can 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:41.880
 The Galaxy Note, on the other hand , has been used for a while. 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:47.710
 s You can double-tap the screen while holding down the button to run the pack note. 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:51.240
 If you press and hold the s10 button on the screen for the first time 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.240
 I was able to leave a note 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:02.540
 Note program Galaxy Note 2 s Memo 0 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:08.990
 Optimus View is equipped with a laptop. 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:12.980
 Optimus View laptops can choose a cover color or the like on the first screen 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:18.500
 The pen editor also shows the screen composition 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:24.830
 You could also change the font for the test and save one or more voice memos 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:27.370
 It is also possible to provide a read-only mode for both the function and the expanded input . 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.370
 It was one. 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:39.430
 Galaxy Note s memo was able to sort notes by folders in the same personality 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:44.139
 Notes that require security provide locking 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:46.720
 It has the ability to synchronize with the document to be burned so that you can back up your notes to a picture file 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:53.290
 It eupnida been Benefits 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:54.040

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.630
 Tao 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.630
 I did it quickly. 

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:15.399
 So far, the Galaxy Note as I haebwatneunde 6000 won duet wormwood 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:22.110
 How have you resolved the questions about the two products 

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:22.110
 Some products can not say negative body bar's profits during good and the 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:32.669
