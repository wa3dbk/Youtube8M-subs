over here the first one is you really
need<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.809> training<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.320> correct<00:00:34.649> way

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
need to be training in the correct way

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.150 
need to be training in the correct way
there's<00:00:36.210> many<00:00:36.660> people<00:00:36.960> out<00:00:37.020> there<00:00:37.079> who<00:00:37.590> don't

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
even realize it but they are training

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.580 
even realize it but they are training
completely<00:00:40.980> wrong<00:00:41.480> you<00:00:42.480> know<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.840> regards<00:00:43.170> to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
completely wrong you know in regards to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.860 
completely wrong you know in regards to
increase<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.100> their<00:00:44.219> vertical<00:00:44.399> leap<00:00:44.879> you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
increase in their vertical leap you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.959 
increase in their vertical leap you
really<00:00:46.140> must<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.739> training<00:00:47.219> your<00:00:47.370> fast-twitch

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
really must be training your fast-twitch

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.690 
really must be training your fast-twitch
fibers<00:00:48.469> you<00:00:49.469> have<00:00:49.620> slow<00:00:49.890> twitch<00:00:50.160> fibers<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
fibers you have slow twitch fibers and

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.020 
fibers you have slow twitch fibers and
fast-twitch<00:00:51.180> fibers<00:00:51.379> now<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> lot<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.710> people

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
fast-twitch fibers now a lot of people

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.310 
fast-twitch fibers now a lot of people
unknowingly<00:00:54.030> are<00:00:54.539> actually<00:00:54.870> training<00:00:55.140> their

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
unknowingly are actually training their

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.439 
unknowingly are actually training their
slow<00:00:55.559> twitch<00:00:55.860> fibers<00:00:56.309> which<00:00:56.969> are<00:00:57.120> great<00:00:57.420> for

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
slow twitch fibers which are great for

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.900 
slow twitch fibers which are great for
you<00:00:58.320> know<00:00:58.410> let's<00:00:58.620> say<00:00:58.800> long-distance<00:00:59.640> running

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
you know let's say long-distance running

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.770 
you know let's say long-distance running
but<00:01:00.660> not<00:01:00.809> great<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.559> quick<00:01:01.920> movements<00:01:02.579> like

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
but not great for quick movements like

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.140 
but not great for quick movements like
of<00:01:03.780> course<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:04.199> vertical<00:01:04.650> leap<00:01:04.860> or<00:01:05.700> quickness

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
of course a vertical leap or quickness

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.760 
of course a vertical leap or quickness
so<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:06.960> want<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.320> make<00:01:07.409> sure<00:01:07.470> your

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
so you really want to make sure your

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.130 
so you really want to make sure your
training<00:01:08.270> you<00:01:09.270> know<00:01:09.420> your<00:01:09.570> fast-twitch

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
training you know your fast-twitch

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.490 
training you know your fast-twitch
fibers<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.799> your<00:01:11.119> workout<00:01:12.119> program<00:01:12.570> because

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
fibers with your workout program because

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.880 
fibers with your workout program because
they're<00:01:13.619> really<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.979> key<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.790> high<00:01:15.119> intensity

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
they're really the key to high intensity

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.590 
they're really the key to high intensity
activity<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.159> jumping<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.060> sprinting

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
activity like jumping and sprinting

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.390 
activity like jumping and sprinting
secondly<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:22.049> really<00:01:22.350> need<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.650> work<00:01:23.189> on

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
secondly you really need to work on

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.960 
secondly you really need to work on
explosion<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.570> not<00:01:24.930> endurance<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.790> this

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
explosion and not endurance and this

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.660 
explosion and not endurance and this
kind<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.270> goes<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> fact<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.430> you<00:01:29.430> want

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
kind of goes to the fact that you want

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.520 
kind of goes to the fact that you want
to<00:01:30.110> create<00:01:31.110> muscles<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:34.229> know<00:01:34.259> do

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
to create muscles that can you know do

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.069 
to create muscles that can you know do
the<00:01:34.650> exercises<00:01:35.070> very<00:01:35.490> quick<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.060> very<00:01:36.119> strong

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the exercises very quick and very strong

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.539 
the exercises very quick and very strong
you<00:01:37.470> don't<00:01:37.650> want<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.159> building<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
you don't want to be building the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.390 
you don't want to be building the
endurance<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> muscle<00:01:40.100> because<00:01:41.100> again

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
endurance of the muscle because again

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.100 
endurance of the muscle because again
you<00:01:41.549> want<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.150> training<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.869> you're

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you want to be training like you're

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.039 
you want to be training like you're
running<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.250> 40-yard<00:01:44.820> dash<00:01:45.119> not<00:01:45.780> like

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
running you know a 40-yard dash not like

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.630 
running you know a 40-yard dash not like
you're<00:01:46.200> running<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.590> marathon<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.280> again<00:01:47.490> you

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
you're running a marathon so again you

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.550 
you're running a marathon so again you
want<00:01:47.729> those<00:01:47.970> fast-twitch<00:01:48.899> fibers<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.470> you

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
want those fast-twitch fibers and you

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.710 
want those fast-twitch fibers and you
want<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.829> working<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.220> explosion<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.180> not

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
want to be working on explosion and not

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.160 
want to be working on explosion and not
endurance<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.909> one<00:01:53.909> way<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.119> really<00:01:54.420> make

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
endurance and one way to really make

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.270 
endurance and one way to really make
sure<00:01:55.350> you're<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> right<00:01:55.799> track<00:01:55.950> when

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
sure you're on the right track when

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.130 
sure you're on the right track when
you're<00:01:56.430> doing<00:01:56.610> your<00:01:56.640> training<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.960> don't

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
you're doing your training is you don't

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.980 
you're doing your training is you don't
want<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.469> pacing<00:01:58.770> yourself<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.719> feel

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
want to be pacing yourself if you feel

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.499 
want to be pacing yourself if you feel
like<00:02:01.020> you're<00:02:01.259> pacing<00:02:01.469> yourself<00:02:02.360> chances<00:02:03.360> are

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
like you're pacing yourself chances are

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.030 
like you're pacing yourself chances are
you're<00:02:03.750> training<00:02:04.140> endurance<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.770> not

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
you're training endurance and not

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.399 
you're training endurance and not
explosion<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.600> again<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.869> want<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.140> be<00:02:07.200> doing

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
explosion so again you want to be doing

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.119 
explosion so again you want to be doing
exercises<00:02:08.369> with<00:02:08.780> lower<00:02:09.780> reps<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.979> know

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
exercises with lower reps and you know

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.850 
exercises with lower reps and you know
not<00:02:11.670> higher<00:02:12.000> reps<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.510> that's<00:02:12.660> one<00:02:12.870> way<00:02:13.020> to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
not higher reps and that's one way to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.740 
not higher reps and that's one way to
make<00:02:14.250> sure<00:02:14.280> you're<00:02:14.550> not<00:02:14.640> pacing<00:02:14.880> yourself<00:02:15.150> and

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
make sure you're not pacing yourself and

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.110 
make sure you're not pacing yourself and
also<00:02:16.230> make<00:02:16.560> sure<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:17.700> when<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.000> are

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
also make sure that when you are

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.020 
also make sure that when you are
training<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.870> know<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.200> workout<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.560> hard<00:02:20.040> it

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
training you know the workout is hard it

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.050 
training you know the workout is hard it
is<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:23.010> know<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.160> are<00:02:23.340> having<00:02:23.550> difficulty

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
is you know you are having difficulty

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.150 
is you know you are having difficulty
finishing<00:02:24.690> your<00:02:24.810> reps<00:02:25.080> make<00:02:25.830> sure<00:02:26.010> you're

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
finishing your reps make sure you're

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.370 
finishing your reps make sure you're
really<00:02:26.490> going<00:02:26.730> all<00:02:27.000> out<00:02:27.060> on<00:02:27.330> every<00:02:27.870> set<00:02:28.140> and

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
really going all out on every set and

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.090 
really going all out on every set and
not<00:02:29.100> kind<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.520> pacing<00:02:29.970> yourself<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.570> in<00:02:30.660> turn

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
not kind of pacing yourself and in turn

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.070 
not kind of pacing yourself and in turn
building<00:02:32.100> up<00:02:32.190> muscular<00:02:32.730> endurance<00:02:33.080> instead

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
building up muscular endurance instead

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.130 
building up muscular endurance instead
of<00:02:34.110> explosion<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:39.060> third<00:02:39.270> factor<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:39.750> you

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
of explosion the third factor is you

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.720 
of explosion the third factor is you
really<00:02:40.380> want<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.680> incorporate<00:02:41.130> multiple

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
really want to incorporate multiple

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.040 
really want to incorporate multiple
approaches<00:02:42.240> when<00:02:42.660> you're<00:02:42.780> doing<00:02:43.020> your

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
approaches when you're doing your

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.170 
approaches when you're doing your
vertical<00:02:43.500> training<00:02:43.890> there's<00:02:44.850> many

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
vertical training there's many

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.780 
vertical training there's many
approaches<00:02:45.570> out<00:02:45.959> there<00:02:46.250> for<00:02:47.250> example<00:02:47.640> there's

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
approaches out there for example there's

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.370 
approaches out there for example there's
plyometric<00:02:48.450> training<00:02:48.480> there's<00:02:49.080> weight

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
plyometric training there's weight

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.920 
plyometric training there's weight
training<00:02:50.209> there's<00:02:51.209> training<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.810> are

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
training there's training that are

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.020 
training there's training that are
involved<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.650> know<00:02:52.709> just<00:02:52.980> jumping<00:02:53.520> exercises

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
involved you know just jumping exercises

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.290 
involved you know just jumping exercises
and<00:02:54.390> all<00:02:55.110> of<00:02:55.230> those<00:02:55.350> three<00:02:55.650> are<00:02:55.739> great<00:02:56.300> and

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
and all of those three are great and

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.970 
and all of those three are great and
will<00:02:57.630> give<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.989> gains<00:02:58.290> but<00:02:58.530> if<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.739> really

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
will give you gains but if you really

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.430 
will give you gains but if you really
want<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.370> max<00:02:59.670> out<00:02:59.910> your<00:03:00.360> vertical<00:03:01.110> jumping

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
want to max out your vertical jumping

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.900 
want to max out your vertical jumping
ability<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.340> really<00:03:02.580> need<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.760> be

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
ability you really need to be

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.510 
ability you really need to be
incorporating<00:03:03.540> all<00:03:03.720> those<00:03:04.050> approaches<00:03:04.680> into

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
incorporating all those approaches into

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.699 
incorporating all those approaches into
your<00:03:05.640> training<00:03:06.090> if<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.230> want<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.470> be<00:03:07.530> doing

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
your training if you want to be doing

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.680 
your training if you want to be doing
plyometrics<00:03:08.070> you<00:03:08.700> want<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.000> be<00:03:09.090> using<00:03:09.420> weights

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
plyometrics you want to be using weights

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.280 
plyometrics you want to be using weights
you<00:03:10.650> want<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.890> be<00:03:10.950> doing<00:03:11.100> jumping<00:03:11.610> exercises

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
you want to be doing jumping exercises

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.449 
you want to be doing jumping exercises
you<00:03:13.290> really<00:03:13.500> want<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.770> be<00:03:13.860> incorporating

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
you really want to be incorporating

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.650 
you really want to be incorporating
multiple<00:03:14.580> approaches<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.420> you're<00:03:15.540> getting

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
multiple approaches so you're getting

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.930 
multiple approaches so you're getting
the<00:03:15.840> best<00:03:15.930> features<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.770> kind<00:03:17.520> of<00:03:17.610> all<00:03:17.790> the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
the best features of kind of all the

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.970 
the best features of kind of all the
programs<00:03:18.360> wrapped<00:03:18.810> into<00:03:19.019> one<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.470> therefore

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
programs wrapped into one and therefore

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.039 
programs wrapped into one and therefore
you're<00:03:20.250> really<00:03:20.549> going<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.730> max<00:03:21.090> out<00:03:21.360> your

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
you're really going to max out your

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:28.490 
you're really going to max out your
vertical<00:03:22.920> jump<00:03:22.950> potential<00:03:27.049> but<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.200> me<00:03:28.320> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
vertical jump potential but to me the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.350 
vertical jump potential but to me the
most<00:03:28.650> important<00:03:29.310> factor<00:03:29.820> that<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.000> need<00:03:30.239> to

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
most important factor that you need to

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.170 
most important factor that you need to
keep<00:03:30.540> in<00:03:30.720> mind<00:03:30.750> is<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.610> you<00:03:32.610> really<00:03:32.850> need<00:03:33.150> to

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
keep in mind is you you really need to

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.680 
keep in mind is you you really need to
get<00:03:33.600> on<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:34.200> program<00:03:34.799> that<00:03:35.549> addresses<00:03:35.700> all<00:03:36.390> the

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
get on a program that addresses all the

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.500 
get on a program that addresses all the
issues<00:03:37.110> i<00:03:37.140> just<00:03:37.709> talked<00:03:37.980> about<00:03:38.269> so<00:03:39.269> you<00:03:39.360> really

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
issues i just talked about so you really

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.560 
issues i just talked about so you really
need<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.900> find<00:03:40.080> a<00:03:40.230> program<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:41.150> is<00:03:42.150> geared

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
need to find a program that is geared

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.990 
need to find a program that is geared
towards<00:03:43.110> working<00:03:43.890> on<00:03:44.100> your<00:03:44.340> fast<00:03:44.700> twitch

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
towards working on your fast twitch

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.870 
towards working on your fast twitch
muscle<00:03:45.630> fibers<00:03:46.190> you<00:03:47.190> know<00:03:47.310> one<00:03:47.549> that<00:03:47.730> is

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
muscle fibers you know one that is

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.820 
muscle fibers you know one that is
geared<00:03:48.239> towards<00:03:48.600> explosion<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:49.680> not

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
geared towards explosion and not

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.130 
geared towards explosion and not
endurance<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.640> again<00:03:51.510> one<00:03:51.780> that<00:03:51.959> does

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
endurance and again one that does

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.440 
endurance and again one that does
incorporate<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:53.040> multiple<00:03:53.580> approaches<00:03:53.880> and

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
incorporate the multiple approaches and

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.240
