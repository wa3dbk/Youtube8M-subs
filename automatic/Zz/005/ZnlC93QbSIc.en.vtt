 allowed to follow the behavior of the animal even below the surface 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.540
 matera pubs attached to the collected material we noticed that it was 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.399
 of an adult individual about 2 and a half meters long 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.420

 inside the den and put it to rest on the seabed keeping the eyes closed 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:53.119
 this type of behavior was zatarra documented in yourself ip 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:58.129
