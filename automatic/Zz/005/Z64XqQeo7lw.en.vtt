00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.280
 Congratulations, girlhood! 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.120
 It’s great to hear this compliment. 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.720
 This single has been very popular in the past month, and we are very excited. 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.360
 What made us persist for so long? I must say of course because of our fans. 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.680
 Fans are the driving force for us to continue, fans let us get inspiration and creativity 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.200
 This return is dedicated to fans waiting for good music. 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.960
 We will release two new title songs in a few weeks. 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.900
 I hope these two songs will be the gifts we bring to the fans who have always supported us. 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.940
 Except this, just hearing this praise made me goose bumps. 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.000
 I heard that we broke through 10 million hits in the first week of publication. 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.140
 So I hope that fans will like more new songs launched in the second half of this year, thank you. 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.600
 Gee 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.720
 Really? you're lying! 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.260
 Let's ask other members 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.440
 "Party" 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.820
 Too said that it is "Party" 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.520
 I think most people in the group say "Gee" because we can sing together with the fans. 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.340
 This song has the best interaction and is one of the most interesting songs of the chorus, so I guess it is "Gee" in general. 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.200
 Nanshan! 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.080
 This place is a bit far, but if you go to Nanyang, there is a bicycle lane that is beautiful. 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:22.560
 The average tourist will not come here because of lack of time, but I recommend that you have time to go here to enjoy the scenery. 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:36.000
 Now in South Korea, it is summer, and it is also the season of smoothies. So there are many delicious smoothies in Korea. I think it is fun to eat smoothies everywhere. It is very interesting! 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.200
 Which area has delicious smoothies? I recommend Sanqingdong! 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.840
 Yes, Sanqingdong, Insadong, I recommend going to these places to eat smoothies! 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.760
 This is a new question 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:01.280
 So far, we only have the fifth album of the Girls’ Generation, which is being produced soon. 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:09.040
 I hope that if there is a chance, we will record these new songs in English. 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.240
 I believe that singing in English will be fun too. 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.560
 But now, it’s not done yet, I hope our company will support it. 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.040
 They heard the answer and then launched English songs for fans. 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.040
 Thank you 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.720
 Thank you very much for inviting us to come here. 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.240
 I hope that you like the show tonight. 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.400
 There are a lot of new songs, we specifically request to sing the latest tracks tonight. 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.040
 So I hope you like it. 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.640
 And we’re wearing this (American) patriotic costume for tonight. 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.240
 I hope you like it, thank you!
