00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
it's a really cool easy system it's

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.590 
it's a really cool easy system it's
actually<00:01:38.369> used<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.759> lot<00:01:38.940> for<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.240> harness

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
actually used a lot for the harness

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.990 
actually used a lot for the harness
portion<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.950> tether<00:01:41.190> portion<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.670> your<00:01:41.820> tree

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000

stand<00:01:42.300> safety<00:01:42.420> harness<00:01:42.990> generally<00:01:43.410> is<00:01:43.470> what

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
stand safety harness generally is what

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.639 
stand safety harness generally is what
they<00:01:43.740> do<00:01:43.800> for<00:01:44.039> that<00:01:44.270> alright<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:46.200> seat<00:01:46.440> on

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
they do for that alright so the seat on

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.770 
they do for that alright so the seat on
and<00:01:47.520> generally<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.970> fold<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.300> seat<00:01:48.509> forward

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and generally you fold the seat forward

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.150 
and generally you fold the seat forward
when<00:01:49.050> you're<00:01:49.170> climbing<00:01:49.440> some<00:01:49.830> people<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.130> think

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
when you're climbing some people I think

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.219 
when you're climbing some people I think
pulled<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.670> back<00:01:50.789> but<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.540> really<00:01:51.780> can't<00:01:52.049> fold

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
pulled it back but you really can't fold

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.420 
pulled it back but you really can't fold
it<00:01:52.350> back<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.680> situation<00:01:53.189> because<00:01:53.250> they

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
it back in the situation because they

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.560 
it back in the situation because they
would<00:01:53.580> get<00:01:53.640> caught<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:53.939> your<00:01:53.970> teeth<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.510> you

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
would get caught in your teeth and you

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.350 
would get caught in your teeth and you
don't<00:01:54.720> want<00:01:54.900> that<00:01:55.610> so<00:01:56.610> let's<00:01:56.909> go<00:01:56.970> put<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
don't want that so let's go put on the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.850 
don't want that so let's go put on the
tree<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.720> just<00:01:57.840> show<00:01:58.260> you<00:01:58.290> how<00:01:58.470> it<00:01:58.500> hooks<00:01:58.650> up

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
tree and just show you how it hooks up

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.170 
tree and just show you how it hooks up
to<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.220> a<00:01:59.340> pretty<00:01:59.490> small<00:01:59.760> tree<00:02:00.000> for

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
to it this is a pretty small tree for

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.460 
to it this is a pretty small tree for
this<00:02:00.270> again<00:02:00.600> we're<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:00.990> doing<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.260> quick

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
this again we're just doing the quick

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.810 
this again we're just doing the quick
tasks<00:02:01.860> here<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.070> show<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.280> guys<00:02:02.340> how<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.580> use

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
tasks here to show you guys how to use

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.120 
tasks here to show you guys how to use
it<00:02:02.970> but<00:02:03.060> generally<00:02:03.810> when<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.020> put<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> climber

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
it but generally when you put a climber

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.979 
it but generally when you put a climber
on<00:02:05.570> you<00:02:06.570> want<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.080> on<00:02:07.170> an<00:02:07.229> angle<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:08.989> as

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
on you want to have it on an angle so as

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.330 
on you want to have it on an angle so as
you<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.259> see<00:02:10.380> here<00:02:10.619> we're<00:02:10.950> not<00:02:11.070> gonna<00:02:11.190> really

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
you can see here we're not gonna really

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.460 
you can see here we're not gonna really
get<00:02:11.549> the<00:02:11.640> angle<00:02:11.880> I<00:02:11.910> want<00:02:12.230> usually<00:02:13.230> want<00:02:13.380> to

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
get the angle I want usually want to

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.199 
get the angle I want usually want to
angle<00:02:13.709> kind<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.070> like<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.880> as<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.090> work

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
angle kind of like this so as you work

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.110 
angle kind of like this so as you work
doing<00:02:15.450> at<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.600> trees<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.989> gets<00:02:16.110> smaller<00:02:17.120> it'll

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
doing at the trees it gets smaller it'll

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.699 
doing at the trees it gets smaller it'll
start<00:02:18.329> the<00:02:18.420> level<00:02:18.690> off<00:02:18.840> alright<00:02:19.320> so<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.560> comes

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
start the level off alright so it comes

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.740 
start the level off alright so it comes
this<00:02:19.829> little<00:02:20.010> toddler<00:02:20.430> piece<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.510> the

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
this little toddler piece this is the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.360 
this little toddler piece this is the
connector<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:22.380> your<00:02:22.500> two<00:02:22.709> stands<00:02:22.950> together

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
connector so your two stands together

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.800 
connector so your two stands together
you<00:02:23.640> got<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:24.000> have<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:24.269> on<00:02:24.450> it's<00:02:24.750> very

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
you got to have this on it's very

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.660 
you got to have this on it's very
important<00:02:25.380> because<00:02:25.500> if<00:02:25.920> your<00:02:26.250> feet<00:02:26.459> were<00:02:26.579> to

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
important because if your feet were to

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.520 
important because if your feet were to
give<00:02:26.820> way<00:02:27.060> or<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.420> top<00:02:27.630> piece<00:02:27.840> gave<00:02:28.079> way<00:02:28.260> these

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
give way or the top piece gave way these

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.840 
give way or the top piece gave way these
two<00:02:28.680> would<00:02:28.799> be<00:02:28.890> connected<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.489> you<00:02:29.579> wouldn't

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
two would be connected and you wouldn't

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.009 
two would be connected and you wouldn't
the<00:02:30.030> one<00:02:30.180> stand<00:02:30.420> cut<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.690> fall<00:02:30.840> from
