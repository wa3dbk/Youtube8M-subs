welcome back friends in the previous
video<00:00:07.230> we<00:00:07.410> have<00:00:07.620> talked<00:00:07.859> about<00:00:08.010> the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
video we have talked about the

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.570 
video we have talked about the
pathogenesis<00:00:09.450> scheme<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.950> DNA

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
pathogenesis scheme and the DNA

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.959 
pathogenesis scheme and the DNA
replication<00:00:12.090> process<00:00:12.719> for<00:00:13.049> the

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
replication process for the

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.460 
replication process for the
double-stranded<00:00:14.969> DNA<00:00:15.120> virus<00:00:15.660> as<00:00:15.839> well<00:00:16.230> as<00:00:16.350> we

double-stranded DNA virus as well as we

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.290 
double-stranded DNA virus as well as we
have<00:00:16.560> also<00:00:16.740> seen<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.730> replication<00:00:18.150> process

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
have also seen the replication process

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.470 
have also seen the replication process
of<00:00:19.070> positive<00:00:20.070> stranded<00:00:20.550> RNA<00:00:21.090> containing

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
of positive stranded RNA containing

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.630 
of positive stranded RNA containing
virus<00:00:22.020> now<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.980> video<00:00:23.310> we<00:00:23.519> are

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
virus now in this video we are

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.269 
virus now in this video we are
interested<00:00:24.150> in<00:00:24.330> knowing<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:25.350> DNA

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
interested in knowing that DNA

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.250 
interested in knowing that DNA
replication<00:00:26.820> process<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.570> negatively

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
replication process of negatively

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.420 
replication process of negatively
stranded<00:00:28.949> RNA<00:00:29.880> viruses<00:00:30.570> okay<00:00:31.140> now<00:00:31.859> before

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
stranded RNA viruses okay now before

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.160 
stranded RNA viruses okay now before
understanding<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.300> process<00:00:33.360> we<00:00:33.750> must<00:00:33.930> know

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
understanding this process we must know

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.350 
understanding this process we must know
what<00:00:34.380> are<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> positive<00:00:35.100> stranded<00:00:35.550> RNA<00:00:36.270> ins

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
what are the positive stranded RNA ins

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.350 
what are the positive stranded RNA ins
negative<00:00:36.870> stranded<00:00:37.200> RNA<00:00:37.649> are<00:00:37.890> now<00:00:38.820> positive

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
negative stranded RNA are now positive

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.750 
negative stranded RNA are now positive
stranded<00:00:39.719> RNA<00:00:40.079> means<00:00:40.290> remember<00:00:40.800> positive

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
stranded RNA means remember positive

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.380 
stranded RNA means remember positive
stranded<00:00:42.420> RNA<00:00:43.340> positive<00:00:44.340> stranded<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.879> -<00:00:45.270> so

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
stranded RNA positive stranded a - so

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.959 
stranded RNA positive stranded a - so
this<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.750> an<00:00:45.899> mRNA<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:47.250> know<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.550> mRNA

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
this is an mRNA and we know that mRNA

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.180 
this is an mRNA and we know that mRNA
can<00:00:48.270> produce<00:00:48.570> proteins<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.710> positive

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
can produce proteins the positive

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.100 
can produce proteins the positive
stranded<00:00:50.550> mRNA<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.149> produce<00:00:51.390> proteins

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
stranded mRNA can produce proteins

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.490 
stranded mRNA can produce proteins
directly<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:53.670> know<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.350> direct<00:00:55.350> a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
directly we all know that direct a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.410 
directly we all know that direct a
protein<00:00:55.980> synthesis<00:00:56.489> via<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.850> translation

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
protein synthesis via the translation

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.200 
protein synthesis via the translation
process<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.590> other<00:00:58.710> hand<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.579> negatively

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
process on the other hand the negatively

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.960 
process on the other hand the negatively
stranded<00:01:00.750> mRNA<00:01:02.780> cannot<00:01:04.159> produce<00:01:05.159> protein

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
stranded mRNA cannot produce protein

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.170 
stranded mRNA cannot produce protein
they<00:01:06.960> cannot<00:01:07.500> produce<00:01:07.799> protein<00:01:08.400> right<00:01:08.909> so

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
they cannot produce protein right so

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.590 
they cannot produce protein right so
that's<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.630> problem<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.060> case<00:01:12.360> we

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
that's the problem so in this case we

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.210 
that's the problem so in this case we
are<00:01:12.630> talking<00:01:12.840> about<00:01:13.310> RNA<00:01:14.310> virus<00:01:15.650> RNA<00:01:16.650> virus

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
are talking about RNA virus RNA virus

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.520 
are talking about RNA virus RNA virus
which<00:01:17.820> are<00:01:18.000> carrying<00:01:19.400> negative<00:01:20.509> mRNA

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
which are carrying negative mRNA

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:30.289 
which are carrying negative mRNA
molecule<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:26.390> Jing<00:01:27.439> genetic<00:01:29.210> material<00:01:30.210> or

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
molecule as as Jing genetic material or

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.679 
molecule as as Jing genetic material or
genetic<00:01:30.750> component<00:01:31.320> okay<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.240> case<00:01:33.509> what

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
genetic component okay in this case what

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.840 
genetic component okay in this case what
we<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:33.990> see<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.189> reason<00:01:35.250> what<00:01:35.729> we

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
we can see so for that reason what we

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.149 
we can see so for that reason what we
need<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.150> do<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.750> kind<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> viruses<00:01:37.680> so

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
need to do for this kind of viruses so

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.999 
need to do for this kind of viruses so
usually<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:38.939> kind<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.360> viruses<00:01:39.930> will<00:01:40.680> have

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
usually this kind of viruses will have

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.649 
usually this kind of viruses will have
and<00:01:42.890> surrounding<00:01:43.890> or<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> protein<00:01:44.549> coat<00:01:44.850> inside

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
and surrounding or a protein coat inside

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.440 
and surrounding or a protein coat inside
which<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.590> will<00:01:46.860> carry<00:01:47.310> its<00:01:47.700> positive

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
which it will carry its positive

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.600 
which it will carry its positive
negatively<00:01:49.020> stranded<00:01:49.439> mRNA<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> viral

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
negatively stranded mRNA so the viral

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.130 
negatively stranded mRNA so the viral
particle<00:01:51.060> will<00:01:51.149> look<00:01:51.329> something<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.750> this

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
particle will look something like this

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.499 
particle will look something like this
right<00:01:52.460> now<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.700> case<00:01:53.939> when<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> virus

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
right now in this case when the virus

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.660 
right now in this case when the virus
particle<00:01:54.560> dissociates<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.710> will<00:01:56.009> provide<00:01:56.399> us

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
particle dissociates it will provide us

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.389 
particle dissociates it will provide us
this<00:01:57.210> negative<00:01:57.450> stranded<00:01:58.170> mRNA<00:01:58.770> right<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.219> let

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
this negative stranded mRNA right so let

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.760 
this negative stranded mRNA right so let
me<00:01:59.579> draw<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.090> will<00:02:00.719> provide<00:02:01.049> us<00:02:01.290> this

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
me draw it will provide us this

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.850 
me draw it will provide us this
negatively<00:02:02.340> stranded<00:02:02.969> mRNA<00:02:03.689> now<00:02:04.200> once<00:02:04.500> we<00:02:04.710> get

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
negatively stranded mRNA now once we get

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.490 
negatively stranded mRNA now once we get
this<00:02:05.040> negatively<00:02:05.490> stranded<00:02:05.939> mRNA<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:07.320> is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
this negatively stranded mRNA this is

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.710 
this negatively stranded mRNA this is
not<00:02:07.740> enough<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.489> translate<00:02:09.000> into<00:02:09.270> proteins

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
not enough to translate into proteins

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.199 
not enough to translate into proteins
right<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.560> need<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.890> produce<00:02:11.209> positively

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
right so we need to produce positively

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.089 
right so we need to produce positively
stranded<00:02:12.629> M

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
stranded M

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.149 
stranded M
how<00:02:14.060> can<00:02:14.299> we<00:02:14.390> produce<00:02:14.599> it<00:02:14.930> we<00:02:15.349> can<00:02:15.530> produce<00:02:15.769> it

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
how can we produce it we can produce it

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.030 
how can we produce it we can produce it
by<00:02:16.549> using<00:02:16.819> this<00:02:17.420> negatively<00:02:17.930> stranded<00:02:18.439> mRNA

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
by using this negatively stranded mRNA

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.780 
by using this negatively stranded mRNA
as<00:02:19.219> a<00:02:19.329> template<00:02:20.329> so<00:02:20.540> use<00:02:21.049> it<00:02:21.319> as<00:02:21.499> a<00:02:22.219> template

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
as a template so use it as a template

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.699 
as a template so use it as a template
use<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:26.060> negative<00:02:26.659> distended<00:02:27.109> mRNA<00:02:27.590> as<00:02:27.650> a

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
use this negative distended mRNA as a

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.670 
use this negative distended mRNA as a
template<00:02:28.189> and<00:02:28.430> what<00:02:28.969> we<00:02:29.120> can<00:02:29.269> do<00:02:29.510> we<00:02:30.109> can<00:02:30.139> make

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
template and what we can do we can make
