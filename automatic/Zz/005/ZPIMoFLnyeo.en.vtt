looking<00:00:20.010> at<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.340> PSG<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.390> Brazil<00:00:21.750> center

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
looking at that PSG in Brazil center

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.349 
looking at that PSG in Brazil center
back<00:00:22.289> Thiago<00:00:22.650> Silva<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.430> them<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.180> your

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
back Thiago Silva and them on your

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.700 
back Thiago Silva and them on your
screens<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.109> second<00:00:25.380> you're<00:00:25.470> going<00:00:25.650> to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
screens in the second you're going to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.259 
screens in the second you're going to
see<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.980> side<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.220> used<00:00:26.670> him<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.939> playing

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
see the side I used him in playing

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.900 
see the side I used him in playing
alongside<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.529> center<00:00:28.920> back<00:00:29.099> Maicon<00:00:29.670> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
alongside the center back Maicon and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.269 
alongside the center back Maicon and
Maxwell<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.529> think<00:00:31.740> these<00:00:31.890> two<00:00:32.070> players

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
Maxwell and I think these two players

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.880 
Maxwell and I think these two players
had<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.700> particularly<00:00:33.390> important<00:00:34.350> role<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
had a particularly important role in the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.110 
had a particularly important role in the
way<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.070> which<00:00:35.160> he<00:00:35.280> performed<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.760> used<00:00:35.969> him<00:00:36.090> in

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
way in which he performed I used him in

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.510 
way in which he performed I used him in
about<00:00:36.239> eight<00:00:36.570> games<00:00:36.920> Gold<00:00:37.920> Cup<00:00:38.070> matches<00:00:38.280> and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
about eight games Gold Cup matches and

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.040 
about eight games Gold Cup matches and
single<00:00:38.820> matches<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.629> yeah<00:00:39.719> I'm<00:00:39.840> going<00:00:39.989> to

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
single matches but yeah I'm going to

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.780 
single matches but yeah I'm going to
explain<00:00:40.260> later<00:00:40.530> how<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> think<00:00:41.160> these<00:00:41.309> two<00:00:41.550> guys

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
explain later how I think these two guys

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.060 
explain later how I think these two guys
really<00:00:42.149> affected<00:00:42.690> his<00:00:42.899> style<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.440> game<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
really affected his style of game in the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.770 
really affected his style of game in the
matches<00:00:44.370> which<00:00:44.489> he<00:00:44.640> did<00:00:44.820> play<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.180> me<00:00:45.270> now

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
matches which he did play for me now

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.150 
matches which he did play for me now
taking<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.110> look<00:00:46.230> at<00:00:46.320> his<00:00:46.410> in-game<00:00:46.590> steps<00:00:47.039> we

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
taking a look at his in-game steps we

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.889 
taking a look at his in-game steps we
can<00:00:47.190> see<00:00:47.399> here<00:00:47.579> he's<00:00:47.730> 28<00:00:48.239> years<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.510> age<00:00:48.690> had

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
can see here he's 28 years of age had

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.389 
can see here he's 28 years of age had
probably<00:00:49.140> at<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.260> peak<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.739> his<00:00:49.800> defensive

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
probably at the peak of his defensive

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.279 
probably at the peak of his defensive
career<00:00:50.700> 6<00:00:51.270> foot<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.510> height<00:00:51.629> which<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
career 6 foot in height which is not the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.810 
career 6 foot in height which is not the
tallest<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> centre-back<00:00:53.370> but<00:00:53.610> still

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
tallest for a centre-back but still

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.430 
tallest for a centre-back but still
pretty<00:00:53.940> tall<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.449> enough<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> job<00:00:55.110> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
pretty tall and enough to do the job and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.830 
pretty tall and enough to do the job and
he<00:00:56.399> has<00:00:56.520> medium<00:00:56.730> high<00:00:57.030> work<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.510> which<00:00:57.690> I'm

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
he has medium high work for it which I'm

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.959 
he has medium high work for it which I'm
not<00:00:58.109> completely<00:00:58.739> ideal<00:00:59.219> what<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.579> ideally

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
not completely ideal what you ideally

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.760 
not completely ideal what you ideally
want<00:01:00.000> for<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> centre-back<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> low<00:01:01.590> high

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
want for a centre-back is a low high

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.799 
want for a centre-back is a low high
work<00:01:01.980> rate<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.699> can<00:01:02.910> be<00:01:03.090> caught<00:01:03.570> out<00:01:03.780> of

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
work rate so you can be caught out of

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.240 
work rate so you can be caught out of
position<00:01:03.930> sometimes<00:01:04.500> with<00:01:04.860> him<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.129> you're

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
position sometimes with him if you're

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.100 
position sometimes with him if you're
not<00:01:05.369> careful<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:06.270> he<00:01:06.390> does<00:01:06.540> have<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
not careful but he does have the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.260 
not careful but he does have the
three-star<00:01:07.770> weak<00:01:07.979> foot<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:08.820> he<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.060> caught

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
three-star weak foot so if he is caught

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.510 
three-star weak foot so if he is caught
in<00:01:09.450> tricky<00:01:09.720> situations<00:01:10.350> he's<00:01:10.500> able<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.890> get

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
in tricky situations he's able to get

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.830 
in tricky situations he's able to get
out<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.880> lot<00:01:12.000> easier<00:01:12.030> than<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.420> defender

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
out of it a lot easier than a defender

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.469 
out of it a lot easier than a defender
with<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.470> guess<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:14.670> cook<00:01:14.939> now

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
with up I guess we can we cook now

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.330 
with up I guess we can we cook now
moving<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.049> his<00:01:16.409> physical<00:01:16.590> attributes<00:01:17.220> we

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
moving on to his physical attributes we

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.999 
moving on to his physical attributes we
can<00:01:17.490> see<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.759> he<00:01:17.820> has<00:01:17.850> 80<00:01:18.270> acceleration<00:01:19.170> 84

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
can see that he has 80 acceleration 84

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.160 
can see that he has 80 acceleration 84
reactions<00:01:20.430> 82<00:01:20.939> sprint<00:01:21.240> speed<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.689> 80

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
reactions 82 sprint speed and 80

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.929 
reactions 82 sprint speed and 80
strength<00:01:22.710> not<00:01:23.130> really<00:01:23.310> focusing<00:01:23.640> too<00:01:23.759> much<00:01:23.790> on

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
strength not really focusing too much on

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.490 
strength not really focusing too much on
stamina<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.930> just<00:01:24.960> means<00:01:25.229> he<00:01:25.350> can

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
stamina because that just means he can

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.140 
stamina because that just means he can
perform<00:01:25.680> better<00:01:26.250> for<00:01:26.490> longer<00:01:26.759> during<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
perform better for longer during the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.539 
perform better for longer during the
game<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:28.020> um<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.680> attributes<00:01:29.159> i<00:01:29.220> mentioned

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
game but um the attributes i mentioned

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.210 
game but um the attributes i mentioned
before<00:01:29.579> before<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.220> acceleration

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
before before that the acceleration

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.700 
before before that the acceleration
agility<00:01:32.880> reaction<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.600> sprint<00:01:33.900> speed<00:01:34.049> all

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
agility reaction and sprint speed all

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.319 
agility reaction and sprint speed all
allowed<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.340> really<00:01:35.640> good<00:01:35.729> recovery<00:01:36.180> so

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
allowed to have really good recovery so

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.420 
allowed to have really good recovery so
remember<00:01:36.630> when<00:01:36.750> i<00:01:36.810> mentioned<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.650> he<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.310> be

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
remember when i mentioned that he can be

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.830 
remember when i mentioned that he can be
caught<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.759> position<00:01:38.850> due<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.600> work

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
caught out of position due to the work

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.020 
caught out of position due to the work
race<00:01:40.140> he's<00:01:40.860> able<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.250> recover<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.640> lot<00:01:41.850> quicker

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
race he's able to recover a lot quicker

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.600 
race he's able to recover a lot quicker
and<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.450> don't<00:01:42.540> notice<00:01:43.110> him<00:01:44.009> getting<00:01:44.490> out

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
and so you don't notice him getting out

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.090 
and so you don't notice him getting out
of<00:01:44.670> position<00:01:44.840> as<00:01:45.840> much<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.380> would<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.740> he

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
of position as much as you would if he

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.429 
of position as much as you would if he
didn't<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.520> these<00:01:47.640> attributes<00:01:47.850> now<00:01:48.810> the

thing<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.800> take<00:02:26.040> note<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.670> his<00:02:26.910> mental

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
thing to take note of in his mental

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.090 
thing to take note of in his mental
attributes<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.780> his<00:02:28.050> interceptions<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.980> which

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
attributes is his interceptions to which

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.030 
attributes is his interceptions to which
is<00:02:29.250> 94<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:31.050> think<00:02:31.350> that's<00:02:31.470> his<00:02:31.590> joint

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
is 94 and I think that's his joint

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.670 
is 94 and I think that's his joint
highest<00:02:32.370> attribute<00:02:32.580> alongside<00:02:33.330> marking<00:02:34.170> but

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
interceptions even when he was caught

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.400 
interceptions even when he was caught
out<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.700> position<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:39.240> I<00:02:39.360> said<00:02:39.630> his<00:02:40.020> agility

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
out of position like I said his agility

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.650 
out of position like I said his agility
and<00:02:40.770> reactions<00:02:41.250> allowed<00:02:41.520> him<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.940> get<00:02:42.510> back

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
and reactions allowed him to get back

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.720 
and reactions allowed him to get back
into<00:02:42.900> position<00:02:43.050> in<00:02:43.650> those<00:02:43.920> situations<00:02:44.520> and

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
into position in those situations and

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.520 
into position in those situations and
make<00:02:44.970> some<00:02:45.120> fantastic<00:02:45.780> interceptions<00:02:46.410> and

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
make some fantastic interceptions and

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.370 
make some fantastic interceptions and
interventions<00:02:47.400> in<00:02:47.550> am<00:02:48.150> certain<00:02:48.600> dangerous

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380

interventions in am certain dangerous
situations<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.430> guess<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.700> other<00:02:50.730> thing

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
situations and I guess the other thing

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.180 
situations and I guess the other thing
to<00:02:51.270> take<00:02:51.420> note<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.780> on<00:02:52.260> this<00:02:52.410> page<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.830> his

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
vision which is 74 which is not the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.720 
vision which is 74 which is not the
highest<00:02:55.380> but<00:02:55.980> for<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.160> centre-back<00:02:56.580> it's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
highest but for a centre-back it's

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.970 
highest but for a centre-back it's
pretty<00:02:57.000> decent<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.660> you'll<00:02:58.530> see<00:02:58.710> later<00:02:58.890> on
