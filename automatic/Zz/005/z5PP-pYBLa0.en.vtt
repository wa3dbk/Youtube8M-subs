torsion is to work on the Egret there's

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.979 
torsion is to work on the Egret there's
also<00:03:47.490> a<00:03:47.610> lot<00:03:47.790> of<00:03:47.819> storage<00:03:48.240> in<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.420> aft<00:03:48.599> wells

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
chose to have it just be extra storage

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.809 
chose to have it just be extra storage
it's<00:03:55.230> great<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.530> put<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.739> soft<00:03:56.040> sided<00:03:56.280> cooler<00:03:56.520> in

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
to have that plum there's a live well

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.400 
to have that plum there's a live well
you<00:04:02.069> can<00:04:02.190> certainly<00:04:02.400> do<00:04:02.760> that<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.300> a

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
you can certainly do that that is a

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.860 
you can certainly do that that is a
factory<00:04:04.410> option<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:06.390> on<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.630> other<00:04:06.750> side

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
factory option and on the other side

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.870 
factory option and on the other side
it's<00:04:07.230> going<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.380> be<00:04:07.470> my<00:04:07.800> oral<00:04:08.280> reservoir<00:04:08.850> I

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
it's going to be my oral reservoir I

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.699 
it's going to be my oral reservoir I

unit<00:04:14.660> another<00:04:15.660> great<00:04:15.900> thing<00:04:16.079> about<00:04:16.200> the

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
unit another great thing about the

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.830 
unit another great thing about the
16-foot<00:04:16.979> Egret<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.209> truly<00:04:18.419> self

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
16-foot Egret is that it truly self

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.349 
16-foot Egret is that it truly self
bails<00:04:19.250> there's<00:04:20.250> deep<00:04:20.519> gutters<00:04:20.910> on<00:04:21.060> all<00:04:21.209> the

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
bails there's deep gutters on all the

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.659 
bails there's deep gutters on all the
hatches<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:22.350> decks<00:04:22.620> are<00:04:22.800> cambered<00:04:23.280> so

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
hatches the decks are cambered so

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.460 
hatches the decks are cambered so
they're<00:04:24.060> slightly<00:04:24.479> arched<00:04:24.810> which<00:04:24.960> means<00:04:25.200> no

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
they're slightly arched which means no

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.040 
they're slightly arched which means no
water<00:04:25.740> gets<00:04:26.010> standing<00:04:26.430> anywhere<00:04:26.780> if<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:27.900> can

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
water gets standing anywhere if you can

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.300 
water gets standing anywhere if you can
look<00:04:28.200> at<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.410> side<00:04:28.560> you'll<00:04:28.830> see<00:04:28.889> that<00:04:29.070> the

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
look at the side you'll see that the

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.219 
look at the side you'll see that the
scupper<00:04:29.700> is<00:04:29.820> clearly<00:04:30.419> above<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.870> waterline

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
scupper is clearly above the waterline

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.170 
scupper is clearly above the waterline
the<00:04:31.889> deck<00:04:32.100> is<00:04:32.280> higher<00:04:32.460> than<00:04:32.669> that<00:04:32.910> so

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
the deck is higher than that so

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.560 
the deck is higher than that so
everything<00:04:33.450> bales<00:04:34.320> out<00:04:34.650> without<00:04:34.800> a<00:04:34.979> problem

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
everything bales out without a problem

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.909 
everything bales out without a problem
one<00:04:36.570> of<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.750> great<00:04:36.930> things<00:04:37.229> about<00:04:37.380> pulling

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
one of the great things about pulling

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.580 
one of the great things about pulling
this<00:04:38.070> boat<00:04:38.340> is<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.150> step<00:04:39.540> makes<00:04:40.139> it<00:04:40.260> easy<00:04:40.470> to

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
this boat is the step makes it easy to

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.810 
this boat is the step makes it easy to
get<00:04:40.740> up<00:04:40.889> onto<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.280> platform<00:04:43.580> well<00:04:44.580> there

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
get up onto the platform well there

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.390 
get up onto the platform well there
again<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:45.570> egrets<00:04:45.930> nice<00:04:46.169> and<00:04:46.500> stable<00:04:46.950> so<00:04:47.100> it's

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
again the egrets nice and stable so it's

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.300 
again the egrets nice and stable so it's
a<00:04:47.460> real<00:04:47.639> pleasure<00:04:48.000> to<00:04:48.180> pull<00:04:48.800> it's<00:04:49.800> very<00:04:50.039> light

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
a real pleasure to pull it's very light

the carbon kevlar model is very light
very<00:04:53.490> easy<00:04:55.070> you'll<00:04:56.070> notice<00:04:56.370> that<00:04:56.520> we're<00:04:56.669> very

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
very easy you'll notice that we're very

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.840 
very easy you'll notice that we're very
horizontal<00:04:58.289> at<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.470> waterline<00:04:58.800> it's<00:04:59.520> a<00:04:59.669> nice

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
horizontal at the waterline it's a nice

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.360 
horizontal at the waterline it's a nice
balanced<00:05:00.390> load<00:05:00.660> with<00:05:01.590> Chris<00:05:01.860> on<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.100> front
