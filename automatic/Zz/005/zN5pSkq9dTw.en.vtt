00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:11.540
 Inove Tech presents peasants at 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.910
 silage packing machine 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.070
 this technology has as objective the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.050
 medium and small producer 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.250
 increasing productivity and 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.039
 profitability 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.230
 determination in sustainability in the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.920
 field of your company property and 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.309
 promotes the diversification the peasant has 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.840
 reduction of the workforce as a priority. 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.430
 increasing their working capacity 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.920
 and production 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.899
 the peasant stores her silage 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.329
 smaller packages having then the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.579
 benefit better sealing facilitating 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.680
 much more the fermentation has a 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.750
 maintaining quality and maintaining a 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.940
 uniform compaction 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.070
 this technology allows ease in 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.309
 time to work because your packaging 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.520
 have a weight ranging from 25 to 35 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.940
 kilos of silage or storage is 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.989
 very practical it can be transported 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.330
 easily facilitating the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.090
 quantification of the weight by its unit 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.430
 in relation to some alternatives that 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.290
 we have nowadays the peasant has 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.670
 requirements that offers more advantages 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.130
 in this process it is single phase and 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.950
 automatic shutdown after each 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.470
 packaging may be to have a single person 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.869
 involved reducing service time 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.240
 and increasing the production the funnel has to 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.119
 capacity of approximately 100 kilos of 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.340
 silage can be bagged from a thousand to two 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.170
 thousand kilos per hour according to the number of 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.229
 workers involved 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.320
 results are guaranteed and approved 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.610
 peasant will also be available at 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.439
 company units fura and 9 tech 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.060
 technological solutions to help 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.060
 work of the medium and small producer
