00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
oops okay is it worth just checking it

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:06.160 
oops okay is it worth just checking it
as<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.330> go<00:02:05.450> down<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:05.689> just<00:02:05.959> sort<00:02:06.080> of

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
as you go down and just sort of

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.109 
as you go down and just sort of
adjusting<00:02:06.619> as<00:02:06.740> you<00:02:06.860> go<00:02:07.039> it<00:02:07.459> is<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:07.970> sometimes

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
enough to the teeth you can go in a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.589 
enough to the teeth you can go in a
little<00:02:11.750> bit<00:02:11.959> closer<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.590> okay<00:02:13.269> it's<00:02:14.269> easier

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
little bit closer and okay it's easier

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.509 
little bit closer and okay it's easier

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
where we actually make the seam ok I'll

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.080 
where we actually make the seam ok I'll
be<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.409> next<00:03:37.650> stage<00:03:37.859> ok<00:03:38.459> so<00:03:38.519> how<00:03:38.700> about<00:03:38.790> had<00:03:39.030> to

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
be the next stage ok so how about had to

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.629 
be the next stage ok so how about had to
read<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:39.269> out<00:03:39.419> right<00:03:39.810> ok<00:03:40.470> fold<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.489> up<00:03:42.169> here

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
read it out right ok fold this up here

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:48.979 
read it out right ok fold this up here
and<00:03:44.639> what<00:03:44.790> we've<00:03:44.909> got<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.180> do<00:03:46.069> is<00:03:47.069> make<00:03:47.340> sure<00:03:47.989> is

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
and what we've got to do is make sure is

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.970 
and what we've got to do is make sure is
it<00:03:49.139> this<00:03:49.260> way<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:51.169> our<00:03:52.169> stitching<00:03:52.769> lines

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
it this way that our stitching lines

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.970 
it this way that our stitching lines
match<00:03:53.340> up<00:03:53.609> and<00:03:53.849> join<00:03:54.709> perfectly<00:03:55.709> with<00:03:55.829> this

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
match up and join perfectly with this

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.759 
match up and join perfectly with this
line<00:03:56.760> here<00:03:57.090> but<00:03:57.629> where<00:03:57.989> we've<00:03:58.139> attached<00:03:58.409> is<00:03:58.620> it

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
line here but where we've attached is it

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.190 
line here but where we've attached is it
ok<00:03:59.370> so<00:03:59.669> it's<00:03:59.819> mostly<00:03:59.969> about<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.359> centimeter<00:04:00.959> in

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
ok so it's mostly about a centimeter in

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.789 
ok so it's mostly about a centimeter in
so<00:04:01.500> i<00:04:01.909> think<00:04:02.909> i'll<00:04:03.180> start<00:04:03.450> actually<00:04:03.599> at<00:04:04.590> this

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
so i think i'll start actually at this

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.369 
so i think i'll start actually at this
top<00:04:05.010> point<00:04:05.310> here<00:04:05.519> make<00:04:06.329> sure<00:04:06.359> there's<00:04:07.260> no

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
top point here make sure there's no

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.110 
top point here make sure there's no
puckering<00:04:07.829> can<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.430> use<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.669> same<00:04:08.849> presser
