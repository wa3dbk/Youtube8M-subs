both<00:02:17.310> take<00:02:17.550> damage<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.180> then<00:02:18.599> you<00:02:18.840> lose<00:02:19.140> and

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.880 
then
so<00:02:26.350> that<00:02:26.560> you've<00:02:26.710> got<00:02:28.050> less<00:02:29.050> Life<00:02:29.380> Points<00:02:29.620> than

your opponent had enough to take the

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.700 
your opponent had enough to take the
blow<00:02:33.210> so<00:02:34.210> let's<00:02:34.810> say<00:02:35.020> Francis<00:02:35.410> you've<00:02:35.560> got<00:02:35.680> a

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
badness because ring of defense is still

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.910 
badness because ring of defense is still
hovering<00:03:04.330> so<00:03:05.020> they<00:03:05.380> could<00:03:05.620> do<00:03:05.740> something

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
hovering so they could do something

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.950 
hovering so they could do something
about<00:03:06.010> ringing<00:03:06.400> defense<00:03:06.730> but<00:03:07.270> ringing

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
about ringing defense but ringing

you go against imagine were in a defense

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.650 
you go against imagine were in a defense
so<00:03:14.490> when<00:03:15.490> defense<00:03:15.880> is<00:03:16.000> not<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.210> problem<00:03:16.450> this

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
so when defense is not the problem this
