00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.609
 sport is nature 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.480
 these paths 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.529
 free hiking must be equipped from head to toe 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:25.960

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.859
 the hiker canucks ap new shoes gave it's a 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.610
 shoe that will have a good shot for the image to have a good grip 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.310
 in all types of terrain 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.700
 a good deal of damping sense for comfort 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.460
 we did our shopping shoes backpacks respecting the 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.460
 rule of three index slices a polar 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.490
 the equipment depends on the level and terrain of the hike 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.360
 for an easy hike let's say the bird-lyre on paths with little 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.690
 of elevation difference the equipment first price of the hiker 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.320
 rises with 76 euros 50 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.399
 for a hike 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.520
 presenting on uneven ground for example it is not necessary a equipment 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.429
 more technical 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.390
 289 euros 50 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.370
 and the hiker and mossi accessories for about thirty euros 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.200
 the sticks save 15% of the strong uphill 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.840
 like downhill when you're st and that's a bit heavy 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.300
 the fact of having sticks of the saga but also to carry the bag is it for 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.940
 hikers paying or for him this summer not these hikers 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.690
 careful 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.080
 so that in order to save a little bit his back and hiker cautious for 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.790
 avoid those moments of loneliness lost to a map 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.510
 I have four and a half inches can in addition to his compass to 20

 and the little more of this type two gps is actually enough power 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.080
 suffered and his hike 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.159
 on to the usher cartography 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.420
 know exactly 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.020
 now we have gone and thus be able to calculate the elevation differences 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.280
 as well as the distance traveled and for the addicts to the rando the license costs 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.280
 less than 30 euros 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.290
 it allows to be assured to participate in the maintenance of the trails 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.520
 and then to realize that nature is free but that it's worth 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.260
 the stroke of respecting it 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.500
