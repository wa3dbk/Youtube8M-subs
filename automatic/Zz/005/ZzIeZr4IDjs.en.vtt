00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
both melons and pumpkins farmable so you

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.950 
both melons and pumpkins farmable so you

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
can grow them both at a central stem

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.680

like<00:00:31.170> slowly<00:00:31.560> grows<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.160> max<00:00:32.340> sighs<00:00:32.640> when<00:00:33.540> it's

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
like slowly grows to max sighs when it's

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.770 
like slowly grows to max sighs when it's
max<00:00:33.930> size<00:00:34.610> it<00:00:35.610> will<00:00:35.760> randomly<00:00:36.210> spawn<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> fruit

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
max size it will randomly spawn a fruit

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.479 
max size it will randomly spawn a fruit
next<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:37.469> there<00:00:37.649> isn't<00:00:37.920> one<00:00:38.040> next<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.460> it

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
next to it if there isn't one next to it

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.819 
next to it if there isn't one next to it
at<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.450> moment<00:00:39.480> we<00:00:40.020> might<00:00:40.230> add<00:00:40.440> even<00:00:40.680> more

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
at the moment we might add even more

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.600 
at the moment we might add even more
farming<00:00:41.430> options<00:00:41.879> if<00:00:42.090> needed<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.190> basically

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
farming options if needed so basically

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.220 
farming options if needed so basically
they're<00:00:45.510> going<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:47.570> farmable<00:00:48.570> melons
