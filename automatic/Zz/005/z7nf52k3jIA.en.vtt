they only loaded five chambers for
safety<00:01:51.539> purposes<00:01:52.789> well<00:01:53.789> the<00:01:53.909> way<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.329> thing

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
safety purposes well the way this thing

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.340 
safety purposes well the way this thing
is<00:01:54.689> designed<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:56.100> could<00:01:56.810> wrest<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> hammer

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
is designed you could wrest the hammer

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.429 
is designed you could wrest the hammer
in<00:01:58.770> between<00:02:00.289> the<00:02:01.460> live<00:02:02.460> cylinders<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.539> I

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
in between the live cylinders and I

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.559 
in between the live cylinders and I
think<00:02:04.710> my<00:02:04.889> point<00:02:05.249> would<00:02:05.460> be<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.240> was

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
think my point would be that if I was

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.309 
think my point would be that if I was
out<00:02:07.190> in<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.250> battlefield<00:02:08.729> expecting<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.929> in

the<00:02:59.489> chamber<00:03:02.060> it's<00:03:03.060> comforting<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.930> know<00:03:03.959> that

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
the chamber it's comforting to know that

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.920 
the chamber it's comforting to know that
the<00:03:04.590> these<00:03:04.980> bullets<00:03:05.549> are<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.819> bit<00:03:06.150> oversized

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
the these bullets are a bit oversized

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.369 
the these bullets are a bit oversized
and<00:03:07.620> what<00:03:08.519> that<00:03:08.730> does<00:03:09.090> for<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:10.700> is<00:03:11.700> it

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
and what that does for you is it

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:18.909 
and what that does for you is it
perfectly<00:03:13.379> seals<00:03:14.040> off<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:17.239> loaded<00:03:18.239> chamber

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:18.919 
perfectly seals off the loaded chamber

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.860 
perfectly seals off the loaded chamber
from<00:03:19.919> the<00:03:20.040> blast<00:03:20.579> that's<00:03:21.090> going<00:03:21.449> to<00:03:21.659> take

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
from the blast that's going to take

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.610 
from the blast that's going to take
place<00:03:22.280> when<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.579> adjacent<00:03:25.129> chamber<00:03:26.129> is<00:03:26.459> fired

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
place when the adjacent chamber is fired

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.589 
place when the adjacent chamber is fired
so<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.799> little<00:03:29.040> bullet<00:03:29.250> gets<00:03:29.699> laid<00:03:30.000> right<00:03:30.359> in

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
so the little bullet gets laid right in

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:38.960 
so the little bullet gets laid right in
here<00:03:31.019> like<00:03:31.199> this<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:33.650> with<00:03:34.650> our<00:03:34.889> rammer<00:03:37.970> that

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
here like this and with our rammer that

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.259 
here like this and with our rammer that
bullet<00:03:39.449> gets<00:03:39.840> rammed<00:03:40.530> all<00:03:40.979> the<00:03:41.310> way<00:03:41.459> down<00:03:41.849> into

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
bullet gets rammed all the way down into

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.479 
bullet gets rammed all the way down into
the<00:03:42.810> chamber<00:03:44.720> and<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:45.780> basically<00:03:46.620> is<00:03:46.769> the

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
the chamber and that basically is the

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.680 
the chamber and that basically is the
loading<00:03:48.000> sequence<00:03:49.549> now<00:03:50.549> I've<00:03:50.760> kind<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.239> taken

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
loading sequence now I've kind of taken

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.550 
loading sequence now I've kind of taken
the<00:03:52.129> liberty<00:03:53.129> to<00:03:53.599> to<00:03:54.599> load<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:54.840> couple<00:03:55.199> of<00:03:55.409> these

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
the liberty to to load a couple of these

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.009 
the liberty to to load a couple of these
chambers<00:03:55.919> in<00:03:56.370> advance<00:03:56.819> rather<00:03:57.269> than<00:03:57.629> going<00:03:57.840> to

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
chambers in advance rather than going to

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.149 
chambers in advance rather than going to
the<00:03:58.879> repetitious<00:03:59.879> repetitious<00:04:01.159> loading

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
the repetitious repetitious loading

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.390 
the repetitious repetitious loading
cycle<00:04:02.729> so<00:04:03.389> what<00:04:03.629> we<00:04:03.750> have<00:04:03.959> to<00:04:04.139> do<00:04:04.319> now<00:04:04.560> is<00:04:04.590> come

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
cycle so what we have to do now is come

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.070 
cycle so what we have to do now is come
up<00:04:05.549> with<00:04:05.579> some<00:04:06.120> caps<00:04:07.939> okay<00:04:08.939> here<00:04:09.239> goes<00:04:09.449> the<00:04:09.720> cap

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
up with some caps okay here goes the cap

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:18.080 
up with some caps okay here goes the cap
over<00:04:11.950> what<00:04:12.220> is<00:04:12.370> called<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:13.390> nipple<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.970> gun

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.530 

rotated<00:04:19.090> cylinder<00:04:19.989> to<00:04:20.170> the<00:04:20.230> next<00:04:20.790> chamber

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.640 

place<00:04:25.540> a<00:04:25.570> cap<00:04:25.990> on<00:04:26.410> that<00:04:27.720> was<00:04:28.720> interesting<00:04:29.440> to

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
place a cap on that was interesting to

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.720 
place a cap on that was interesting to
note<00:04:29.860> that<00:04:31.920> cavalry<00:04:32.920> especially<00:04:33.700> cavalry<00:04:35.730> who

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
note that cavalry especially cavalry who

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.560 
note that cavalry especially cavalry who
might<00:04:36.940> be<00:04:37.120> going<00:04:37.450> out<00:04:37.600> on<00:04:37.660> a<00:04:37.900> long<00:04:38.260> patrol<00:04:38.890> and

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
might be going out on a long patrol and

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.570 
might be going out on a long patrol and
under<00:04:40.570> very<00:04:40.930> wet<00:04:41.500> and<00:04:41.680> rainy<00:04:41.980> conditions<00:04:44.580> they

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
under very wet and rainy conditions they

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.780 
under very wet and rainy conditions they
had<00:04:45.850> a<00:04:45.880> little<00:04:46.180> way<00:04:46.420> of<00:04:47.370> protecting<00:04:48.370> these

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
had a little way of protecting these

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.900 
had a little way of protecting these
caps<00:04:49.530> while<00:04:50.530> they<00:04:50.770> were<00:04:50.830> riding<00:04:51.430> along<00:04:51.520> on<00:04:51.880> a

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
caps while they were riding along on a

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.410 
caps while they were riding along on a
horse<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:52.630> that<00:04:53.070> was<00:04:54.070> to<00:04:54.940> simply<00:04:55.720> smear<00:04:56.350> towel

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
horse and that was to simply smear towel

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.040 
horse and that was to simply smear towel
over<00:04:58.420> top<00:04:58.930> of<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.230> cap<00:04:59.500> and<00:05:00.270> when<00:05:01.270> the<00:05:01.570> hammer

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
over top of the cap and when the hammer

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.260 
over top of the cap and when the hammer
struck<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.680> cap<00:05:02.920> of<00:05:03.160> course<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.700> would<00:05:03.880> ignite

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
struck the cap of course it would ignite

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.170 
struck the cap of course it would ignite
and<00:05:04.540> fire<00:05:04.780> right<00:05:05.110> for<00:05:05.380> you<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:05.590> tell<00:05:05.830> oh<00:05:06.180> I'll

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
and fire right for you to tell oh I'll

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.380 
and fire right for you to tell oh I'll
make<00:05:07.450> one<00:05:07.690> little<00:05:07.930> a<00:05:08.140> side<00:05:08.470> note<00:05:08.890> here<00:05:09.390> for

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.240 
make one little a side note here for
those<00:05:10.600> of<00:05:10.840> you<00:05:11.020> who<00:05:11.230> remember<00:05:11.530> going<00:05:11.920> to<00:05:12.040> the

old Saturday afternoon matinees when the

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.520

Cowboys<00:05:16.540> were<00:05:16.870> riding<00:05:17.410> down<00:05:17.440> on<00:05:17.710> the<00:05:18.190> villains

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
Cowboys were riding down on the villains

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.730 
Cowboys were riding down on the villains
they<00:05:20.530> would<00:05:20.770> typically<00:05:21.310> go<00:05:21.850> BAM<00:05:22.810> then<00:05:23.470> they'd

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
they would typically go BAM then they'd

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.060 
they would typically go BAM then they'd

cock for the next discharge the reason
for<00:05:31.630> that<00:05:31.690> is<00:05:32.230> because<00:05:32.490> with<00:05:33.490> these<00:05:33.760> guns<00:05:35.370> once

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
for that is because with these guns once

for that is because with these guns once
the<00:05:36.700> cap<00:05:37.330> has<00:05:37.600> been<00:05:37.660> fired<00:05:39.420> it<00:05:40.420> kind<00:05:41.020> of<00:05:42.510> what

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
the cap has been fired it kind of what

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.990 
the cap has been fired it kind of what
they<00:05:43.660> call<00:05:43.870> frank<00:05:44.380> eighths<00:05:44.740> it<00:05:45.100> goes<00:05:45.640> in<00:05:45.880> two

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
they call frank eighths it goes in two

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.560 
they call frank eighths it goes in two
parts<00:05:46.420> and<00:05:46.690> those<00:05:47.620> parts<00:05:48.130> can<00:05:48.370> fall<00:05:48.700> down<00:05:48.730> in

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
parts and those parts can fall down in

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.150 
parts and those parts can fall down in
the<00:05:49.690> inside<00:05:50.410> of<00:05:50.920> the<00:05:51.580> mechanism<00:05:52.300> and<00:05:52.980> if<00:05:53.980> that

the inside of the mechanism and if that

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.780 
the inside of the mechanism and if that
happens<00:05:54.790> you're<00:05:55.630> out<00:05:55.780> of<00:05:55.810> business<00:05:56.790> you

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
happens you're out of business you

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.570 
happens you're out of business you
cannot<00:05:58.210> shoot<00:05:58.600> another<00:05:59.140> shot<00:05:59.500> until<00:06:00.130> you<00:06:00.250> sit

cannot shoot another shot until you sit

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.560 
cannot shoot another shot until you sit
down<00:06:00.990> get<00:06:01.990> a<00:06:02.020> stick<00:06:02.530> or<00:06:02.830> some<00:06:03.550> convenient<00:06:04.300> tool

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
down get a stick or some convenient tool
