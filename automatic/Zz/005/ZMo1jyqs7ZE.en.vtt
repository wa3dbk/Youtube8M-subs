00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.049
 the smallest man in the field played a big game tom last night 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.260
 hiariej respect had no problem with the opponent and as a crown on his good 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.820
 game he scored in the last minute the 25 year old gentleman Peter could score 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.109
 never in that position 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:18.009
 and aria's cordoba yes you do not know what happens in the figures I have to do 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.499
 to be able to be there nowadays I also had a great time playing against them 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:25.820
 against fc twente in the center now know me on the right in the match 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.230
 getting better actually 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.890
 and if you see it also a lot of ordinary and what just big is in me a 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.590
 good 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.180
 and the same group one that completely and then one year so that they so 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.550
 finish with such a goal 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.260
 perpetrators of the murder groningen had revenge for the 5 and last night 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.770
 defeated against NSC earlier this season 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.800
 in the euroborg, distributors scored mountains twice, just once 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.039
 like a professional rider 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:50.879
 through that 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.789
 but actually ron jans didn't want to know anything about one in advance 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.460
 any to that of marche if your motivation should put the negative out 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.840
 things I don't believe in that I think you should remove your motivation from the eu 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.830
 the european football stand get the power a home match in the police 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.350
 in emmen and the form that we show 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.310
 that finds a much more important market and you can go ahead with it and the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.730
 another day but for a man 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.070
 before a competition 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.119
 and that the fact that that is also true in the final phase will have some fun of singing choirs 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.909
 shares that again had to do with that other match with later anyway 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.920
 loosely according to anchor the ns wants to humiliate in the final phase by raising the ball high 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.869
 holding and muffling stood with feet on the ball with hands on the side 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.350
 the public could not appreciate it and neither did Jansen sporting about it 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.249
 and I hope that it will be the last time that if you do something 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:38.300
 because I don't mind the euro 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.370
 dea that then that it is actually about war over but I think they are 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.840
 maybe they have learned now 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.420
 that they themselves no longer do a sequel the stock exchanges is also indicate 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.110
 actually so 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.110
 and then they were happy again 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.430
 ir it is a piece of theater jans is not strange some houses below 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.469
 another one from jans 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.009
 nice step up then to Rotterdam at Feyenoord
