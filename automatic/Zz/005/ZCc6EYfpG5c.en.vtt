00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.519
 Hello everyone went I took another 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.800
 the package here is your watch 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.490
 alarm clock desktop only this 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.800
 time i took 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.410
 different design and size 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.269
 big ones that were at an affordable price on 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.800
 aliexpress cost was 28 dollars 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.130
 the cheapest 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.349
 it was the cheapest that was 28 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.469
 dollars seller rated them 5 bucks 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.989
 he arrived in my 20 days let's 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.890
 simple mail by the way yes something simple 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.730
 mail began quickly 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.710
 come let's unpack 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.710
 let's see what the seller himself imposed 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.350
 there is a way one-to-one same tv watch 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.379
 by design they cost $ 10 15 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.739
 but it is the dimensions they have themselves small 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.689
 I was looking for small ones on my own 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:09.810
 okay so big box, all in 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:12.689
 changed but I think it's not scary well done 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.880
 served packed all that previous 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.799
 the seller at that seller 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.689
 the previous one will not played until delivery 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.979
 it was amazing fast but but 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.720
 the packaging was very bad 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:32.009
 Here we have, though a little bit longer but 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:36.930
 at least so worthy of packaging 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:40.400
 secretly so packed for much bigger 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.400
 more were previous 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.380
 the link and the watch itself can also 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:55.770
 immediately the power supply before immediately under our 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:02:02.580
 herringbone how many 5 volts to 0 5 amps 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.580
 that day open watch packed 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.390
 Here are such a miracle watch without a scoreboard 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.080
 it turns out here will glow should 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.780
 be seen on the idea so how up here 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:23.130
 here down here in on the little ones 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:26.160
 batteries are big now let's see 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.720
 it is necessary to check here already 4 fingers 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.690
 which format is also big 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.880
 2a she 'll probably take a second now 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.570
 little batteries do not know how much they are 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.850
 sunk 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:42.250
 let's check but what if yes you can 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.460
 that the power supply them just run 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.070
 goes to the batteries here such 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.660
 green on the video is wrong 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.290
 it appears to us more or less here 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.989
 lime 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.080
 she video on camera some more 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.360
 bluish may the source be the same 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.600
 as in my original but such 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.780
 the participants are interesting only I don't know how 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:11.020
 They are here in principle, everything is not so cool 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:12.820
 bright and made as if under furniture such 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.360
 know riffling or what's it called 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.860
 I don't know this kind of wood color 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.830
 white ivory 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.830
 called in my opinion this is the power supply y 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:29.040
 we can be obtained so from the network yes 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:32.530
 so interesting but in principle even 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.470
 loud about a degree even from fahrenheit 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.540
 and celsius 22 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.540
 no on it 22 not 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:48.500
 here is an alarm clock so it's scatter 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.760
 Yes, in principle, normal watch with 28 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.850
 dollars they even have such 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.660
 it’s not a piece of plastic 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.860
 inside a piece of microcircuit like those were 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.680
 whether previous were Khimki 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.830
 so sorry battery in the chamber sat 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.720
 unplugged the camera did not notice so already 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.490
 got these batteries out 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.740
 unscrewed the back cover here it turns out 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.830
 put the cake battery rather 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:16.040
 total if you pull up your fingers 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.310
 then the background will work 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.590
 alarm clock does not seem so sure I do not know 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.320
 so let's check the power supply now 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.070
 how does it work or not? 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.330
 we are near here 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.900
 Rosette watch for the way interesting can be 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.120
 tune 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.040
 with an interval of five seconds will be 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.760
 show time then date later 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.640
 the temperature 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.120
 Well, change the time so as 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.860
 written in the lot from the seller 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.470
 another interesting nuance is that 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.960
 parts throw merkado connected scoreboard 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.710
 Well, the power saving mode is most likely 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.210
 for cotton they will turn on someone not 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.270
 I know how sensitive this cotton is 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:01.190
 up to 1 everyone earned from eating without 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:08.960
 batteries, in principle, is normal only here 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:11.450
 I do not know how they work here and not 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.290
 disconnect you wait until it goes out 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:19.460
 scoreboard or exhibit and then a cotton 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:21.530
 they will turn on don't know wait or 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.560
 don't wait for the ads to go out 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.080
 In principle, you can adjust the clock 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.880
 choose a different color exterior 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.710
 the scoreboard can also choose there 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.560
 black for example blue dial with 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.630
 red is the same with red blue 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.970
 I think there is some pink 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.280
 you can choose a different type in hours 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.370
 Seller's reference will be filed under 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.770
 the video is sure to be okay 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.230
 Worthy of course packaging 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.750
 better but also the muzzles 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.820
 enough for these hours and delivery 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.070
 also simple mail pretty quickly 20 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:58.240
 days all the same so on not go out and 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.040
 she is in silence to sit so that they 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.980
 went out 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:07.600
 only time goes I don’t know I don’t 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:11.580
 such a tablet battery so 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.580
 check fail these we checked 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:18.600
 so reset this seedling reset enable 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.600
 turn off 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:34.420
 she generally turned off completely turned off 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:40.960
 of tax we have a temperature here to leave 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:43.330
 On the date, yes, he is here somehow functions 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.230
 understand sit properly 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:51.970
 don't do anything yet 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:56.680
 let's try again this recently 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:07:00.480
 just turn off well, basically these are 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:03.700
 middle name and so you can buy 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:08.490
 looks cool that began to change 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.490
 and myth by degrees every five seconds yes 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:17.200
 whether or not it is still necessary to have a second post 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.210
 now yes it turns out later 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.510
 temperature 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:25.600
 give the interval is unclear well cool 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:27.190
 cool we still have to figure out how to 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.560
 turn off and then you can 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.780
 turn on cotton 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.420
 Is it at a distance a stand measure somewhere 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.090
 will stand far away at night such a color 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:39.700
 light green will be quite distinguishable and very 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:43.420
 it will be well visible both temperature and time 

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:46.660
 and the date if you suddenly wake up at night or 

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:49.390
 early in the morning these are the cases 

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.590
 I recommend the seller if you need a video 

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.170
 like put likes write 

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:57.270
 comments subscribe to my channel 

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:57.270
 and thank you all for watching all bye
