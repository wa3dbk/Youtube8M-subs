00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
of the first thing I recommend with any

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.900 
of the first thing I recommend with any
detergent<00:00:33.039> is<00:00:33.280> to<00:00:33.430> check<00:00:33.609> out<00:00:33.760> the

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
detergent is to check out the

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.389 
detergent is to check out the
ingredients<00:00:34.000> and<00:00:34.570> in<00:00:35.320> almost<00:00:35.469> every<00:00:35.829> case<00:00:36.010> the

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
ingredients and in almost every case the

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.520 
ingredients and in almost every case the
shorter<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:36.850> list<00:00:37.059> the<00:00:37.300> better<00:00:37.510> so<00:00:38.379> if<00:00:38.469> you

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
shorter the list the better so if you

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.000 
shorter the list the better so if you
look<00:00:38.710> at<00:00:38.829> the<00:00:38.920> ingredients<00:00:39.489> on<00:00:39.579> many<00:00:40.269> of<00:00:40.510> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
look at the ingredients on many of the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.279 
look at the ingredients on many of the
baby<00:00:42.010> marketed<00:00:42.870> detergents<00:00:43.870> you'll<00:00:44.079> find

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 
baby marketed detergents you'll find

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:46.439 
baby marketed detergents you'll find
that<00:00:44.469> they're<00:00:44.649> actually<00:00:45.129> pretty<00:00:45.850> loaded<00:00:46.120> with

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
that they're actually pretty loaded with

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.959 
that they're actually pretty loaded with
fragrances<00:00:47.229> that<00:00:47.800> make<00:00:47.949> them<00:00:48.129> smell<00:00:48.550> like

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
fragrances that make them smell like

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.059 
fragrances that make them smell like
baby<00:00:49.329> detergents<00:00:50.079> but<00:00:50.620> the<00:00:50.769> actual

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:51.069 
baby detergents but the actual

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:53.189 
baby detergents but the actual
functionality<00:00:51.670> of<00:00:52.089> the<00:00:52.210> detergent<00:00:52.510> is<00:00:52.809> not

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
functionality of the detergent is not

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.949 
functionality of the detergent is not
necessarily<00:00:53.769> geared<00:00:54.489> towards<00:00:54.789> babies<00:00:55.210> so

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:55.959 
necessarily geared towards babies so

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:59.489 
necessarily geared towards babies so
going<00:00:56.170> with<00:00:56.319> a<00:00:56.709> detergent<00:00:57.039> that<00:00:57.429> is<00:00:58.499> with

00:00:59.489 --> 00:00:59.499 
going with a detergent that is with

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:01.639 
going with a detergent that is with
lower<00:00:59.799> with<00:01:00.159> less<00:01:00.519> ingredients<00:01:01.239> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
lower with less ingredients and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.439 
lower with less ingredients and
hopefully<00:01:03.119> something<00:01:04.119> that<00:01:04.239> is

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
hopefully something that is

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.320 
hopefully something that is
biodegradable<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.260> good<00:01:05.440> for<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.680> earth<00:01:06.330> you

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
biodegradable and good for the earth you

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.210 
biodegradable and good for the earth you
will<00:01:07.360> be<00:01:07.720> able<00:01:07.869> to<00:01:07.960> find<00:01:08.170> that<00:01:08.770> it<00:01:08.890> will<00:01:09.010> rinse

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
will be able to find that it will rinse

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.710 
will be able to find that it will rinse
out<00:01:09.430> much<00:01:09.640> better<00:01:09.820> from<00:01:10.060> your<00:01:10.150> baby's<00:01:10.420> clothes

is<00:01:14.020> still<00:01:14.470> developing<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:15.220> so<00:01:15.340> their<00:01:15.490> skin<00:01:15.730> is

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
is still developing and so their skin is

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.210 
is still developing and so their skin is
very<00:01:16.090> sensitive<00:01:16.420> so<00:01:17.410> adding<00:01:17.860> a<00:01:17.950> lot<00:01:18.100> of

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
very sensitive so adding a lot of

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.030

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.150 
chemicals and fragrance is actually not
good<00:01:21.420> particularly<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.660> fragrance<00:01:23.050> with<00:01:24.010> it

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
good particularly the fragrance with it

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.120

hyper<00:01:24.400> stimulating<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.360> baby<00:01:25.950> it'll<00:01:26.950> smell

good<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.430> you<00:01:27.580> but<00:01:27.910> it'll<00:01:28.060> actually<00:01:28.300> make<00:01:29.260> baby

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
good to you but it'll actually make baby

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.340 
good to you but it'll actually make baby
more<00:01:30.160> uncomfortable<00:01:30.870> another<00:01:31.870> thing<00:01:32.140> that<00:01:32.320> I

your<00:01:37.690> diaper<00:01:37.930> hamper<00:01:38.350> you<00:01:38.470> might<00:01:38.650> have

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
your diaper hamper you might have

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.740 
your diaper hamper you might have
something<00:01:39.280> that<00:01:39.940> you<00:01:40.060> would<00:01:40.150> put<00:01:40.300> your<00:01:40.450> baby's

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
something that you would put your baby's

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.170

so if your baby spits up a lot or tends
to<00:01:45.940> have<00:01:46.090> leaks<00:01:46.420> then<00:01:47.230> this<00:01:47.650> will<00:01:47.860> contain

high-efficiency you'll probably use

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.789 
high-efficiency you'll probably use
about<00:02:47.879> 1/4<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.480> 1/3<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:49.019> recommended<00:02:49.530> amount
