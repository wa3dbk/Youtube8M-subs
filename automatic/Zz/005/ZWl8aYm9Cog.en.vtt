00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 hey here is norman i want the four 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.710
 main causes of hypertension 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.730
 imagine and whose solution the 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.580
 First main cause is salt salt need 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.369
 we do not eat so salt 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.760
 sodium chloride but also sea salt and 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.320
 teamer salt also contains only 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.869
 Sodium chloride it is just as harmful 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.840
 what happens if we salt too much? 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.179
 stuff into us 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.910
 it just leads to deposits in the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.430
 arteries and just clogs up ours 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.340
 the whole circulatory system is ours 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.170
 body forced to pump even more 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.879
 so that even nutrients through 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:49.320
 our blood can get as well 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:51.570
 It also promotes salt 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.460
 and many other diseases because they 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.879
 just clogged everything and it leads 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.420
 also to water deposit so 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:05.159
 We absolutely must avoid salt 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.380
 our body needs no salt 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.860
 In all things we need more potassium 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.920
 as sodium 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.560
 but those who are afraid have too little sodium too 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.880
 Of course, many celery can be eaten too 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.880
 or eat algae for the contain 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.590
 enough minerals without the harmful ones 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.470
 Effects of cooking salt so the second 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.610
 The main reason for hypertension is too much 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.970
 fat especially saturated fats off or 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.750
 processed fat can out the whole 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.770
 finished products above all things in 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.409
 animal products but our body needs 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.470
 of course, essential fatty acids, the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.290
 Above all things are green leafy 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.180
 Vegetable sprouts own good relationship 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.420
 available 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.560
 above all things such as shazam 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.520
 Flaxseed and hemp seeds contain one 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.719
 very good relationship between the 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.299
 essential fatty acids omega-3 and 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.979
 omega-6 white is also important to them 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.070
 in a good relationship to each other 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.070
 lie 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:14.440
 absolutely do not need to eat at all 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.110
 we fish because that has only a very 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.540
 bad fatty acid spectrum also has 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.080
 Saturated fatty acids in excess and 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.690
 not such a great relationship and omega 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.090
 3 and omega 6 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.930
 and besides, every heated one loses 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.890
 his structure is causing cancer and cancer 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.020
 is completely worthless and useless for us 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.550
 and fish oil oxidizes, for example 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.130
 easy to make so it is 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.209
 always ran the heated oxygen 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:50.170
 is exposed and in bulk 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.510
 Chemistry is packed full and fish 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.840
 already contain so many 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.940
 heavy metals and plastics we 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.170
 Tipping into the sea above all things 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.230
 mercury is 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.560
 So who is a very high salary 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.420
 In the meantime, mercury can be found 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.370
 We must not eat too much fat 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.180
 we have to do all kinds of animal products 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.989
 avoid 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.950
 because too much fat sticks too 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.500
 again our entire bloodstream 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.450
 system slows down the ability of ours 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.250
 Add blood oxygen to our cells 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.590
 Of course , that's what it takes to promote that as well 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.500
 again 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.299
 diabetes and many other diseases 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.690
 So too much fat especially saturated 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.209
 Avoid fatty acids like this 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.950
 Third major reason for hypertension is 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.840
 stress yes we must not stress 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.480
 leave because stress always arises only in 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.350
 own head where the other has fun 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.630
 For example, bungee jumping developed 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.870
 someone else maybe so stress 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.489
 we must not be stressed 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.459
 it helps relaxation exercises like 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:03.269
 just close your eyes and deep 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.269
 breathe in 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.209
 that is really very advisable and 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.700
 In addition, we get so again 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.630
 inhale more oxygen through the deep breath 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:20.410
 and oxygen is really essential 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.669
 so that our body works that 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.410
 leads right back to the next 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:29.470
 point if we do not train 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.090
 work properly then that leads 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.030
 always too high blood pressure 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.130
 because the kidneys are virtually our filter 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.070
 For the blood, yes, they all filter 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:43.120
 pollutants out if they are natural 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.810
 work properly because we have ours 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.840
 body not approximate to the species 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.950
 our food is actually for us 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.120
 is provided 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:58.210
 the vegetable raw food wild herbs for 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:02.020
 No animal warms up its food 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.790
 destroy it before and while warming up 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.830
 only nutrients are lost and 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.080
 it also creates pollutants again 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.870
 again only the blood circulation 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.030
 system clog 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.979
 So we have to build our body 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.590
 that he works properly again 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:20.710
 that the blood circulation system again 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.120
 works and also our kidneys 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.130
 work well again 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.479
 above all things for the kidneys need 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.180
 we also drink enough 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.130
 So I drink at least a liter of that 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.860
 is the first thing I do when I am 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:38.890
 get up early preferably green vegetables 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:42.130
 juices or algae the chlorella we 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.000
 definitely have to drink a lot as well 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.140
 for the kidneys 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.780
 then we must not eat too much fat 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:53.250
 and nothing too much salt, respectively 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:55.960
 do not eat salt at all 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.880
 and of course we have to avoid that yet 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.229
 more pollutants into us too 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.100
 stuff and above all things too 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:04.479
 First the pollutants are in us 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.979
 from have also stored lead again 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:08.229
 so detoxify 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:10.470
 that works again through the 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:13.760
 nutrition very well 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:18.310
 Herbal raw food detoxifies very well 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.310
 especially with green vegetable juices
