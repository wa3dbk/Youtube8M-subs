found<00:04:04.150> on<00:04:04.680> google<00:04:05.730> but<00:04:06.730> honestly<00:04:07.630> in<00:04:07.780> my

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
found on google but honestly in my

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.849 
found on google but honestly in my
opinion<00:04:07.959> i<00:04:08.470> think<00:04:08.680> i<00:04:09.430> did<00:04:09.970> a<00:04:10.000> good<00:04:10.180> job<00:04:10.239> and<00:04:10.859> the

opinion i think i did a good job and the

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.970 
opinion i think i did a good job and the
kick<00:04:12.070> pad<00:04:12.370> look<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.209> it<00:04:13.329> honestly<00:04:14.320> adds<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.859> it

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
kick pad look to it honestly adds to it

little<00:04:57.240> boy<00:04:57.419> but<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.319> figured<00:04:59.159> it<00:04:59.250> would<00:04:59.340> be

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
little boy but I figured it would be

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.420 
little boy but I figured it would be
more<00:04:59.639> funny<00:04:59.939> if<00:05:00.090> he<00:05:00.120> was<00:05:00.300> a<00:05:00.360> troll<00:05:00.629> color<00:05:01.430> but

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430

racist to the point of the fact that he
has<00:05:10.139> big<00:05:10.439> lips<00:05:11.599> though<00:05:12.599> at<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.740> same<00:05:13.800> time
