pretty tab is not perfect there's a

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.059 
pretty tab is not perfect there's a
little<00:01:52.329> blemishes<00:01:52.689> but<00:01:52.899> it<00:01:53.829> looks<00:01:54.009> pretty

good<00:01:54.749> next<00:01:55.749> committee<00:01:56.409> is<00:01:56.619> this<00:01:56.999> triangle

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
good next committee is this triangle

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.250 
good next committee is this triangle
shape<00:01:59.649> right<00:01:59.859> here<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:01.119> know

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
shape right here you know

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.610 
shape right here you know
I'll<00:02:02.620> flip<00:02:03.580> it<00:02:03.700> this<00:02:03.850> way<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.900> I<00:02:04.960> mean<00:02:05.380> if<00:02:05.470> it's

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
I'll flip it this way and I mean if it's

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.430 
I'll flip it this way and I mean if it's
only<00:02:05.800> about<00:02:05.950> this<00:02:06.160> big<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:07.630> not<00:02:07.960> that<00:02:08.260> big

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
only about this big it's not that big

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.380 
only about this big it's not that big
but<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:08.890> gets<00:02:09.010> this<00:02:09.220> perfectly<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:10.210> you<00:02:10.330> too

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
but it gets this perfectly to you too

figured<00:04:41.000> I<00:04:41.270> let<00:04:41.480> you<00:04:41.630> know<00:04:41.690> it<00:04:42.140> is<00:04:42.890> it's

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
figured I let you know it is it's

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.980 
figured I let you know it is it's
definitely<00:04:44.540> easier<00:04:44.840> to<00:04:45.169> scale<00:04:45.980> then<00:04:46.310> skew

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
definitely easier to scale then skew

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.050 
definitely easier to scale then skew
rather<00:04:47.990> than<00:04:48.260> scheme<00:04:48.860> and<00:04:49.010> scale<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:49.580> try<00:04:50.000> and

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
rather than scheme and scale and try and

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.880 
rather than scheme and scale and try and
match<00:04:50.270> it<00:04:51.130> anyway<00:04:52.210> next<00:04:53.210> we<00:04:53.780> had<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.200> badge<00:04:54.530> I

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
match it anyway next we had the badge I

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.610 
match it anyway next we had the badge I
just<00:04:55.790> married<00:04:56.000> it<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.570> writing's<00:04:57.080> too<00:04:57.200> small

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
just married it the writing's too small

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.050 
just married it the writing's too small
that<00:04:57.770> nobody<00:04:58.100> really<00:04:58.310> notices<00:04:59.180> it<00:04:59.390> anyway<00:04:59.750> and

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
that nobody really notices it anyway and

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.540 
that nobody really notices it anyway and
last<00:05:02.060> I<00:05:02.630> just<00:05:03.020> put<00:05:03.169> a<00:05:03.200> white<00:05:03.590> square<00:05:03.830> over<00:05:04.430> the
