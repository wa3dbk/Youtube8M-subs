00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.110 
the 75-day is my preference in this
particular<00:00:52.739> wheel<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.430> gonna<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:53.790> a<00:00:53.820> black

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
particular wheel it's gonna have a black

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.600 
particular wheel it's gonna have a black
core<00:00:54.510> pre-broken<00:00:55.380> in<00:00:55.649> skin<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.220> it's<00:00:56.460> gonna

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
core pre-broken in skin and it's gonna

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.160 
core pre-broken in skin and it's gonna
leave<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.970> most<00:00:57.149> amount<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.480> fame<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.930> the

leave the most amount of fame of the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.620 
leave the most amount of fame of the
three<00:00:58.380> wheels<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:59.280> will<00:00:59.610> last<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.329> very<00:01:00.360> long

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
three wheels this will last a very long

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.049 
three wheels this will last a very long
time<00:01:00.809> for<00:01:01.290> being<00:01:01.440> 75<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.130> it<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> great<00:01:02.760> pickup

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059

thing<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.770> ABA<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.250> probably<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.790> way<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.910> go

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
thing the ABA is probably the way to go

thing the ABA is probably the way to go
they<00:02:15.959> also<00:02:16.230> make<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.800> five-o<00:02:17.069> crooked

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
they also make the five-o crooked

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.259 
they also make the five-o crooked
this<00:02:18.500> is<00:02:18.650> going<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.860> be<00:02:19.010> very<00:02:19.190> similar<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:20.150> the

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
this is going to be very similar to the

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.570 
this is going to be very similar to the
shape<00:02:20.599> of<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.200> Swift<00:02:21.530> with<00:02:21.800> their<00:02:22.010> supported

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
core on the inside but this is not going

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.080 
core on the inside but this is not going
to<00:02:24.830> have<00:02:25.010> that<00:02:25.160> Center<00:02:25.519> set<00:02:25.730> bearing

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
to have that Center set bearing

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.309 
to have that Center set bearing
placement<00:02:26.569> of<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:27.500> smaller<00:02:28.420> five<00:02:29.420> oh<00:02:29.450> what's

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
placement of the smaller five oh what's

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.080 
placement of the smaller five oh what's
nice<00:02:30.500> about<00:02:30.530> this<00:02:30.980> is<00:02:31.280> it'll<00:02:31.489> be<00:02:31.519> a<00:02:31.610> little<00:02:31.940> bit

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
nice about this is it'll be a little bit

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.030 
nice about this is it'll be a little bit
offset<00:02:32.360> it's<00:02:33.019> going<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.319> come<00:02:33.500> with<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.709> pre

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
offset it's going to come with a pre
