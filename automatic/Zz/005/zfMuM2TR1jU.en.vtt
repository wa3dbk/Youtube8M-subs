00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.810
 Mr. Sakurada 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.330
 We have you use in the back mountain from the disease and the spot 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.519
 Burning man 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.459
 Somehow recording and airing are more than you 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:14.549
 After all 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.959
 new 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.300
 That idea 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.130
 It seems like the era is a little bit in front of this even after losing 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.839
 I have it now 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.250
 First made 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.050
 00 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.409
 I'm not a pro, when I come in from the defensive 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.250
 Even if you receive that, I will rush immediately 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.770
 It also returns 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.600
 I got a basement but 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.600
 It is great even if it was before Amami 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.469
 Shimizu is 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.260
 With this system 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.450
 I'm getting better and better in the future 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.250
 Is it not? 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.060
 It is said that a new hot road was opened 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.740
 Still high 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.540
 various 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.830
 Improvement is 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.670
 It's about the house 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.270
 I'm sorry to continue, but I'll wake you up 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.100
 When I've heard so far, it feels so good 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.230
 It can not be reproduced 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.920
 You can also make an income, but conversely, Izumo Norin Point 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.630
 There are many 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.250
 The treatment of the case which became many like such a long time ago 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.280
 repetition 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.520
 I came with a pose, but I wonder if it's this past 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.780
 Is 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.630
 It 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.770
 I already got off 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.870
 The expectation that I will go in the head of the innovation quite 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.620
 I also have 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.620
 As we use, it is circle 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.750
 Noba that 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.950
 I'm very high school 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.640
 that 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.780
 There is a lot of corruption and it is simple to say 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.780
 The 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.460
 Before direct sober 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.600
 I think it is Mondo, but after all 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.770
 The person who understands is said to have been waiting for it 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.340
 I'm coming to the place 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.930
 That's right I am simple and extravagant 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.400
 I really feel that I can see performances little by little every day 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.659
 Maybe that's not just about pursuing here 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.630
 It is a prospect to ask a little bit every day 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.250
 Isn't this good at bat? 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.599
 That 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.489
 I am now 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.409
 It is fun just to have 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:14.899
 Such part 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.849
 But that high high that very high 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.039
 I will say it will be fried 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.069
 Thank you for being an Iemon 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.310
 Hasegawa is not uncommon at the company last month 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.900
 It did not come very much to bring it close to this point 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.329
 It is called 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.329
 Well, for example, we have a case in the high ground 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:39.629
 The master manager is still great recording 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.379
 All three are so 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.010
 That's right, it's about getting close to it 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.629
 First 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.629
 Family register simply 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.499
 I imagined that there is a reason to go 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:56.470
 Gunma 5-2 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.379
 It started from the art museum 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.369
 It is part but 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:05.239
 It is wonderful for me not to divide it into three stages of difficulty size 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.039
 There is a person
