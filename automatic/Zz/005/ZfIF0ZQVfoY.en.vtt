00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
version 1.0 point2 and I held off on

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.190 
version 1.0 point2 and I held off on
updating<00:00:41.340> until<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.969> jailbreak<00:00:42.270> was<00:00:42.750> released

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
updating until a jailbreak was released

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.369 
updating until a jailbreak was released
and<00:00:43.520> i<00:00:44.629> went<00:00:45.629> ahead<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.840> follow<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.320> steps

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
and i went ahead and follow the steps

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.400 
and i went ahead and follow the steps
and<00:00:47.149> it<00:00:48.149> was<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.870> little<00:00:49.200> bit

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
and it was it was a little bit

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.410 
and it was it was a little bit
complicated<00:00:49.860> probably<00:00:50.820> not<00:00:50.969> for<00:00:51.180> everyone

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
complicated probably not for everyone

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.380 
complicated probably not for everyone
but<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.440> instructions<00:00:53.370> were<00:00:53.460> written<00:00:53.940> well

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
but the instructions were written well

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.330 
but the instructions were written well
enough<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:55.320> where<00:00:55.500> someone<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:55.980> me<00:00:56.129> could

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
enough to where someone like me could

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.580 
enough to where someone like me could
follow<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:59.250> folks<00:00:59.489> over<00:00:59.640> at<00:00:59.789> app<00:01:00.120> tap

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
follow it so the folks over at app tap

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.770 
follow it so the folks over at app tap
to<00:01:01.590> make<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> app<00:01:02.010> tap<00:01:02.280> installer<00:01:02.730> or<00:01:03.030> install

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
to make the app tap installer or install

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.260 
to make the app tap installer or install
that<00:01:04.019> app<00:01:04.260> they're<00:01:04.530> going<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> be<00:01:04.830> coming<00:01:05.010> out

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
that app they're going to be coming out

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.600 
that app they're going to be coming out
with<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> much<00:01:06.510> simpler<00:01:06.900> elegant<00:01:07.439> solution<00:01:08.400> for

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
with a much simpler elegant solution for

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.359 
with a much simpler elegant solution for
the<00:01:08.700> iphone<00:01:09.470> probably<00:01:10.470> sometime<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.100> week

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
the iphone probably sometime this week

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.570 
the iphone probably sometime this week
or<00:01:11.580> next<00:01:11.610> week<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:13.170> you're<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> little<00:01:13.650> bit<00:01:13.920> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
or next week so if you're a little bit a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.410 
or next week so if you're a little bit a
little<00:01:14.750> bit<00:01:15.750> careful<00:01:16.080> or<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:17.150> just<00:01:18.150> want<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
little bit careful or you just want to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.820 
little bit careful or you just want to
make<00:01:18.509> sure<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.750> don't<00:01:18.840> mess<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.200> anything<00:01:19.470> i

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
make sure you don't mess up anything i

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.039 
make sure you don't mess up anything i
would<00:01:20.400> i<00:01:20.729> would<00:01:20.759> wait<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.659> come<00:01:21.990> out

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
would i would wait for that to come out

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.539 
would i would wait for that to come out
before<00:01:22.560> i<00:01:22.590> would<00:01:22.770> go<00:01:22.890> ahead<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.159> muck<00:01:23.430> around

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
before i would go ahead and muck around

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.420 
before i would go ahead and muck around
with<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.799> iphone<00:01:26.220> dev

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
with the the one that the iphone dev

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.030 
with the the one that the iphone dev
team<00:01:26.670> put<00:01:26.909> together<00:01:27.049> so<00:01:28.049> but<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.009> know

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
team put together so but you know

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.830 
team put together so but you know
essentially<00:01:29.880> they're<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.390> do<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> same

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
essentially they're going to do the same

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.289 
essentially they're going to do the same
thing<00:01:31.140> but<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.860> apt<00:01:32.159> at<00:01:32.369> people<00:01:32.700> tend<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.119> make

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
thing but the apt at people tend to make

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.960 
thing but the apt at people tend to make
it<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.479> one-click<00:01:34.310> hack<00:01:35.310> which<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.729> kind<00:01:35.939> of

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
it a one-click hack which is kind of

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.510 
it a one-click hack which is kind of
cool<00:01:36.439> so<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.850> packed<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.060> guy<00:01:39.299> as<00:01:40.189> you<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.280> see

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
cool so I packed this guy as you can see

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.429 
cool so I packed this guy as you can see
my<00:01:42.680> battery<00:01:43.790> my<00:01:44.790> battery<00:01:45.210> image<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:46.049> a

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
my battery my battery image is a is a

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.039 
my battery my battery image is a is a
fuel<00:01:46.950> indicator<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.640> not<00:01:47.850> not<00:01:48.750> your<00:01:48.899> normal

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
fuel indicator is not not your normal

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.639 
fuel indicator is not not your normal
battery<00:01:49.500> indicator<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:51.030> used<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.049> nap<00:01:52.409> call

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
battery indicator so I used a nap call

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.490 
battery indicator so I used a nap call
customized<00:01:53.310> through<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.970> also<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> a

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
customized through that I also have a a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.050 
customized through that I also have a a
carrier<00:01:56.399> image<00:01:56.700> change<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.240> parrot<00:01:57.509> says

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
carrier image change the parrot says

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.880 
carrier image change the parrot says
there<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.149> goes<00:02:00.299> again<00:02:00.329> sorry<00:02:01.290> hit<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.560> camera

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
there it goes again sorry hit the camera

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.060 
there it goes again sorry hit the camera
but<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.820> says<00:02:02.969> iphone<00:02:03.469> with<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.530> little<00:02:04.680> apple

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
but it says iphone with a little apple

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.070 
but it says iphone with a little apple
sign<00:02:05.340> instead<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.630> normal<00:02:07.409> 18t<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:09.390> let's

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
sign instead of the normal 18t so let's

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.240 
sign instead of the normal 18t so let's
go<00:02:10.200> ahead<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.440> look<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.830> here<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.039> see<00:02:11.160> what

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
go ahead and look in here and see what

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.210 
go ahead and look in here and see what
I've<00:02:11.459> done

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.710 

and<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.430> got<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.610> little<00:02:15.790> custom<00:02:16.210> sound<00:02:16.480> there

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
and I got a little custom sound there
