more<00:00:51.010> and<00:00:51.280> we'll<00:00:51.730> get<00:00:51.850> that<00:00:52.000> feeling<00:00:52.540> quite

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350

get a bit of an idea how I do it so I'll
just<00:03:13.340> finish<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:14.030> up<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.450> continue

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
it and working it you kind of get used

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.790 
it and working it you kind of get used
to<00:05:48.480> the<00:05:48.600> feel<00:05:48.810> but<00:05:49.020> when<00:05:49.200> you<00:05:49.320> would<00:05:49.500> come<00:05:49.530> back

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.040 
that I take that's one thing maybe you
can<00:06:21.210> look<00:06:21.330> at<00:06:21.480> when<00:06:21.630> you're<00:06:21.720> looking<00:06:21.780> at

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
can look at when you're looking at

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.930 
can look at when you're looking at
guitars<00:06:22.290> out<00:06:22.680> for<00:06:22.950> rack<00:06:23.190> seeing<00:06:23.610> how<00:06:23.760> well

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
guitars out for rack seeing how well

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.450 
guitars out for rack seeing how well
that's<00:06:24.180> been<00:06:24.390> done<00:06:24.570> if<00:06:25.380> it's<00:06:25.620> been<00:06:25.770> seen<00:06:26.040> seed

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
that's been done if it's been seen seed

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.590 
that's been done if it's been seen seed
it's<00:06:26.760> probably<00:06:27.150> good<00:06:29.030> but<00:06:30.030> if<00:06:30.150> the<00:06:30.240> skunk's

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
it's probably good but if the skunk's

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.960 
it's probably good but if the skunk's
trip<00:06:30.840> is<00:06:30.960> not<00:06:31.140> Center<00:06:31.800> on<00:06:31.920> your<00:06:32.100> on<00:06:32.580> your<00:06:32.640> blank

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
trip is not Center on your on your blank

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.220 
trip is not Center on your on your blank
then<00:06:33.180> it's<00:06:33.330> going<00:06:33.420> to<00:06:33.510> be<00:06:33.630> offset<00:06:34.020> a<00:06:34.050> little

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
then it's going to be offset a little

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.730 
then it's going to be offset a little
bit<00:06:35.120> anyways<00:06:36.120> I<00:06:36.300> will<00:06:36.360> continue<00:06:36.870> on<00:06:37.050> and<00:06:37.350> get

bit anyways I will continue on and get

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.730 
bit anyways I will continue on and get
