00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
 for love 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.800
 to me 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.459
 What's up with kids here in general and today? 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.469
 we are in episode number 9 of the 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.629
 curry guide of the call of duty black ops 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.630
 2 and today I'm going to show you how to use the 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.400
 witches that are going to give us two drinks or 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.150
 it is a tutorial of how to have two 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.200
 drinks in round 1 as you are watching 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.840
 we need the bank also to take out 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.330
 money and that just keep watching and what 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.250
 first of 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.350
 we have to do is come here to the 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.540
 mansion is for this episode what 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.040
 I will recommend is that you see all the 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.640
 previous because for this episode 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.559
 we need a little more knowledge 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.090
 about the game and so on then we have 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.650
 to come here to the mansion that is the 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.480
 of the bauble shop go through 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.820
 the whole mansion as you have seen 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.220
 slow motion repeat the video if you want 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.320
 see it and when we kill all the 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.180
 witches to leave will give us a drink 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.860
 then something can teach how to return 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.590
 again to the same site in this episode 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.780
 let's see that, see how we come back 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.610
 around here nothing else there we go there and 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.250
 look at this detail that is a piano 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.200
 that here just enter what is the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.960
 mansion back is this is the way 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.290
 back we have to come all the 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.220
 You are on these stairs and we will go to the map 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.380
 over again 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.350
 as soon as you arrive, notice now that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.240
 we have the light that's why you have to 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.430
 see previous episodes to know a 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.360
 little more where is the light and so on for 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.100
 this second part 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.050
 we are going to need the knives 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.550
 ballistics obligatorily without them 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.060
 we are leaving we will not be able to do the 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.500
 part of getting second life the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.570
 first part of the first drink the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.700
 you can do without needing the second 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.100
 but the second one you can not do it without 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.290
 need for the first one is mandatory or 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.760
 be logical because we have to go back 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.280
 to the witches and killing them is 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.020
 healthy drink logically then we have 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.450
 to come to the classroom after getting 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.100
 the ballistics and we have to go right to 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.869
 piano that you are going to see now is worth and a 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.590
 once we get the ballistics we come to 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.130
 we approach the piano and you 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.479
 we give the square to the piano it's worth 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.320
 square what is used and the X 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.759
 what is unworthy 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.850
 we come to this white line and colom 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.860
 ballistic and we shoot at the bullseye 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.390
 a little music will sound and we come back here to 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.160
 piano and we give the button again 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.069
 action then we have to go running 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.189
 to the mansion 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.170
 see what I said that without 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:25.230
 need the first part without 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.129
 need for the second one I meant that 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.379
 You can do the first one 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.420
 individually the second one fixes that 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.980
 we have to go through the witches to 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.920
 that if now it kills it would notice 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.780
 drink and on coming here fixed in 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.730
 the detail of before the piano that was 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.040
 empty now having made the 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.169
 ballistic and so on we're going to get that 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.209
 There is a witch playing the piano. 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:49.090
 well you see is playing the piano 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.549
 you have to come here you have to pay ten 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.930
 only ten of money that is very very 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.609
 little and will give us the second drink 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.430
 look down on the right on top of the 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:59.469
 round 1 we have that we have two drinks 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.810
 all the money that I have got it out 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.549
 of the bank because the witches every hit 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.709
 They give us two thousand dollars 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.120
 and when we have zero money it is not 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.359
 when they start to take life and we 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.040
 they can kill then once we have 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.049
 done all this when leaving the mansion 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.329
 we have the light that we activate and they give us 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.859
 the two drinks as it is they do not give us the 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.750
 two drinks if we do not have the light 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.330
 activated 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.680
 then nothing is already clear, you have to 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.560
 do 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.450
 first we need the ballistics all 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.719
 to get the two measurements after 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.540
 if the piano play the music shoot at 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:37.180
 Diana play again at the piano and all the 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.859
 whole mansion back will be a 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.590
 witch on the piano we have to pay her 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.359
 ten of money and he will give us a drink and 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.099
 if we kill all the witches we know 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.569
 the second drink so I do not expect anything 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.389
 that you like the video you deis light 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.439
 favorites if you're not and see you in the 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.439
