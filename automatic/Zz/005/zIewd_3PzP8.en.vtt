 easy photoshop I will teach you to 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.450
 create this Christmas postcard will that 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.440
 it can also work as a framework 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.779
 photographic this pretty truth I am your 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.680
 friend danny saavedra and do not change him 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.680
 we start 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.880
 ok the first thing we have to do is 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.010
 Open a template or template that I give them 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.170
 I have prepared so it is that we are going to 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.470
 double click here on the desktop 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.630
 of photoshop 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.480
 and we will choose 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.850
 This is called Christmas postcard 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.590
 I will leave this material in the 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.090
 description of the video so you can 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.630
 download since we are going to open 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.900
 let's say ok 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.540
 this temple consists of three elements the 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.670
 first is the background that comes like this with a 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.180
 degraded and this was done with some 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.310
 brushes that already abound by the network 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.090
 Christmas as well as snowflake type 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.359
 vector 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.200
 in the second stage brings elements that 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:25.500
 they were extracted and stuck 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.960
 and the third layer are being 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.630
 shines that also made us with a 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.560
 brush this template I downloaded it in 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.820
 the net 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.000
 well then let's go to file 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.580
 place 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.300
 and I 'm going to choose this picture you're going to 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.290
 put the photo you want 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.290
 how to place 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.150
 and let's press the uppercase key or 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:57.060
 shift and we're going to pull from any of the 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.060
 corners to resize what 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.950
 let's say this size 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.950
 let's go and give to validate 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.700
 at once again I'm going to file 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.700
 place 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.750
 and now I'm going to choose this which is the 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.830
 the Christmas hat 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.830
 let's place 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.070
 and this comes to answer a question 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.490
 I did in my group as 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.319
 They could put a Christmas hat from 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.409
 what are you going to see how easy 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.329
 just like we did with the baby 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:37.310
 we press the uppercase key and pull 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:41.200
 some of the corners to 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.200
 resize and adjust to size 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.450
 that we stay like this I go inter to validate 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:05.160
 now I'm going to take the text tool 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.160
 that is activated with the letter t 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.900
 and I click to start writing 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.610
 I'm going to use the source because 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.909
 I will leave them in the description of 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.909
 video 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.630
 and I 'm going to put it in red 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.550
 and I write happy 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.970
 as the tool move 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:40.010
 I click right here on your layer and 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.010
 I click on merge options 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.940
 here in fusion options 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.800
 we are going to put a line like that since 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.800
 we click on this stroke box 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.769
 We will put the size to 5 pixels 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.590
 and in color we will put the color 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.590
 White 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.739
 we are OK 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.370
 and now let's go where it says shadow 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.370
 parallel 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.450
 here simply with the mouse I'm going to 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.680
 go down a little 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.680
 let's say there 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:32.060
 in the distance we stayed at 13 extension 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:36.449
 0 size 5 and here is not for city what 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:39.559
 I'm going to go down to 50 percent 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.559
 I give ok 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:48.280
 let's duplicate this text first what 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.770
 I will put more or less here 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.050
 we are going to duplicate this text by pressing 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.050
 the alt key and we pull with the mouse 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:04.419
 I double click here in the layers panel 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.419
 about your text thumbnail here 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.979
 and I write the word christmas 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.979
 as the tool move 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.970
 and positioned him there we're going to change the 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.970
 colour 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.030
 to a dark green 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.000
 I like it ok 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.800
 let's duplicate this text again 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:43.110
 just like we did with the other 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.110
 pressing the alt key and pulling 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:49.589
 I'm going to double click on your thumbnail 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:52.199
 of text here in this box if you give in 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:54.689
 another place is not going to come out ok 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:57.630
 So to avoid here on the 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:06:00.470
 text thumbnail 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:03.470
 and now we can write I'm going to put 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.470
 2012 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.070
 as the tool move 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.949
 I put it here more or less 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.949
 and we are going to change the color 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.440
 we put a yellow color 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.910
 let's say that we give ok 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:35.000
