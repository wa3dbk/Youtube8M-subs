00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
different alternate points so let's say

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.660 
different alternate points so let's say
you're<00:01:10.170> trying<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.680> reset<00:01:11.100> let's<00:01:11.280> hack<00:01:11.460> your

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
alternative points for nearly all the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.149 
alternative points for nearly all the
points<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.150> facts<00:01:21.600> boxes<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.409> i<00:01:22.680> was

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
points on the facts boxes so i was

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.410 
points on the facts boxes so i was
checking<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.580> out<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.850> that's<00:01:23.970> what<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.180> that's

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
checking it out and that's what I that's

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.820 
checking it out and that's what I that's
why<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.930> decided<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.320> give<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.500> another<00:01:25.619> go

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
why I decided to give it another go

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.630 
why I decided to give it another go
because<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:27.229> thought<00:01:28.229> maybe<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.979> try<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.460> on

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
because I thought maybe if I try it on

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.219 
because I thought maybe if I try it on
with<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.939> spots<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.570> would<00:01:30.659> work<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.110> I

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
with a spots and it would work but I

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.690 
with a spots and it would work but I
don't<00:01:31.500> know<00:01:31.590> if<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.920> wire<00:01:32.159> that's<00:01:32.460> not

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
don't know if it's the wire that's not

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.760 
don't know if it's the wire that's not
thick<00:01:32.909> enough<00:01:32.939> my<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.900> soldering<00:01:34.290> looks<00:01:34.530> fine

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the right wire or I don't know it's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.340

now yeah so I'm probably gonna give
maybe<00:05:10.139> the<00:05:10.290> recycle<00:05:10.680> attract<00:05:10.889> another<00:05:11.130> good

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
maybe the recycle attract another good

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.280 
maybe the recycle attract another good
time<00:05:11.580> because<00:05:11.790> I<00:05:11.970> got<00:05:12.120> go<00:05:12.720> to<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.020> gym<00:05:13.169> right

it<00:05:31.229> but<00:05:31.470> I<00:05:31.680> randomly<00:05:32.430> stumbled<00:05:32.970> across<00:05:33.060> a

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
it but I randomly stumbled across a

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.330 
it but I randomly stumbled across a
forum<00:05:34.200> where<00:05:34.350> some<00:05:34.560> guy<00:05:34.710> was<00:05:34.919> having<00:05:35.250> the<00:05:35.310> same

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
forum where some guy was having the same

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.210 
forum where some guy was having the same
issues<00:05:35.820> me<00:05:36.090> and<00:05:36.380> supposedly<00:05:37.380> someone<00:05:37.770> found<00:05:37.950> a

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
issues me and supposedly someone found a

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.400 
issues me and supposedly someone found a
solution<00:05:38.940> to<00:05:39.270> it<00:05:39.479> and<00:05:39.570> I<00:05:39.630> gave<00:05:39.840> it<00:05:39.870> a<00:05:40.020> shot<00:05:40.050> and

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
solution to it and I gave it a shot and

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.740 
solution to it and I gave it a shot and
sure<00:05:40.650> enough<00:05:40.680> it<00:05:40.979> worked<00:05:41.190> fine<00:05:41.430> and<00:05:41.700> so<00:05:41.910> now<00:05:42.539> at

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
sure enough it worked fine and so now at

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.159 
sure enough it worked fine and so now at
least<00:05:42.960> I<00:05:43.229> program<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:43.979> chip<00:05:45.020> for<00:05:46.020> any

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
least I program the chip for any

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.110 
least I program the chip for any
motherboard<00:05:46.590> type<00:05:46.740> and<00:05:47.010> it<00:05:47.100> sounds<00:05:47.490> like<00:05:47.520> it

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
motherboard type and it sounds like it

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.240 
motherboard type and it sounds like it
sounds<00:05:48.390> like<00:05:48.660> the<00:05:48.810> Xbox<00:05:49.050> is<00:05:49.380> trying<00:05:49.650> to<00:05:49.770> reset
