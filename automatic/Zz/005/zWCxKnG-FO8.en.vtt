different<00:00:25.130> to<00:00:25.220> other<00:00:25.750> cradles<00:00:26.750> made<00:00:26.990> by<00:00:27.320> Ram

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
different to other cradles made by Ram

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.759 
different to other cradles made by Ram
there<00:00:29.029> are<00:00:29.210> actually<00:00:29.509> two<00:00:29.869> connection<00:00:30.410> points

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
there are actually two connection points

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.320 
there are actually two connection points
on<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:30.980> back<00:00:31.130> of<00:00:31.339> this<00:00:31.490> for<00:00:31.759> connecting<00:00:32.180> to

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
on the back of this for connecting to

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.230 
on the back of this for connecting to
two<00:00:32.689> different<00:00:32.870> types<00:00:33.050> of<00:00:33.500> mounts<00:00:33.980> one<00:00:34.970> is

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.240 
two different types of mounts one is

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.210 
two different types of mounts one is
their<00:00:35.540> standard<00:00:36.050> diamond<00:00:36.230> plate<00:00:36.680> which<00:00:36.950> is<00:00:37.190> a

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
their standard diamond plate which is a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.850 
their standard diamond plate which is a
hole<00:00:37.520> here<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:37.880> a<00:00:38.120> hole<00:00:38.150> here<00:00:38.750> you<00:00:39.410> can<00:00:39.530> just

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
hole here and a hole here you can just

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.710 
hole here and a hole here you can just
see<00:00:40.190> a<00:00:40.220> shape<00:00:40.580> of<00:00:40.760> a<00:00:40.850> diamond<00:00:41.060> come<00:00:41.480> around

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
see a shape of a diamond come around

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.290 
see a shape of a diamond come around
there<00:00:41.960> like<00:00:41.990> so<00:00:42.430> that<00:00:43.430> is<00:00:43.640> for<00:00:43.850> connecting

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
there like so that is for connecting

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.230 
there like so that is for connecting
this<00:00:44.420> cradle<00:00:44.900> directly<00:00:45.590> to<00:00:45.920> a<00:00:46.190> ram<00:00:46.730> mount<00:00:47.000> in

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
this cradle directly to a ram mount in

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.540 
this cradle directly to a ram mount in
this<00:00:47.420> case<00:00:47.630> I<00:00:47.780> had<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.050> RAM<00:00:48.260> suction<00:00:48.770> cup<00:00:48.950> you

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
this case I had the RAM suction cup you

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.800 
this case I had the RAM suction cup you
can<00:00:49.640> see<00:00:49.850> on<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.030> end<00:00:50.090> of<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:50.270> suction<00:00:50.630> cup

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810 
can see on the end of this suction cup

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.770 
can see on the end of this suction cup
mount<00:00:51.080> there<00:00:51.230> is<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.380> diamond<00:00:52.190> plate<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.330> if<00:00:53.630> you

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
mount there is a diamond plate so if you

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.450 
mount there is a diamond plate so if you
buy<00:00:53.990> this<00:00:54.170> cradle<00:00:54.650> with<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:54.950> mounting<00:00:55.430> system

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
buy this cradle with a mounting system

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.490 
buy this cradle with a mounting system
you<00:00:56.240> will<00:00:56.360> find<00:00:56.630> there's<00:00:56.810> a<00:00:56.900> diamond<00:00:57.290> plate

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
you will find there's a diamond plate

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.410 
you will find there's a diamond plate
that<00:00:58.010> is<00:00:58.070> designed<00:00:58.580> to<00:00:58.790> connect<00:00:59.180> these<00:00:59.360> two

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
that is designed to connect these two

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.710 
that is designed to connect these two
pieces<00:00:59.900> together<00:01:00.290> like<00:01:00.620> so<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:01.600> then<00:01:02.600> the

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
pieces together like so and then the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.420 
pieces together like so and then the
holes<00:01:02.930> match<00:01:03.200> up<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:03.680> then<00:01:03.890> you<00:01:04.070> use<00:01:04.280> the

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
holes match up and then you use the

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.490 
holes match up and then you use the
hardware<00:01:04.729> included<00:01:05.330> with<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.539> cradle<00:01:05.960> to

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
hardware included with the cradle to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.440 
hardware included with the cradle to
connect<00:01:06.859> to<00:01:07.100> that<00:01:07.340> diamond<00:01:07.789> plate<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:08.240> now

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
connect to that diamond plate and now

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.870 
connect to that diamond plate and now
you<00:01:08.509> have<00:01:08.750> a<00:01:08.780> mounting<00:01:09.200> system<00:01:09.340> all<00:01:10.340> connected

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
you have a mounting system all connected

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.090 
you have a mounting system all connected
up<00:01:10.969> like<00:01:11.240> so<00:01:11.659> so<00:01:12.469> I'll<00:01:12.590> show<00:01:12.799> you<00:01:12.829> how<00:01:12.950> that

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
up like so so I'll show you how that

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.490 
up like so so I'll show you how that
diamond<00:01:13.609> plate<00:01:13.850> matches<00:01:14.090> up<00:01:14.450> without<00:01:15.170> the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
diamond plate matches up without the

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.989 
diamond plate matches up without the
mount<00:01:16.929> so<00:01:17.929> you<00:01:18.289> take<00:01:18.530> that<00:01:18.740> off<00:01:18.920> so<00:01:19.789> there<00:01:19.939> we

00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:19.999 
mount so you take that off so there we

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:22.029 
mount so you take that off so there we
go<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:20.210> just<00:01:20.509> match<00:01:20.749> up<00:01:20.780> those<00:01:21.109> two<00:01:21.380> holes<00:01:21.619> one

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
go you just match up those two holes one

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:25.300 
go you just match up those two holes one
in<00:01:22.340> each<00:01:22.609> corner<00:01:22.999> of<00:01:23.119> the<00:01:23.270> diamond<00:01:23.659> and<00:01:24.310> that's

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
in each corner of the diamond and that's

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.080 
in each corner of the diamond and that's
how<00:01:25.640> that'll<00:01:25.969> connect<00:01:26.329> now<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.829> other<00:01:28.130> pin

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
how that'll connect now the other pin

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.959 
how that'll connect now the other pin
connections<00:01:29.749> here<00:01:30.229> you<00:01:31.159> can<00:01:31.310> see<00:01:31.579> are<00:01:31.850> these

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
connections here you can see are these

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.200 
connections here you can see are these
slots<00:01:32.840> here<00:01:33.229> what<00:01:34.009> that's<00:01:34.280> for<00:01:34.490> is<00:01:34.549> to<00:01:34.850> connect

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
slots here what that's for is to connect

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.020 
slots here what that's for is to connect
this<00:01:35.479> cradle<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.170> an<00:01:36.289> existing<00:01:37.030> magellan

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
this cradle to an existing magellan

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.989 
this cradle to an existing magellan
mount<00:01:38.329> so<00:01:39.259> the<00:01:39.380> Magellan<00:01:39.920> series<00:01:40.429> systems

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999 
mount so the Magellan series systems

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:45.639 
mount so the Magellan series systems
have<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:42.069> male<00:01:43.069> version<00:01:43.460> of<00:01:43.759> these<00:01:44.119> slots<00:01:44.649> so

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
have that male version of these slots so

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.889 
have that male version of these slots so
basically<00:01:46.130> just<00:01:46.280> line<00:01:46.759> up<00:01:46.789> those<00:01:47.119> slots<00:01:47.479> put

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
basically just line up those slots put

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.319 
basically just line up those slots put
the<00:01:48.020> Magellan<00:01:48.560> system<00:01:48.920> into<00:01:49.249> the<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:49.909> larger

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
the Magellan system into the the larger

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:51.910 
the Magellan system into the the larger
part<00:01:50.539> of<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.689> hole<00:01:50.929> you<00:01:51.170> can<00:01:51.409> see<00:01:51.619> there<00:01:51.799> I've

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
part of the hole you can see there I've

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.010 
part of the hole you can see there I've
done<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.939> can<00:01:53.090> see<00:01:53.270> how<00:01:53.389> they<00:01:53.539> come<00:01:53.749> in<00:01:53.869> there

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
done you can see how they come in there

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.139 
done you can see how they come in there
and<00:01:54.200> then<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:54.499> simply<00:01:54.710> push<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.639> cradle<00:01:55.999> down

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
and then you simply push the cradle down

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.840 
and then you simply push the cradle down
until<00:01:56.749> it<00:01:56.869> clicks<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.409> now<00:01:58.100> it's<00:01:58.340> connected

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
until it clicks and now it's connected

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.120 
until it clicks and now it's connected
into<00:01:59.209> those<00:01:59.389> holes<00:01:59.749> so<00:02:00.469> that's<00:02:00.679> two<00:02:01.009> different

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
into those holes so that's two different

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.260 
into those holes so that's two different
ways<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:02.030> mount<00:02:02.329> this<00:02:02.770> cradle<00:02:03.770> on<00:02:04.159> to<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.759> system

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
ways to mount this cradle on to a system

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.889 
ways to mount this cradle on to a system
a<00:02:05.420> mounting<00:02:05.780> system<00:02:06.369> now<00:02:07.450> another<00:02:08.450> thing<00:02:08.600> to

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
a mounting system now another thing to

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.719 
a mounting system now another thing to
note<00:02:09.050> on<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.350> back<00:02:09.500> here<00:02:09.860> is<00:02:10.100> this<00:02:10.340> little

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
note on the back here is this little

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.760 
note on the back here is this little
slot<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.270> runs<00:02:11.480> down<00:02:11.690> here<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.230> these<00:02:12.410> holes

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
slot that runs down here and these holes

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.870 
slot that runs down here and these holes
and<00:02:13.130> this<00:02:13.340> large<00:02:13.640> hole<00:02:13.970> here

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
and this large hole here

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.640 
and this large hole here
what<00:02:15.880> that's<00:02:16.030> for<00:02:16.300> is<00:02:16.360> connecting<00:02:17.140> the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
what that's for is connecting the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.040 
what that's for is connecting the
magellan<00:02:18.430> cable<00:02:19.260> into<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.290> cradle<00:02:21.010> itself

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
magellan cable into the cradle itself

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.780 
magellan cable into the cradle itself
semi-permanently<00:02:23.050> i've<00:02:23.830> got<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.190> USB<00:02:24.430> cable

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
semi-permanently i've got the USB cable

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.700 
semi-permanently i've got the USB cable
here<00:02:25.270> but<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.960> would<00:02:26.080> probably<00:02:26.470> get<00:02:26.680> a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
here but you would probably get a

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.670 
here but you would probably get a
cigarette<00:02:27.400> lighter<00:02:27.700> cable<00:02:28.120> or<00:02:28.240> wherever<00:02:28.420> else

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
cigarette lighter cable or wherever else

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.190 
cigarette lighter cable or wherever else
but<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.770> way<00:02:29.980> this<00:02:30.220> connects<00:02:30.670> in<00:02:30.850> here<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
but the way this connects in here is the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.820 
but the way this connects in here is the
cable<00:02:32.680> itself<00:02:33.040> has<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:34.120> little<00:02:34.620> push<00:02:35.620> down

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
cable itself has a little push down

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.760 
cable itself has a little push down
groove<00:02:36.190> here<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.209> can<00:02:37.390> connect<00:02:37.750> them<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.650> what

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
groove here you can connect them so what

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.890 
groove here you can connect them so what
I<00:02:38.800> find<00:02:39.040> is<00:02:39.280> easiest<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:39.880> push<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.420> top<00:02:40.660> of

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
I find is easiest is you push the top of

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.370 
I find is easiest is you push the top of
the<00:02:41.230> cradle<00:02:41.650> in<00:02:42.360> top<00:02:43.360> of<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.600> cable<00:02:44.020> into<00:02:44.230> the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
the cradle in top of the cable into the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.190 
the cradle in top of the cable into the
cradle<00:02:44.830> then<00:02:45.340> while<00:02:45.550> pushing<00:02:45.820> it<00:02:46.060> up<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.930> sort

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
cradle then while pushing it up you sort

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.140 
cradle then while pushing it up you sort
of<00:02:47.230> lift<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.590> bottom<00:02:47.920> into<00:02:48.190> place<00:02:48.640> until<00:02:49.000> it

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
of lift the bottom into place until it

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.940 
of lift the bottom into place until it
clicks<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:50.140> let's<00:02:50.350> do<00:02:50.560> that

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
clicks so let's do that

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.520 
clicks so let's do that
okay<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:51.880> said<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.360> was<00:02:52.480> easy<00:02:52.720> let's<00:02:53.200> try<00:02:53.470> it

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
okay I said that was easy let's try it

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.410 
okay I said that was easy let's try it
again<00:02:53.620> let's<00:02:54.489> try<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.700> with<00:02:54.790> my<00:02:54.910> thumbs<00:02:55.150> there

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
again let's try it with my thumbs there

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.650 
again let's try it with my thumbs there
we<00:02:55.480> go<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:56.050> it<00:02:56.200> goes<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:57.150> can<00:02:58.150> see<00:02:58.420> there

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
we go and it goes so you can see there

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.410 
we go and it goes so you can see there
now<00:02:58.930> this<00:02:59.230> cable<00:02:59.770> has<00:03:00.100> connected<00:03:00.910> into<00:03:01.300> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
now this cable has connected into the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.350 
now this cable has connected into the
back<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.890> RAM<00:03:03.160> mount<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.670> then<00:03:04.000> now<00:03:04.300> you

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
back of the RAM mount and then now you

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.630 
back of the RAM mount and then now you
see<00:03:04.720> this<00:03:04.930> slot<00:03:05.230> here<00:03:05.260> where<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.250> can<00:03:06.370> run<00:03:06.489> the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
see this slot here where you can run the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.160 
see this slot here where you can run the
cable<00:03:07.000> down<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.510> you've<00:03:07.600> actually<00:03:07.750> got<00:03:07.989> some

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
cable down and you've actually got some

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.990 
cable down and you've actually got some
holes<00:03:08.380> here<00:03:08.620> we<00:03:08.770> could<00:03:08.950> zip<00:03:09.190> tie<00:03:09.400> this<00:03:09.580> cable

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
holes here we could zip tie this cable

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.510 
holes here we could zip tie this cable
in<00:03:10.959> so<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.290> becomes<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.680> permanent<00:03:12.400> solution

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
in so it becomes a permanent solution

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.570 
in so it becomes a permanent solution
for<00:03:12.880> your<00:03:13.239> cradle<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:14.170> again<00:03:14.680> because<00:03:15.220> that

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
for your cradle and again because that

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.270 
for your cradle and again because that
falls<00:03:16.000> below<00:03:16.330> that<00:03:16.540> cable<00:03:17.170> falls<00:03:17.380> below<00:03:17.739> these

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
falls below that cable falls below these

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.060 
falls below that cable falls below these
connection<00:03:18.790> points<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:19.720> can<00:03:19.959> put<00:03:20.350> the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
connection points you can put the

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.130 
connection points you can put the
diamond<00:03:21.489> plate<00:03:21.670> over<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.120> top<00:03:22.330> no<00:03:22.570> problem<00:03:22.930> or

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
diamond plate over the top no problem or

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.890 
diamond plate over the top no problem or
you<00:03:23.769> can<00:03:23.920> connect<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.400> Magellan<00:03:24.880> cradle<00:03:25.690> over

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
you can connect the Magellan cradle over

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.650 
you can connect the Magellan cradle over
the<00:03:26.560> top<00:03:26.769> as<00:03:26.920> well<00:03:27.070> so<00:03:27.310> that's<00:03:28.000> how<00:03:28.150> this<00:03:28.269> cable

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
the top as well so that's how this cable

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.900 
the top as well so that's how this cable
connects<00:03:29.019> now<00:03:29.680> once<00:03:29.950> that's<00:03:30.130> connect<00:03:30.489> a<00:03:30.760> ball

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
connects now once that's connect a ball

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.620 
connects now once that's connect a ball
is<00:03:31.120> connected<00:03:31.660> you<00:03:32.170> can<00:03:32.200> now<00:03:32.560> get<00:03:32.830> your<00:03:33.630> GPS
