just wish the perks were a little bit
better<00:02:12.710> on<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.130> gets<00:02:13.190> more<00:02:13.400> use<00:02:14.200> but

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
better on it so it gets more use but

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.100 
better on it so it gets more use but
like<00:02:15.319> i<00:02:15.410> said<00:02:15.440> it's<00:02:15.890> if<00:02:16.849> your<00:02:17.150> grenades<00:02:17.540> trip

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110

can<00:02:20.989> be<00:02:21.110> useful

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
can be useful

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.090
