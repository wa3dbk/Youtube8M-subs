00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.904
 Hello everyone, welcome to the new episode of "The Theory of Creation God" 

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:06.740
 If you missed the previous episode, you can click here to watch 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.680
 I am cold dragon 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.660
 This episode will not be serious 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.060
 Because I will talk about the villagers 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.660
 I will compare the villagers and real history in "Be a Creation God" 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.660
 To judge which age the villagers belong to 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.834
 This time I will use a lot of Wikipedia and "Be a Creation God" Wikipedia. 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.800
 Please sit down and wear a seat belt. 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.560
 We are ready to take off 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.540
 First, the villagers will cultivate 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.800
 If you search for the history of farming in Wikipedia 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.380
 You will know that humans started farming as early as 12,000 years ago. 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.540
 Just the Neolithic Age 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.900
 Then we can say that the villagers are at least the people after 10,000 AD. 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.380
 But they don't look so old. 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.200
 The next item, there is a furnace in their blacksmith shop. 

00:00:52.255 --> 00:00:54.415
 On behalf of them will smelt 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.700
 According to Wikipedia, humans smelt as early as 8,000 years ago. 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.740
 Then we can sort out the time 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.160
 Now look at the construction of the village 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.580
 In "When a Creation God" Wikipedia, it said that this room with bookshelves is a library. 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.320
 clam? 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.060
 Ok, casually, the first library in history was before "prehistoric" 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.160
 About 4,600 years ago 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.580
 That is to say, they are people after 2,600 years of AD. 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.580
 The other thing is that you can find the stables in the box in the village. 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.685
 The first stable in history was used in the second year before BC. 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.060
 Ok, you are smarter than I imagined. 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.180
 Also, there are churches in the village. 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.440
 In fact, it is quite in line with the theory of the previous film. 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.620
 If you don't know what I am talking about, click here to see the video. 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.440
 Uh...... 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.440
 Wikipedia? 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.540
 He said that the first church was built in 233 AD. 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.900
 I believe I have mentioned all the characteristics of the village. 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.580
 Compare real history 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.160
 The villagers are probably people in the year of 290 AD. 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.420
 How is it, this episode is almost here? 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.780
 I am sorry that I uploaded the video so late because I was working on it recently. 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.200
 The animation that will be released and the next episode "Be a Creation God Theory" 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.140
 Itâ€™s a relationship fortress, but I have no idea at all. 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.360
 I hope you can like or share this video.
