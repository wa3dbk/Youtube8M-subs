actually<00:02:34.440> recommend<00:02:35.070> more<00:02:35.280> than<00:02:35.490> this<00:02:35.610> is

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
actually recommend more than this is

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.300 
actually recommend more than this is
adding<00:02:36.150> apple<00:02:36.420> cider<00:02:36.540> vinegar<00:02:36.690> into<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.830> and

adding apple cider vinegar into it and

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.880 
adding apple cider vinegar into it and
you<00:02:38.490> might<00:02:38.640> wonder<00:02:38.820> well<00:02:39.180> then<00:02:39.360> why<00:02:39.570> are<00:02:40.530> you

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
you might wonder well then why are you

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.290 
you might wonder well then why are you
making<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.220> with<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.459> honey<00:02:41.700> if<00:02:41.970> it's<00:02:42.120> good

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
making it with just honey if it's good

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.960 
making it with just honey if it's good
to<00:02:42.420> add<00:02:42.540> apple<00:02:42.840> cider<00:02:42.959> vinegar<00:02:43.110> also<00:02:43.700> well<00:02:44.700> one

to add apple cider vinegar also well one
of<00:02:45.090> my<00:02:45.120> daughters<00:02:45.780> does<00:02:46.080> not<00:02:46.350> like<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.739> syrup

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.470 
of my daughters does not like the syrup
with<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.250> apple<00:02:47.520> cider<00:02:47.610> vinegar<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.360> I

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
with the apple cider vinegar in it I

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.120 
with the apple cider vinegar in it I
think<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.840> tastes<00:02:49.140> yummy<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.739> doesn't<00:02:50.040> have

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
think it tastes yummy it doesn't have

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.070 
think it tastes yummy it doesn't have
very<00:02:50.250> much<00:02:50.459> vinegar<00:02:50.850> in<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.750> think<00:02:51.989> it

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
very much vinegar in it and I think it

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.770 
very much vinegar in it and I think it
tastes<00:02:52.410> really<00:02:52.650> good<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:53.370> she<00:02:54.060> just<00:02:54.330> has<00:02:54.750> a

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
tastes really good but she just has a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.360 
tastes really good but she just has a
hard<00:02:55.020> time<00:02:55.200> with<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.500> she<00:02:55.680> likes<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.010> cider

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
hard time with it she likes the cider

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.270 
hard time with it she likes the cider
vinegar<00:02:56.790> by<00:02:57.000> itself<00:02:57.450> but<00:02:58.080> mixed<00:02:58.920> with<00:02:59.130> the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
vinegar by itself but mixed with the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.590 
vinegar by itself but mixed with the
honey<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.760> elderberry<00:03:00.090> she<00:03:00.330> just<00:03:00.480> has<00:03:00.570> a

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
honey and the elderberry she just has a

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.090 
honey and the elderberry she just has a
hard<00:03:00.810> time<00:03:00.959> taking<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.500> thought<00:03:01.830> that

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
hard time taking it so I thought that

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.760 
hard time taking it so I thought that
would<00:03:02.190> be<00:03:02.340> nice<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.820> make<00:03:02.940> her<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.450> jar<00:03:04.140> without

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
would be nice and make her a jar without

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.310 
would be nice and make her a jar without

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.180 
apple cider vinegar
it<00:03:09.180> contains<00:03:09.959> living<00:03:10.350> enzymes<00:03:10.709> just<00:03:10.950> like<00:03:11.070> the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
it contains living enzymes just like the

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.600 
it contains living enzymes just like the
raw<00:03:11.310> honey<00:03:11.610> that<00:03:12.360> is<00:03:12.510> going<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.320> make<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.459> an

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
raw honey that is going to make it an

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.550 
raw honey that is going to make it an
even<00:03:14.730> healthier<00:03:15.300> syrup<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.350> also

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
even healthier syrup and it also

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.280 
even healthier syrup and it also
preserves<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.610> longer<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.080> with<00:03:19.080> the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
preserves it longer so with the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
because

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.910 
because
taking<00:03:44.660> on<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.780> daily<00:03:44.930> basis<00:03:45.380> and<00:03:45.530> just<00:03:45.680> help

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
taking on a daily basis and just help

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.280 
taking on a daily basis and just help
them<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:46.430> much<00:03:46.640> with<00:03:46.849> allergies<00:03:47.360> and<00:03:47.540> asthma

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
them that much with allergies and asthma

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.830 
them that much with allergies and asthma
and<00:03:48.380> so<00:03:48.860> all<00:03:49.010> you<00:03:49.250> do<00:03:49.489> after<00:03:49.970> you<00:03:50.090> mix<00:03:50.420> that<00:03:50.660> is

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
and so all you do after you mix that is

00:03:50.840 --> 00:04:02.590 
and so all you do after you mix that is
you<00:03:50.989> just<00:03:51.230> pour<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:51.650> into<00:03:51.800> a<00:03:51.980> jar<00:03:58.510> and<00:04:01.420> lid<00:04:02.420> on

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
you just pour it into a jar and lid on

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.030 
you just pour it into a jar and lid on
it<00:04:02.840> and<00:04:02.989> it's<00:04:03.319> a<00:04:03.410> good<00:04:03.800> idea<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.340> label<00:04:05.180> it<00:04:05.300> and

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
it and it's a good idea to label it and

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.040 
it and it's a good idea to label it and
put<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.160> date<00:04:07.370> on<00:04:07.850> it<00:04:08.150> that<00:04:08.330> you<00:04:08.450> made<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.930> so

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
put the date on it that you made it so

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.710 
put the date on it that you made it so
you<00:04:09.200> remember<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:10.430> it<00:04:10.489> expires<00:04:10.880> with<00:04:11.330> honey

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.600 
you remember that it expires with honey

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
very much land you can plant when it's a

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.120 
very much land you can plant when it's a

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
and they turn into elderberries at the

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.230

end of the summer and it's a way that

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.140 
end of the summer and it's a way that
you<00:05:38.479> can<00:05:38.660> be<00:05:38.780> self-sufficient<00:05:39.260> if<00:05:39.950> you<00:05:40.160> grow

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
you can be self-sufficient if you grow

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.430 
you can be self-sufficient if you grow
your<00:05:41.330> own<00:05:41.389> elder<00:05:41.780> brace<00:05:41.960> because<00:05:42.080> there<00:05:42.289> could

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
your own elder brace because there could

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.960 
your own elder brace because there could
come<00:05:42.590> a<00:05:42.650> day<00:05:42.830> when<00:05:42.979> we<00:05:43.100> can't<00:05:43.310> buy<00:05:43.550> our<00:05:43.940> own

I've<00:06:10.840> seen<00:06:11.110> in<00:06:11.500> a<00:06:11.620> health<00:06:11.980> food<00:06:12.040> store<00:06:12.250> and

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
I've seen in a health food store and

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.950

about<00:06:17.110> fifteen<00:06:17.530> dollars<00:06:18.040> and<00:06:18.400> so<00:06:18.580> this<00:06:18.760> is<00:06:18.940> a

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
about fifteen dollars and so this is a

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.050 
about fifteen dollars and so this is a
lot<00:06:19.210> more<00:06:19.450> than<00:06:19.720> eight<00:06:19.870> ounces<00:06:20.350> and<00:06:20.770> I<00:06:21.760> only
