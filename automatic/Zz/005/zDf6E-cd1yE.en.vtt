00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
in this place I mean that for me it's

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.430 
in this place I mean that for me it's
like<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> site-specific<00:00:51.000> work<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.780> art<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.290> put

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
like a site-specific work of art to put

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
like a site-specific work of art to put
it<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.770> place<00:00:53.040> I<00:00:53.280> don't<00:00:53.579> know<00:00:53.820> whether<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
it in this place I don't know whether it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.760 
it in this place I don't know whether it
would<00:00:54.360> work<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> same<00:00:55.020> way<00:00:55.050> anywhere<00:00:55.530> else

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
would work in the same way anywhere else

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.160 
would work in the same way anywhere else
but<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.670> place<00:00:56.879> felt<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.750> was<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> really

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
but the place felt like it was a really

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.990 
but the place felt like it was a really
part<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.680> work<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.280> those<00:00:59.460> looks<00:00:59.789> either
