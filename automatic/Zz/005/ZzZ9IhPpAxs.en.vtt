that's going to help me install a new
one<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:11.090> i<00:01:11.360> don't<00:01:11.510> know<00:01:11.720> if<00:01:11.840> that's<00:01:11.930> a<00:01:12.080> problem

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
one so i don't know if that's a problem

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.570 
one so i don't know if that's a problem
or<00:01:12.470> not<00:01:12.560> i<00:01:12.590> think<00:01:12.710> it's<00:01:12.920> just<00:01:13.040> a<00:01:13.130> mic<00:01:13.280> booster

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
or not i think it's just a mic booster

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.850 
or not i think it's just a mic booster
but<00:01:13.729> it<00:01:13.820> keeps<00:01:13.970> on<00:01:14.120> turning<00:01:14.510> itself<00:01:14.780> on<00:01:15.049> and<00:01:15.320> i

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
but it keeps on turning itself on and i

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.890 
but it keeps on turning itself on and i
think<00:01:16.040> that's<00:01:16.190> that's<00:01:16.430> a<00:01:16.580> real<00:01:16.700> issue<00:01:16.940> i<00:01:17.240> shot

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
think that's that's a real issue i shot

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.420 
think that's that's a real issue i shot
this<00:01:18.049> update<00:01:18.409> video<00:01:18.619> before<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.130> then<00:01:19.280> Mike

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
this update video before and then Mike

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.160 
this update video before and then Mike
booster<00:01:19.700> turned<00:01:19.940> itself<00:01:20.240> up<00:01:20.450> again<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:21.020> I<00:01:21.049> have

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
booster turned itself up again so I have

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.570 
booster turned itself up again so I have
to<00:01:21.260> lower<00:01:21.380> it<00:01:21.650> and<00:01:21.740> now<00:01:21.860> I'm<00:01:21.920> reshooting<00:01:22.369> this

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
to lower it and now I'm reshooting this

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.030 
to lower it and now I'm reshooting this
but<00:01:23.479> um<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.170> yeah<00:01:24.290> basically<00:01:24.440> i<00:01:24.650> think<00:01:24.890> that's

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
but um so yeah basically i think that's

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.760 
but um so yeah basically i think that's
that's<00:01:25.490> fixed<00:01:25.970> with<00:01:26.150> i<00:01:26.390> think<00:01:26.659> i<00:01:26.900> might<00:01:27.740> have

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
that's fixed with i think i might have

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.560 
that's fixed with i think i might have
to<00:01:27.979> keep<00:01:28.220> switching<00:01:28.640> it<00:01:28.760> or<00:01:28.939> if<00:01:29.119> you<00:01:29.240> tell<00:01:29.420> me<00:01:29.450> a

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
to keep switching it or if you tell me a

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.780 
to keep switching it or if you tell me a
way<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:29.659> permanently<00:01:30.130> make<00:01:31.130> it<00:01:31.250> stay<00:01:31.520> lower

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
way to permanently make it stay lower

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.670 
way to permanently make it stay lower
maybe<00:01:32.180> it<00:01:32.360> thinks<00:01:32.390> my<00:01:32.810> mic<00:01:32.990> is<00:01:33.020> like<00:01:33.320> too<00:01:33.470> low

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
maybe it thinks my mic is like too low

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.140 
maybe it thinks my mic is like too low
and<00:01:33.860> it's<00:01:33.950> turning<00:01:34.189> up<00:01:34.369> automatically<00:01:34.880> I

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.340 
and it's turning up automatically I
don't<00:01:35.930> know<00:01:36.049> but<00:01:36.500> um<00:01:37.030> second<00:01:38.030> thing<00:01:38.210> is<00:01:38.390> you
