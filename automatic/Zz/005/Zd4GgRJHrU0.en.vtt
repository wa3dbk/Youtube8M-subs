00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.500 
are
first<00:02:13.920> shiny<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.460> once<00:02:14.700> we<00:02:14.880> get<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.240> first

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
first shiny so once we get the first

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.000 
first shiny so once we get the first

shiny which is gonna be through safri

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.920 
shiny which is gonna be through safri
set<00:02:17.250> then<00:02:17.790> we<00:02:18.150> can<00:02:18.270> go<00:02:18.390> right<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.750> first

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
set then we can go right to the first

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.570 
set then we can go right to the first
year<00:02:19.170> now<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.410> course<00:02:19.650> Iverson<00:02:20.190> isn't

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
year now of course Iverson isn't

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.370 
year now of course Iverson isn't
mandatory<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:21.120> do<00:02:21.300> this<00:02:21.480> we<00:02:21.960> are<00:02:22.080> just<00:02:22.230> doing

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
mandatory to do this we are just doing

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.290 
mandatory to do this we are just doing
this<00:02:22.620> because<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:23.340> adds<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.640> bit<00:02:23.820> more<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:24.180> a

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
this because it adds a bit more of a

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.450 
this because it adds a bit more of a
challenge<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.930> authenticity<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:26.160> this

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
challenge and authenticity to this

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.060 
challenge and authenticity to this
series<00:02:26.820> so<00:02:27.330> whenever<00:02:27.990> we<00:02:28.170> do<00:02:28.380> feat<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.830> first

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
series so whenever we do feat the first

series so whenever we do feat the first
gym<00:02:29.250> with<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.610> starter<00:02:30.090> then<00:02:30.540> before<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:31.080> can

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
gym with the starter then before we can

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.960 
gym with the starter then before we can

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
there in the first place we must get is

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.240 
there in the first place we must get is
