00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.000
 hi all guys with you hamish and 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.020
 Today I will continue the story for the third 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.420
 Soviet branch Fri-Sau Well, specifically for 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.859
 the branch in which no one believed very 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.320
 I have been written in comments for a long time 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.230
 that this is such nonsense we never 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.949
 will and so on it's so small 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.269
 prehistory but what is most interesting 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.809
 developers about a month ago themselves 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.000
 confirmed this information and leaked 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.340
 information about something on this thread I 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.680
 I thought there would be two options 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.390
 there will be a machine in the top here and one of them 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.879
 turned out to be the one that I think in 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.660
 Basically this is from 4 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:50.670
 It is in the form of TCP cabin with a cool 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.500
 well, that is, interestingly houses 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.809
 fri-shka but for it now i wont 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.449
 telling all the more for her were already 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.239
 video I will tell for level 9 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.010
 in this thread since 8 7 I already 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.600
 I told before and I can credit 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.000
 insert video somewhere here you 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.159
 see if you are interested in what were 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.450
 typewriter up 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.340
 pawns since these videos are pretty 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.240
 old maybe somewhere from the month two or three 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.560
 for sure there is well in general on the ninth 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.710
 our level is Su-152 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.810
 ram or object 120 taranus rather 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.549
 all it simply call the object 120 what 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.350
 I also like these here all the more 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.840
 titles 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.350
 code type ram rather than fit dori 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.430
 isu-152 ram also doesn't sound 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.189
 therefore, it is likely to be an object 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.150
 120 and we are now at the ninth level 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.450
 there will be two fr-shki which will be objects 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.810
 you are pretty cool by the way this 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.000
 Fri-Shka will be able to compete with popularity 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.970
 the same 704 may even become more 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.070
 popular and because in battle she somehow 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.710
 to be more effective firstly here 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.549
 we have a tower Akhatin I do not turn 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.820
 360 degrees to the table 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.399
 140 is exactly the turn here can 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.259
 be even a half-turn, she will 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.430
 turning is pretty cool 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.359
 i.e. half circle 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.560
 will we have such a defeat zone that 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.239
 pretty cool i mean it's not 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.969
 704 which just have angles 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.209
 horizontal pickup is already pasha with 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:27.000
 the tower is cool yes but there is 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.329
 minus there is absolutely no armor 30 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.280
 millimeters in the forehead there are 20 in the sides and 15 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.769
 k in places I'm not mistaken but what kind of tower 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.500
 it could be exactly the same 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.060
 more armored no information 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.819
 regarding the tower here 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.700
 Sorry I would like her to be 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.319
 But it’s clear that what’s not here 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.780
 will be on full spin 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.709
 Here's what else would be so interesting . 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.950
 very light 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.480
 It weighs only 27 tons that both 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.549
 I am very well that she is so 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.859
 light and inadequate small in size 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.500
 pretty six meters only 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:05.489
 the valley is also pretty good and 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:10.109
 the engine here is so very powerful i would 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:13.859
 he said diesel we have that is to burn 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:17.099
 Fri-shka will not be as often as is allowed 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.959
 the same 704 even though it seems to many that 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.940
 burns and often but actually if we 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.449
 throw in the stern he lights up 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.849
 well after two three shots exactly 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:29.189
 more always those people who know where 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.199
 baku 704 those just shoot tanks and 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:34.049
 sets fire to him here will be all much 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:38.220
 it is more difficult to set fire to a pawn 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:41.009
 harder but it is cardboard in distinguishing 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.239
 from 704 so basically this is not 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:49.169
 especially a lie and plus here but by the way 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.720
 saying here we have very good 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:54.720
 maximum speed of 64 kilometers per hour 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.930
 that is, a really fast Fri-shka 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.060
 drive straight even drive very fast 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.379
 previous pet and she will be really very 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.540
 quickly and that is, it will be possible 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.120
 take some key positions in 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.329
 bushes for example and throw not 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.459
 glow work through the tower from the tower 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.340
 highlight here by the way will be more 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.079
 good visibility of at least 400 meters 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.090
 here it will be for sure because she was 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.510
 very sharp-sighted here it was released already 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.639
 70s so she should be in 2 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.510
 very hot and very good in fact it 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.900
 really imba 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.479
 bt glass cannon which 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.310
 really inspire in some measure the fear and 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.070
 would be pretty cool seemingly 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.169
 hoods and ponerfili but here it is 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.380
 branch of course not so soon but 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.930
 no less than these pt will bend the truth is not in 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.180
 each hands that is, it is necessary that 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.570
 the brain of a person who plays this 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.190
 fr and so a person could somehow 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.139
 understand in general how to play 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.440
 glass typewriter as waffenturger 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:05:00.550
 only without a drum 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.840
 we are therefore in principle problems 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.940
 will not be so that this pasha will 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.340
 just bends them not so much 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.889
 as the same 704 although it should be 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.050
 pretty popular here yet 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.800
 one very cool feature is 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:18.280
 We have a gun 150 2 millimeter cannon m 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.310
 69 this is very modern and cannon and in 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.200
 the game it should be such a gun like 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.370
 even 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.600
 plazmagan but because you I was she 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.070
 made to punch 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.680
 machines like 60 deuce for example it 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.260
 all the same not weak as for me to break through 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.810
 if there should be at least two hundred 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.120
 eighty certainly millimeters can 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.849
 even under 300 because it really is 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.320
 the gun was very powerful and in real life 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:48.880
 shot and at very large distances 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.530
 and it was very accurate very powerful 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.900
 brought out of course it will bring it not 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.780
 will be so bend over but it should be 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.750
 a worthy competitor bl-10 what's by 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.210
 I am very well and well, ammunition here 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.440
 us guns only 22 shells but in 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.820
 In principle, this is the norm 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:09.430
 here's a new firing rate too 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.740
 pretty important for pc and here 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.910
 she will be new charging somewhere in the area 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:19.170
 12 and 13 seconds and maybe even 14 years exactly 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:21.430
 I do not know but should be around 12 seconds 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.410
 But if it is of course so 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.930
 little shells will be very fast 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.610
 run out I think that in this game 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.090
 recharge zerfit and it will be somewhere 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:33.780
 15 seconds with a rammer somewhere 14 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:37.720
 pennies as in principle with the same 704 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.370
 Well , here we have a type in 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.240
 size 4 people 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:45.490
 Well, in principle, all the information ppt 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.740
 this ends me more 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.410
 nothing like that 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:52.420
 there is only the history of the creation of this birdie 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.010
 but I think it is not interesting to anyone and you 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.040
 You can read it yourself just to drive in 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:07:00.520
 google and object 120 ramming there will be all 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:04.810
 creation stories and all the information what 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:07.560
 There is in it here but so on this 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:10.780
 dads all hope you were interested 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.790
 put likes subscribe to the channel 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.980
 the number of likes will depend on 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:18.610
 How soon will I tell the West on the base 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:20.710
 site 4 which will be in the top and in 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.270
 principle on how many likes to be 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.580
 Depends only on what will be the general video 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.200
 releasing because I always look at 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.540
 that is, if people are interested, they 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.460
 put likes if they made attacks means not 

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:33.010
 want new videos 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:37.060
 that's why in principle this is all that to me 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:39.250
 need from you guys subscribe to 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.870
 channel if you are not already subscribed if you 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:46.450
 it was interesting and you want to learn new 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:49.260
 well, wait for the new videos 

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.260
 dating guys
