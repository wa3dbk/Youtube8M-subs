obviously<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.240> actually<00:01:06.510> really<00:01:06.990> helped

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
obviously and I actually really helped

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.140 
obviously and I actually really helped
me<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.320> stayed<00:01:07.619> hydrated<00:01:07.799> eight<00:01:08.760> loads<00:01:09.000> of

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
me just stayed hydrated eight loads of

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.050 
me just stayed hydrated eight loads of
fruit<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:10.350> made<00:01:10.619> such<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> difference

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
fruit and it made such a difference

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.270 
fruit and it made such a difference
actually<00:01:12.060> one<00:01:12.930> date<00:01:13.200> between<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
actually one date between this and the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.450 
actually one date between this and the
final<00:01:14.670> race<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.380> that<00:01:16.380> seemed<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:17.340> me

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
final race and that seemed to not do me

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.160 
final race and that seemed to not do me
good<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.729> think<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.970> was<00:01:18.060> too<00:01:18.270> much<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.930> got<00:01:19.080> to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
good I think it was too much you got to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.929 
good I think it was too much you got to
eat<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.159> hydrate<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.759> fruits

fun event great so we find I could've

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.259 
fun event great so we find I could've
done<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.370> without<00:02:15.489> all<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.879> training<00:02:16.180> I've

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
done that without all the training I've

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.759 
done that without all the training I've
been<00:02:16.360> doing<00:02:16.540> lately<00:02:16.659> here<00:02:17.500> we<00:02:17.560> have<00:02:17.680> the

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
been doing lately here we have the

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.320 
been doing lately here we have the
Sprint<00:02:18.220> event<00:02:18.519> this<00:02:18.640> was<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.849> second<00:02:19.239> event

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
of the day so there's three rounds

quotes Emmys and finals in the sprint
and<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.409> same<00:02:23.590> in<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.799> endurance<00:02:24.159> one<00:02:24.370> this

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
and the same in the endurance one this

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.979 
and the same in the endurance one this
is<00:02:24.640> just<00:02:24.790> one<00:02:25.000> length<00:02:25.180> from<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.569> back<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.959> the

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
is just one length from the back to the

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.309 
is just one length from the back to the
front<00:02:26.819> slightly<00:02:27.819> different<00:02:28.180> track<00:02:28.420> as<00:02:28.840> you

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
front slightly different track as you

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.449 
front slightly different track as you
can<00:02:29.530> see<00:02:29.680> there<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:29.890> think<00:02:30.010> I've<00:02:30.190> got<00:02:30.310> one<00:02:30.400> of

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
can see there I think I've got one of

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.740 
can see there I think I've got one of
the<00:02:30.519> most<00:02:30.640> efficient<00:02:31.030> techniques<00:02:31.390> look<00:02:31.569> at<00:02:31.659> my

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
the most efficient techniques look at my

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.410 
the most efficient techniques look at my
chest<00:02:31.989> stays<00:02:32.470> up<00:02:32.819> don't<00:02:33.819> touch<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.209> peak

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
chest stays up don't touch the peak

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.449 
chest stays up don't touch the peak
glide<00:02:35.049> over<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.440> peak<00:02:35.620> charge<00:02:36.159> down<00:02:36.370> the

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
glide over the peak charge down the

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.699 
glide over the peak charge down the
other<00:02:36.579> side<00:02:36.790> like<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.930> just<00:02:38.049> got<00:02:38.230> long<00:02:38.440> limbs

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
other side like I just got long limbs

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.729 
other side like I just got long limbs
out<00:02:39.040> when<00:02:39.579> he's<00:02:39.730> going<00:02:40.000> for<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:41.470> we'll<00:02:41.560> see

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
out when he's going for it but we'll see

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:42.869 
out when he's going for it but we'll see
where<00:02:41.860> this<00:02:41.950> technique<00:02:42.310> holds<00:02:42.579> through<00:02:42.730> to

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
where this technique holds through to

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.569 
where this technique holds through to
the<00:02:42.970> end<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:44.190> was<00:02:45.190> swinging<00:02:45.400> by<00:02:45.609> my<00:02:45.760> side

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
the end I was swinging by my side

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.670 
the end I was swinging by my side
focused<00:02:48.930> accelerate<00:02:49.930> down<00:02:50.079> that<00:02:50.260> bottom<00:02:50.500> bit

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
focused accelerate down that bottom bit

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.490 
focused accelerate down that bottom bit
up<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.040> hill<00:02:51.900> there<00:02:52.900> we<00:02:52.959> go<00:02:53.079> gliding<00:02:53.349> through

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
up the hill there we go gliding through

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.900 
up the hill there we go gliding through
with<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.709> Vibrams<00:02:54.160> have<00:02:54.340> been<00:02:54.459> training<00:02:54.819> the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
with the Vibrams have been training the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.240 
with the Vibrams have been training the
vibrance<00:02:55.329> for<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.540> long<00:02:55.690> time<00:02:55.930> now<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:56.950> really

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
vibrance for a long time now I really

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.589 
vibrance for a long time now I really
like<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.549> barefoot<00:02:57.940> really<00:02:58.209> obviously

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
like the barefoot really obviously

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.940 
like the barefoot really obviously
you're<00:02:58.750> stomping<00:02:59.109> a<00:02:59.170> bit<00:02:59.290> more<00:02:59.440> solid

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
you're stomping a bit more solid

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.319 
you're stomping a bit more solid
concrete<00:03:00.519> per<00:03:00.670> have<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.819> lot<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:01.000> people<00:03:01.239> had

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
really good in not good injuries but

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.670 
really good in not good injuries but
injuries<00:03:03.519> my<00:03:03.909> hip<00:03:04.090> flexors<00:03:04.480> were<00:03:04.629> aching<00:03:05.590> a

injuries my hip flexors were aching a

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.899 
injuries my hip flexors were aching a
lot<00:03:05.890> from<00:03:06.099> all<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.459> up<00:03:06.579> and<00:03:06.760> downhill

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909
