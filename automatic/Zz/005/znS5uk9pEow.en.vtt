00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.209
 welcome to the depp unit and 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:09.160
 assists of module 3 of other zoonoses 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:09.160
 parasitic by mouth 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.740
 the points that will be followed in the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.200
 presentation of the unit are the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.630
 following first presents 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.060
 the cause of the disease that cycle 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.130
 biological has and the false infectious 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.020
 for humans it will also be done 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.560
 reference to the geographical distribution 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.960
 and the casuistry as well as the signs with 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.360
 those who study the treatment of choice 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.620
 and finally the prevention and control 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.620
 of this dose basket 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.350
 the dip and lydia sis is a dose basket 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.050
 very common in animals of 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.180
 company therefore suggests a greater 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.949
 predisposition to suffer it in the 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.620
 people who live with dogs and cats 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.050
 if they do not keep the appropriate measures 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.059
 hygienic-sanitary cases more 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.970
 frequent occur in short children 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.110
 age then contact scrap and the no 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.460
 application of measures 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.460
 hygienic-sanitary 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.799
 peeling caninum is a whole 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.590
 cause of deep lidia if you can 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.990
 reach 60 centimeters in length 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.509
 the escort of delirium is armed that is to say 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.820
 that has a face with several crowns 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.640
 of hooks to anchor to the mucosa of the 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.399
 bowel characteristics 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.170
 dilithium it is important to know that 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.020
 recorded probiotics have mobility 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.149
 own and leave the host in a way 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.220
 independent to the stool these 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.280
 proteins the size of the color of a 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.700
 Cucumber nugget are releasing capsules 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.800
 or light capsules with 20 or 30 eggs 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.929
 thick cover inside which 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.929
 locate the embryo ex a canto 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.310
 the biological cycle of delirium is 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.980
 indirect like that of all states 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.310
 animals and people get infected 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.490
 when they ingest the different cips that 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.960
 they are in fleas mainly 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.080
 It can also be found in lice 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.720
 the jdd cysticercus is in the intestine it 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.700
 transform into the adult gesture 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.800
 lengthening the this vilo own 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.750
 engravings will go to the caudal part of the 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.780
 digestive tract and they will come out of the 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.819
 host for the anus 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.980
 during the movement of the forecasts 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.400
 they are detaching capsules or light 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.290
 that are ingested by fleas 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.959
 mainly the eggs hatch in 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.340
 the intestine of the flea and the embryo is 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.920
 pulling through the wall of the 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.530
 intestine and it will form in the cavity 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.750
 cephalic theme the cysticercus today that 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.640
 is going to be the infecting way when 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.610
 after definitive principal or 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.480
 secondary ingests the 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.480
 adult gesture 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.530
 the infecting phase is a fifty siege and 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.110
 that is located in the flea or in the 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.720
 lice people can become infected 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.000
 when they accidentally made fleas or 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.460
 lice with fish chalk coidh is also 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.380
 when a dog or a cat has chewed 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.540
 a flea a louse can be left 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.060
 cysticercosis in which he sees all of 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.730
 temporary form and if the in a person in 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.010
 the west mouth sucks the area life 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.210
 by the dog by the cat ingest 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.210
 cysticerc yes 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.010
 the pili de asis has been cited throughout 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.510
 the world except in Antarctica the 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.970
 presence of stanford or if you are 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.370
 linked to the greatest exposure to the form 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.710
 infecting is why it is associated with 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.350
 the poor hygienic conditions and with 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.180
 close contact with dogs and cats and 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.840
 especially the one linked to the presence of 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.430
 the intermediary pairs fleas or lice 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.010
 the prevalence is higher in children than in 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.170
 adults with almost all safety can be 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.880
 say it is because they do not keep the 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.880
 adequate hygienic-sanitary measures 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.790
 Most infections occur without 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.830
 symptomatology but you can write 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.200
 typical clinical pictures of a basket 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.160
 discomfort dosage 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.660
 anorexia abdominal pain diarrhea 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.120
 Puritan because the promised 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.120
 they have their own mobility and they go out of shape 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.330
 independent to the stool in infections 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.100
 Chronicles can delay growth and 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.950
 malnutrition due to the action 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.170
 plundering of the cesc all these signs 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.090
 are directly related to the 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.090
 parasitic load in the host 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.809
 the most accurate diagnosis is to see the 

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:37.910
 promised to move either on the mass 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:39.710
 fecal or underwear 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.200
 because of his way of leaving the 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.340
 Hosted can not be conclusive a 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.340
 negative coprological 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.820
 The treatment of choice is 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.800
 practical to him is a drug that has 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.130
 proven its effectiveness in this type of 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.050
 infections prevention and control happens 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.780
 for a safe relationship with pets 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.520
 that is to say to establish hygienic tights 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.190
 suitable for example washing hands 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.750
 after touching the pets too 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.690
 Deworming would be successful 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.190
 internal and external use of pets 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.010
 deworming treatment 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.870
 internal should include an acid basket 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.620
 as practical before and 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.630
 external deworming will be directed to 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.610
 eliminate this intermediary therefore the 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.570
 Infect form before this first 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.570
 zoonoses 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.960
 they have been the main sources 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.960
 of bibliography consulted 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.430
 and thank you very much for your attention
