00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
Lumia with its 41 megapixel camera and

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.190 
Lumia with its 41 megapixel camera and
the<00:03:26.750> galaxy<00:03:27.170> s4<00:03:27.440> has<00:03:27.610> 13<00:03:28.610> megapixels<00:03:29.420> but<00:03:29.930> guys

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
the galaxy s4 has 13 megapixels but guys

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.560 
the galaxy s4 has 13 megapixels but guys
megapixels<00:03:31.160> they<00:03:31.400> are<00:03:31.549> really<00:03:31.940> overrated<00:03:32.450> so

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
megapixels they are really overrated so

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.300 
megapixels they are really overrated so
let's<00:03:32.690> just<00:03:32.900> forget<00:03:33.080> about<00:03:33.260> them<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.769> focus

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
let's just forget about them and focus

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.430 
let's just forget about them and focus
on<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.670> quality<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.450> I<00:03:35.810> would<00:03:35.959> say<00:03:36.110> that<00:03:36.350> the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
on the quality and I would say that the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.500 
on the quality and I would say that the
Lumia<00:03:36.709> 1020<00:03:36.920> is<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.610> sharpest<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:38.299> the

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
Lumia 1020 is the sharpest and the

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.020 
Lumia 1020 is the sharpest and the
clearest<00:03:39.080> but<00:03:39.860> maybe<00:03:40.130> like<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.580> couch<00:03:40.760> on<00:03:41.000> the

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
clearest but maybe like the couch on the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.150 
clearest but maybe like the couch on the
iPhone<00:03:41.390> 5s<00:03:41.660> is<00:03:41.840> a<00:03:41.900> little<00:03:42.080> bit<00:03:42.200> better<00:03:42.440> the

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
iPhone 5s is a little bit better the

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.110 
iPhone 5s is a little bit better the
galaxy<00:03:43.580> s4

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
galaxy s4

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.240 
galaxy s4
I<00:03:44.150> wouldn't<00:03:44.720> say<00:03:44.870> that<00:03:44.900> it's<00:03:45.320> washed<00:03:45.620> out<00:03:45.890> but

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
I wouldn't say that it's washed out but

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.430 
I wouldn't say that it's washed out but
I<00:03:46.430> like<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.880> least<00:03:47.120> of<00:03:47.330> these<00:03:47.570> three<00:03:48.110> phones

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
I like the least of these three phones

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.550 
I like the least of these three phones

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
in this clip the Lumia 1020 easily has

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.310 
in this clip the Lumia 1020 easily has
the<00:03:51.769> best<00:03:52.010> zoom<00:03:52.400> it<00:03:52.850> offers<00:03:53.180> 6<00:03:53.450> X<00:03:53.720> lossless

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
the best zoom it offers 6 X lossless

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
Full HD on the other two phones when you

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.750 
Full HD on the other two phones when you
start<00:04:00.170> zooming<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.769> quality<00:04:01.130> of<00:04:01.310> your<00:04:01.459> image

really gets worse

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.229 
really gets worse
so<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.350> Lumia<00:04:03.620> 1020<00:04:03.769> wins<00:04:04.340> this<00:04:04.580> test<00:04:04.940> it

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
so the Lumia 1020 wins this test it

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.570 
so the Lumia 1020 wins this test it
really<00:04:05.720> has<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:05.900> great<00:04:06.230> camera<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:07.160> especially

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
shines in low-light situations I would

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.229 
shines in low-light situations I would
say<00:04:10.130> that<00:04:10.310> it<00:04:10.370> probably<00:04:10.549> asked<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:10.940> best

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
say that it probably asked the best

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.390 
say that it probably asked the best
