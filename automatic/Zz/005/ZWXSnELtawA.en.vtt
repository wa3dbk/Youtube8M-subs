hey YouTube is good in 273 making a

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.380 
hey YouTube is good in 273 making a
quick<00:00:03.480> video<00:00:03.990> not<00:00:04.560> on<00:00:04.770> any<00:00:05.009> knife<00:00:05.940> in

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
quick video not on any knife in

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.990 
quick video not on any knife in
particular<00:00:07.429> but<00:00:08.429> on<00:00:09.769> essentially<00:00:10.769> Springs<00:00:11.580> in

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
particular but on essentially Springs in

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.990 
particular but on essentially Springs in
knives<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.660> guess<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.080> could<00:00:13.230> say<00:00:13.849> some<00:00:14.849> people

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
knives I guess you could say some people

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.840 
knives I guess you could say some people
just<00:00:15.360> have<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.440> want<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.070> call<00:00:17.250> illusion

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
just have this I want to call illusion

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.679 
just have this I want to call illusion
that<00:00:18.480> these<00:00:18.960> things<00:00:19.170> are<00:00:20.660> impervious<00:00:21.660> to

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
that these things are impervious to

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.519 
that these things are impervious to
breakage<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.279> they<00:00:23.760> last<00:00:24.000> forever<00:00:24.529> or

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
breakage so that they last forever or

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.029 
breakage so that they last forever or
years<00:00:26.519> even<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.289> this<00:00:28.289> won't<00:00:28.410> break<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:28.859> you

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
years even and this won't break on you

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.209 
years even and this won't break on you
and<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:30.359> may<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.570> for<00:00:30.960> some<00:00:30.990> people<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:31.769> it's

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
and that may be for some people but it's

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.180 
and that may be for some people but it's
not<00:00:32.430> for<00:00:32.640> me<00:00:32.759> that's<00:00:33.450> not<00:00:33.690> been<00:00:33.870> my<00:00:33.899> experience

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
not for me that's not been my experience

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.110 
not for me that's not been my experience
and<00:00:35.190> here<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.969> two<00:00:37.399> Kershaw<00:00:38.399> speed<00:00:38.790> assist

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
and here I have two Kershaw speed assist

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.869 
and here I have two Kershaw speed assist
knives<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.690> two<00:00:40.590> benchmade<00:00:41.129> access<00:00:41.640> box

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
knives and two benchmade access box

knives and two benchmade access box
knives<00:00:42.360> no<00:00:42.930> access<00:00:43.290> card<00:00:43.530> they<00:00:43.710> now<00:00:44.600> both<00:00:45.600> of

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
knives no access card they now both of

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.260 
knives no access card they now both of
these<00:00:46.050> knives<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.890> corporates<00:00:47.489> one<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.090> these

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
these knives and corporates one of these

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.450 
these knives and corporates one of these
which<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.320> torsion<00:00:49.739> bar<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.280> one

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
which is a torsion bar this one

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.600 
which is a torsion bar this one
specifically<00:00:51.050> for<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> shallot<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.430> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
specifically for the shallot and just to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.860 
specifically for the shallot and just to
get<00:00:53.820> an<00:00:54.239> idea<00:00:54.530> how<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.680> works<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.510> this<00:00:57.510> part

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
get an idea how this works is this part

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.010 
get an idea how this works is this part
hooks<00:00:58.320> into<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.590> blade<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.430> then<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.719> hooks

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
hooks into the blade and then this hooks

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.450 
hooks into the blade and then this hooks
into<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.230> back<00:01:01.469> spacer<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.219> sort<00:01:02.430> of

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
into the back spacer and you can sort of

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.429 
into the back spacer and you can sort of
see<00:01:02.609> how<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.910> would<00:01:03.030> Bend<00:01:04.010> it<00:01:05.010> bends<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.700> this

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
see how it would Bend it bends like this

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.710 
see how it would Bend it bends like this
would<00:01:07.439> compress<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.490> then<00:01:08.880> when<00:01:09.150> opening<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
would compress and then when opening a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.350 
would compress and then when opening a
knife<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:10.619> honest<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.010> obviously<00:01:11.400> get<00:01:11.580> you

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
knife be honest you obviously get you

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.499 
knife be honest you obviously get you
know<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> nice<00:01:12.810> fast<00:01:13.530> opening<00:01:14.010> now<00:01:15.000> that's<00:01:15.330> all

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
know a nice fast opening now that's all

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.340 
know a nice fast opening now that's all
well<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.840> good<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:17.630> this<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.840> blurt<00:01:19.080> here

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
well and good but this is a blurt here

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.969 
well and good but this is a blurt here
notice<00:01:19.770> there<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.729> no<00:01:21.500> there's<00:01:22.500> no<00:01:22.680> speed

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
notice there is no there's no speed

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.280 
notice there is no there's no speed
assist<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.610> knife<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:25.110> is

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
assist with this knife and that is

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.780 
assist with this knife and that is
because<00:01:26.000> off<00:01:27.000> camera<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:29.130> torsion<00:01:29.579> bar<00:01:29.759> broke

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
because off camera the torsion bar broke

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.320 
because off camera the torsion bar broke
in<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.030> blur

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
in the blur

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.180 
in the blur
and<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:35.800> torsion<00:01:36.220> bar<00:01:36.400> broke<00:01:36.670> in<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.510> shallot

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
and the torsion bar broke in the shallot

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.660 
and the torsion bar broke in the shallot
you<00:01:39.190> can<00:01:39.370> seize<00:01:39.610> get<00:01:40.240> them<00:01:40.390> both<00:01:41.370> both<00:01:42.370> back

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
you can seize get them both both back

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.850 
you can seize get them both both back
here<00:01:42.700> they<00:01:43.570> both<00:01:43.810> broke<00:01:44.110> in<00:01:44.350> nearly<00:01:44.620> identical

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
here they both broke in nearly identical

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.830 
here they both broke in nearly identical
ways<00:01:45.900> this<00:01:46.900> part<00:01:47.230> was<00:01:47.650> busting<00:01:48.190> off<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
ways this part was busting off the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.360 
ways this part was busting off the
weakest<00:01:50.200> part<00:01:50.470> of<00:01:50.620> the<00:01:50.710> bike<00:01:50.950> you<00:01:51.100> can<00:01:51.250> see

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
weakest part of the bike you can see

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.310 
weakest part of the bike you can see
that<00:01:51.490> this<00:01:51.580> is<00:01:51.730> the<00:01:51.820> blurs<00:01:52.030> it<00:01:52.810> broke<00:01:53.110> in<00:01:53.230> the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
that this is the blurs it broke in the

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.780 
that this is the blurs it broke in the
closed<00:01:53.560> position<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.340> can<00:01:54.460> see<00:01:54.580> how<00:01:54.730> to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
closed position so you can see how to

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.230 
closed position so you can see how to
bend<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.570> piece<00:01:56.350> of<00:01:56.500> metal<00:01:56.800> is<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.710> before

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
bend that piece of metal is so before

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.320 
bend that piece of metal is so before
then<00:02:01.240> breakage<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.770> shallot<00:02:03.220> broke<00:02:03.520> in<00:02:03.700> 26

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
then breakage the shallot broke in 26

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.410 
then breakage the shallot broke in 26
days<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:05.650> blurt<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.250> was<00:02:06.640> about<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:06.910> year<00:02:07.240> after

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
days the blurt I was about a year after

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.760 
days the blurt I was about a year after
I<00:02:07.600> got<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:07.960> it<00:02:08.080> broke<00:02:08.260> so<00:02:10.140> take<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.320> for<00:02:11.380> what

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
I got it it broke so take that for what

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.290 
I got it it broke so take that for what
you<00:02:11.920> will<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.490> nice<00:02:12.670> thing<00:02:12.700> though<00:02:13.090> is

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
you will the nice thing though is

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.200 
you will the nice thing though is
Kershaw<00:02:13.750> will<00:02:14.140> send<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.620> out<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:16.060> know

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
Kershaw will send you out you know

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.840 
Kershaw will send you out you know
torsion<00:02:16.930> bars<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.340> can<00:02:18.490> fix<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.790> yourself

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
torsion bars so you can fix it yourself

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.910 
torsion bars so you can fix it yourself
so<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.510> don't<00:02:19.660> really<00:02:19.720> mind<00:02:20.050> then<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.770> other

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
so I don't really mind then the other

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.780 
so I don't really mind then the other
thing<00:02:21.130> is<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:23.080> torsion<00:02:23.530> bar<00:02:23.740> just<00:02:24.460> opens

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
thing is the the torsion bar just opens

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.840 
thing is the the torsion bar just opens
nice<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.620> has<00:02:26.620> an<00:02:26.770> email<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.130> liar<00:02:27.370> lock

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
nice it has an email a liar lock

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.340 
nice it has an email a liar lock
so<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.090> lock<00:02:28.270> is<00:02:28.480> independent<00:02:29.140> in<00:02:29.260> the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
so the lock is independent in the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.980 
so the lock is independent in the
opening<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.280> that's<00:02:30.490> what<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.700> like<00:02:30.850> about<00:02:30.990> the

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
opening so that's what I like about the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.540 
opening so that's what I like about the
sweet<00:02:32.290> safe<00:02:32.530> knives<00:02:32.800> is<00:02:33.070> that<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:35.530> know<00:02:35.650> if<00:02:36.310> it

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
sweet safe knives is that you know if it

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.610 
sweet safe knives is that you know if it
were<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.760> fail<00:02:37.000> on<00:02:37.240> you<00:02:37.420> at<00:02:37.990> a<00:02:38.020> critical<00:02:38.290> point

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
were to fail on you at a critical point

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.560 
were to fail on you at a critical point
in<00:02:38.739> time<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.610> knife<00:02:39.820> is<00:02:40.000> still<00:02:40.180> operational

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
in time the knife is still operational

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.900 
in time the knife is still operational
and<00:02:40.989> even<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.230> blur<00:02:41.440> has<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:42.430> fairly<00:02:42.850> good

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
and even the blur has a fairly good

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.120 
and even the blur has a fairly good
detent<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:44.380> actually<00:02:44.500> like<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:45.040> as<00:02:45.100> a

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
detent and I actually like it as a

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.860 
detent and I actually like it as a
manual<00:02:45.520> so<00:02:45.790> I'm<00:02:45.880> not<00:02:46.000> gonna<00:02:46.330> even<00:02:46.480> bother<00:02:46.690> with

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
manual so I'm not gonna even bother with

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.440 
manual so I'm not gonna even bother with
the<00:02:47.020> torsion<00:02:47.440> bar<00:02:47.650> with<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.760> shallot<00:02:49.120> when<00:02:49.330> it

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
the torsion bar with the shallot when it

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.580 
the torsion bar with the shallot when it
touches<00:02:49.690> bar<00:02:50.020> broke<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:52.660> was<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:53.020> also<00:02:53.170> acted

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
touches bar broke it was it also acted

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.350 
touches bar broke it was it also acted
as<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.709> detent<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.520> knife<00:02:54.730> was<00:02:54.880> detent

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
as a detent so this knife was detent

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.270 
as a detent so this knife was detent
list<00:02:56.459> but<00:02:57.459> in<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:59.140> still<00:02:59.500> locked<00:02:59.739> open<00:02:59.950> so

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
list but in it still locked open so

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.110 
list but in it still locked open so
that's<00:03:00.430> kind<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.700> nice

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
that's kind of nice

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.680 
that's kind of nice
and<00:03:01.690> here<00:03:02.140> we<00:03:02.590> have<00:03:02.739> two<00:03:03.239> axis<00:03:04.239> locks<00:03:04.450> knives

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
and here we have two axis locks knives

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.690 
and here we have two axis locks knives
the<00:03:05.140> mini<00:03:05.350> grip<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:06.160> my<00:03:06.340> benchmade<00:03:06.760> 530<00:03:07.239> now

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
the mini grip and my benchmade 530 now

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.979 
the mini grip and my benchmade 530 now
all<00:03:09.700> this<00:03:09.940> less<00:03:10.180> than<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.420> knife<00:03:10.510> speak<00:03:10.780> for

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
all this less than the knife speak for

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.290 
all this less than the knife speak for
itself

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.790 

this<00:03:16.930> one<00:03:17.170> has<00:03:17.440> both<00:03:18.690> Omega<00:03:19.690> Springs<00:03:20.320> break<00:03:20.620> on

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
this one has both Omega Springs break on

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
this one has both Omega Springs break on
this<00:03:21.210> after<00:03:22.210> about<00:03:22.330> a<00:03:22.390> year<00:03:22.480> beauties<00:03:23.020> do<00:03:23.820> so

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
this after about a year beauties do so

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.700 
this after about a year beauties do so
and<00:03:25.810> with<00:03:25.990> the<00:03:26.080> thing<00:03:26.260> with<00:03:26.350> this

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
and with the thing with this

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.900 
and with the thing with this
there's<00:03:27.310> no<00:03:27.490> detent<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.240> the<00:03:28.780> lock<00:03:28.990> is

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
there's no detent and the lock is

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.140 
there's no detent and the lock is
useless<00:03:30.910> so<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:32.680> started<00:03:33.220> don't<00:03:33.550> care<00:03:33.910> for

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
useless so I started don't care for

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.080 
useless so I started don't care for
access<00:03:34.480> black<00:03:34.690> knives<00:03:34.930> really<00:03:35.230> anymore<00:03:36.090> is

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
access black knives really anymore is

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.620 
access black knives really anymore is
that<00:03:37.350> total<00:03:38.350> failure<00:03:39.060> renders<00:03:40.060> you<00:03:40.240> a<00:03:40.270> useless

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
that total failure renders you a useless

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.930 
that total failure renders you a useless
knife<00:03:41.080> and<00:03:41.950> if<00:03:42.070> anything<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:42.520> could<00:03:42.610> hurt<00:03:42.820> you

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
knife and if anything it could hurt you

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.200 
knife and if anything it could hurt you
if<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.180> had<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.590> use<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:44.770> in<00:03:45.190> actual<00:03:45.700> real<00:03:46.000> life

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
if you had to use it in actual real life

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
if you had to use it in actual real life
terms<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.720> know<00:03:46.840> so<00:03:48.180> that's<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.660> then

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
terms you know so that's that and then

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.400 
terms you know so that's that and then
this<00:03:50.460> this<00:03:51.460> mini<00:03:51.760> grip<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.660> one<00:03:52.780> I<00:03:52.810> won<00:03:53.140> from

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
this this mini grip the one I won from

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.660 
this this mini grip the one I won from
at<00:03:53.590> peace<00:03:53.860> peace<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:55.480> had<00:03:55.780> one<00:03:56.740> Omega<00:03:57.280> spring

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
at peace peace it had one Omega spring

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.280 
at peace peace it had one Omega spring
break<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.780> it<00:03:59.710> is<00:04:00.010> semi<00:04:00.970> functional<00:04:01.570> but<00:04:02.110> the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
break so it is semi functional but the

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.440 
break so it is semi functional but the
Omega<00:04:02.590> like<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.460> access<00:04:03.790> block<00:04:03.970> is<00:04:04.120> super

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
Omega like the access block is super

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.520 
Omega like the access block is super
weak<00:04:04.710> like<00:04:06.450> that<00:04:07.450> was<00:04:07.600> just<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.900> shake<00:04:08.140> right

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
weak like that was just a shake right

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.010 
weak like that was just a shake right
there<00:04:08.770> just<00:04:08.890> the<00:04:09.420> you<00:04:10.420> know<00:04:10.540> it's<00:04:10.720> not<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:10.900> very

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
there just the you know it's not a very

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.450 
there just the you know it's not a very
even<00:04:11.380> hard<00:04:11.620> shake<00:04:11.830> kind<00:04:12.190> of<00:04:12.280> hard<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.430> do<00:04:12.520> it<00:04:12.610> on

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
even hard shake kind of hard to do it on

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.260 
even hard shake kind of hard to do it on
on<00:04:15.460> in<00:04:16.299> frame<00:04:16.630> but<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.440> can<00:04:17.590> see<00:04:17.770> just<00:04:17.799> how

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
on in frame but you can see just how

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.720 
on in frame but you can see just how
even<00:04:19.270> one<00:04:19.600> Omega<00:04:20.440> spring<00:04:20.770> breaking<00:04:21.040> renders

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
even one Omega spring breaking renders

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.120 
even one Omega spring breaking renders
the<00:04:21.880> whole<00:04:21.910> knife<00:04:22.620> pretty<00:04:23.620> much<00:04:23.800> useless

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
the whole knife pretty much useless

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.950 
the whole knife pretty much useless
because<00:04:24.460> even<00:04:24.850> I<00:04:25.060> guess<00:04:25.210> you<00:04:25.360> could<00:04:25.540> use<00:04:25.570> it's

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
because even I guess you could use it's

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.800 
because even I guess you could use it's
not<00:04:26.290> useless<00:04:26.590> those<00:04:26.950> unsafe<00:04:27.790> like<00:04:28.420> I<00:04:28.570> wouldn't

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
not useless those unsafe like I wouldn't

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.130 
not useless those unsafe like I wouldn't
trust<00:04:29.050> this<00:04:29.230> knife<00:04:29.440> even<00:04:29.770> just<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.450> quick<00:04:31.450> wrist

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
trust this knife even just a quick wrist

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.440 
trust this knife even just a quick wrist
you<00:04:32.560> know<00:04:32.590> not<00:04:32.920> even<00:04:32.950> a<00:04:33.190> really<00:04:33.340> hard<00:04:33.610> wrist

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
you know not even a really hard wrist

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.830 
you know not even a really hard wrist
flick<00:04:34.690> gets<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.110> knife<00:04:35.260> open<00:04:35.680> so<00:04:36.640> at<00:04:37.510> some

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
flick gets the knife open so at some

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.090 
flick gets the knife open so at some

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
think this was about a month but I don't

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.700 
think this was about a month but I don't
know<00:06:50.270> how<00:06:50.419> used<00:06:50.720> it<00:06:50.870> was<00:06:50.990> before<00:06:51.349> because<00:06:51.440> it

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
know how used it was before because it

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.300 
know how used it was before because it
was<00:06:51.800> one<00:06:51.979> of<00:06:52.010> the<00:06:52.130> contests<00:06:53.110> 26<00:06:54.110> days<00:06:54.380> and<00:06:54.919> then

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
was one of the contests 26 days and then

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.140 
was one of the contests 26 days and then
about<00:06:55.490> a<00:06:55.550> year<00:06:55.970> so<00:06:56.750> you<00:06:57.520> know<00:06:58.520> it<00:06:58.820> is<00:06:58.880> what<00:06:59.060> it

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
about a year so you know it is what it

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.180 
about a year so you know it is what it
is<00:06:59.240> I<00:06:59.330> suppose<00:07:02.410> they're<00:07:03.410> easily<00:07:03.530> fixed<00:07:04.070> I

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190 
is I suppose they're easily fixed I

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.610 
is I suppose they're easily fixed I
guess<00:07:04.400> but<00:07:04.789> it's<00:07:05.000> just<00:07:05.120> not<00:07:05.300> not<00:07:05.870> work<00:07:06.020> it's

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 
guess but it's just not not work it's

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.110 
guess but it's just not not work it's
just<00:07:06.770> the<00:07:06.979> peace<00:07:07.190> of<00:07:07.340> mind<00:07:07.580> you<00:07:07.760> don't<00:07:07.940> have

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 
just the peace of mind you don't have

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.080 
just the peace of mind you don't have
the<00:07:08.300> peace<00:07:08.449> of<00:07:08.599> mind<00:07:08.810> with<00:07:09.740> the<00:07:09.889> knives<00:07:10.090> okay
