that<00:00:42.750> Americans<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.110> tough<00:00:43.379> i<00:00:43.530> agree<00:00:43.710> with

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
that Americans are tough i agree with

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.260 
that Americans are tough i agree with
the<00:00:44.040> congressman<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.700> Americans<00:00:45.030> are<00:00:45.090> tough

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
the congressman the Americans are tough

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.959 
the congressman the Americans are tough
and<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> two<00:00:45.570> tough<00:00:45.780> jobs<00:00:46.610> it's<00:00:47.610> not<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.760> job<00:00:47.850> I

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
and the two tough jobs it's not a job I

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.819 
and the two tough jobs it's not a job I
want<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.690> not<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.200> lot<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.379> people<00:00:49.530> took

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
want to do and not a lot of people took

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.369 
want to do and not a lot of people took
mr.<00:00:50.370> Rodriguez<00:00:50.850> up<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.390> his<00:00:52.160> offer<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:54.379> it

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
mr. Rodriguez up on his offer and it

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.840 
mr. Rodriguez up on his offer and it
seems<00:00:55.649> from<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.949> statistics<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.520> my

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
seems from the statistics that my

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.420 
seems from the statistics that my
researchers<00:00:57.449> found<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.109> there<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> lack

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
researchers found that there is a lack

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.650 
researchers found that there is a lack
of<00:00:59.460> labor<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.910> parts<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.300> United<00:01:00.570> States

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
of labor and parts of the United States

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.700 
of labor and parts of the United States
and<00:01:02.180> that<00:01:03.180> seems<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.660> say<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.260> Americans

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and that seems to say that Americans

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.050 
and that seems to say that Americans
don't<00:01:04.860> want<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.189> take<00:01:05.309> these<00:01:05.489> jobs<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.000> I

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
don't want to take these jobs but I

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.460 
don't want to take these jobs but I
don't<00:01:06.210> want<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.390> say<00:01:06.479> definitively<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.229> they

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
don't want to say definitively that they

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.550 
don't want to say definitively that they

won't mr. Colbert you could work on so
many<00:01:10.680> issues<00:01:10.950> why<00:01:11.729> are<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.180> interested<00:01:12.600> in

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
many issues why are you interested in

this<00:01:13.049> issue<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:18.500> like<00:01:19.500> talking<00:01:19.740> about<00:01:20.130> people

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
this issue I like talking about people

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.179 
this issue I like talking about people
who<00:01:20.520> don't<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.820> any<00:01:20.880> power<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.979> this<00:01:22.979> seems

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
who don't have any power and this seems

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.100 
who don't have any power and this seems
like<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> least<00:01:24.150> powerful<00:01:24.420> people<00:01:24.900> in
