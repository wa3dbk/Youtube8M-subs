at Paris Auto Show this year we unveiled

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.540 
at Paris Auto Show this year we unveiled
for<00:00:07.120> the<00:00:07.240> first<00:00:07.450> time<00:00:07.690> the<00:00:07.870> new<00:00:08.050> seed<00:00:08.469> $5<00:00:09.130> which

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:09.550 
for the first time the new seed $5 which

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.640 
for the first time the new seed $5 which
is<00:00:09.730> the<00:00:09.849> first<00:00:10.089> model<00:00:10.330> that<00:00:10.629> will<00:00:10.809> arrive<00:00:11.440> in

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650 
is the first model that will arrive in

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.819 
is the first model that will arrive in
the<00:00:11.769> UK<00:00:12.129> in<00:00:12.400> the<00:00:12.459> new<00:00:12.759> year<00:00:13.120> at<00:00:14.079> the<00:00:14.259> same<00:00:14.469> time

the UK in the new year at the same time

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.730 
the UK in the new year at the same time
we<00:00:15.429> were<00:00:15.579> able<00:00:15.610> to<00:00:15.940> show<00:00:16.240> the<00:00:16.720> future<00:00:17.350> of<00:00:17.530> the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
we were able to show the future of the

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.580 
we were able to show the future of the
seed<00:00:17.949> family<00:00:18.460> with<00:00:19.119> the<00:00:19.599> station<00:00:20.019> wagon<00:00:20.170> in

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
seed family with the station wagon in

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.099 
seed family with the station wagon in
pre-production<00:00:21.009> form<00:00:21.670> and<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:22.630> three<00:00:22.900> dog

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:23.109 
pre-production form and the three dog

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.620 
pre-production form and the three dog
which<00:00:23.560> will<00:00:23.769> give<00:00:24.009> us<00:00:24.039> an<00:00:24.339> additional<00:00:25.150> element

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
which will give us an additional element

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.679 
which will give us an additional element
within<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.500> range<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.849> three<00:00:28.119> need<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.570> be

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
within the range the three need to be

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.620 
within the range the three need to be
seen<00:00:28.929> together<00:00:29.140> because<00:00:30.009> the<00:00:30.669> whole<00:00:30.910> concept

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
seen together because the whole concept

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.299 
seen together because the whole concept
of<00:00:31.929> seed<00:00:32.230> is<00:00:32.500> that<00:00:33.190> we<00:00:33.460> can<00:00:33.760> appeal<00:00:34.719> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
of seed is that we can appeal to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.470 
of seed is that we can appeal to
wide-ranging<00:00:36.309> European<00:00:36.850> test<00:00:37.149> with

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
wide-ranging European test with

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.139 
wide-ranging European test with
different<00:00:37.960> products<00:00:38.350> obviously<00:00:39.250> what<00:00:40.000> we

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
different products obviously what we

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.020 
different products obviously what we
also<00:00:40.300> want<00:00:40.690> to<00:00:40.780> do<00:00:41.110> is<00:00:41.440> have<00:00:42.190> distinct

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
also want to do is have distinct

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.970 
also want to do is have distinct
characters<00:00:43.570> for<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:43.960> three<00:00:44.199> cars<00:00:44.469> whilst

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
characters for the three cars whilst

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.819 
characters for the three cars whilst

most Korean of European brands what we

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.380 
most Korean of European brands what we
needed<00:00:56.320> was<00:00:56.859> a<00:00:56.890> car<00:00:57.219> that<00:00:57.489> was<00:00:57.550> designed<00:00:58.120> with

needed was a car that was designed with
European<00:00:58.899> tests<00:00:59.469> in<00:00:59.710> mind<00:01:00.100> for<00:01:00.850> European

standards of quality and that we could

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.300 
standards of quality and that we could
also<00:01:07.210> build<00:01:07.659> here<00:01:08.049> in<00:01:08.200> Europe<00:01:08.530> which<00:01:08.950> is<00:01:08.979> what

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
also build here in Europe which is what

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.120 
also build here in Europe which is what
we're<00:01:09.460> doing<00:01:09.580> with<00:01:09.850> our<00:01:09.880> Factory<00:01:10.420> in<00:01:10.509> salina

when<00:01:12.130> seed<00:01:12.640> was<00:01:12.909> shown<00:01:13.119> in<00:01:13.299> Geneva<00:01:14.189> back<00:01:15.189> at

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
when seed was shown in Geneva back at

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.969 
when seed was shown in Geneva back at
the<00:01:15.490> beginning<00:01:15.670> of<00:01:16.000> this<00:01:16.180> year<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:17.590> given

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
the beginning of this year and given

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.819 
the beginning of this year and given
that<00:01:18.070> it's<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.369> $5<00:01:18.880> it<00:01:19.720> was<00:01:19.990> always<00:01:20.259> going<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:20.740> be

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
that it's a $5 it was always going to be

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.219 
that it's a $5 it was always going to be
a<00:01:20.950> little<00:01:21.130> bit<00:01:21.400> more<00:01:21.610> conservative<00:01:22.110> when<00:01:23.110> it

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
a little bit more conservative when it

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.499 
a little bit more conservative when it
made<00:01:23.409> it<00:01:23.530> into<00:01:23.680> final<00:01:24.130> production<00:01:24.700> compared

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
made it into final production compared

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.230 
made it into final production compared
to<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.020> original<00:01:26.110> concept<00:01:26.680> however<00:01:27.640> with<00:01:28.119> the

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
to the original concept however with the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.060 
to the original concept however with the
three-door<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:29.110> with<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.409> different<00:01:29.829> kind

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
three-door and with the different kind

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.889 
three-door and with the different kind
of<00:01:30.159> audience<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.820> different<00:01:31.119> kind<00:01:31.299> of<00:01:31.390> market

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
of audience the different kind of market

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.510 
of audience the different kind of market
then<00:01:32.619> we<00:01:33.220> are<00:01:33.340> hoping<00:01:33.549> that<00:01:33.759> more<00:01:34.750> of<00:01:35.079> the<00:01:35.520> of

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
then we are hoping that more of the of

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.060 
then we are hoping that more of the of
what<00:01:36.700> you<00:01:36.880> see<00:01:37.119> here<00:01:37.570> in<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:38.439> concept<00:01:38.890> car

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
what you see here in the concept car

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.100 
what you see here in the concept car
will<00:01:39.490> make<00:01:39.759> it<00:01:39.970> into<00:01:40.450> production<00:01:40.630> and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
will make it into production and

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.289 
will make it into production and
certainly<00:01:41.590> things<00:01:41.860> like<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.729> angle<00:01:43.090> of<00:01:43.180> the

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
certainly things like the angle of the

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.499 
certainly things like the angle of the
rear<00:01:43.479> windows<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:45.009> body<00:01:45.250> line<00:01:45.579> that<00:01:46.299> is

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
rear windows the the body line that is

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.139 
rear windows the the body line that is
something<00:01:46.990> that<00:01:47.049> we<00:01:47.439> do<00:01:47.979> expect<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.640> see<00:01:48.759> more

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
something that we do expect to see more

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.810 
something that we do expect to see more
in<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.390> finished<00:01:49.719> production<00:01:50.049> vehicle<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
in the finished production vehicle the

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.100 
in the finished production vehicle the
reality<00:01:52.420> is<00:01:52.659> that<00:01:53.020> seed<00:01:53.829> has<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.549> compete

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
reality is that seed has to compete

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.990 
reality is that seed has to compete
right<00:01:56.110> in<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.409> mainstream<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:57.130> therefore<00:01:57.850> it

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
right in the mainstream and therefore it

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.069 
right in the mainstream and therefore it
has<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.600> have<00:01:58.840> as<00:01:59.740> many<00:02:00.729> elements<00:02:01.270> as<00:02:01.509> possible

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
has to have as many elements as possible

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.510 
has to have as many elements as possible
that<00:02:02.500> are<00:02:02.530> class-leading

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
that are class-leading

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.200 
that are class-leading
for<00:02:04.180> us<00:02:04.299> to<00:02:04.539> be<00:02:04.770> considered<00:02:05.770> an<00:02:05.920> alternative

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
for us to be considered an alternative

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.639 
for us to be considered an alternative
to<00:02:07.210> all<00:02:07.360> of<00:02:07.509> those<00:02:07.659> very<00:02:08.229> well<00:02:08.440> established
