00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.460
 in this new video we are going to talk about a 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.750
 already known game called winning eleven 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.140
 for those who do not know it is a game 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.470
 of football like the one of fifa but it does not bring 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.780
 the number of drinking leagues that brings 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.600
 the fifa game of this game came out 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.879
 I think only in Europe and in the USA so 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.300
 that only brings some equipment from there 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.220

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.170

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:51.180
 patches to update the players in 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.430
 the teams talking about winning eleven 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.309

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.500

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.500
