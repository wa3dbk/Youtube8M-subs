00:00:08.277 --> 00:00:10.806
Hello and welcome to this new presentation video.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.822
Today I'll tell you about an object of the "Element" airsoft brand and this object is an E-Lite.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:21.985
This E-Lite was sent to me by AirsoftPeak shop.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.308
You can find this item by typing the four-digit code on their website : 9138.

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:37.138
It should be noted that AirsoftPeak shop offers a coupon code of $5 on your next order,

00:00:37.578 --> 00:00:42.168
coupon code that you will find in this corner of the video.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.916
So we will open this package.

00:00:55.216 --> 00:00:58.847
This is the E-lite.

00:01:02.347 --> 00:01:13.019
It comes with a small cord to hang it. Is it to put around the neck or to avoid losing it, no idea.

00:01:18.283 --> 00:01:29.502
There is four different E-lite : red, green, blue and infrared.

00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:34.203
That model is red.

00:01:35.232 --> 00:01:39.137
It weighs 40g according to the manufacturer site.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:51.577
The back of this E-lite is covered of velcro so you can attach it to any velcro part , mainly, I think, on a helmet.

00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:56.151
But you can put it anywhere as long as you have an area with velcro.

00:01:56.994 --> 00:02:00.020
How works the E-lite ?

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:14.905
Here we are in "off" mode. There is the "On" mode : press one time for a red constant constant light in this kind of gelatin.

00:02:16.315 --> 00:02:20.701
Press a second time to have a blinking mode.

00:02:28.983 --> 00:02:31.236
And finally press to turn it off.

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:41.826
There is 140 hours of operation. The battery is a priori not replaceable. I will try by curiosity.

00:02:43.014 --> 00:02:54.596
Finally, you can use it as a decorative item on an helmet. Although you may not go unnoticed.

00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:02.857
Or perhaps it's be useful to distinguish different members of a team.

00:03:03.636 --> 00:03:12.558
Or for night games, to differentiate two teams...

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:18.748
Thank you for watching this video !
