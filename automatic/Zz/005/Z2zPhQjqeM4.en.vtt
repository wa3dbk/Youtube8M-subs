similar features now I know Motorola
seem<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.949> have<00:00:53.039> taken<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.879> maybe<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
seem to have taken this to maybe the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.330 
seem to have taken this to maybe the
next<00:00:54.629> level<00:00:55.020> with<00:00:55.170> some<00:00:55.410> extra<00:00:55.739> accessories

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
next level with some extra accessories

next level with some extra accessories
but<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.840> really<00:00:58.199> asking<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:58.859> trouble<00:00:59.129> I

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
but this is really asking for trouble I

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.369 
but this is really asking for trouble I
really<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.910> think<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.359> Apple<00:01:00.809> will<00:01:01.230> be

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
really do think that Apple will be

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.539 
really do think that Apple will be
watching<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:01.949> one<00:01:02.190> very<00:01:03.090> very<00:01:03.930> closely<00:01:04.549> but

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
watching this one very very closely but

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.280 
watching this one very very closely but
enough<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.030> similarities<00:01:06.659> between<00:01:06.689> this

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
enough of the similarities between this

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.170 
enough of the similarities between this
and<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.830> ipod<00:01:08.220> nano<00:01:08.400> let's<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> look<00:01:09.060> at

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
and that ipod nano let's have a look at

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.289 
and that ipod nano let's have a look at
the<00:01:09.299> device<00:01:09.570> itself<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:11.670> feature<00:01:11.970> list

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299

I<00:04:47.800> just<00:04:48.340> really<00:04:48.880> do<00:04:49.000> predict<00:04:49.419> the<00:04:49.570> Apple<00:04:49.990> will

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
I just really do predict the Apple will

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.409 
I just really do predict the Apple will
not<00:04:50.770> take<00:04:51.070> kindly<00:04:51.250> to<00:04:51.460> this<00:04:51.730> device<00:04:52.060> being

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
not take kindly to this device being

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.300 
not take kindly to this device being
released<00:04:52.750> that's<00:04:52.930> just<00:04:53.169> my<00:04:53.290> prediction<00:04:53.830> it

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
released that's just my prediction it

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.450

has<00:04:54.520> got<00:04:54.760> some<00:04:54.970> differentiating<00:04:55.780> factors<00:04:56.460> but

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
has got some differentiating factors but

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.159 
has got some differentiating factors but
Apple<00:04:57.850> are<00:04:58.030> going<00:04:58.210> to<00:04:58.300> probably<00:04:58.480> be<00:04:58.720> seen<00:04:58.990> to

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
Apple are going to probably be seen to

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.500 
Apple are going to probably be seen to
