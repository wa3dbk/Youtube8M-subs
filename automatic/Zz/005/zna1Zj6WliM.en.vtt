00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.410
 beautiful all guys well found on 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.600
 channel just flash 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.090
 today I'm here with a new video where you are 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.880
 I will tell you the best tips to win 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.279
 all wars between clans and then 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.710
 make progress with the village 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.840
 since they have so many resources 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.419
 wars if well used as well 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.550
 will seem a waste of resources 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.940
 then guys I state that these 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.519
 councils are not mine of war 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.100
 yes I mean I know how to attack everything though 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.049
 not just real sar tega e 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.829
 these tips were given to me by 

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:52.699
 nico tomio which is a member of the clan 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.920
 Greek warriors this nico toni indeed 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.379
 to a youtube channel called Greek 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.049
 warrior mister ya the council of 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.679
 pass it you can find in description is 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:06.530
 practically they are a clan with 145 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:09.799
 vittorio in war I believe and if you want 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.869
 of the method recommendations for 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.850
 use attack strategies 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.549
 go to his channel you will find of 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.560
 all now we start with the real e 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.020
 own video we start from the first one 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.649
 and I recommend you remember that anyway 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.960
 he gave them to me so I mean it 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.420
 I only know how to explain them in any case 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.999
 comments i think he will answer you yes 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.090
 have some doubts 

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:36.020
 then the first let's say a council from 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.289
 follow 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.840
 and distribute impose ct practically 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:45.049
 distributing municipalities means that 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.990
 you must bring me a city ​​hall number 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.610
 at 10 a number of municipalities at 9 with a 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.920
 number of municipalities per eight this 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.090
 because why at least when you attack 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.159
 in war 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.469
 what do i know a guy has to attack the 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.590
 number 8 the other guy the number 9 am 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.060
 shooting at random but at least it's much more 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.250
 easy 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.560
 I can guarantee you to succeed 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.810
 organize themselves in war especially for 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.519
 be much more balanced because 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.980
 have a clan that maybe at some 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.230
 City Hall on the 10th and all the others are 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.180
 uniqueness to the lot will be very much 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.970
 difficult to win a war because 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.340
 strategies are totally different then 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.920
 let's say you have a right number of 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.040
 municipalities for each level which is one thing 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.650
 really really good the second one 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.110
 I give you advice is to 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.629
 never attack their own in 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.760
 consideration for payment means 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.010
 for example that as you see in the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.620
 replays are the number 12 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.489
 I don't have to attack number 12 this 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.950
 because why practically with me that 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.639
 I can say the match making of the wars 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.639
 between clans 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:55.880
 it's not that it's very correct and therefore me 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:58.430
 which are 12 are equal to 12 with 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.870
 respective no because in any case to make you 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.750
 an example there was a light 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.569
 emaciated and are a ten shabby 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.389
 so anyway it's just that 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.020
 consideration means the 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:12.130
 village totally 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.560
 equal indeed and therefore we recommend 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.050
 attack those who are sure to do the three 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.440
 stars therefore only attacked if 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.450
 you know you make three stars at 11 plus 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.750
 precisely that you want to attack 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.330
 other advice is on recruitment 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.610
 or to recruit members with at least 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.720
 200 pounds war this my advice 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.220
 staff 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.680
 because when they opened the clan for 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.750
 the war ii already that there was a lot of people that 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.940
 he was not able to attack this alone 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.690
 because he had no experience then 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.720
 get people with 150 bar 200 stars 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.180
 in war and be sure they will be 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.820
 certainly very capable of attacking 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:59.330
 then other advice than to recruits 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:02.270
 you need the first war 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.090
 let them do with their strategy they use 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.310
 usually so that they are anyway 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.680
 let it free so you feel a 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.990
 comfortable and will not go away but what 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.120
 more important at least see what it has 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.580
 learned him throughout the period of 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.450
 clash therefore how one knows how to stick with 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:23.090
 that particular strategy and precisely 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.550
 as if he were doing well up front now 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.390
 let's spend a little more on things a lot 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.400
 more techniques for example then the timetable 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.620
 for 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.840
 start a war discard a war 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.930
 as they say in the jargon then 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.509
 practically the time to unleash it 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.449
 let's say the best times he has 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:46.090
 he recommended the Greek one 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.039
 warriors are between eight and a half 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.370
 half past twelve in short, a timetable 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:53.680
 evening where you are sure to succeed 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.030
 to attack this because because if 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.350
 work the wild at 3 am 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.300
 you will attack too soon before the deadline 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.360
 of the war and the adversaries while you 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.070
 sleep can make stars put it to you 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.350
 in that place and therefore to say that the 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.650
 war so be really careful of 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.260
 when you unleash the war then more 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.430
 advice regarding 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.740
 reservations 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.970
 then regarding the 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.260
 reservations 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.580
 as I told you before you don't go to 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.090
 consideration but on who does the three 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.550
 stars 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.389
 to book however there are several 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.550
 methods then or use that of the 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.580
 message inter year that is 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.330
 practically I see a little bit in chat 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.910
 I tell you go on a message and what I do 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.010
 I want to attack this here then maybe 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.870
 another guy arrives a message a message 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.330
 what I want to attack this other 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.669
 so that anyway through the boss yes 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.470
 manages to organize itself in another way 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.260
 use the club's bulletin board 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.840
 always updatable limited for the 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.390
 number of messages 15 used that 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.910
 rest assured that 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.310
 perfectly the only problem is that it is 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.990
 visible to opponents but should not 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:12.450
 create many problems this then 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:15.360
 or even better method if you are 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.910
 among the best war clans ever 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.100
 how do they use flash core 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.510
 accuses cles corner to a site that 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.440
 allows you to book 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:28.080
 practically the people the adversaries 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.410
 within the clan war and it really is 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.540
 really very useful I leave you anyway 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.360
 you can find on youtube what you find 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:39.570
 lots of melting on how to use it 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.750
 other thing about reservations and if that 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:46.470
 note that the opponent is sorry that 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.300
 one of your clan within 12 hours not 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.000
 He has made the first attack the 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.730
 booking skips or if you take it e 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.680
 get along and kind and okay dude 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.290
 not attacked within the first 12 hours 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.140
 then this 4 heel seems to me 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.900
 a good thing, however, agree 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:06.000
 then another thing is that the new revenue 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.980
 they never make the first war so 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.940
 that look like you attack like 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.210
 you are organized 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:15.390
 then the last advice and that anyway 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.310
 when the war seems over or 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:20.370
 be ahead of even the 15 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:24.690
 stars that seem few are not like that 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:26.880
 few however never stick for 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:29.280
 booty this is an advice I give you 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.830
 because if you attack by loot 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.690
 really war is over because 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.180
 however I was an england where one is 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:38.520
 attacked the last and left the 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.590
 municipi the first municipalities outside on the way 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.910
 that the adversaries went for loot 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:45.340
 and then at last we attacked 

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.380
 and therefore always attack by stars 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.840
 safe even in the last minutes of the 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.970
 war so guys for today a video 

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.430
 finished the advice to join the 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.650
 channel if you have not already done past 

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:59.200
 from the Gregorio Mysteria channel that it 

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:01.600
 found in descriptions I recommend 

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.040
 pass us these replays apply 

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.290
 really a mess 

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:09.210
 let at least 80 live there 

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:09.210
 see you again at the next hello
