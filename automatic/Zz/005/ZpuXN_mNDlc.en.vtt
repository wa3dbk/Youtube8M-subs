00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.379 

first<00:00:11.070> thing<00:00:11.760> that<00:00:11.790> you<00:00:12.240> need<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:14.389> frozen

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
first thing that you need is frozen

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.890 
first thing that you need is frozen
strawberries<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:17.220> I'm<00:00:18.090> just<00:00:18.270> using<00:00:18.510> these

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
strawberries and I'm just using these

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.300 
strawberries and I'm just using these
ones<00:00:19.230> by<00:00:20.190> Europe's<00:00:20.880> best<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.650> reason<00:00:22.800> I'm

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
ones by Europe's best and the reason I'm

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.700 
ones by Europe's best and the reason I'm
using<00:00:23.369> frozen<00:00:24.029> strawberries<00:00:24.810> instead<00:00:25.260> of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
using frozen strawberries instead of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.269 
using frozen strawberries instead of
fresh<00:00:26.369> strawberries<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.350> because<00:00:28.350> this<00:00:28.949> is

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
fresh strawberries is because this is

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.950 
fresh strawberries is because this is
like<00:00:29.460> killing<00:00:30.000> two<00:00:30.240> birds<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.630> one<00:00:30.750> stone

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
like killing two birds with one stone

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.920 
like killing two birds with one stone
you<00:00:31.529> don't<00:00:31.740> need<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.039> to<00:00:32.820> get<00:00:33.059> any<00:00:33.300> ice<00:00:33.600> this

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
you don't need it to get any ice this

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.330 
you don't need it to get any ice this
way<00:00:35.090> so<00:00:36.090> I'm<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.420> going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.660> use<00:00:37.340> these

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
out up to the half lion half mark so

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.319 
out up to the half lion half mark so
it's<00:00:47.969> half<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.300> liter<00:00:48.510> mm<00:00:49.170> that's<00:00:49.379> according

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
now I'm just going to take some milk

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.420 
now I'm just going to take some milk
this<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.760> your<00:02:15.910> vitamin<00:02:16.360> d<00:02:16.570> milk<00:02:16.600> and<00:02:17.220> I'm<00:02:18.220> just

this is your vitamin d milk and I'm just

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.190 
this is your vitamin d milk and I'm just
going<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.610> fill<00:02:18.820> it<00:02:18.940> up<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.570> point<00:02:19.780> where

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
going to fill it up to the point where

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:28.290 
going to fill it up to the point where
it<00:02:20.440> covers<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.860> bananas<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.970> that's<00:02:28.150> about

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
it covers the bananas so that's about

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.860 
it covers the bananas so that's about
good<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.340> can<00:02:30.459> always<00:02:30.700> add<00:02:30.880> more<00:02:30.910> milk<00:02:31.569> so

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
good and you can always add more milk so

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.000 
good and you can always add more milk so
it's<00:02:31.989> better<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.350> start<00:02:32.560> with<00:02:32.590> less<00:02:32.860> because

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
it's better to start with less because

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.290 
it's better to start with less because
you<00:02:33.160> can't<00:02:33.370> really<00:02:33.400> take<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:33.819> out<00:02:33.940> once<00:02:34.150> it's

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
you can't really take it out once it's

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.790 
you can't really take it out once it's
bonded<00:02:34.660> so<00:02:35.590> I'm<00:02:35.650> just<00:02:35.800> going<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:35.980> take<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.250> lid

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
bonded so I'm just going to take the lid

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.550 
bonded so I'm just going to take the lid
and<00:02:38.819> I'm<00:02:39.819> first<00:02:40.330> I'm<00:02:40.630> gonna<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.290> I'm<00:02:41.350> just

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
and I'm first I'm gonna and I'm just

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
and I'm first I'm gonna and I'm just
going<00:02:41.739> to<00:02:41.769> start<00:02:42.130> with<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.489> on<00:02:42.930> low

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.270 

I<00:02:59.480> think<00:03:00.480> that's<00:03:00.630> pretty<00:03:00.870> good<00:03:01.110> so<00:03:01.620> just<00:03:01.800> to

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
I think that's pretty good so just to

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.680 
I think that's pretty good so just to
get<00:03:02.550> some<00:03:02.730> pretty<00:03:03.000> creamy<00:03:03.270> consistency

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
get some pretty creamy consistency

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.740 
get some pretty creamy consistency
should<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:05.220> got<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.940> this<00:03:05.970> is<00:03:06.210> kind<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.510> what<00:03:06.630> the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
should I got so this is kind of what the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.390 
should I got so this is kind of what the
consistency<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.650> smoothie<00:03:07.860> should<00:03:08.100> look

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
consistency of a smoothie should look

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.540 
consistency of a smoothie should look
like<00:03:08.430> once<00:03:08.850> you're<00:03:09.000> done<00:03:09.890> it<00:03:10.890> should<00:03:10.920> be<00:03:11.250> kind

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
like once you're done it should be kind

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:18.140 
like once you're done it should be kind
of<00:03:11.670> thick<00:03:16.550> so<00:03:17.550> I'm<00:03:17.580> just<00:03:17.760> going<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.970> take<00:03:18.090> a

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
of thick so I'm just going to take a

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
of thick so I'm just going to take a
glass<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:20.820> I'm<00:03:21.210> going<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.450> pour<00:03:21.660> some<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.110> the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
glass and I'm going to pour some so the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:30.920 
glass and I'm going to pour some so the
unit<00:03:28.280> it's<00:03:29.280> going<00:03:29.490> to<00:03:29.580> drip<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.210> so<00:03:30.510> this<00:03:30.750> is

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
unit it's going to drip and so this is

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.910 
unit it's going to drip and so this is
