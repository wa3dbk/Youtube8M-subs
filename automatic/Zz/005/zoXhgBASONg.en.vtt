people so I have a lot of people ask me

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.550 
people so I have a lot of people ask me
how<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.359> do<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> line<00:00:24.990> work<00:00:27.199> you<00:00:28.199> could<00:00:28.349> do<00:00:28.439> it

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
how to do a line work you could do it

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.279 
how to do a line work you could do it
either<00:00:28.680> two<00:00:29.070> ways<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.689> them<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.840> by

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
either two ways and one of them is by

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.430 
either two ways and one of them is by
vectors<00:00:32.210> so<00:00:33.210> what<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.540> do<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.989> go<00:00:34.170> over

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
vectors so what you do is you go over

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.790 
vectors so what you do is you go over
here<00:00:35.420> you<00:00:36.420> see<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.630> little<00:00:36.870> pen<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.680> you

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
here you see the little pen and you

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.889 
here you see the little pen and you
create<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> new<00:00:38.309> layer<00:00:38.700> just<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.570> you

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
create a new layer just like that you

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.150 
create a new layer just like that you
can't<00:00:40.050> delete<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.920> don't<00:00:40.950> need

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
can't delete that like this I don't need

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.799 
can't delete that like this I don't need
it<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.870> you<00:00:42.870> start<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.230> use<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.710> it's

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
it and you start to use it it's

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.830 
it and you start to use it it's
incredibly<00:00:45.809> easy<00:00:46.430> uh<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:48.649> don't<00:00:49.649> know<00:00:49.920> oh<00:00:50.840> my

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
incredibly easy uh I don't know oh my

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.380

you get close to them you just click and
drag<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.390> left<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.430> it<00:01:41.430> goes<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.939> know

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
drag to the left and it goes you know

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.240 
drag to the left and it goes you know
advantages<00:01:42.960> oh<00:01:43.110> my<00:01:43.229> god<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.649> drag<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
advantages oh my god you drag to the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.950 
advantages oh my god you drag to the
right<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.729> gets<00:01:44.880> thicker<00:01:45.180> okay<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.130> a

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
right and it gets thicker okay that is a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.560 
right and it gets thicker okay that is a
little<00:01:48.960> trick<00:01:49.290> for<00:01:49.680> vanishing<00:01:50.340> lights<00:01:50.790> okay

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
little trick for vanishing lights okay

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.370 
little trick for vanishing lights okay
I'm<00:01:52.259> gonna<00:01:52.470> do<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.070> couple<00:01:53.820> more<00:01:54.210> times<00:01:54.479> so

so yeah I'm dragging to the right

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.910 
so yeah I'm dragging to the right
because<00:02:05.649> well<00:02:06.070> I<00:02:06.250> like<00:02:06.579> it<00:02:06.850> when<00:02:07.149> it<00:02:07.329> thins<00:02:07.570> out

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
because well I like it when it thins out

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
because well I like it when it thins out
rather<00:02:08.920> than<00:02:09.099> gets<00:02:09.459> thicker<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:10.470> rarely<00:02:11.470> use

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
rather than gets thicker I rarely use

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.979 
rather than gets thicker I rarely use
thick<00:02:12.940> me<00:02:13.090> over<00:02:13.390> here<00:02:13.569> i'm<00:02:13.660> going<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.870> use

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
thick me over here i'm going to use

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.160 
thick me over here i'm going to use
thickening<00:02:14.530> because<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:16.239> cloth<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.810> kind<00:02:17.050> of

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
thickening because the cloth is kind of

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.210 
thickening because the cloth is kind of
like<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.670> shadow<00:02:19.000> i<00:02:19.769> don't<00:02:20.769> know<00:02:20.860> i<00:02:20.890> can't

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
like in a shadow i don't know i can't

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:32.699 
like in a shadow i don't know i can't
explain<00:02:21.459> really<00:02:28.349> it's<00:02:29.349> very<00:02:29.620> easy<00:02:31.590> there<00:02:32.590> is

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
explain really it's very easy there is
