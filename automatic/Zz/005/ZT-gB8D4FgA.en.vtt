 look out in the other recipes 

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:25.890
 have already done this 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.140
 so now it goes on then you see it 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.780
 I've got it back there already 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.119
 unpacked 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.770
 tomato paste and passed tomatoes now 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.780
 with the tomatenmark and so with the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.039
 because we come quite a long way yes because 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.049
 then we always take a shot 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.030
 if we eat something cooked or what 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.950
 if you look at the tip 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.359
 I want to paddle with you 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.959
 for example, a really great sauce 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:51.719
 For example, now we have two 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:53.340
 boxes bananas browns it so that we im 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.959
 basically two boxes one to the week 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.639
 need two boxes that is so 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.219
 that means that these are the two 

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:02.320
 fresh who need a little longer 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.409
 this something already a bit yellow 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.740
 even tells grad fairtrade is okay 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.750
 that's really cool and people 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.240
 here should something noticed drives 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.830
 it is not the one 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.209
 Orientation along the longitudinal side of it 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.690
 is the indiscriminate that means we have too 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:26.650
 a walnut bought for the good fats 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:29.620
 no fun aside to vettel yes to 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.950
 example here avocados are easy 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.680
 to 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.450
 they belong to 80 c 10 and the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.150
 we draw us back regularly 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.690
 that's exactly what our big shopping is 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.150
 how long that will last a week think 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.470
 I maybe little longer 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.470
 Of course, things are still going on anyway 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.760
 we would be much longer bananas 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.560
 again with the nachordern 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.340
 So we buy food as you see 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.019
 including, for example, the sweet potatoes 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.459
 but you can also eat the chambers raw 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:05.590
 eat cooked and what we do not have the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.530
 is basically what i have now 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.820
 I have not forgotten anything 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.840
 at capsule opponents from so people very short 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.220
 and also I will that we do not now 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.250
 unnecessarily lengthen 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.170
 Thanks for watching me on this 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.970
 video I liked her leave 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.110
 comment on dogs rating below underneath 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.750
 And that was exactly what our shelf was 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.700
 Grocery shopping and me fruits and vegetables 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.709
 therefore the cool if that is now in the house 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.329
 then you are like me 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.090
 I just tricked myself into the beginning 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.660
 bought fruits and vegetables yes without 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.190
 The End 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.959
 I have each thrown away but I 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.000
 have really bought that I was the 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.860
 I had to force the food in 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.239
 the first and meanwhile is power 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:52.380
 just is klien idea until then 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.380
 make people
