00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
the start of course it was a culmination

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.310 
the start of course it was a culmination
of<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:26.220> full<00:03:26.519> season<00:03:26.850> of<00:03:27.209> frustration<00:03:28.170> and

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
disappointment where basically he

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.509 
disappointment where basically he
thought<00:03:31.049> that<00:03:31.470> he<00:03:31.680> would<00:03:31.829> get<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:31.980> chance<00:03:32.250> to

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
thought that he would get the chance to

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.009 
thought that he would get the chance to
be<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.760> number<00:03:32.970> two<00:03:33.000> he<00:03:33.569> thought<00:03:33.840> he<00:03:33.930> would

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
be the number two he thought he would

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.210 
be the number two he thought he would
get<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.230> chance<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.500> play<00:03:34.650> quarterback<00:03:34.980> and

get the chance to play quarterback and
so<00:03:35.400> now<00:03:35.549> it's<00:03:35.910> morphed<00:03:36.299> into<00:03:36.560> basically<00:03:37.560> I'm

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
so now it's morphed into basically I'm

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.280 
so now it's morphed into basically I'm
taking<00:03:38.519> myself<00:03:38.790> out<00:03:39.120> for<00:03:39.329> not<00:03:39.600> playing<00:03:39.750> okay
