00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
and you feel like this might be one

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.070 
and you feel like this might be one
that's<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> cause<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> scar<00:01:21.119> one<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
that's going to cause a scar one of the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.429 
that's going to cause a scar one of the
best<00:01:22.320> things<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:23.040> do<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.670> massage<00:01:24.439> so

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
best things that we can do is massage so

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.609 
best things that we can do is massage so
with<00:01:25.650> clean<00:01:25.979> hands<00:01:26.420> even<00:01:27.420> gloved<00:01:27.990> hands<00:01:28.350> that

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
with clean hands even gloved hands that

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.550 
with clean hands even gloved hands that
would<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:28.920> great<00:01:29.420> massage<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.750> area<00:01:30.900> gently

would be great massage the area gently

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.660 
would be great massage the area gently
now<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.770> reason<00:01:32.009> for<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.640> because

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
now the reason for that is because

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.899 
now the reason for that is because
massage<00:01:33.570> helps<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.079> break<00:01:34.259> up<00:01:34.470> scar<00:01:34.650> tissue<00:01:35.040> it

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
massage helps to break up scar tissue it

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.660 
massage helps to break up scar tissue it
also<00:01:36.090> brings<00:01:36.479> blood<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.170> area<00:01:37.670> which

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
also brings blood to the area which

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.969 
also brings blood to the area which
brings<00:01:38.939> oxygen<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> skin<00:01:40.110> which<00:01:40.680> kills

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
brings oxygen to the skin which kills

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.330 
brings oxygen to the skin which kills
bacteria<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.729> also<00:01:42.150> aids<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.720> healing<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.590> it

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
bacteria and also aids in healing and it

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.160 
bacteria and also aids in healing and it
also<00:01:44.490> brings<00:01:44.880> circulation<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.810> skin

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
also brings circulation to the skin

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.940 
also brings circulation to the skin
which<00:01:46.350> results<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.479> cell<00:01:48.479> renewal<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.860> of

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
which results in cell renewal and of

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.980 
which results in cell renewal and of
course<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.369> need<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.729> cell<00:01:51.000> renewal<00:01:51.360> because

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
course we need that cell renewal because

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.920 
course we need that cell renewal because
