after I put those chocolate chips on as
you<00:04:29.650> guys<00:04:29.800> could<00:04:30.039> see<00:04:30.220> they<00:04:30.430> didn't<00:04:30.639> really

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
you guys could see they didn't really

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.460 
you guys could see they didn't really
look<00:04:31.000> like<00:04:31.060> they<00:04:31.270> were<00:04:31.330> sinking<00:04:31.840> so<00:04:32.259> I<00:04:32.289> took<00:04:32.379> a

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
look like they were sinking so I took a

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.619 
look like they were sinking so I took a
plastic<00:04:32.710> knife<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.819> I<00:04:33.879> stirred<00:04:34.300> them<00:04:34.419> down

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:34.629 
plastic knife and I stirred them down

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:36.420 
plastic knife and I stirred them down
into<00:04:34.930> there<00:04:35.080> so<00:04:35.349> this<00:04:35.830> batter<00:04:36.069> was<00:04:36.220> just<00:04:36.370> I

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
into there so this batter was just I

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.820 
into there so this batter was just I
guess<00:04:36.460> thicker<00:04:37.000> than<00:04:37.270> I<00:04:37.330> was<00:04:37.449> anticipating

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
deeper because I was hitting him when I

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.180 
deeper because I was hitting him when I
was<00:05:08.199> doing<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:08.590> old<00:05:08.710> probe<00:05:09.159> test<00:05:10.259> but<00:05:11.259> for<00:05:12.130> the

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
was doing the old probe test but for the

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.710 
was doing the old probe test but for the
most<00:05:12.340> part<00:05:12.550> they<00:05:12.669> kind<00:05:12.849> of<00:05:12.940> stayed<00:05:13.210> on<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.479> top

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
most part they kind of stayed on the top

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.559 
most part they kind of stayed on the top
of<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:14.020> top<00:05:15.009> of<00:05:15.159> the<00:05:15.250> cake<00:05:15.520> here<00:05:15.789> the<00:05:15.970> bread

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:16.569 
of the top of the cake here the bread

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:22.249 
of the top of the cake here the bread
that's<00:05:16.780> fine<00:05:16.990> though<00:05:19.409> still<00:05:20.409> very<00:05:20.680> very<00:05:20.919> warm

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
that's fine though still very very warm

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:30.809 
that's fine though still very very warm
moist<00:05:27.270> it's<00:05:28.270> really<00:05:28.509> really<00:05:28.780> good<00:05:29.699> it's<00:05:30.699> a

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
moist it's really really good it's a

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:34.409 
moist it's really really good it's a
little<00:05:31.090> bit<00:05:31.210> more<00:05:31.509> savory<00:05:31.990> than<00:05:32.289> your<00:05:33.280> I<00:05:33.610> guess

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
little bit more savory than your I guess

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.180 
little bit more savory than your I guess
traditional<00:05:35.229> pumpkin<00:05:35.889> bread<00:05:36.009> and<00:05:36.130> I'm

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
traditional pumpkin bread and I'm

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.249 
traditional pumpkin bread and I'm
guessing<00:05:36.490> that's<00:05:36.580> because<00:05:36.819> of<00:05:37.090> that<00:05:37.180> ale<00:05:37.389> but

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
guessing that's because of that ale but

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.309 
guessing that's because of that ale but
it<00:05:38.440> it<00:05:38.710> still<00:05:39.190> tastes<00:05:39.599> more<00:05:40.599> deserty<00:05:40.990> if<00:05:41.169> that

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 
it it still tastes more deserty if that

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:46.680 
it it still tastes more deserty if that
makes<00:05:41.500> any<00:05:41.560> sense<00:05:44.099> I'm<00:05:45.099> happy<00:05:45.460> a<00:05:45.699> little

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
makes any sense I'm happy a little

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
makes any sense I'm happy a little
butter<00:05:46.900> on<00:05:46.960> there<00:05:47.169> I'll<00:05:47.259> be<00:05:47.409> really<00:05:47.620> happy

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710
