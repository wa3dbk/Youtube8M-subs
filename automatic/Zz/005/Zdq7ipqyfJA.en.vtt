be<00:00:49.559> Mexico<00:00:50.010> then<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.579> go<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.969> website<00:00:51.360> from

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
be Mexico then we go to the website from

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.360 
be Mexico then we go to the website from
30<00:00:52.020> at<00:00:52.140> where<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.469> are<00:00:52.500> going<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:52.920> using<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
30 at where we are going to be using the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.340 
30 at where we are going to be using the
randomizer<00:00:54.059> tool<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.660> further<00:00:55.140> that's

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
randomizer tool and further that's

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.750 
randomizer tool and further that's
actually<00:00:55.620> going<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.949> change<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.579> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
actually going to change that to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.540 
actually going to change that to
slightly<00:00:57.360> for<00:00:57.750> me<00:00:57.870> since<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:59.190> can't<00:00:59.399> really

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
slightly for me since you can't really

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.250 
slightly for me since you can't really
search<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.090> certain<00:01:00.510> nationalities<00:01:00.870> but

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
search on certain nationalities but

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.049 
search on certain nationalities but
hopefully<00:01:01.620> once<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.100> done<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
hopefully once that is done that is the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.160 
hopefully once that is done that is the
way<00:01:03.210> we're<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.780> picking<00:01:03.960> our

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
way we're going to be picking our

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.630 
way we're going to be picking our
players<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:05.070> does<00:01:05.189> something<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.549> do

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
players so it does something you do

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.130 
players so it does something you do

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.350 
our starter squad and the reason why I
only<00:01:18.930> f5<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.830> simply<00:01:20.759> because<00:01:21.060> they<00:01:21.210> are<00:01:21.270> not

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
only f5 is simply because they are not

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.810 
only f5 is simply because they are not
enough<00:01:21.840> like<00:01:22.170> none<00:01:22.560> red<00:01:22.860> bronze<00:01:23.220> players<00:01:23.520> that

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
enough like none red bronze players that

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.219 
enough like none red bronze players that
we<00:01:23.939> are<00:01:24.060> actually<00:01:24.240> able<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.780> make<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> full

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
we are actually able to make a full

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.960 
we are actually able to make a full
squad<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.710> let's<00:01:25.920> say<00:01:26.100> Argentina<00:01:26.700> as<00:01:26.880> an

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
squad of let's say Argentina as an

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.789 
squad of let's say Argentina as an
example<00:01:27.330> they<00:01:27.930> don't<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.259> any<00:01:28.470> number<00:01:28.740> i

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
example they don't have any number i

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.260 
example they don't have any number i
bronze<00:01:29.100> keepers<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> nationality

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
bronze keepers so that is a nationality

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.300 
bronze keepers so that is a nationality
we<00:01:30.540> unfortunately<00:01:30.869> cannot<00:01:31.470> use<00:01:31.710> at<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> start

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
we unfortunately cannot use at the start

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.060 
we unfortunately cannot use at the start
but<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:33.270> can<00:01:33.420> obviously<00:01:33.689> get<00:01:34.590> players<00:01:34.890> from

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
but we can obviously get players from

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.039 
but we can obviously get players from
that<00:01:35.250> nationality<00:01:35.670> once<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.329> want<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.750> score<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
that nationality once we want to score a

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.050 
that nationality once we want to score a
lot<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.259> goals<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.860> win<00:01:38.250> games<00:01:38.460> as<00:01:38.640> well<00:01:38.759> so

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
lot of goals and win games as well so

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.160 
lot of goals and win games as well so
and<00:01:39.270> that's<00:01:39.420> going<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.570> be<00:01:39.689> working<00:01:39.869> out

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
and that's going to be working out

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.990 
and that's going to be working out
anyway<00:01:40.890> these<00:01:41.100> are<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.369> five<00:01:41.549> teams<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.909> are

with this Tino is that it's not on 100
chemistry<00:02:06.149> but<00:02:06.719> because<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.590> decided

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
chemistry but because of that I decided

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.710 
chemistry but because of that I decided
to<00:02:08.069> change<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.520> slightly<00:02:08.729> I've<00:02:09.239> decided<00:02:09.569> to

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
decide to mainly do it as well is

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.210 
decide to mainly do it as well is
because<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:24.840> actually<00:02:24.960> looking<00:02:25.800> very<00:02:26.010> very

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
because it's actually looking very very

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.640 
because it's actually looking very very
similar<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.790> normal<00:02:27.300> started<00:02:27.960> team<00:02:28.110> you
