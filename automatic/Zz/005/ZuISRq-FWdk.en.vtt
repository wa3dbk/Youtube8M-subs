00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:20.099
 as part of speech recognition demonstrations in the beta the 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:20.909
 of mango 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:24.960
 so in the new version that will feel the goal of 17 minutes 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.239
 year 712 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.499
 we missed a lot of progress that was made out to sedentary 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:30.929
 is pretty impressive 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.510
 so as in the previous version to launch the sultan ben date button 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.560
 jassem al-thani 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.310
 but then you said that your ample your order so to 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.970
 now i'm trying to open the app% the second 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.800
 opens music and video 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.270
 convenient 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.380
 this is so the acknowledged command he understood that I wanted to start the 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.380
 the beautiful music video us happening to me launched the app 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.920
 that something even more impressive is the possibility of 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.490
 to compose sms without touching at any time the smartphone so we go 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.490
 try 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
 sms professor thibault 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.660
 m 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.159
 Hi, how are you 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.159
 I'm good 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.140
 sent 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.040
 So we will wait for the solidarity he will dictate to my homework 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.960
 more suite 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.110
 at the layer 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.970
 JuppÃ© 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.220
 you see it's really exciting he had understood that you send a 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.570
 sms to my contact professor thibault 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.420
 he managed to leave my cv perfectly this message he then sent me 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.340
 but when I received the sms because I sent a moment of celebration 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.730
 when I received the week he told me landbourg since I studied in 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.480
 I asked for this option in the settings but we can 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.739
 deactivate 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.539
 the only member 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.319
 only if you are in mild mode all wrong 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.989
 a passerby 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.169
 sending 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:32.249
 and you have there are the sms in 30 years of power so we acted but 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:35.249
 always a small collectivist village cement coffee shops all cases what 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:37.059
 on the rancart what kbc late 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.059
 we are in practice the trash that is simple 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.799
 but no other possibility with voice recognition is to do 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.339
 to launch research 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.339
 So I am 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:54.249
 who appeared 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.799
 ht 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.599
 so here is still a little complementary and advance in the game 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.779
 in the envied 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:04.539
 but he misunderstood that I wanted to do a local search nokia has 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:05.579
 launched on 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.699
 the local part directly 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:11.369
 here I have a list of elected coffee in Paris is expected yielded 1 75 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:15.509
 om seemed fruitful 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:18.499
 speech recognition is really exciting hamburg that can most 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:21.819
 strong since the beginning of the creation to climb good by cons it must not be 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.069
 to lure one more sometimes it does not work 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.509
 for example let dictate a sms with the punctuation you said point 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:28.469
 polling 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:32.439
 according to the only goal of the match in less that the population between four 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:34.099
 eyes of 2 25% 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.069
 better a good is still a good start and I think it can be 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.239
 helpful to those who travel a lot car especially 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.419
 mikit can not that is there since we have no right in France 2 of 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.369
 to use the phone while driving 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:48.579
 thanks to this e-mail function possible increases to read the sms that 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.019
 receives audois 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.549
 likewise to dictate some pretty basic messages it works rather not 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.489
 wrong anyway that you liked as you could see 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.689
 so here is the complement for more information go to the website
