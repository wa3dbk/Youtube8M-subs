00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:07.180
 this happened many many years ago in 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:10.490
 a small town called jaral del 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.700
 Progress that is in Guanajuato 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.029
 the municipal president in turn sent 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.330
 place some benches in a park that 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.400
 was in the train terminal 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.220
 to give comfort to users who 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.619
 at that time they were many since in 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.880
 that time was traveled frequently in 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.580
 train 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.190
 this terminal 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.450
 as a reference point he was 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.160
 near a pantheon 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.650
 all right 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.800
 shortly after installing the benches 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.640
 these were vandalized 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.720
 night and looked battered and even 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.460
 broken, so the authorities 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.350
 They decided to send a guard to 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.219
 take care 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.059
 strangely the watchman got sick and 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.070
 He did not want to continue his assignment 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.549
 other watchers were sent but 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.979
 the same thing happened to them 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.890
 municipal president seemed very strange 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.710
 this situation and ordered to investigate what 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.619
 it was happening they told him a 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.200
 a little crazy story about a 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.130
 supposed ghost that appeared and 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.430
 frightened the vigilantes 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.250
 he thought that this situation was ridiculous 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.700
 and decided to send a policeman of his 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.900
 trust to do the surveillance to this 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:43.430
 police nicknamed him 'el chino' herrera 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.250
 the police went to the place thinking that 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.710
 everything was silly and that he did not 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.080
 I was afraid of nothing, much less 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.930
 alleged ghosts 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.990
 however the next day I do not know 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.960
 presented to work reporting very 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.570
 sick and hospitalized 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.119
 the municipal president went to the hospital 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.899
 to know what had happened to the 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:13.420
 police and he managed to narrate the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.569
 facts before dying 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.270
 I told him that everything had happened that night 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.420
 passed uneventfully until 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.540
 around midnight he felt 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.970
 run a cold air and saw a haze 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.990
 thick 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.930
 then he heard strange noises and believed 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.390
 hear also the cry of a woman 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.620
 wherefore he approached the place from where 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.620
 came from the mist I can see 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.170
 a figure dressed in white he left 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.380
 approaching to tell him it was too late 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.130
 to hang around but he saw that the 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.420
 woman came out of the pantheon 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.170
 and what affected him most was the fact 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.360
 see that the woman was not walking 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.340
 but it floated about 30 centimeters 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.580
 from the ground 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.760
 then says that the woman figure 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.840
 white pounced on him and by the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.129
 scare fainted 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:22.400
 That same night the policeman died but in 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:25.030
 his deathbed swore that everything 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.940
 he said it was true 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.960
 after that and nobody else wanted to go to 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.240
 take care of the benches 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:37.280
 and those of the town tell that in 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:40.690
 nights in the distance you still hear the 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.690
 Crying of a woman
