00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.950
 Hello my Breedlove of society 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.080
 clans robe and we face the battle on the map 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.450
 zigfried line between the formed top 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.700
 clan comic and cool thin they 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.280
 which currently occupies 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.120
 many versions of the first places on 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.200
 py cluster 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:28.590
 and so with the comic strip this is the 4th 104 fv215b 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.750
 372 batchat and and 3 and on competition from the old woman 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.570
 why do we highlight it because 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.379
 enough skill artilter we look 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.659
 traveling as we see the comics took 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.519
 a fairly small amount of hassles 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:44.569
 there is it will be a game uniquely and through 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:49.260
 grab the greens and play through the city 

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:50.789
 mountain occupation two sevens go to town i 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.170
 so guess one goes here in this 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.899
 place 2 somewhere here lacquer on patrols 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.139
 c . engaged two two cars on her 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.609
 cover 3 can both shoot through 

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:05.759
 fifth sixth vertical so principle 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.509
 help and rush and esteshka again there 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.090
 and fly here 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:13.219
 a small number of pawns 1 2 can 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.219
 help in case of what can cover 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.649
 A minute passed in a thin yet they 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.329
 no one shines with while some 2 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.329
 machines possible artillery someone else 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.609
 shooting just so neatly we 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.109
 most likely all the same two artillery 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:32.560
 seven starts neatly 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:35.149
 nobody saw the lumen of the tower here 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.140
 the seven did not shine the night most likely 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.429
 here 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.289
 There is no machine. The mouse is clear. 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.670
 there kamani if ​​she played through 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.380
 greenery 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.200
 at least on the green already shone 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.909
 most likely tried to take her 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.789
 considering that the mouse is lit and lit 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.909
 Here in this place most likely it is virgins 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.569
 here in this here with a pair of 7 here from 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.020
 pair of tanks 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:02.569
 This is a mobile pdf 2mb here to put a map 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.709
 very dug up the map very 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.359
 dug up much 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:09.019
 and it must be taken into account 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:11.030
 what here from here if before it was possible with 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.220
 any of these places sweep zero 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.010
 vertical now it is impossible here 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.579
 everywhere hills and from here you can play towers 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.389
 There was a change of batchut Shot went to 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.480
 full position 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:25.090
 they actually changed in two 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.930
 half a minute nothing happened 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.940
 Tank Mania in DEF 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.769
 this is their territory accordingly 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.450
 comics need something now 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.440
 do as we see begins 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.000
 the movement of acres and flash drives 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.819
 if you are your phone a currency weave 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.400
 coming closer to the center and so 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.250
 I assume that you are trying to Ryazan here 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.959
 This area here weave out the sun 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.680
 take acne here and here 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.940
 someone is 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.919
 weave on the B8 square here no one 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.139
 glows first comes out with a merry 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:03:01.639
 checks if there is anyone here or anyone 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:04.959
 no, and really here in this region 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:07.220
 no one therefore sevens flash drives can 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.359
 more inconspicuously to surely lost 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.549
 but nevertheless they only stick out 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.060
 the tower from the house to not get they can not 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.500
 can go further and here from these places 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.959
 so apparently not playing towers begin 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.750
 disassemble the mouse and the shootout begins 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.850
 weave weave, of course, weave 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.620
 therefore we need towers 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.660
 very quickly disassemble the mouse and help with 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.299
 hundreds of opponents weave forced 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.570
 retreat to the greens due to the fact that 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.009
 e 100 comic is in much more 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.440
 advantageous position and not at the expense of 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:43.070
 different issue from the hills 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.780
 can play tower weave tank they are not 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:50.449
 can flash drives predictably disassemble the mouse 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.250
 the mouse could not do a tower 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:55.000
 it is extremely difficult to break it as 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.440
 exposes his cheeks he leaves nld and 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.549
 because of this little ignorance 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.750
 cards and you of the fact that there is a mouse 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.090
 could he stand somewhere far away may 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.949
 be and would have lived the bill already 20 in favor 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.680
 comics weave forced to retreat 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:11.090
 the word is no longer among them but the whole half 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.340
 someone is good 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.600
 opolovinil and meanwhile 3 feveshki 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.870
 passes already towards the base 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.690
 it will be in cutting artillery if 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.250
 she has old women doing exact 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.410
 getting into this area 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.539
 he takes them, in principle, a score of 40 to three 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.410
 tank batcha which most likely already 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:38.330
 gone on when they take the butt not on 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.220
 when but nevertheless with three strands 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.220
 the enemy is clearly he can not cope 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:52.120
 41 accurate shot hotel believes addiction 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:54.759
 51 bochata taken in two tanks will be 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.220
 an attempt to go in the back will be an attempt from 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:05:02.620
 focus precisely centurion 52 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:06.070
 but as we see now at least 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:09.130
 three comic tanks distracted by one 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.560
 tank in thin they are therefore in this region 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.750
 approximately and approximately equal to 100 in tanks 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:18.000
 even when accounting 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:21.280
 a huge difference in the score but leaving and 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.610
 screed thin they are on the square c two two 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:28.060
 cars come he will be in the tail 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.680
 shooting drums karma and actually on 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.620
 this 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.380
 any attempts by the tank are they to win 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:40.090
 will stop 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:43.410
 shot 50b lit artillery for some reason 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.410
 don't get still 50 b 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.100
 not clear but oh well here it is 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:55.130
 Got left artillery likely 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.130
 two artillery and st-shka on c2 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.710
 where is artillery we all know where 1 page 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:08.600
 ear predictable here throwing bomb at 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:11.020
 him a very good score 13 2 whether 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.340
 attempt to finish off and most likely not at 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.919
 Comic sufficient number of even 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.500
 tanks will try to get batik and hardly 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:21.490
 will look for artillery but big 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.610
 failed to pick up 13 3 failed 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.169
 14:03 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.169
 and victory comic
