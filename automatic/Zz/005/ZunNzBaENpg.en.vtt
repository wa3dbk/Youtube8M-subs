00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.960
 Y 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.889
 everything changes in our adolescence 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.200
 body grows mature we leave the forms 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.470
 of childhood and we started to adapt to 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.540
 the challenges of adult life 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.000
 something similar happens with our 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.150
 personality is that to be able 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.760
 develop in adolescence 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.950
 we need to define our identity 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.790
 learn to know and value us 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.790
 ourselves 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.870
 how 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.899
 adolescence is a stage of 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.359
 personal revolution in which 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.519
 produce profound changes appear 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.010
 new sensations that we do not know how 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.350
 handle we feel that nobody understands us 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.030
 that everything is going to embarrass us but it's 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.030
 also a stage of much reflection 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.750
 we learn all the time but not 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.739
 we want to learn not only in the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.739
 school one learns 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.240
 adolescence is the stage of 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.390
 transition that every young person lives among 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.990
 10 and the 19 years that it takes it from 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.329
 childhood to the adult world in this process the 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.240
 body changes and the teenager looks 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:28.469
 forced to modify his mind according 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.469
 to the environment in which he lives 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.560
 to talk about this that we feel can be 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.049
 a good way to not have a bad time 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.970
 since adolescence it is common for 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.149
 arise want to talk about what we 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.130
 happens but it can happen that for some 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.429
 reason at home we do not feel at all 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.860
 comfortable to make good places to 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.340
 express themselves can be the school or some 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.979
 neighborhood or community center there is 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.159
 other teenagers with the same doubts 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.659
 and the same fears and professionals 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.659
 trained to help 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.360
 for you was a teenager that is the 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.300
 adolescence for you for me is a 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.540
 stage change where you are most 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.280
 vulnerable and you do not have all kinds of 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.320
 experiences that you have got good and 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.880
 bad things because you feel vulnerable 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:30.310
 and because it's like you're big for 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.230
 certain things and guys for others that you 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.540
 send maple light signs and I'm girl 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.490
 For that I am 15 years old but for others 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.520
 things does not depend how each one of you 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.140
 suits the sun or suppose that the 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.490
 other people see us very boys are very 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.850
 great but that we ourselves do not 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.310
 we know at what point we are crying to 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.050
 sometimes not the poetic and I have a notebook 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.500
 where I write when I feel rehman and 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.500
 sad 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.690
 it's a kind of download and not yourself 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.310
 you write are doing some voice my 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.130
 case everything there is harmonica time 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.860
 because he had to touch anything because he said 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:12.040
 I love it not because I saw a method of 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.040
 development download by music 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.730
 If you had to tell me to be 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.180
 adolescent teenager is a stage that 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.990
 we change ourselves before us we play 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:30.670
 in the playground we were playing but now not 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.470
 now we change we grow our physical 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.630
 that's what happens in adolescence the 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.520
 girls started to worry about another 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.590
 way of dressing and others in the 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.569
 adolescence or the same thing that happened 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.940
 with any clothes but now it started 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.040
 change has we like this clothes that do not 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.440
 like for example the other mom me 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.130
 I buy once 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:56.460
 green jacket green green 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.830
 so I started waiting and sparkling and me 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.330
 I do not like it and I did not wear it and 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.190
 nicolÃ¡s for example contains 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.380
 get used to weapons with males 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.780
 with more women with colleagues than with 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.640
 women because there are times when 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.640
 Girls unattended companions 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.889
 if you had to tell me one thing 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.109
 that they say being a teenager to me what 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.880
 I loved this was what I love 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.910
 to be able to enjoy this is what is 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.060
 go the cyber john computer in the 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.630
 play that will listen mp3 music in 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.630
 mobile 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.570
 and that's what I like about being something like that 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.570
 to 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:50.739
 and I'm going to use technology to learn 

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:52.569
 the computers the mp3 and the internet are 

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:54.519
 very powerful tools that are not 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:58.169
 good are bad in themselves all 

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:58.169
 It really depends on how we use them 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.449
 we can access a lot 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.159
 information we can study we can 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.780
 question why things are like 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:12.740
 they are and they are not otherwise we can 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.740
 have a critical thinking 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.770
 we can do all this with internet without 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.349
 internet but ultimately what 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.800
 important is that we learn to 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.800
 think 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.890
 They are potatoes and do everything you want 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:38.930
 come now what you want if you want to go to 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:40.820
 the school if they do not let you do everything 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.160
 but well after that also happens 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.260
 time you realize that you still need 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.920
 greater an adult who also follows you 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.920
 his way though
