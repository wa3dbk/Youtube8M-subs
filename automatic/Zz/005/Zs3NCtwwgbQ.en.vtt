 inch screen amoled with 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.449
 resolution full hd quad-core processor 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.820
 to 1.9 gigahertz 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.860
 lte connection and your camera 13 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.560
 megapixels 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.840
 In addition, the terminal is more luxurious in its 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.400
 finished with its metal outer ring 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.160
 and has many features 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.570
 novelties to share music 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.340
 documents to use the smartphone as 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.050
 a remote control of a television or 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.550
 to divide your operating system to 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.040
 that the corporate and personal part 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.660
 live in perfect harmony for greater 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.080
 tranquility of the administrators of 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.080
 systems 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.120
 well here we have the new galaxy s 4 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.210
 flexible samsung device for 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.950
 2013 its launch will be on April 27 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.560
 at 10 o'clock in the morning we will start 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.270
 distribute the galaxy s 4 as 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.120
 main features highlight that 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.040
 we have a terminal with some finishes and 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.870
 a much more premium design if you 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.740
 you approach and see a little the bevel 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.840
 we include an aluminum frame and 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.800
 we maintain the dimensions of the galaxy s3 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.110
 We reduce the thickness of the terminal and 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.509
 we also reduce the weight of the terminal 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.850
 ok if we focus on the 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.200
 screen arrived at 5 inches as 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.820
 I said before keeping 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.800
 dimensions of the terminal and this we have 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.690
 achieved by adjusting the two edges 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.399
 of the screen a lot more students 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.080
 now the frames are worth 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:49.650
 we include a quad-core processor 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:52.710
 of 1.9 gigahertz we support lt in 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.750
 all its in all its bands besides 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.210
 good 16 gigas of storage ample 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.409
 up to 64 through a micro SD of 2GB 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.409
 two gigas of ram 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.100
 we included a rear camera of 3 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.960
 megapixels and a 1.9 front camera 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.960
 the rear camera with flash 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.370
 we also have an infrared sensor with 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.310
 which we can control the screen or 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.860
 the TV when turning it on, turn it off and 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.000
 wishing to use it from remote control 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.330
 well here we have the charger 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.780
 wireless from samsung we see that the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.519
 load is totally immediate and good 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.870
 we will get an indication that the 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.170
 term of this this loading of the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.720
 accessory comes a housing 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.240
 which is what makes the load 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.520
 inductively 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.620
 As you can see, the casing fits 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.590
 completely 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.180
 with the terminal is a translator is not what 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.890
 an application is a service that is 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.019
 integrated within the galaxy software 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.959
 s 4 will allow us to do translations 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.190
 simultaneous both online and offline 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.390
 in this case we are going to make a 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.930
 simultaneous translation from English to 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.930
 Spanish 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.200
 now I 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.200
 then perform the translation you see that 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.840
 have done the translation to how 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.819
 you are and we can also make him do 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.650
 an internal of the characteristics that 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.840
 has our 4e galaxy serviu 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.860
 nerve will allow us to perform a series 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.360
 of actions without touching the 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.760
 screen in this case we can make a 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.170
 preview of the information as 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.030
 He did not come see the band playing 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.340
 no time and a 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.579
 preview of the information 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.079
 ok this will work well in environments 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.750
 this style or also for example if 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:40.470
 we navigate through the gallery we can 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.450
 make a navigation 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.100
 and do a preview of some 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.510
 of the folders for example this 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.070
 we had letters of photographs we see the 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.710
 prioritization of the 14 in this we have 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.150
 three then we see the three photographs what 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.220
 which can we identify them from a 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.110
 more intelligent evaluation then through 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.370
 we are going to share content 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.640
 multimedia in this case we are going to 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.790
 share a song let's create a 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.790
 group 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.090
 let's share a song 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.210
 we select the song that we want 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.860
 share 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.410
 and now you will see in what simple way 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:16.300
 let's pair so the song 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.300
 start playing on our devices 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.370
 this is already paired 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.750
 and now this will turn to untie 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.140
 I do not leave me a dimension 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.880
 and now we start one of us 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.160
 let's try a new functionality 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.670
 of the galaxy s 4g sound and show and it's the 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.250
 possibility of adding an audio to a 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.110
 photography we make the photograph 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.170
 we are in the galaxy s presentation 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.000
 4 we have recorded the audio now we are going to 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:03.630
 The galery 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.530
 we are also worth inside the camera 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.030
 we include a series of functionalities 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.950
 we have adopted the menu that we present 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.300
 in our galaxy camera and here you see 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.340
 all the new features that 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.680
 we have are the types of shots 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.600
 from from a panoramic trigger 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.230
 then photos to make a sequence of 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:24.800
 pictures night mode of detecting which 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.330
 is the most prettiest face the photo 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.860
 add the sound as we have already seen 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.300
 sheets 1 which is a solution that 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.039
 we present in the mobile world congress 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.080
 it means that it will not be in the 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:35.150
 launch moment of galaxy s 4 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.599
 but it will arrive throughout the year 2013 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.949
 we are in a personal environment in which 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.180
 we have all our applications of 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.159
 personal environment we had our 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.889
 facebook twitter social applications 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:47.870
 dropbox and good then all everything 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.509
 let's say our images our mail 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.970
 However, we arrived on the 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:55.310
 Monday we are going to work and we go to the mode 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.659
 knox we enter the password to 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.160
 enter into knox mode or mode 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.810
 corporate 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.040
 and until here you see that it changes all the 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.080
 interface see is not just a change 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.300
 interface but also what we have 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.140
 here is an isolation of applications 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.670
 you see that all applications 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.020
 they have a candadito this means 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.170
 that the information that within these 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.360
 applications is is safe and then 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.730
 we will have for example imagine that 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.290
 We received a corporate email with a 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.930
 document that is confidential 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.030
 we have saved it and now because 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.770
 example we go to the environment to in also to 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.770
 my files we try fire 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:30.650
 we go to my files and here we have it 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.969
 downloaded you see there are some more 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.129
 because we have done the odd thing 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:37.849
 so now if I try to do 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:39.379
 this file from the personal environment 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:42.080
 you will see that this file is not 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.279
 processed by the previous file was 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:48.210
 about a presentation about the galaxy 

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:50.009
 we did not stop to download my files 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.509
 and here we only have one version of 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.639
 galaxy that picture is not the same 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:56.160
 presentation that we had previously 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:58.020
 is another file other than another structure 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.789
 of files what we get from this 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.990
 way is that the files that are that 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:03.240
 they are confidential or they are from the 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.490
 company can only be shared with 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.169
 through the applications that our 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.750
 haiti manager decides we can do it 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:12.810
 It's worth in this case, because I usually 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:15.120
 allowed to make one to share the 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.789
 file through through the mail 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.770
 corporate worth then we would be by 

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:21.479
 sharing directly opens us the 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.520
 mail to send it in this way 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:24.690
 we can do a control over the 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.789
 information that our 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.949
 workers and also we can 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:30.960
 control where that is going 

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:32.789
 information if we detect that this 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.770
 information has been released or sent to 

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:39.180
 someone who should not be so 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:40.949
 remote through the container we could 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.419
 block the container not only the part 

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:43.590
 professional and leave seriously in this 

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:46.220
 zone but leave the personal part 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.930
 accessible to the user 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:51.950
 The sale price in our market 

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:54.280
 of the galaxy s 4 will be 699 euros for the 

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:56.750
 Free terminal with 16 gb capacity 

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.750
 although it can be extended by cards 

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:02.360
 microsd and integrate to version 4.2 

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.510
 livin points of the android system 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.510
 Google 

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:10.400
 yes 

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.400
 no no no
