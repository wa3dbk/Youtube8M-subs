00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
which from flat to incline we're going

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:35.590 
which from flat to incline we're going
right<00:00:23.779> from<00:00:23.900> flat<00:00:24.199> to<00:00:24.230> flat

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.750 

the<00:00:35.930> whole<00:00:36.079> point<00:00:36.320> of<00:00:36.410> this<00:00:36.559> is<00:00:37.160> to<00:00:37.220> shock<00:00:37.610> your

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
the whole point of this is to shock your

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.130 
the whole point of this is to shock your
muscles<00:00:37.820> since<00:00:38.210> we<00:00:38.300> can't<00:00:38.600> go<00:00:38.780> heavy<00:00:38.989> with

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
muscles since we can't go heavy with

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.280 
muscles since we can't go heavy with
lacking<00:00:39.860> weights<00:00:40.070> so<00:00:41.059> what<00:00:41.930> if<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:42.079> do<00:00:42.200> is

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
lacking weights so what if the do is

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.960 
lacking weights so what if the do is
make<00:00:42.440> sure<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:42.620> keep<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:42.829> volume<00:00:43.220> up<00:00:43.399> and

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
make sure you keep the volume up and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.270 
make sure you keep the volume up and
keep<00:00:44.420> your<00:00:44.540> pace<00:00:44.780> up<00:00:44.809> with<00:00:45.620> maybe<00:00:45.800> just<00:00:45.890> enough

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
keep your pace up with maybe just enough

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.040 
keep your pace up with maybe just enough
time<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:46.550> catch<00:00:46.670> your<00:00:47.030> breath<00:00:47.090> and<00:00:47.690> get<00:00:48.020> a

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
time to catch your breath and get a

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.040 
time to catch your breath and get a
drink<00:00:48.320> of<00:00:48.470> water<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:49.040> that's<00:00:50.000> it<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:50.900> now

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
drink of water and that's it so now

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.079 
drink of water and that's it so now
pretty<00:00:51.769> much<00:00:51.920> without<00:00:52.100> stopping<00:00:52.699> in<00:00:53.059> the

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
pretty much without stopping in the

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:54.910 
pretty much without stopping in the
simple<00:00:53.449> water<00:00:53.600> we're<00:00:54.290> gonna<00:00:54.379> transition

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
simple water we're gonna transition

right from incline flyes to incline
presses<00:00:56.780> now<00:00:57.379> like<00:00:57.500> I<00:00:57.559> said<00:00:57.680> we<00:00:57.800> don't<00:00:57.980> have

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
presses now like I said we don't have

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.070 
presses now like I said we don't have
heavy<00:00:58.519> enough<00:00:58.699> weight<00:00:58.910> there<00:00:59.150> and<00:00:59.360> as<00:00:59.870> you<00:00:59.989> can

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
heavy enough weight there and as you can

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.920 
heavy enough weight there and as you can
see<00:01:00.320> I<00:01:00.350> mean<00:01:00.680> 60<00:01:01.550> pounds<00:01:01.940> isn't<00:01:02.089> even<00:01:02.360> as<00:01:02.540> heavy

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
see I mean 60 pounds isn't even as heavy

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.810 
see I mean 60 pounds isn't even as heavy
as<00:01:03.019> I<00:01:03.110> normally<00:01:03.170> go<00:01:03.500> on<00:01:03.530> flies<00:01:03.860> let<00:01:04.580> alone

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
as I normally go on flies let alone

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.570 
as I normally go on flies let alone
pressing<00:01:05.630> but<00:01:06.229> this<00:01:06.619> is<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.830> fourth<00:01:07.100> exercise

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
pressing but this is the fourth exercise

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.999 
pressing but this is the fourth exercise
and<00:01:08.030> doing<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:08.810> at<00:01:08.869> a<00:01:08.930> fast<00:01:09.170> pace<00:01:09.289> makes<00:01:09.740> it<00:01:09.860> so

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
and doing it at a fast pace makes it so

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.800 
and doing it at a fast pace makes it so
these<00:01:10.700> will<00:01:11.149> give<00:01:11.270> us<00:01:11.390> some<00:01:11.509> nice<00:01:11.630> good

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
like these focus on squeezing at the top

all<00:02:06.259> right<00:02:06.440> final<00:02:07.340> exercise<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.789> burnout

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
all right final exercise to the burnout

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.090 
all right final exercise to the burnout
will<00:02:08.270> be<00:02:08.390> targeted<00:02:08.959> more<00:02:09.050> towards<00:02:09.110> lower

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
will be targeted more towards lower

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.220 
will be targeted more towards lower
chest<00:02:10.520> and<00:02:10.819> again<00:02:11.239> another<00:02:11.450> nice<00:02:11.660> squeezing

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
chest and again another nice squeezing

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.510 
chest and again another nice squeezing
movement<00:02:12.680> that's<00:02:13.370> just<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:14.090> machine<00:02:14.420> press<00:02:14.720> I

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
movement that's just the machine press I

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.800 
movement that's just the machine press I
took<00:02:16.520> off<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.730> pads<00:02:17.090> on<00:02:17.300> these<00:02:17.420> handles

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
took off the pads on these handles

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.660 
took off the pads on these handles
because<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:18.319> actually<00:02:18.470> proven<00:02:18.980> in<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.430> study

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
because it's actually proven in a study

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.280 
because it's actually proven in a study
that<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.269> thickness<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.870> bar<00:02:21.080> will

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
that the thickness of a bar will

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.930 
that the thickness of a bar will
determine<00:02:21.560> how<00:02:22.160> much<00:02:22.280> your<00:02:22.489> muscles<00:02:22.790> being

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
determine how much your muscles being

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.840 
determine how much your muscles being
used<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.569> thinner<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.680> bar<00:02:24.830> is<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.640> more

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
used and thinner the bar is the more

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.550 
used and thinner the bar is the more
your<00:02:26.000> muscles<00:02:26.090> actually<00:02:26.480> being<00:02:26.900> isolated

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
your muscles actually being isolated

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.750 
your muscles actually being isolated
believe<00:02:27.739> it<00:02:27.830> or<00:02:27.920> not<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.160> lot<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.340> power<00:02:28.550> if

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
believe it or not a lot of power if

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.009 
believe it or not a lot of power if
there's<00:02:28.940> like<00:02:29.060> using<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.360> thicker<00:02:29.569> bars<00:02:29.840> to

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
there's like using the thicker bars to

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.449 
there's like using the thicker bars to
work<00:02:30.140> on<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.319> overall<00:02:30.560> strength<00:02:30.920> power<00:02:31.190> and

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
work on the overall strength power and

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.309 
work on the overall strength power and
grip<00:02:31.610> which<00:02:32.300> is<00:02:32.330> fine<00:02:32.630> because<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:32.930> does<00:02:33.080> work

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
grip which is fine because it does work

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.290 
grip which is fine because it does work
but<00:02:33.769> for<00:02:33.890> actually<00:02:34.190> isolating<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.910> muscle

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
but for actually isolating the muscle

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.000 
but for actually isolating the muscle
there's<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.780> whole<00:02:35.930> scientific<00:02:36.260> explanation

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
there's a whole scientific explanation

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.140 
there's a whole scientific explanation
for<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.430> didn't<00:02:37.880> even<00:02:37.970> really

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
for it that I didn't even really

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.750 
for it that I didn't even really
remember<00:02:38.569> but<00:02:38.750> long<00:02:39.200> story<00:02:39.230> short<00:02:39.640> sit<00:02:40.640> under

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
remember but long story short sit under

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.100 
remember but long story short sit under
the<00:02:40.850> bar<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.360> more<00:02:41.569> that<00:02:41.690> muscle<00:02:41.959> will<00:02:42.049> be

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
the bar the more that muscle will be

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.979 
the bar the more that muscle will be
