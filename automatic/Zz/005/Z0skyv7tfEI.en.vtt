00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hello everyone, Ala and today I am 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.290
 I will review the yoghurt maker that I 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.290
 bought not so long ago, we tell you 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.300
 its pros cons price value and so 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.759
 further generally yogurtnitsu I acquired 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.650
 because i have a little baby her 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.140
 need to feed some sour milk 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.670
 products and what is sold in the store 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.480
 not quite what you want 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.820
 quality so I decided to try 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.340
 do yogurt itself when your 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.590
 instructions because of yogurt out sourdough then 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.110
 there is so much useful written 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.510
 qualities that straight you become 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.290
 practically immortal you live long 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.390
 you fix the microflora nicat and so 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.489
 further so on so on in the Internet 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.100
 the store where they sold the leaven 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.559
 complete in general there was a choice of 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.780
 four options well, the most such 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.699
 the popular option is this here moulinex pro 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.930
 which I will tell today in 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.149
 I ended up buying 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.079
 Yogurt maker offline about the store itself 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.879
 media markt there it cost 1800 rubles 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.430
 Differences from them video where it cost 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.560
 almost two times more expensive how to choose 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.510
 exactly which device i think that 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.560
 In principle, they are all about the same . 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.420
 They have a power button on and off 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.000
 setting the time I looked like 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.640
 press optical mechanical buttons 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.020
 which tactile were not pleasant 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.049
 and another important point that I already understood 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.159
 after purchase you can see here 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.320
 the height of this one 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.030
 glass so that it was taller then 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.250
 here everything will be absolutely everything 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.530
 any standard glasses that you 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.170
 What do you need ? 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.460
 top cover under which is 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:48.360
 lids for jars in my case it is 7 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.149
 jars of about 200 milliliters in 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.220
 Generally these 7 jars is one packet 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.130
 milk and one of these jars is obtained 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.320
 filled not 100 percent here and 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.390
 further theta removable part where stored 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.090
 covers and inside respectively all 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.040
 glass jars, I specifically take off 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.979
 This review is after me 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.979
 and the shopping mall has disappeared, and I am already more 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.900
 sober look on 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.330
 acquisitions already when we are all 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.610
 tried you can talk about some 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.940
 standard use per family of 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.129
 three people prince enough one 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.549
 ferment for a few days here I have 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:27.530
 wiwa leaven what is it like 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.190
 they look so small 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.340
 jars inside which is itself 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.040
 bacterium yogurt on her need 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.829
 instructions to add milk 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.360
 it's all in milk pour in jars and 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.569
 put on specified in instructions 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:49.040
 time can be stored in the refrigerator in 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.900
 jars well, it seemed to me to cook 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.670
 not so convenient because I'm in any 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.940
 case the whole product is obtained 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.519
 I do not store the barrels and merge it into some one 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.739
 large one tank so here I have 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.400
 glasses of whiskey came up here 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.319
 height and grabs 5 pieces and lighter ones 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.000
 pull out because all the same u edges 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.579
 butterflies 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.980
 cling yogurt is just not so comfortable there 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.200
 just poured and everything to this yogurt maker yet 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.690
 sold an additional set of jars 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.489
 if suddenly you have broken bath 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.130
 if suddenly you have a big family and you 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.780
 need every morning a new yogurt here 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.459
 you can buy an extra set 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.680
 and constantly changing them one 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.470
 the refrigerator is preparing something else 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.419
 I prepare a new one every three days 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.120
 product i realized that if you want 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:37.220
 try what to do yogurt 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.940
 appreciate it enough for you to buy 1 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.000
 leaven 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.069
 without yogurt maker try diluting 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.049
 milk do everything according to the instructions and 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.200
 put just in the bottle in 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.150
 some kind of warm on the battery at night and 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.380
 this will be enough for u 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.599
 you turned out to 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.849
 taste the taste of the starter product 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.970
 several species there are special 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.310
 which should be used for example after 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.690
 antibiotic diseases which 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.209
 stimulates immunity 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.819
 ordinary kefir sour cream 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.829
 cottage cheese directly yogurt itself so 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.290
 called be a lock is a separate 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.660
 product for babies if nursing moms and 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.199
 pregnant women in general ferment variations 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.750
 weight 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:19.609
 for every taste in order for you 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.469
 decide it is tasty or not I think 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.210
 just worth a try because by 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:24.490
 camera but 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.919
 I can't tell you that 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.430
 concerns children but I think it's a question 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:32.169
 time habits and of course the question of skill 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.240
 that is, experiments can be set 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:38.590
 a lot to add to these yogurt and berries 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.539
 honey sweeteners also online 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.840
 You can find a lot of recipes by 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:46.240
 cooking various foods 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.960
 concerns me then I stopped just 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.180
 on yogurt 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.360
 it is great instead of sour cream 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.930
 salads and you can marinate chicken it 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.210
 you can drink instead of kefir in principle he 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.729
 we can make sweet ones 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.130
 ice cream desserts so for now 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.229
 favorite of my products I tried 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.080
 make curd but apparently something I'm doing 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:10.120
 wrong it didn't work out twice i 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.759
 I realized that it's easier for me just for now 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.770
 buy in store as for 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.690
 acquiring needs or not 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.550
 despite being at home 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.509
 without this device you can cook 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:25.360
 yogurt i'm glad i have it 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.430
 which I often use especially a bottle 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.409
 put me on the battery for the night nowhere 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.570
 it's not expensive 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.669
 the device takes a worthy place on 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.190
 I am very glad to be in my kitchen 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.479
 acquired the price-quality ratio from 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.150
 he is just fine 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.280

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.560
