get into the inside fight and he still
got<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.320> better<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.710> koto<00:01:07.979> now<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.970> despite<00:01:09.600> it

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
got the better of koto now it despite it

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.530 
got the better of koto now it despite it
largely<00:01:10.740> depends<00:01:11.310> what<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.640> saw<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.119> from<00:01:12.299> if

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
largely depends what you saw it from if

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.960 
largely depends what you saw it from if
you<00:01:12.810> saw<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.200> from<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.380> crowd<00:01:13.680> then<00:01:14.430> yeah<00:01:14.729> it

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
you saw it from the crowd then yeah it

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.969 
you saw it from the crowd then yeah it
looked<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.210> holder<00:01:15.659> was<00:01:15.810> doing<00:01:16.110> damage<00:01:16.350> but

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
looked like holder was doing damage but

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.580 
looked like holder was doing damage but
in<00:01:17.130> reality<00:01:17.340> he<00:01:17.880> couldn't<00:01:18.600> even<00:01:18.659> land<00:01:19.200> any

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
in reality he couldn't even land any

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.249 
in reality he couldn't even land any
clean<00:01:20.189> shots<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.299> shots<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.689> he<00:01:21.960> did

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
clean shots in the shots that he did

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.330 
clean shots in the shots that he did
land<00:01:22.590> were<00:01:23.040> partially<00:01:23.909> blocked<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.540> fact

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
land were partially blocked in fact

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.950 
land were partially blocked in fact
Mayweather<00:01:26.340> was<00:01:26.790> able<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.240> keep<00:01:27.390> coral<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
Mayweather was able to keep coral to

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.649 
Mayweather was able to keep coral to
less<00:01:28.170> than<00:01:28.200> twenty<00:01:28.740> percent<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.670> his<00:01:30.150> punches

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
less than twenty percent of his punches

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.240 
less than twenty percent of his punches
because<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.229> see<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> fight<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.979> slow

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
because if you see the fight in slow

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.300 
because if you see the fight in slow
motion<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.909> seemed<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:33.740> again<00:01:34.740> Mayweather

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
motion it seemed like again Mayweather

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.310 
motion it seemed like again Mayweather
just<00:01:35.579> knew<00:01:35.970> where<00:01:36.270> every<00:01:36.570> punch<00:01:36.810> was<00:01:36.960> coming

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
just knew where every punch was coming

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.140 
just knew where every punch was coming
and<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.770> think<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.100> has<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.939> fact

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
and I think this has to do with the fact

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.270 
and I think this has to do with the fact
that<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.170> get<00:01:40.320> people<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:40.979> emulate

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
that you can get people that can emulate

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.819 
that you can get people that can emulate
me<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.820> gold<00:01:42.060> oh<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.689> how<00:01:43.110> many<00:01:43.170> people<00:01:43.740> can

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
me get gold oh but how many people can

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.429 
me get gold oh but how many people can
emulate<00:01:44.100> Floyd<00:01:44.549> Mayweather<00:01:44.939> not<00:01:45.420> many<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.990> mean

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
emulate Floyd Mayweather not many I mean

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.710 
emulate Floyd Mayweather not many I mean
he's<00:01:46.770> very<00:01:47.100> unconventional<00:01:47.729> think<00:01:48.420> about<00:01:48.600> it

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
he's very unconventional think about it

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.660 
he's very unconventional think about it

ways<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.060> protect<00:01:51.240> his<00:01:51.540> body<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:52.320> he's<00:01:52.530> so

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
ways to protect his body but he's so

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.520 
ways to protect his body but he's so
fast<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.880> he<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.450> bring<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.960> hand<00:01:55.140> up<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
fast that he can bring that hand up and

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.289 
fast that he can bring that hand up and
punch<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.159> know<00:01:56.430> I'm<00:01:56.490> saying<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.909> there

were times where Miguel Cotto head like

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.219 
were times where Miguel Cotto head like

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that she'll defense like this and he

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.560 
that she'll defense like this and he
just<00:02:01.259> couldn't<00:02:01.680> land<00:02:02.280> anything<00:02:02.700> he<00:02:03.540> just

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
just couldn't land anything he just

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.690 
just couldn't land anything he just
couldn't<00:02:04.290> even<00:02:04.770> when<00:02:04.920> he<00:02:05.009> had<00:02:05.219> Mayweather

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
couldn't even when he had Mayweather

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.219 
couldn't even when he had Mayweather
backed<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.299> into<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> corner<00:02:06.960> he<00:02:07.049> just

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
backed up into the corner he just

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.930 
backed up into the corner he just
couldn't<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.649> anything<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.670> said<00:02:08.849> before

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
couldn't do anything like I said before

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.790 
couldn't do anything like I said before
he<00:02:09.239> probably<00:02:09.629> landed<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.530> would<00:02:11.160> say<00:02:11.510> no

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
he probably landed I would say no

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.980 
he probably landed I would say no
more<00:02:12.890> than<00:02:13.010> three<00:02:13.220> or<00:02:13.280> four<00:02:13.700> clean<00:02:14.270> shots<00:02:14.780> in

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
that fight and even then Mayweather took

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.880 
that fight and even then Mayweather took
those<00:02:17.210> punches<00:02:17.510> just<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:18.320> he<00:02:18.410> could<00:02:18.560> give<00:02:18.770> them

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
those punches just so he could give them

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.670 
those punches just so he could give them
two<00:02:19.100> or<00:02:19.130> three<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:20.120> mean<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:21.170> can't<00:02:21.470> take

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680

was just truly amazing and you can't
take<00:02:40.970> away<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.270> fact<00:02:41.360> these<00:02:41.690> were<00:02:41.900> the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
take away the fact these were the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.930 
take away the fact these were the
greatest<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.500> all<00:02:42.650> time<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:43.160> mean<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.700> don't

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
greatest of all time I mean you don't

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.700

have<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.270> like<00:02:44.420> him<00:02:44.600> outside<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:45.020> ring<00:02:45.200> but<00:02:45.680> I

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
have to like him outside the ring but I

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.100 
have to like him outside the ring but I
think<00:02:45.860> he<00:02:46.130> could<00:02:46.250> give<00:02:46.370> Manny<00:02:46.640> Pacquiao<00:02:47.120> big

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
think he could give Manny Pacquiao big

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.800 
think he could give Manny Pacquiao big
problems<00:02:48.620> in<00:02:48.800> fact<00:02:49.370> where<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.120> think<00:02:50.570> Manny

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
problems in fact where I think Manny

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.810 
problems in fact where I think Manny
Pacquio<00:02:51.260> has<00:02:51.470> an<00:02:51.620> advantage<00:02:51.950> over<00:02:52.280> many<00:02:52.670> of

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
Pacquio has an advantage over many of

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.790 
Pacquio has an advantage over many of
Floyd's<00:02:53.090> opponents<00:02:53.690> is<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:54.200> he's<00:02:54.380> extremely

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
Floyd's opponents is that he's extremely

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.440 
Floyd's opponents is that he's extremely
fast<00:02:55.220> so<00:02:55.400> that<00:02:55.430> fight<00:02:55.760> should<00:02:55.910> be<00:02:55.970> interesting

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
fast so that fight should be interesting

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.080 
fast so that fight should be interesting
