today two dozen to keep the feet nice
and<00:00:40.200> even<00:00:40.649> rate<00:00:40.969> everybody<00:00:41.969> has<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.239> tendency

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
and even rate everybody has a tendency

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.209

to<00:00:42.780> push<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.989> little<00:00:43.170> bit<00:00:43.320> harder<00:00:43.379> with<00:00:43.829> one<00:00:43.980> leg

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
to push a little bit harder with one leg

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.970 
to push a little bit harder with one leg
so<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.270> find<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.629> both<00:00:45.809> my<00:00:45.989> heels<00:00:46.289> are<00:00:46.469> exactly

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
so I find it both my heels are exactly

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.540 
so I find it both my heels are exactly
straight<00:00:47.750> I'm<00:00:48.750> able<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.350> know<00:00:49.440> isolate<00:00:50.100> my

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
straight I'm able to you know isolate my

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.520 
straight I'm able to you know isolate my
strong<00:00:50.850> legs<00:00:51.090> as<00:00:51.270> much<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.690> my<00:00:51.809> weaker<00:00:52.110> leg<00:00:52.289> do

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
strong legs as much as my weaker leg do

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.670 
strong legs as much as my weaker leg do
so<00:00:53.570> make<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.780> little<00:00:54.989> more<00:00:55.140> more<00:00:55.289> challenging

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
so make a little more more challenging

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.520 
so make a little more more challenging
that<00:00:55.800> way

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.360 

rs.10000<00:00:59.530> front<00:00:59.740> delts<00:01:00.070> elbows<00:01:00.670> up<00:01:02.220> you<00:01:03.220> want

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
rs.10000 front delts elbows up you want

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.420 
rs.10000 front delts elbows up you want

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
to kind of solder with the parts then

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.610
