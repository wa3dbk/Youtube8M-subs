00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:22.140
 balance say I didn't like it

 very much the other the black one that 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.609
 you will see in a while that the boost is me 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:33.180
 also like on the waterline on the 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:35.720
 internal rhyme while this leaves some 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.720
 in pescara 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.800
 the one just the front goes by 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.520
 apply the darkest color I already have 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.520

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.670
 the blush diego from the palm 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.720
 52 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.490
 I missed the movie on the way with 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.770
 myself 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.340
 but in a word, you will definitely have it 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:33.900
 seen two best times per hour on 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:37.849
 perfect lips and pastel theater 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.849
 both that this hicks 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.060
 and this is the velvet minors but I entered 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.540
 color 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.540
 remains 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:13.939
 and this is the result in ull and you will have 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:16.189
 given how pigmented this is 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:19.909
 in the end it is a beautiful lip gloss 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:22.459
 pure color really very beautiful and nothing 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:26.119
 as usual he hopes that beth and maybe 

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:29.719
 having seen something interesting is like at 

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:33.319
 I'm usually trying them and I'll let you know 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:36.499
 later on the mine or on the blog 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:38.569
 impressions but it can be that 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:41.029
 which struck me most all 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:44.389
 products that I have tried this is that 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:46.509
 which I absolutely loved the most 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:51.969
 compared to others precisely because it is 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:55.449
 so evident the effect is so intense 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:58.779
 really nice and also a good one 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.059
 also a good scent always vanilla 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:04.149
 a fragrance of those anyway 

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:06.369
 like me very good 

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:09.599
 remains and it is all I hope there is 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:09.599
 liked a kiss bye
