00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
I just think the classy now at first

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.490 
I just think the classy now at first
glance<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.419> a4<00:00:32.750> might<00:00:32.960> not<00:00:33.110> look<00:00:33.320> any

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
glance the a4 might not look any

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.140 
glance the a4 might not look any
different<00:00:33.680> to<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.190> original<00:00:34.460> car<00:00:34.910> that<00:00:35.060> was

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
different to the original car that was

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.060 
different to the original car that was
brought<00:00:35.330> out<00:00:35.360> about<00:00:35.630> five<00:00:35.990> years<00:00:36.260> ago<00:00:36.500> now<00:00:36.680> and

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
brought out about five years ago now and

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.010 
brought out about five years ago now and
that's<00:00:37.370> probably<00:00:37.610> intentional<00:00:38.390> because<00:00:38.810> the

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
that's probably intentional because the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.540 
that's probably intentional because the
sales<00:00:39.260> figures<00:00:39.620> for<00:00:39.770> this<00:00:39.860> body<00:00:40.070> design<00:00:40.430> have

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
sales figures for this body design have

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.640 
sales figures for this body design have
always<00:00:40.730> been<00:00:41.000> superb<00:00:41.540> in<00:00:42.170> fact<00:00:42.230> it's<00:00:42.560> probably

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
always been superb in fact it's probably

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.010 
always been superb in fact it's probably
safe<00:00:42.980> to<00:00:43.010> say<00:00:43.310> that<00:00:43.340> it<00:00:43.640> was<00:00:43.730> this<00:00:43.910> a4<00:00:44.540> that

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
safe to say that it was this a4 that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.660 
safe to say that it was this a4 that
really<00:00:45.380> lifted<00:00:45.680> out<00:00:45.800> his<00:00:45.950> image<00:00:46.220> up<00:00:46.400> alongside

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
really lifted out his image up alongside

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.630 
really lifted out his image up alongside
likes<00:00:47.330> a<00:00:47.450> BMW<00:00:47.990> and<00:00:48.410> Mercedes<00:00:48.860> so<00:00:49.100> I<00:00:49.130> guess<00:00:49.460> it's

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
likes a BMW and Mercedes so I guess it's

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.460 
likes a BMW and Mercedes so I guess it's
a<00:00:49.700> case<00:00:49.880> of<00:00:49.910> if<00:00:50.450> it<00:00:50.630> ain't<00:00:50.780> broke<00:00:50.990> don't<00:00:51.020> try

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
a case of if it ain't broke don't try

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.140 
a case of if it ain't broke don't try
and<00:00:51.530> fix<00:00:51.740> it<00:00:51.950> but<00:00:52.400> the<00:00:52.520> flipside<00:00:52.730> of<00:00:52.910> that<00:00:53.030> is

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
and fix it but the flipside of that is

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.550 
and fix it but the flipside of that is
that<00:00:53.480> your<00:00:53.570> customers<00:00:53.990> want<00:00:54.110> to<00:00:54.200> see<00:00:54.320> that

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
if we're looking at this and the three

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.570 
if we're looking at this and the three
to<00:04:09.150> eight<00:04:09.330> or<00:04:09.600> on<00:04:09.959> paper<00:04:10.250> we've<00:04:11.250> got<00:04:11.370> similar

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
to eight or on paper we've got similar

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.699 
to eight or on paper we've got similar
price<00:04:11.989> we've<00:04:12.989> got<00:04:13.140> similar<00:04:13.410> high

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
price we've got similar high

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.039 
price we've got similar high
specification<00:04:14.550> they've<00:04:15.000> both<00:04:15.120> got<00:04:15.390> cracking

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
specification they've both got cracking

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.810 
specification they've both got cracking
six-cylinder<00:04:16.650> engines<00:04:17.040> and<00:04:17.220> there's<00:04:17.730> gonna

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
six-cylinder engines and there's gonna

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.039 
six-cylinder engines and there's gonna
be<00:04:17.880> no<00:04:18.120> question<00:04:18.540> about<00:04:18.600> build<00:04:18.989> quality

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
be no question about build quality

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.599 
be no question about build quality
because<00:04:19.799> they're<00:04:19.919> both<00:04:20.010> German

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
because they're both German

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.510 
because they're both German
so<00:04:21.090> really<00:04:21.269> it's<00:04:21.570> down<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:21.840> two<00:04:22.019> things

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
so really it's down to two things

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.890 
so really it's down to two things
firstly<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:24.000> transmission<00:04:24.570> do<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.750> want

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
firstly the transmission do you want

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.720 
firstly the transmission do you want

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
other one which i think is going to be

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.960 
other one which i think is going to be
the<00:04:30.780> big<00:04:30.930> decider<00:04:31.320> is<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.190> badge<00:04:32.400> or<00:04:32.790> more
