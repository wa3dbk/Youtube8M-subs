bait sit just for a second I'll make a
couple<00:00:29.960> quick<00:00:30.230> twitches<00:00:30.800> with<00:00:30.950> the<00:00:31.070> rod<00:00:31.250> to

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
started and then I'll just let it sit

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.529 
started and then I'll just let it sit
and<00:00:35.769> it's<00:00:36.769> really<00:00:37.129> important<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:38.390> have<00:00:38.449> a

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
and it's really important to have a

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.329 
and it's really important to have a
little<00:00:38.870> bit<00:00:38.960> of<00:00:39.019> slack<00:00:39.350> in<00:00:39.530> your<00:00:39.559> line<00:00:39.710> that's

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
little bit of slack in your line that's

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.880 
little bit of slack in your line that's
gonna<00:00:40.550> allow<00:00:40.879> that<00:00:41.269> bait<00:00:41.899> to<00:00:42.079> dart<00:00:42.289> side<00:00:42.739> to

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
gonna allow that bait to dart side to

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.029 
gonna allow that bait to dart side to
side<00:00:43.359> and<00:00:44.359> the<00:00:45.079> way<00:00:45.199> you<00:00:45.260> do<00:00:45.469> that<00:00:45.620> is<00:00:45.800> when<00:00:45.920> you

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
side and the way you do that is when you

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.029 
side and the way you do that is when you
jerk<00:00:46.850> your<00:00:46.969> rod<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.960> throw<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.379> rod<00:00:48.530> tip<00:00:48.800> back

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
jerk your rod you throw the rod tip back

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.819 
jerk your rod you throw the rod tip back
at<00:00:49.249> it<00:00:49.449> just<00:00:50.449> a<00:00:50.600> jerk<00:00:50.899> and<00:00:51.260> you<00:00:51.350> throw<00:00:51.620> it<00:00:51.679> back

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
at it just a jerk and you throw it back

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.759 
at it just a jerk and you throw it back
and<00:00:52.670> sometimes<00:00:52.909> real<00:00:53.899> little<00:00:54.140> jerks<00:00:54.440> will

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
and sometimes real little jerks will

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.450 
and sometimes real little jerks will
trigger<00:00:54.979> that<00:00:55.159> strike<00:00:56.949> and<00:00:57.949> one<00:00:58.249> of<00:00:58.370> the

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
trigger that strike and one of the

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.009 
trigger that strike and one of the
things<00:00:58.670> I'm<00:00:58.819> always<00:00:58.999> doing<00:00:59.449> with<00:00:59.600> this<00:00:59.719> bait

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
great retrieve when the waters real cold

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.810 
great retrieve when the waters real cold
so<00:01:49.229> many<00:01:49.409> people<00:01:49.710> get<00:01:49.800> habit<00:01:50.190> of<00:01:50.280> these<00:01:50.460> hard

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
so many people get habit of these hard

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.969 
so many people get habit of these hard
jerks<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.540> when<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.780> water<00:01:52.020> gets<00:01:52.290> cold<00:01:52.619> I

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
jerks but when that water gets cold I

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.920 
jerks but when that water gets cold I
don't<00:01:53.430> want<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:53.940> bait<00:01:54.180> moving<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> lot<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:54.900> I

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
don't want that bait moving a lot so I

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.219 
don't want that bait moving a lot so I
make<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.409> cast<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.130> if<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.820> watch<00:01:57.090> my<00:01:57.119> tip<00:01:57.780> I

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
make that cast and if you watch my tip I

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.100 
make that cast and if you watch my tip I
just<00:01:59.100> kind<00:01:59.580> of<00:01:59.670> shake<00:01:59.909> it<00:01:59.940> it's<00:02:00.600> almost<00:02:00.899> like

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
just kind of shake it it's almost like

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.139 
just kind of shake it it's almost like
you're<00:02:01.290> worm<00:02:01.530> fishing<00:02:02.100> or<00:02:02.220> drop-shot<00:02:02.729> fishing

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
you're worm fishing or drop-shot fishing

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.810 
you're worm fishing or drop-shot fishing
and<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:04.140> shake<00:02:04.470> it<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.800> then<00:02:05.190> I<00:02:05.220> let<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> bait

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
and I shake it and then I let the bait

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.859 
and I shake it and then I let the bait
stop<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.649> shake<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:09.090> let<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.360> bait<00:02:09.539> stop

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
stop I shake it and I let the bait stop

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.990 
stop I shake it and I let the bait stop
and<00:02:10.140> that's<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.860> real<00:02:11.160> great<00:02:11.519> technique

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
and that's a real great technique

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.550 
and that's a real great technique
because<00:02:12.390> every<00:02:12.660> time<00:02:12.810> you're<00:02:12.989> shaking<00:02:13.470> it

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
because every time you're shaking it

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.100 
because every time you're shaking it
that<00:02:14.550> baits<00:02:14.790> just<00:02:15.060> doing<00:02:15.300> these<00:02:15.390> little<00:02:15.810> tiny

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
that baits just doing these little tiny

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.130 
that baits just doing these little tiny
twitches<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.860> then<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.640> pause<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.720> fades

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
twitches and then on the pause it fades

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.610 
twitches and then on the pause it fades
off<00:02:19.470> that's<00:02:20.220> one<00:02:20.550> real<00:02:20.790> big<00:02:21.030> one<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:22.500> other

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
off that's one real big one the other

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.810 
off that's one real big one the other
one<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:24.269> count<00:02:24.660> your<00:02:25.140> pauses<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.010> find<00:02:26.550> out

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
one is to count your pauses and find out

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.080 
one is to count your pauses and find out
the<00:02:27.480> pause<00:02:27.750> they<00:02:28.080> want<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:29.160> about<00:02:29.400> every<00:02:29.670> five

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
the pause they want so about every five

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.960 
the pause they want so about every five
casts<00:02:30.780> I'll<00:02:30.989> change<00:02:31.410> my<00:02:31.530> cadence<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.370> I'll

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
casts I'll change my cadence and I'll

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.270 
casts I'll change my cadence and I'll
count<00:02:33.360> my<00:02:33.660> pauses<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.470> first<00:02:34.709> cast

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
count my pauses so the first cast

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.449 
count my pauses so the first cast
I<00:02:35.430> might<00:02:36.269> count<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.660> three<00:02:37.019> and<00:02:37.350> I'll<00:02:38.130> do<00:02:38.310> that

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
I might count the three and I'll do that

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.789 
I might count the three and I'll do that
for<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.790> first<00:02:39.030> five<00:02:39.300> cast<00:02:39.630> if<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.410> doesn't

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
for the first five cast if that doesn't

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:41.210 
for the first five cast if that doesn't
work

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
work

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.500 
work
my<00:02:42.180> next<00:02:42.480> five<00:02:42.660> casts<00:02:43.230> on<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:44.190> pause<00:02:44.510> I'm

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
my next five casts on the pause I'm

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.630 
my next five casts on the pause I'm
going<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.900> count<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.230> five<00:02:46.440> I'll<00:02:47.220> count<00:02:47.519> the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
going to count the five I'll count the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.270 
going to count the five I'll count the
seven<00:02:48.060> I'll<00:02:48.150> count<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.540> ten<00:02:48.920> until<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:49.980> get

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
seven I'll count the ten until I get

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.220 
seven I'll count the ten until I get
that<00:02:50.430> first<00:02:50.730> bite<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.660> once<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.049> get<00:02:52.170> that

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
that first bite and once you get that

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.130 
that first bite and once you get that
first<00:02:52.650> bite<00:02:52.950> then<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.180> duplicate<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.720> so

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
first bite then you can duplicate it so

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.920 
first bite then you can duplicate it so
be<00:02:55.829> very<00:02:56.130> conscious<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.299> amount<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.690> time

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
be very conscious of the amount of time

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.640 
be very conscious of the amount of time
between<00:02:58.769> your<00:02:59.160> pauses

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650
