00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.720
 good to all I am pose and good here you 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.759
 I bring a video more light detail this 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.380
 time is to show you a trick how 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.450
 raise the survival range to 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.159
 maximum that is level 25 and good this 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.199
 trick has taught me golden you will have your 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:15.820
 channel in the description if you want 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.310
 see more videos of agen light or more 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.140
 tricks and good we go with the trick to 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.939
 do this we would have to duplicate in 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.529
 the help packages and supplies that 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.060
 As you know they are the packages of these 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.390
 that the planes let go of us and fall into a 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.130
 random site of the map 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.449
 the trick of duplicating the objects what 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.949
 you will have in the description for those who do not 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.450
 know how to do it and well once we have 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.970
 a minimum of three to be able to do 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.070
 trick we will do it until we have 99 once 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.989
 that we have the 99 we will come here to 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.030
 dependent and we will deliver them as 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.129
 you see will give us a lot of experience and 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.500
 we will raise the rank I was at level 10 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.989
 of survival and I went up to the level 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.850
 17 I had to do it a couple more times 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.920
 to get to 25 and good as you see 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.260
 now I will have the 7 skill points 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.809
 which are the 7 levels that you just upload 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.930
 and we can go unlocking branches and 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.359
 skills are good we can have them all 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.309
 and good to also tell you that this trick 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.979
 It also helps us find weapons 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.660
 more more powerful that do more damage 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.670
 once we climb to level 25 the 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.330
 seller of this tower is going to 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.729
 sell catanas with 1700 damage and things 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.520
 so we will also find more weapons 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.720
 powerful on the map and nothing else here 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.800
 I leave with the video I hope you have 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.800
 liked and until next time 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.560
 yes 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.239
 and others 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.230
 good 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.650
 no more 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.530
 well
