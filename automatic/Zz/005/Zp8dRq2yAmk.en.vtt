00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.290
 on the big sunday dough we will tell 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.540
 you about land rover discovery 4 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.580
 embodied by 60 years of experience 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.170
 British engineers and testers 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.420
 off-road vehicle manufacturer 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.640
 we will tell you about the car at 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.439
 the creation of which was also generalized 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.539
 used the experience of thousands of drivers 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.580
 who used to ride in life 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.189
 on good roads and in places where 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.439
 asphalt is visible only in a dream we will tell 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.960
 you about the technique of creation of which was 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.210
 so ambitious that many found it 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.780
 unrealizable and goal specialists 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.940
 Land Rover 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.829
 was to create an SUV on which 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.350
 could be easily at ease and with 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.480
 comfort to travel everywhere 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.980
 asphalt dirt road under the wheels 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.059
 sand mud water or descents and ascents 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.430
 inspired by such a high goal 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.350
 English engineers must have forgotten 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.289
 invite to create their cars 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.539
 Eternal opponents of designers to be 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.640
 may therefore land rover discovery 4 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.190
 turned out beautiful that special 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.010
 engineering beauty that is not born 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.630
 a flight of fancy of the artist and 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.729
 the purpose of technology is high 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.460
 adjustable ground clearance to 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.290
 overcome deep rut and ford to 70 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.720
 centimeters deep with huge 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.820
 side windows with large mirrors and 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.799
 low tilt almost vertical 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.170
 windshield to provide 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.720
 the abolition of visibility to the driver of the crew 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.210
 any conditions brutal impressive 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.460
 almost sheer grille to 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.079
 overcoming the ford she could have been right 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.450
 raise and move the wave in front of you 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.430
 following the water wheels set apart 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.079
 practically at the corners of the body to 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.570
 reduce weight and give the highest 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.670
 geometric cross impressive 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.939
 alloy wheels delivered the same is not easy 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.829
 So 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.170
 beauty sake and to reduce 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.579
 unsprung masses increase comfort 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.310
 and good road handling 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.619
 driving speeds in general what 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.280
 beautiful and durable and functional 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.110
 that's exactly what design engineers say 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.770
 land rover discovery 4 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.680
 can be seen from his literal appearance not 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.960
 need to scratch your head think about what this 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.840
 car for what 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.470
 made pay attention to the road 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.610
 clearance 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.730
 this car with the usual highway 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.100
 position of height controls 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.970
 suspension ground clearance is 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:26.180
 about 230 millimeters at the first 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.780
 the position he raised is already more than 300 a 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.270
 if the car touches its lever 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.470
 suspension of some obstacles 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.370
 eg sit on the ground the height 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.160
 ground clearance will reach 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.440
 breathtaking 330 millimeters 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.950
 virtually no equal among serial 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.330
 machine's versatility destination 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.330
 discovery 4 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.310
 chassis and complete off-road saloon 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.050
 continuation of the spirit of restraint and 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.360
 functionality complete submission 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.730
 Emotion accurate engineering in calculating 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.330
 jobs performed by the principle 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.330
 landrover 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.090
 called commons and team landing 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.220
 that is , I am sitting far away looking 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.400
 which is very useful in any road 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.709
 and the more off-road situation bodies 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.900
 control dashboard central 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.940
 console flawless in terms of 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.860
 ergonomic design selection 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.610
 finishing materials and quality 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.130
 manufacturing 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.260
 everything is made with truth british taste and 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.480
 aristocratic the same on 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.670
 passenger places where they pop in and can 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.400
 accommodate people of any body size from 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.920
 ballerinas to heavyweight boxer maybe 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.230
 this is why the landrover technique is often 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.829
 choose famous athletes and personalities 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.530
 arts 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.959
 the disco trunk is huge 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.910
 and comfortable able to accommodate a whole 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.359
 a bunch of things after all athletes and artists 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.609
 live always on the road now come 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.530
 time to talk about the super terrain system 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.920
 response mode manager 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.370
 three liter turbodiesel lan driver 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.690
 functioning him to 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.120
 all-wheel drive transmission ass 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.280
 transmissions as well as driving 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.310
 the lumen of this capable car 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.599
 this is an automatic transmission with mode 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.450
 shift commands 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:14.900
 i.e. manual control we can 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.680
 manually select any of the available to us 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.600
 6 gear automatic transmission is 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.360
 height management 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.770
 suspension air suspension and height then 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.470
 have ground clearance 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.440
 if high ground clearance is selected 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.380
 and in the process of moving the car 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.720
 touches something with the suspension lever 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.650
 for example primer then automatically 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.660
 ground clearance 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.060
 still grow a few centimeters 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.390
 that is, the car will try to 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:49.130
 all the strength to rise as high as we can 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:52.650
 it is possible to switch 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.980
 transfer case manually here 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.020
 we include a reduced powertrain range 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.630
 which allows us to increase traction 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.810
 effort on wheels don't forget that 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:08.750
 discovery 4 wheel drive and 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:13.370
 again this is not all this big 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:16.440
 round rotary switch it 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.580
 terrain control unit 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:23.400
 response ie control system 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.670
 off-road transmission in general rotating 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:30.150
 we choose this switch in advance 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:32.610
 memorized search system 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.220
 transmission control program and and 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.550
 management is now this is ours to us 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:42.330
 mode switchable 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:45.290
 snow sand still switching 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.820
 potassium mud and at this moment 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.940
 automatically lift the body 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.030
 slightly increased ground clearance 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.670
 deep sandy and rocky ground 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.630
 there is basically a driver owner of this 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:02.580
 car can not particularly soared 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.240
 how to drive a car in heavy 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.069
 road conditions 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.160
 Now we will show you how it all 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:10.930
 works and works let's face it 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.810
 fantastically choose using terrain 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.880
 e.g. dirt response mode is potassium 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.440
 will immediately lead to a smoothing of responses 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.210
 engine pedal action 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.639
 accelerator that will not allow the machine 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.960
 dig in and block the axle 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.479
 differentials all-wheel drive 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.610
 transmission in addition automatic gearbox not 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:29.740
 will rush to switch up to 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.590
 the driver always had a supply of traction 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.720
 ground clearance will also increase in 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.610
 This position terrain response can be with 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.500
 ease to overcome more than 90 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.690
 percent off-road troubles 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.210
 which is found in Belarus along the way 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.400
 to hunt fishing country house 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.220
 if in addition manually turn on 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.009
 downshift still lift body 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.860
 here discovery 4 is able to creep in 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:56.259
 such conditions where 90 percent of other 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.759
 SUVs sit down to say that 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:58.569
 by geometric parameters 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:00.909
 cross 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:02.979
 he almost has no equal 

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:04.870
 consider that the rain response despite 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:07.300
 on its uniqueness and advancement 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.430
 the law of physics cannot be overcome 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.620
 extreme possibilities wlan driver 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.110
 huge but overestimate your skills 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.030
 off road driving and also continue 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.699
 movement if it becomes frank 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.039
 scary we do not recommend not having basic 

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:23.199
 skills better not tease fate trusting 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:24.120
 on the powerful capabilities of the machine to 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:28.190
 discovery 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:30.460
 really universal car 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:36.080
 which are equally suitable for 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:37.150
 high-speed trips on the highway and for 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.810
 off road 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:44.860
 controls in our highway mode 

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:48.680
 speed of 90 kilometers per hour is quiet 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:51.440
 comfortable comfortably and you can roll up and 

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:55.390
 go straight ahead 

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.390
 That's what I love this car
