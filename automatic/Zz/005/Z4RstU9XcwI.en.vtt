the user is it in logical order and then

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.699 
the user is it in logical order and then
lastly<00:03:50.459> is<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:51.030> know<00:03:51.120> interactivity<00:03:51.780> you

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
lastly is you know interactivity you

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.289 
lastly is you know interactivity you
know<00:03:52.799> kind<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.040> into<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.310> technology<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.000> use

in a delivery method so you know when
somebody<00:03:57.480> comes<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.690> your<00:03:57.750> website<00:03:57.930> are<00:03:58.319> you

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
somebody comes to your website are you

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.170 
somebody comes to your website are you

when<00:04:00.690> they<00:04:00.810> need<00:04:01.049> it<00:04:01.079> and<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.099> technology

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
when they need it and the technology

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.610 
when they need it and the technology
that<00:04:02.639> you're<00:04:02.819> implementing<00:04:03.329> it<00:04:04.079> does<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.440> make

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
that you're implementing it does it make

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.649 
that you're implementing it does it make
sense<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.099> is<00:04:05.220> what<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.579> user<00:04:05.790> would<00:04:06.180> expect

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
sense and is what the user would expect

sense and is what the user would expect
so<00:04:07.379> these<00:04:07.949> three<00:04:08.250> these<00:04:08.609> three<00:04:08.669> things<00:04:08.940> can

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
so these three these three things can

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.000 
so these three these three things can
kind<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:09.870> just<00:04:09.930> kind<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.379> explain<00:04:10.650> what<00:04:10.829> user

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
kind of just kind of explain what user

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.710 
kind of just kind of explain what user
experience<00:04:11.669> is<00:04:11.819> kind<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.209> breaking<00:04:12.389> it<00:04:12.690> down

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
experience is kind of breaking it down

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.899 
experience is kind of breaking it down
and<00:04:13.169> next<00:04:13.680> we'll<00:04:13.769> talk<00:04:13.919> about<00:04:14.040> why<00:04:14.340> it<00:04:14.400> why<00:04:14.879> you

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
and next we'll talk about why it why you

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.939 
and next we'll talk about why it why you
need<00:04:15.269> user<00:04:15.480> experience<00:04:16.109> why<00:04:16.320> it's<00:04:16.470> important

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
need user experience why it's important

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.319 
need user experience why it's important
next<00:04:17.549> we're<00:04:17.669> going<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.820> talk<00:04:17.970> about<00:04:18.090> user

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
next we're going to talk about user

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.930 
next we're going to talk about user
experience<00:04:18.449> and<00:04:19.109> why<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.709> important<00:04:20.220> when

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
experience and why it is important when
