00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.940
 bales but especially the water but hs 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.940
 thank you 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.900
 that the children is a vhs more 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.699
 commonly called cassette 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.140
 if you are born after 2003 you do not 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.439
 probably know because that's it 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.059
 children 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.939
 it's not the xbox one it's a 

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:30.469
 VCR is used to read the vhs and 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.369
 if you were born after 2003 you 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:32.719
 probably know because those in 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.070
 blue that kids it's a 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.180
 remote control and if you do not know what 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.350
 that it is that you are damn 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.350
 happy because it still exists 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.460
 not us 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.829
 dad the bullets or so it's a series 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.750
 aired from September 1996 on 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.369
 france 3 we follow the adventures of 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.360
 bullets or everyday objects that 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.399
 comes alive during the night 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.009
 the cloth the fork the pencil the 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.460
 bowl and slippers my god but it's from 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.680
 black magic 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.060
 it's satanic during the night 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.229
 bullets for the benefit of human sleep 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.090
 to do a whole bunch of bullshit 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.799
 so the tea towel the little spoon 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.539
 lack of drowning in the sink he plays 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.710
 with the toys of the sleeping boy they are 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.539
 have them locked up in a bin 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.340
 short males or it's a beautiful band 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.869
 branquignols but before 7am 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.220
 morning everything has to be put back into order in 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.020
 the house to prevent the inhabitants 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.030
 realize something good 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.830
 I looked at all 165 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.979
 episodes and in none they are done 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.979
 Grill 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.670
 you must know that at the base the baba lou 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.440
 it's a series of children's books 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.729
 in the style gentleman writes 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.619
 by jean luc morel who is also the 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.000
 creator of the series and if I can say 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.380
 one thing about these books is at 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.270
 how scary they look no 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.989
 but look at that and frankly the 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.729
 cover is tasteless 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:08.080
 with his naive look I'm sorry but 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.789
 the pan would be a sacred thing 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.620
 now since we asked for it 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.379
 wanted to intervene on a point that 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.879
 Babalou means after very serious 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.300
 searches I came up with three 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.370
 hypotheses 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.860
 for that we have to lean towards the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.810
 term babalou with 2o babalou haye is 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.760
 the father of the worlds these deities at the 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.629
 youku people me it's a belief 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.459
 based on magic 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.720
 although absolutely terrifying I 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.580
 guess it was pasty and also 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.650
 the least plausible second hypothesis 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.360
 balou and English a synonym for 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.750
 sweety crown which means in 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.170
 French 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.519
 my darling where my love when we see a 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.140
 man pans that would be no wonder 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.300
 and finally last and third hypothesis 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.040
 which seems the most logical indeed 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.050
 balou also means behaviors 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.159
 irrational and I think we can say 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.090
 that the tea towels that spoke of 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.610
 forks that's nothing of a 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.319
 rational behavior and I am 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.069
 not sure of herself and you are 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.959
 downright scary 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.620
 now if you want it well I 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.960
 would like us to stop a few 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.980
 moments on the lyrics of the credits 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.800
 the dads we popes us to life 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.099
 per year begin to play and that 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.239
 bees do not have that's how it was 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.769
 looks super cheerful and lively 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.909
 but if we change a little bit 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.299
 the atmosphere and keeping the same 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.299
 lyrics 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.030
 never 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.290
 decree 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.460
 Yes 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.720
 here are the kids it's over for 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.220
 today 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.720
 do not forget to share the video with 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.990
 your friends do not even need art in 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.990
 coil and 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.440
 all dads we live well 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.450
 and dad he's me 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.750
 we start playing and 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.750
