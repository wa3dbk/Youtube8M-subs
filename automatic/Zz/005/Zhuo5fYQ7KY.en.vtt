00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
the only place that Cameron could have

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.430 
the only place that Cameron could have
got<00:00:45.700> it<00:00:45.879> and<00:00:46.360> it<00:00:46.540> was<00:00:46.600> away<00:00:46.840> from<00:00:46.899> the<00:00:47.140> defender

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
got it and it was away from the defender

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.139 
got it and it was away from the defender
it<00:00:47.680> was<00:00:47.829> either<00:00:47.980> camera<00:00:48.460> gets<00:00:48.670> it<00:00:48.850> or<00:00:48.940> it<00:00:49.030> goes

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
it was either camera gets it or it goes

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.630 
it was either camera gets it or it goes
out<00:00:49.360> of<00:00:49.390> bounds<00:00:49.570> so<00:00:49.989> it<00:00:50.950> was<00:00:51.070> a<00:00:51.100> great<00:00:51.250> throw

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:02.529 
wanted to win it and they have you have

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:04.409 
wanted to win it and they have you have
to<00:02:02.590> have<00:02:02.709> a<00:02:02.799> Heisman<00:02:03.249> moment<00:02:03.579> well<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:04.239> run

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:04.419 
to have a Heisman moment well the run

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:06.209 
to have a Heisman moment well the run
against<00:02:04.689> LSU<00:02:04.869> was<00:02:05.319> a<00:02:05.349> Heisman<00:02:05.770> moment<00:02:06.099> and

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
against LSU was a Heisman moment and

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.729 
against LSU was a Heisman moment and
then<00:02:06.340> obviously<00:02:06.639> that<00:02:06.999> catch<00:02:07.209> was<00:02:07.419> one<00:02:07.630> but<00:02:08.379> I

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
then obviously that catch was one but I

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.469 
then obviously that catch was one but I
think<00:02:09.189> it's<00:02:09.310> fitting<00:02:09.489> that<00:02:09.640> Cody<00:02:10.030> burns<00:02:10.239> is

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
think it's fitting that Cody burns is

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.890 
think it's fitting that Cody burns is
Wanda<00:02:10.750> threw<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:11.019> to<00:02:11.140> him

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
Wanda threw it to him

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.630 
Wanda threw it to him
well<00:02:12.079> because<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.890> know<00:02:12.950> Cody's<00:02:13.280> had<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.489> great

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
well because you know Cody's had a great

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.789 
well because you know Cody's had a great
career<00:02:13.909> up-and-down<00:02:14.780> career<00:02:15.049> it's<00:02:15.620> been<00:02:15.769> a

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
career up-and-down career it's been a

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.059 
career up-and-down career it's been a
lot<00:02:15.950> but<00:02:16.939> upward<00:02:17.239> lately<00:02:17.540> but<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:18.079> just<00:02:18.950> thought

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
lot but upward lately but I just thought

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.710 
lot but upward lately but I just thought
it<00:02:19.220> was<00:02:19.310> beautiful<00:02:19.459> moment<00:02:19.970> since<00:02:20.420> I've<00:02:20.569> been

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
different quarterback coaches and

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.210 
different quarterback coaches and
offensive<00:02:23.540> coordinators<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:24.290> it's<00:02:25.040> been<00:02:25.189> a

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
offensive coordinators so it's been a

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.429 
offensive coordinators so it's been a
big<00:02:25.430> time<00:02:25.579> roller<00:02:25.819> coaster<00:02:26.180> for<00:02:26.269> me<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.659> you
