returned<00:00:46.530> back<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.739> meat-eating<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.430> saw

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
returned back to meat-eating and I saw

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.799 
returned back to meat-eating and I saw
one<00:00:47.850> study<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.239> I'll<00:00:48.329> link<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.600> down<00:00:48.750> below

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
one study that I'll link it down below

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.840 
one study that I'll link it down below
just<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.289> discussion<00:00:49.620> from<00:00:49.860> vegans<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.550> believe

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
just a discussion from vegans I believe

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.100 
just a discussion from vegans I believe
I<00:00:51.149> think<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.539> one<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.780> ones<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.989> found

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
I think it's one of the ones I found

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.569 
I think it's one of the ones I found
that<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:52.620> something<00:00:52.860> like<00:00:53.010> eighty<00:00:53.280> four

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
that up just something like eighty four

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.060 
that up just something like eighty four
percent<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.270> vegans<00:00:54.690> leave<00:00:55.410> veganism<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
percent of vegans leave veganism and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.590 
percent of vegans leave veganism and
return<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.489> meat-eating<00:00:56.789> at<00:00:56.940> some<00:00:57.149> point<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
return to meat-eating at some point and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.910 
return to meat-eating at some point and
here's<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.050> problem<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.530> we've<00:00:58.649> run<00:00:58.770> into

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
here's the problem that we've run into

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
hundred percent

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.910 
hundred percent
I<00:01:08.790> tried<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:09.930> really<00:01:10.290> believed<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.830> I

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
I tried it's really believed in it I

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.710

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.999 
that it was simply unsustainable there's
a<00:01:18.330> reason<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.930> all<00:01:19.080> through<00:01:19.290> history<00:01:19.320> no

illness there there is data out there
showing<00:03:59.670> there<00:03:59.820> are<00:03:59.850> much<00:04:00.060> higher<00:04:00.239> rates<00:04:00.540> of

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630

mental illness among vegetarians in the
mainstream<00:04:02.850> community<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.630> I<00:04:04.590> suspect<00:04:05.340> the

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
mainstream community and I suspect the

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.160 
mainstream community and I suspect the
cravings<00:04:05.910> and<00:04:06.060> some<00:04:06.510> sort<00:04:06.720> of<00:04:06.810> vitamin

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
cravings and some sort of vitamin

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.710 
cravings and some sort of vitamin
deficiencies<00:04:07.709> do<00:04:07.890> play<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.160> role<00:04:08.280> there<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:09.540> if

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
deficiencies do play a role there and if

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.960 
deficiencies do play a role there and if
your<00:04:09.870> mental<00:04:10.110> health<00:04:10.440> isn't<00:04:10.709> good<00:04:11.130> then<00:04:11.790> your

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
your mental health isn't good then your

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.490 
your mental health isn't good then your
physical<00:04:12.420> health<00:04:12.510> can<00:04:12.780> suffer<00:04:13.079> in<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.320> long

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
physical health can suffer in the long

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.460 
physical health can suffer in the long
term

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
term

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.470 
term
and<00:04:14.590> your<00:04:15.070> survival<00:04:15.640> can<00:04:15.790> suffer<00:04:16.090> in<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.299> long

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
and your survival can suffer in the long

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.990 
and your survival can suffer in the long
term<00:04:16.750> so<00:04:17.049> this<00:04:17.590> very<00:04:17.890> much<00:04:18.160> becomes<00:04:18.610> an<00:04:18.820> issue

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
term so this very much becomes an issue

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.880 
term so this very much becomes an issue

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
when I think about it put it in that

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.780 
when I think about it put it in that
context<00:05:41.320> the<00:05:41.440> actual<00:05:41.740> act<00:05:41.979> of<00:05:42.130> killing<00:05:42.640> in
