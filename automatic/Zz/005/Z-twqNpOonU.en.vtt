00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
of that so it looks like that of course

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.490 
of that so it looks like that of course
this<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:09.989> tipping<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.649> can't<00:02:10.860> really<00:02:11.009> see

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
this is tipping so you can't really see

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.480 
this is tipping so you can't really see
what<00:02:13.500> I'm<00:02:13.620> doing<00:02:13.650> but<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.130> get<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.370> general

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
what I'm doing but you get the general

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.200 
what I'm doing but you get the general
idea

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:41.040 
forth to make these little cloud shapes
on<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.390> side<00:02:27.570> of<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.780> glass
