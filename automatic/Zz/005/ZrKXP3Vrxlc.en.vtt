 we will forgo two tablespoons of sugar 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.960
 common sugar because the demand is 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.220

 say once I'm taking a dough 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.860
 comes in to take it out, add it to 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.290
 little more milk because I make sure not to 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.170
 have no number 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.200
 then an egg spoon is agreed 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.510
 two tablespoons of sugar a cup of 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.319
 common flour with a column spoon 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.540
 and a cup of milk always lady 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.790
 it smells like that of henares or a little 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.790
 butter not spoonful of butter 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.269
 if you want for example to do the 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.890
 pancakes eyes or whatever you want to call 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.170
 with some particular flavor for example 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.370
 essence of vanilla power did not count 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.370
 the last ones with blueberries 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.599
 I finish sheets I put two tablespoons 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.000
 of shortening 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:21.250
 eggs two spoons of sugar one cup 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.980

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.650
 baking powder a cup of milk two 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.989
 tablespoons of butter mixes everything and 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.640
 let the dough rest in the refrigerator 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.769
 About half an hour 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.170
 Once you rest, you start doing your 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.489
 hot pan your pancakes to make and 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.670
 I start to react 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:43.049
 so we make a strap of so many 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.049
 skillet talentino 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.299
 of film and series for us 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.489
 but but the reflection is very rich and they are 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.480
 ideal for breakfast and to do it 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.480
 very fast and very even 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:08.700
 Mapping the male - notice that as the 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.350
 mass in the press that the pancake and the 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.300
 pan is hot 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.950
 I can hear a lesser evil and form 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.630
 with nothing I'll fight again and then 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.630
 starts to coagulate and I do not know if this one 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.790
 trained in summer goes to the brakes 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.470
 we build a turret at least 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.470
 has a clue 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.410
 the covers 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.860
 for me the ones cut around 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:41.050
 to cook today much more 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:43.240
 clear out there they will do it inwards 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.979
 look here side like this while they're 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.060
 cooking before you finish coagulating 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:51.759
 you put a couple of blueberries 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.080
 striped banana whatever you want the theme 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:57.180
 belongs to milk controls 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.000
 it's a good total stage so if you 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.980
 we put more be 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.270
 a good family option was the copera 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.900
 in the middle 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:11.500

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.880
 such principles where would we be the 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.070
 movements 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.990
 you do not have to wait you have to see the 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.450
 following coves when they start to 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.970
 approaching word and here the interior is 10 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.370
 It's expensive that loses brightness the dough wants 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.500
 say that they are already to turn 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.840
 then with a spatula I turn 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.580
 triquis that do not go over golden 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.180
