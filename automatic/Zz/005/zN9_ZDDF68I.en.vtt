00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
booster packs so I will open this up and

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.830 
booster packs so I will open this up and
get<00:00:32.250> everything<00:00:32.460> out<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.790> show<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.270> then

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.740 
packs so here's Reshiram and that is
from<00:01:34.740> plasma<00:01:35.220> freeze<00:01:35.840> there<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.170> cure<00:01:38.070> em<00:01:38.750> from

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
from plasma freeze there is cure em from

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.310 
from plasma freeze there is cure em from
noble<00:01:40.049> victories<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:41.119> then<00:01:42.119> Zekrom<00:01:42.840> from

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
noble victories and then Zekrom from

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.050 
noble victories and then Zekrom from
plasma<00:01:43.860> freeze<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> figurines

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
plasma freeze and then the figurines

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.219 
plasma freeze and then the figurines
there's<00:01:51.060> Zekrom<00:01:53.390> I'll<00:01:54.390> set<00:01:54.630> these<00:01:54.810> up<00:01:55.020> back

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
there's Zekrom I'll set these up back

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.510 
there's Zekrom I'll set these up back
here<00:01:55.500> hopefully<00:01:55.890> they<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.250> stand<00:01:56.930> here<00:01:57.930> is

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
here hopefully they can stand here is

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.560 
here hopefully they can stand here is
cure<00:01:59.520> em<00:02:01.939> like<00:02:02.939> so

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:14.250 

and<00:02:08.009> then<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.100> last<00:02:09.280> one<00:02:09.610> is<00:02:09.959> Reshiram<00:02:13.260> no

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
and then the last one is Reshiram no

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.140 
and then the last one is Reshiram no
it's<00:02:14.470> gonna<00:02:14.560> be<00:02:14.650> pretty<00:02:14.980> risky<00:02:15.490> to<00:02:15.640> stand<00:02:15.940> it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
it's gonna be pretty risky to stand it

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:28.590 
it's gonna be pretty risky to stand it
looks<00:02:16.330> like<00:02:26.130> look<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:27.489> don't<00:02:28.090> think<00:02:28.239> that<00:02:28.360> one's

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
looks like look I don't think that one's

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.449 
looks like look I don't think that one's
gonna<00:02:28.660> make<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.670> like<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:32.280> then<00:02:33.280> the

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
gonna make it like this and then the

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.060 
gonna make it like this and then the
four<00:02:33.790> booster<00:02:34.239> packs<00:02:34.450> in<00:02:34.720> here

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.580 

there<00:02:39.070> are<00:02:39.480> plasma<00:02:40.480> blast<00:02:41.550> boundaries<00:02:42.550> cross

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
there are plasma blast boundaries cross

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.780 
there are plasma blast boundaries cross
dragons<00:02:44.590> exalted<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.450> next<00:02:46.450> Destiny's<00:02:47.790> small

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
dragons exalted and next Destiny's small

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.000 
dragons exalted and next Destiny's small
sets<00:02:49.120> in<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.360> current<00:02:49.690> rotation<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.530> I'll

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
sets in the current rotation and I'll

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.699 
sets in the current rotation and I'll
open<00:02:51.340> oldest<00:02:52.180> newest<00:02:52.540> next<00:02:52.900> Destiny's<00:02:53.319> dragon

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
open oldest newest next Destiny's dragon

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.500 
open oldest newest next Destiny's dragon
this<00:02:53.800> exalted<00:02:54.160> boundaries<00:02:54.819> cross<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.420> then

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
this exalted boundaries cross and then

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.590 
this exalted boundaries cross and then
plasma<00:02:55.989> blast

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
plasma blast

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.110 
plasma blast
so<00:02:58.600> I'll<00:02:58.870> open<00:02:58.900> this<00:02:59.230> one<00:02:59.290> first<00:02:59.470> with<00:03:00.120> Mewtwo

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
so I'll open this one first with Mewtwo

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.990 
so I'll open this one first with Mewtwo
on<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.660> cover<00:03:04.590> at<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.800> one<00:03:05.950> at<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.250> time<00:03:06.489> you

like there's the team plasma card in the

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:49.409 
like there's the team plasma card in the
back<00:06:45.940> here<00:06:46.330> which<00:06:47.229> is<00:06:47.530> a<00:06:47.560> Volcarona<00:06:48.340> non<00:06:49.060> holo

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:52.350 
back here which is a Volcarona non holo
where<00:06:49.810> so<00:06:50.710> overall<00:06:51.220> definitely<00:06:51.910> below

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
where so overall definitely below

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.749 
where so overall definitely below
average<00:06:52.660> pulse<00:06:53.199> this<00:06:53.949> last<00:06:54.280> pack<00:06:54.550> was

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759 
average pulse this last pack was

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:56.430 
average pulse this last pack was
probably<00:06:55.030> my<00:06:55.180> best<00:06:55.360> pack<00:06:55.690> since<00:06:55.930> it<00:06:56.110> did<00:06:56.259> have

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 
probably my best pack since it did have

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.379 
probably my best pack since it did have
the<00:06:56.470> two<00:06:56.919> rare<00:06:57.160> cards<00:06:57.610> in<00:06:57.759> it<00:06:57.789> but<00:06:58.360> overall

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389 
the two rare cards in it but overall

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:01.409 
the two rare cards in it but overall
definitely<00:06:59.139> not<00:06:59.380> worth<00:06:59.740> the<00:07:00.000> 1998<00:07:01.000> that<00:07:01.210> I<00:07:01.270> had

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:01.419 
definitely not worth the 1998 that I had

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:04.439 
definitely not worth the 1998 that I had
to<00:07:01.479> pay<00:07:01.660> for<00:07:01.690> this<00:07:02.020> collection<00:07:02.979> box<00:07:03.190> but<00:07:04.150> who

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:04.449 
to pay for this collection box but who

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:05.850 
to pay for this collection box but who
knows<00:07:04.630> they<00:07:04.870> may<00:07:04.990> buy<00:07:05.169> another<00:07:05.410> one<00:07:05.620> of<00:07:05.740> these

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
knows they may buy another one of these

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.070 
knows they may buy another one of these
in<00:07:06.009> the<00:07:06.099> future<00:07:06.250> and<00:07:06.729> when<00:07:07.360> I<00:07:07.389> open<00:07:07.720> that<00:07:07.750> box

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 
in the future and when I open that box

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.050 
in the future and when I open that box
it'll<00:07:08.650> actually<00:07:08.800> give<00:07:09.130> me<00:07:09.250> some<00:07:09.490> ultra<00:07:09.910> rare

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060 
it'll actually give me some ultra rare

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.240 
it'll actually give me some ultra rare
