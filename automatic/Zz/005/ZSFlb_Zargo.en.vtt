I think bill heaven college is a great
place<00:00:01.920> to<00:00:02.070> learn<00:00:02.389> because<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:04.069> the<00:00:05.069> Bible<00:00:05.460> is

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:05.600 
place to learn because the the Bible is

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.849 
place to learn because the the Bible is
essential<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.629> everything<00:00:07.230> but<00:00:07.410> there's<00:00:07.799> a

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
essential to everything but there's a

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.850 
essential to everything but there's a
great<00:00:08.130> diversity<00:00:08.610> in<00:00:09.170> the<00:00:10.170> course<00:00:10.410> offerings

wonderful setting for studying the Bible

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.420 
wonderful setting for studying the Bible
because<00:01:15.390> we're<00:01:15.630> surrounded<00:01:15.930> by<00:01:16.310> people<00:01:17.310> in

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430

other departments and other disciplines

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.010 
other departments and other disciplines
who<00:01:19.860> also<00:01:20.070> believe<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.790> Bible<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.360> true

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
who also believe that the Bible is true

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.170 
who also believe that the Bible is true
and<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.130> as<00:01:23.310> though<00:01:23.340> we're<00:01:24.150> in

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and so it's not as though we're in

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.929 
and so it's not as though we're in
hostile<00:01:24.750> territory<00:01:25.130> at<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> same<00:01:26.460> time<00:01:26.520> when

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
hostile territory at the same time when

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.480 
hostile territory at the same time when
the<00:01:27.090> city<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:28.040> although<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.100> has<00:01:29.250> many

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the city that although it has many

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.969 
the city that although it has many
churches<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.180> not<00:01:30.590> ceded<00:01:31.590> its<00:01:31.680> already

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
churches is not ceded its already

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.950 
churches is not ceded its already
faithful<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.820> Christ<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.750> great

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.569 
opportunity for ministry some schools

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
