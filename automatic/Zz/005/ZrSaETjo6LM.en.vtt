00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.059
 percent 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.579
 ca 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.100
 sometimes comes out of the manager 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.890
 a replacement father 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.359
 b 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.560
 his calves are supposed to become happy cows 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.970
 Ludolf von Maltzahn keeps his dairy cows species-appropriate 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.870
 enough electricity 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.810
 And then probably Emstal who is important for the herd formation, he says 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.730
 Here the animals are over seven years old in conventional operated it 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.050
 only four 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.020
 I think our king is really good and so cool can be free in the stable 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.390
 Do not move on big slides 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.790
 Concrete surfaces erased straw lies 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.420
 on which one can move, that is, when animals drive each other 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.770
 they can dodge 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.210
 decorated 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.250
 Phil place and they are driven daily to the pasture 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.170
 and percentages of fresh grass 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.020
 while they spend time with other farmers in the stable all their lives 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.220
 here outlet 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.430
 and he grows his own food 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.430
 that too is different 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.930
 that is how agriculture has to operate 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.340
 within two to four 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.180
 the entire food supply does not welcome our own fields 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.230
 produce 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.250
 All in all, we wanted to reach the goal 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.470
 a circular economy a closed system around its reputation 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.630
 the circulation starts at four o'clock in the morning 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.370
 for Makarenko short and 200 cows 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.949
 Organic agriculture has its price 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:12.489
 8 liters less milk a day produces a smart oku over one 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.379
 conventional 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.379
 Unfortunately, it is likely to decline slightly 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.799
 Pursuers 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.829
 just looking at the performance 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.959
 furthermore 11 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.319
 she left as continued 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.170
 so if i get there then i will not understand that they are not on the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.170
 Less power 11 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.719
 The farm is located in a nature reserve 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:43.539
 Here, after the milking, the freestyle courses are given to their lodges 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.349
 the drivers deliver directly to the customer 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.349
 this saves the intermediate trade 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.719
 with the new device is the SCC's 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.089
 even schools and day-care centers are not 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:08.299
 it is now enough for the milk is twice as expensive as in the supermarket for the 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.299
 Kickers is he still sees the price value 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:13.729
 man 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:19.040
 Freedom from a superminister more communities St and because they are doorstep 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:20.519
 delivered to the front door 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.739
 because it is not very good for colder air 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.700
 the new dairy 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.290
 only with these million investments could all 80 jobs be secured at the farm 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.309
 become 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:35.660
 to your own product 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.409
 it includes cream cheese 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.409
 or Marta divider 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:46.839
 the general public 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.479
 more is possible 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.019
 in that he 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.989
 continue 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.009
 for quite a bit more 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:10.759
 the second 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:14.929
 because in dairy markets here in the farm shop are the dairy products 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:16.569
 Selling 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:19.729
 Overall, the farm makes 7 million euros in annual sales 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:25.889
 Ludolf von Maltzan because I had the success he 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.050
 as long as his freestyle are happy too
