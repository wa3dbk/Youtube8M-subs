triax weave fibreglass lamp and all that

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.940 
triax weave fibreglass lamp and all that
means<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.960> there's<00:00:40.170> three<00:00:40.410> different<00:00:40.590> layers

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
means is there's three different layers

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.950 
means is there's three different layers
of<00:00:41.219> fiberglass<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> construction<00:00:42.360> which

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
of fiberglass in the construction which

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.330 
of fiberglass in the construction which
just<00:00:43.140> keeps<00:00:43.350> us<00:00:43.500> no<00:00:43.620> more<00:00:43.739> torsionally<00:00:44.309> rigid

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
just keeps us no more torsionally rigid

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.130 
just keeps us no more torsionally rigid
so<00:00:45.059> when<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.719> edge<00:00:45.930> at<00:00:46.110> high

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
so when you have it up on edge at high

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.080 
so when you have it up on edge at high
speeds<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.739> stays<00:00:46.950> really<00:00:47.070> smooth<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.910> steady

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
speeds it stays really smooth and steady

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.450 
speeds it stays really smooth and steady
and<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> Lamar<00:00:49.800> mission<00:00:50.070> snowboard
