asparagus what I do is I'll just take

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.400 
asparagus what I do is I'll just take
and<00:01:39.250> break<00:01:39.550> one<00:01:39.820> find<00:01:40.570> out<00:01:40.720> where<00:01:40.840> breaks<00:01:41.110> and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
and break one find out where breaks and

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.620 
and break one find out where breaks and
that's<00:01:41.470> typically<00:01:42.060> where<00:01:43.060> it<00:01:43.119> starts<00:01:43.390> to<00:01:43.509> get

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
that's typically where it starts to get

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.020 
that's typically where it starts to get
woody<00:01:44.790> maybe<00:01:45.790> go<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.229> half-inch<00:01:47.229> beyond<00:01:47.619> that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030

cut all that off and then we'll cut this

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.920 
cut all that off and then we'll cut this
into<00:01:52.450> thirds

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
into thirds

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.020
