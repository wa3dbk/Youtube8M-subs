like<00:01:57.240> 16<00:01:57.630> percent<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.219> I'm<00:01:59.219> gonna<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.490> to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
like 16 percent but I'm gonna have to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.830 
like 16 percent but I'm gonna have to
figure<00:01:59.759> out<00:01:59.969> after<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.600> looks<00:02:00.719> like

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
figure out after this and it looks like

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.830 
figure out after this and it looks like
a<00:02:00.869> solid<00:02:01.310> 18<00:02:02.310> percent<00:02:02.610> from<00:02:02.729> there<00:02:02.939> I'm<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.540> I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
a solid 18 percent from there I'm just I

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.060 
a solid 18 percent from there I'm just I
don't<00:02:04.290> even<00:02:04.380> know<00:02:04.530> what<00:02:04.619> I'm<00:02:04.710> talking<00:02:05.009> about

but<00:02:05.399> I'm<00:02:05.430> gonna<00:02:05.909> get<00:02:06.119> out<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.270> there<00:02:06.390> cuz<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.659> can

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
but I'm gonna get out of there cuz I can

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.749 
but I'm gonna get out of there cuz I can
absolutely<00:02:06.960> wall<00:02:07.409> him<00:02:07.619> was<00:02:07.710> my<00:02:07.829> sylveon<00:02:08.310> or<00:02:08.550> so

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.520 
absolutely wall him was my sylveon or so
I<00:02:08.789> would<00:02:09.030> think<00:02:09.270> he<00:02:09.720> Oh<00:02:09.750> goes<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.289> hammer

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
I would think he Oh goes to the hammer

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.839 
I would think he Oh goes to the hammer
arm<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:10.950> I'm<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.099> okay<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.310> could<00:02:11.550> take<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
arm and I'm like okay I could take the

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.340 
arm and I'm like okay I could take the
hit

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
hit

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.310 
hit
well<00:02:12.470> but<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.400> does<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.520> lot<00:02:13.820> of<00:02:13.880> damage<00:02:14.320> like

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
well but it does a lot of damage like

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.050 
well but it does a lot of damage like
that<00:02:15.560> wasn't<00:02:15.680> even<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:16.010> crit<00:02:16.460> that<00:02:16.640> it's<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.820> lot

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
that wasn't even a crit that it's a lot

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.270 
that wasn't even a crit that it's a lot
of<00:02:17.090> damage<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.290> resist<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.740> too<00:02:19.040> it's<00:02:19.190> a

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
of damage and I resist that too it's a

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.180 
of damage and I resist that too it's a
fighting<00:02:19.520> move<00:02:19.790> but<00:02:20.680> just<00:02:21.680> goes<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.980> show<00:02:22.160> that

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
fighting move but just goes to show that

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.430 
fighting move but just goes to show that
theories<00:02:22.700> really<00:02:23.000> are<00:02:23.270> not<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.690> powerful<00:02:23.960> I

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
theories really are not that powerful I

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.140 
theories really are not that powerful I
mean<00:02:24.470> people<00:02:24.950> undermined<00:02:25.370> in<00:02:25.490> fear<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:25.940> look

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
mean people undermined in fear you look

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.000

at<00:02:26.240> that<00:02:26.390> damage<00:02:26.600> but<00:02:27.500> I'm<00:02:27.560> gonna<00:02:27.680> get<00:02:27.830> out<00:02:27.920> of

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
at that damage but I'm gonna get out of

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.170 
at that damage but I'm gonna get out of
there<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.220> not<00:02:28.340> take<00:02:28.520> another<00:02:28.730> one<00:02:28.850> come<00:02:29.000> up<00:02:29.030> to

maybe done good damaged and him knocking
me<00:05:20.540> out<00:05:20.570> then<00:05:20.840> I<00:05:20.900> come<00:05:21.050> up<00:05:21.170> to<00:05:21.260> sylveon<00:05:21.680> but

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
me out then I come up to sylveon but

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.760 
me out then I come up to sylveon but
Garchomp<00:05:22.970> does<00:05:23.540> not<00:05:23.720> rely<00:05:24.020> on<00:05:24.050> dragon<00:05:24.590> moves

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
Garchomp does not rely on dragon moves

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.310 
Garchomp does not rely on dragon moves
especially<00:05:25.010> mega<00:05:25.580> Garchomp<00:05:26.180> so<00:05:26.480> he<00:05:27.140> may

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
especially mega Garchomp so he may

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.470 
especially mega Garchomp so he may
evolve<00:05:27.650> right<00:05:28.070> in<00:05:28.190> my<00:05:28.280> face<00:05:28.580> as<00:05:28.880> he's<00:05:29.210> gonna<00:05:29.330> go

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
evolve right in my face as he's gonna go

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.240 
evolve right in my face as he's gonna go
to<00:05:29.540> the<00:05:29.630> Dragon<00:05:29.990> Claw<00:05:30.200> which<00:05:30.440> I<00:05:30.590> did<00:05:30.800> predict

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
to the Dragon Claw which I did predict

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.220 
to the Dragon Claw which I did predict
so<00:05:31.430> I<00:05:31.490> came<00:05:31.550> onto<00:05:31.880> my<00:05:32.090> sylveon<00:05:32.540> not<00:05:32.870> even<00:05:33.110> being

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
so I came onto my sylveon not even being

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.060 
so I came onto my sylveon not even being
affected<00:05:33.650> by<00:05:33.770> it

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
as he now goes for the EQ it's easy

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.660 
as he now goes for the EQ it's easy
gonna<00:05:36.350> be<00:05:36.440> able<00:05:36.500> to<00:05:36.650> destroy<00:05:36.980> off<00:05:37.130> my<00:05:37.280> Sylvia

a waterfall maybe doing more damage to
its<00:06:46.910> tab<00:06:47.120> but<00:06:47.449> that's<00:06:48.440> not<00:06:48.590> the<00:06:48.740> case<00:06:48.919> and<00:06:49.250> I'm

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
its tab but that's not the case and I'm

its tab but that's not the case and I'm
just<00:06:49.699> gonna<00:06:49.819> destroy<00:06:50.210> him<00:06:50.449> and<00:06:50.720> that<00:06:50.990> will<00:06:51.259> be

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.530 
just gonna destroy him and that will be

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.870

he played very well I have made some
mistakes<00:06:58.099> as<00:06:58.310> myself<00:06:58.520> as<00:06:58.940> I<00:06:59.000> very<00:06:59.599> preventable

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
mistakes as myself as I very preventable

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.249 
mistakes as myself as I very preventable
and<00:07:01.699> right<00:07:02.270> now<00:07:02.389> I<00:07:02.449> can't<00:07:02.750> even<00:07:02.840> think<00:07:03.110> the

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:03.259 
and right now I can't even think the

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:05.680 
and right now I can't even think the
department<00:07:03.620> can't<00:07:03.770> even<00:07:03.949> air<00:07:04.130> it<00:07:04.220> as<00:07:04.370> well<00:07:04.690> but

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690 
department can't even air it as well but

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.120 
department can't even air it as well but
I<00:07:05.720> know<00:07:05.810> the<00:07:05.870> reason<00:07:06.259> is<00:07:06.380> very<00:07:06.410> sloppy<00:07:06.830> and<00:07:06.979> I'm

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.130 
I know the reason is very sloppy and I'm

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.110 
I know the reason is very sloppy and I'm
probably<00:07:07.250> gonna<00:07:07.430> hate<00:07:07.669> it<00:07:07.699> but<00:07:07.849> if<00:07:07.970> you<00:07:08.030> guys
