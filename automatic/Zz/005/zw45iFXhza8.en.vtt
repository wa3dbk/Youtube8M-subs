00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.370
 good morning for everyone 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.210
 well here in this race we measure with 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.310
 tranquility 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.460
 we bring a good team 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.070
 to a young but very strong team 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.140
 we hope to see a day like today 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.450
 feeling 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:25.530
 four for four months that I do not have 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.350
 no career we hope you can 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.120
 find any what are the 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:35.360
 advantages of running here on the tour of 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.360
 san luis truth that is appreciated 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.910
 in January it's a race of these because 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.060
 I have a temperature that is 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:48.880
 spectacular the europe is a bit worse 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.880
 with the cold and then this helps us 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.650
 for 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.590
 is to get each one with his big 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.020
 objectives 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.990
 these are other goals that also 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.089
 they are good to enforce them for 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.880
 give a good show to people already 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.270
 that then what we are here gives us 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.640
 a great welcome 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.810
 from we are a comment tube 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.640
 why 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.409
 Argentina is a bit like Colombia 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.450
 so 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.800
 the races are very well organized 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.020
 everything is very good so I think that 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.900
 is the best way to start the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.290
 season after you hit us in 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.120
 Spain with your fall so that you are in 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.740
 this tour or to extend crowns or 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.150
 to test sensations indicate the tour 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.640
 of france and also the comparison of 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.810
 last year 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.350
 Well that's what the race will say 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.280
 I'm not wrong 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.460
 I come to start picking up the pace but 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:02:00.500
 If the opportunity is given, it could be 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:03.140
 dispute the latter for you this year 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.590
 here in san luis and the turn and the turn 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.920
 good if the truth after for 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.380
 start a few months have been quite 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.380
 hard for me because I obviously wanted to 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.569
 be in competition but well I think 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.420
 that right now everything is fine things 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.640
 they are very well physically 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.600
 I'm very good so I think that 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.330
 It seems like it's a bit early to start 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.800
 be fine but I think for the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.920
 races that follow 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.210
 I will be at my level a ball 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.790
 for neiro before the responsibility of the 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.120
 reference number one for the tour of 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.150
 France, you 're as calm as 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.090
 appears because the preventive of 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.000
 natural spaces the study seems that 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.330
 the thing does not go with you it looks very 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.990
 quiet we already know that it is like that but 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.180
 inside you are equal 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.740
 you can tell the questions how 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.740
 those start to get very nervous 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.060
 whether there is 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.440
 so the edition please 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.190
 place shai lens I know there are very rivals 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.190
 powerful 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.350
 I'm also sure of disabilities 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.120
 I know I have to prepare very well 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.120
 to reach that goal 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.480
 I do things the way I could 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.450
 I will surely be there in the fight of the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.670
 Tour de France 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.330
 and the first question is for nairo 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.760
 quintana if this the preparation that 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.720
 you had last year 3 that was 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:56.340
 important and it brought you luck for what 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.900
 was your success in Europe and then the 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.989
 second question also goes for 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.300
 betancourt since they are both 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.670
 Latin Americans if run on land in 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.280
 land of this continent means to 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.150
 you a motivation or does it mean something 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.150
 something special 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.740
 Of course it is that this race with a 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.740
 good level 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.460
 with 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.790
 and a high mood because it talks about 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.790
 won 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.300
 it served me as preparation to be able 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.240
 arrive 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.440
 previous italy as I said it and as 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.220
 It planned 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.409
 good last minute last year the 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.220
 true that the people that we always 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:45.880
 treats very well 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.390
 As I said it is so corny that we are from the 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.040
 same South Americans 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:55.410
 we felt at home if it is a 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.660
 very cute race very organized the 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.360
 people are very flirtatious with us 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:04.170
 then we are very comfortable still 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.470
 we have good heat then something that 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:10.690
 add and good 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.090
 while abel the tours are 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.190
 quite following but let's not say very 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.080
 very very hard then not 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.830
 to catch a little rhythm to be 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.730
 a little quiet and good we are 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.730
 doing very well here
