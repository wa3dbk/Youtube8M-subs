fine<00:00:17.609> chisel<00:00:18.770> okay<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.520> reason<00:00:20.789> we<00:00:20.910> like

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
fine chisel okay and the reason we like

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.609 
fine chisel okay and the reason we like
this<00:00:21.240> because<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.570> has<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> little<00:00:21.869> flexibility

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
this because it has a little flexibility

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.679 
this because it has a little flexibility
and<00:00:23.130> what<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.580> do<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.880> just<00:00:23.910> take<00:00:24.269> for
