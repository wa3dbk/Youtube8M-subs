 the decorated attached 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.500
 I now have only two limits 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.140
 among the disclosed 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.300
 the total of eight 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.630
 so I get more handball for handball 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.630
 to get 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.220
 the two additional ones 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.580
 The ricketts had been pretty miraculous 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.020

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:00.440
 together in the pot until the 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.740
 onion classic is onion now 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.160
 meanwhile it takes a few classical ones 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.960
 minutes 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.460
 that is as far as we can 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:14.140
 We will start with the remaining ingredients 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.140
 with the tomatoes 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.970
 and then look next 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.970
 all ingredients won until eight 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.510
 can also be spiced now 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.510
 become 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.720
 ingredients or spices are now up on 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.550

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:52.220
 with the remaining twelve briquettes 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.690
 cut and at about 15 to 20 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.690
 to cook for a few minutes 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.680
 that's all in my head right now 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.170
 heard in it except won 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.010
 I have the tomatoes for cooking 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.540
 something crushed and when I am with mine 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.800
 used to submit whole pieces 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.620
 just 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.650
 So now on top of it 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.890
 readiness and blanket and around 20 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.890
 minutes 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.880
 the crisis around the rest of now 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.460
 also as you really only need 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.939
 more quarter hour 20 minutes, the 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.860
 to give stage 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:37.189
 that's why the beans are so later than me 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.199
 at my course used around 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:42.629
 has treated beans from the break and 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.710
 they are already precooked and as the 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:49.010
 of course not anymore 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:52.960
 Cook for 22 minutes at the last round 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:57.880
 do not like the lid on it 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:00.669
 another quarter of an hour 20 maximum with the 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.580
 patch, there is no problem if you 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:09.430
 further the quality bands changed 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:13.050
 the use of lessing there 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.050
 it works great 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:22.490
 are nearing agreement 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:24.970
 see our free something is in the 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.970
