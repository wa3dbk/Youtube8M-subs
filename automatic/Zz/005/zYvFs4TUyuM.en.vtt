00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.179 
in the next couple days or maybe week or
two<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.159> mining<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.780> pretty<00:02:04.469> easy<00:02:04.590> odds

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
two and mining it's a pretty easy odds

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.520 
two and mining it's a pretty easy odds
up<00:02:05.430> i<00:02:05.640> do<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.060> pretty<00:02:06.270> casually<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.170> that

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
up i do that pretty casually so that

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.249 
up i do that pretty casually so that
shouldn't<00:02:07.680> be<00:02:07.829> too<00:02:07.979> bad<00:02:08.009> um<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.989> yeah

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
shouldn't be too bad um so yeah

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.490 
shouldn't be too bad um so yeah
hopefully<00:02:10.500> i'll<00:02:10.770> come<00:02:11.430> close<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:12.090> maxing<00:02:12.720> or

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500
