00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.690 

all<00:02:14.470> right<00:02:14.590> definitely<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.250> hardest<00:02:15.400> thing

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
all right definitely the hardest thing

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.700 
all right definitely the hardest thing
to<00:02:15.730> do<00:02:15.940> is<00:02:16.270> getting<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.960> bands<00:02:17.200> lined<00:02:17.530> up

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
to do is getting the bands lined up

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.180 
to do is getting the bands lined up
after<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:19.630> love<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.380> pouch<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.800> love<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.040> pouch

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
after I love the pouch I love the pouch

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.010 
after I love the pouch I love the pouch
and<00:02:21.430> usually<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.970> have<00:02:22.150> some<00:02:22.480> kind<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.720> frame

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
and usually I have some kind of frame

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.510 
and usually I have some kind of frame
because<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.380> frames<00:02:23.620> flat<00:02:23.950> or<00:02:24.130> something<00:02:24.370> but

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
because the frames flat or something but

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.970 
because the frames flat or something but
since<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:24.910> is<00:02:24.990> it's<00:02:25.990> round<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.500> load<00:02:26.830> the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
since this is it's round I load the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.470 
since this is it's round I load the
pouch<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.490> then<00:02:27.610> I'm<00:02:27.760> holding<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.210> and<00:02:28.360> I'm

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
pouch and then I'm holding it and I'm

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.890 
pouch and then I'm holding it and I'm
having<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:29.140> rotate<00:02:29.770> it<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:31.270> get<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.510> bands

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
having to rotate it to get the bands

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.720 
having to rotate it to get the bands
oriented<00:02:32.500> correctly<00:02:32.680> so<00:02:33.100> I<00:02:33.190> can<00:02:33.370> shoot<00:02:33.550> it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
oriented correctly so I can shoot it

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.730 
oriented correctly so I can shoot it
it's<00:02:34.300> funny<00:02:34.510> but<00:02:34.960> super<00:02:35.710> accurate<00:02:35.830> yep<00:02:36.310> but<00:02:36.490> I

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
it's funny but super accurate yep but I

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.870 
it's funny but super accurate yep but I
didn't<00:02:38.740> have<00:02:38.830> any<00:02:38.980> return<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.400> centers<00:02:39.700> and

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
didn't have any return to centers and

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.750 
didn't have any return to centers and
that's<00:02:40.000> was<00:02:40.210> the<00:02:40.510> main<00:02:40.740> worry<00:02:41.740> for<00:02:42.430> most<00:02:42.640> the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
that's was the main worry for most the

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.640 
that's was the main worry for most the
members<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.209> I<00:02:43.390> worry<00:02:43.959> about<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.260> too<00:02:44.470> but

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
members so I worry about that too but

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.560 
members so I worry about that too but
that's<00:02:45.490> what<00:02:45.610> I'm<00:02:45.700> shooting<00:02:45.880> tiny<00:02:46.240> babies

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
that's what I'm shooting tiny babies

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.780 
that's what I'm shooting tiny babies
instead<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:47.050> big<00:02:47.530> balls<00:02:47.709> so<00:02:48.190> thanks<00:02:48.700> for

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
instead of big balls so thanks for

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.090
