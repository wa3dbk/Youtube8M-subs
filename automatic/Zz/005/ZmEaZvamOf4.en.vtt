we refuse to call ourselves a political

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.000 
we refuse to call ourselves a political
party<00:00:30.550> because<00:00:31.390> parties<00:00:31.869> have<00:00:32.140> nothing<00:00:32.680> to<00:00:32.829> do

the environment yes something that the

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.360 
the environment yes something that the
Conservatives<00:00:44.379> and<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.620> Liberals<00:00:45.010> don't

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
Conservatives and the Liberals don't

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.209 
Conservatives and the Liberals don't
understand<00:00:46.059> is<00:00:46.390> that<00:00:46.690> we<00:00:47.170> actually<00:00:47.379> live<00:00:47.890> in

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
understand is that we actually live in

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.270 
understand is that we actually live in
the<00:00:48.579> environment<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:50.079> it's<00:00:50.230> pretty<00:00:50.559> important

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
the environment so it's pretty important

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.899 
the environment so it's pretty important
if<00:00:52.030> elected<00:00:52.989> my<00:00:53.199> party<00:00:53.680> will<00:00:53.890> fix<00:00:54.280> the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.820 

I'm<00:01:01.940> not<00:01:02.300> sure<00:01:02.720> what<00:01:03.200> that<00:01:04.059> means<00:01:05.680> but<00:01:06.680> I'm

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
I'm not sure what that means but I'm

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.290 
I'm not sure what that means but I'm
pretty<00:01:07.100> sure<00:01:07.250> it<00:01:07.520> has<00:01:07.580> something<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.090> do<00:01:08.270> with

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
pretty sure it has something to do with

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.160 
pretty sure it has something to do with
the<00:01:08.510> trains

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
the trains

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.840 
the trains
and<00:01:09.350> I<00:01:10.160> like<00:01:10.400> trains<00:01:10.820> I<00:01:12.100> believe<00:01:13.100> that<00:01:13.280> taxes

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
and I like trains I believe that taxes

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.540 
and I like trains I believe that taxes
should<00:01:14.090> not<00:01:14.300> exist<00:01:14.750> as<00:01:15.110> a<00:01:15.619> matter<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:15.979> fact<00:01:16.340> I

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
should not exist as a matter of fact I

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.300 
should not exist as a matter of fact I
would<00:01:16.760> like<00:01:16.790> to<00:01:17.060> impose<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.479> reverse<00:01:18.110> tax<00:01:18.530> of<00:01:18.860> 5%

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
would like to impose a reverse tax of 5%

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.290 
would like to impose a reverse tax of 5%
on<00:01:20.119> all<00:01:20.390> purchases<00:01:20.720> if<00:01:21.350> something<00:01:22.340> is<00:01:22.430> $0.99

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
on all purchases if something is $0.99

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.920 
on all purchases if something is $0.99
you<00:01:23.810> impose<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.200> reverse<00:01:24.619> tax<00:01:24.950> of<00:01:25.220> 5%<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:26.300> that

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
you impose a reverse tax of 5% and that

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.380 
you impose a reverse tax of 5% and that
thing<00:01:27.229> becomes<00:01:28.990> less<00:01:29.990> expensive<00:01:31.090> that's<00:01:32.090> what

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
thing becomes less expensive that's what

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.980 
thing becomes less expensive that's what
I<00:01:32.420> do<00:01:32.539> about<00:01:32.810> taxes<00:01:33.530> I'm<00:01:33.830> not<00:01:34.430> sure<00:01:34.850> what<00:01:35.330> taxes

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
I do about taxes I'm not sure what taxes

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.010 
I do about taxes I'm not sure what taxes
are<00:01:36.110> used<00:01:36.560> for<00:01:37.070> it<00:01:37.220> I<00:01:37.720> pretty<00:01:38.720> much<00:01:39.729> think<00:01:40.729> that

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
are used for it I pretty much think that

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.770 
are used for it I pretty much think that
Canada<00:01:42.020> should<00:01:42.170> invest<00:01:42.830> in<00:01:43.100> wrestling<00:01:43.940> it's

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
Canada should invest in wrestling it's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.550 
Canada should invest in wrestling it's
really<00:01:45.440> popular<00:01:45.680> in<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.190> United<00:01:46.520> States<00:01:47.560> if

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
really popular in the United States if

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.820 
really popular in the United States if
elected<00:01:49.190> I<00:01:49.460> will<00:01:49.820> make<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.450> work<00:01:50.660> week<00:01:50.960> two

I'm<00:02:01.830> pretty<00:02:02.430> sure<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:03.270> elected<00:02:03.660> I<00:02:04.170> won't

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.029 
I'm pretty sure that if elected I won't
go<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.490> war<00:02:05.790> with<00:02:06.150> Taiwan<00:02:06.830> I'm<00:02:08.509> pretty<00:02:09.509> sure<00:02:10.039> if

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
go to war with Taiwan I'm pretty sure if

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.510 
go to war with Taiwan I'm pretty sure if
elected<00:02:11.820> our<00:02:12.350> military<00:02:13.350> will<00:02:13.650> be<00:02:13.800> stronger

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
elected our military will be stronger

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.250 
elected our military will be stronger
than<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:14.820> of<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.270> United<00:02:15.690> States<00:02:18.260> not

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
than that of the United States not

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.750 
than that of the United States not
literally

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.210 

I'm<00:02:23.599> pretty<00:02:23.959> sure<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.260> unemployment<00:02:25.069> is<00:02:25.189> a

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
I'm pretty sure that unemployment is a

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.320 
I'm pretty sure that unemployment is a
bad<00:02:25.610> thing

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
bad thing

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.440 
bad thing
so<00:02:26.900> if<00:02:27.079> elected<00:02:27.650> my<00:02:28.400> government<00:02:28.970> will<00:02:29.180> pass<00:02:29.420> a

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
so if elected my government will pass a

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.479 
so if elected my government will pass a
law<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:30.049> says<00:02:30.110> if<00:02:30.439> you<00:02:30.530> lose<00:02:30.799> your<00:02:31.010> job<00:02:31.040> you

law that says if you lose your job you

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.110 
law that says if you lose your job you
have<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.849> get<00:02:31.970> another<00:02:32.209> one<00:02:33.790> well<00:02:34.790> unless

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
have to get another one well unless

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.940 
have to get another one well unless
you're<00:02:35.950> retarded<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.360> midget<00:02:38.360> or<00:02:38.720> an<00:02:38.930> Eskimo<00:02:39.500> in

you're retarded a midget or an Eskimo in

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.759 
you're retarded a midget or an Eskimo in
that<00:02:40.879> case<00:02:41.239> you<00:02:41.480> should<00:02:41.510> probably<00:02:42.019> move<00:02:42.530> in

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
that case you should probably move in

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.680 
that case you should probably move in
with<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:42.980> family<00:02:43.310> member

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690

very<00:03:19.800> important<00:03:20.600> kids<00:03:21.600> should<00:03:22.020> read<00:03:22.260> books

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
very important kids should read books

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.460 
very important kids should read books
instead<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.760> shooting<00:03:24.150> guns<00:03:24.480> at<00:03:24.750> each<00:03:24.900> other<00:03:25.170> I

instead of shooting guns at each other I
don't<00:03:25.860> think<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:27.150> there<00:03:27.360> should<00:03:27.570> be

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
don't think that there should be
