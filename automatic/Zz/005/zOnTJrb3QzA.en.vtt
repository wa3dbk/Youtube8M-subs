what's going on and to engage with them

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.269 
what's going on and to engage with them
you<00:00:15.570> get<00:00:15.839> two<00:00:16.170> different<00:00:16.560> versions<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.160> each

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
you get two different versions of each

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.500 
you get two different versions of each
gene<00:00:17.550> one<00:00:17.730> minimum<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.660> jack<00:00:23.119> it's<00:00:24.119> super

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
gene one minimum you jack it's super

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.810 
gene one minimum you jack it's super
taster<00:00:24.930> gene<00:00:25.109> from<00:00:25.350> both<00:00:25.410> pair<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.460> makes<00:00:26.670> it

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
taster gene from both pair that makes it

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.300 
taster gene from both pair that makes it
taste<00:00:27.000> really<00:00:27.090> highly<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:28.260> have<00:00:28.470> thousands<00:00:29.250> of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
taste really highly we have thousands of

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.890 
taste really highly we have thousands of
people<00:00:29.640> who<00:00:29.820> come<00:00:30.000> into<00:00:30.150> at<00:00:30.330> Bristol<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
people who come into at Bristol and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.860 
people who come into at Bristol and
every<00:00:31.859> single<00:00:32.040> one<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.550> different<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.510> every

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
every single one is different so every

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.330 
every single one is different so every
day<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.020> different<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.649> really<00:00:35.100> really

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
day is different it's really really

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.119 
day is different it's really really
varied<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.090> really<00:00:36.360> love<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.129> it's

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
varied and I really love that and it's

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.639 
varied and I really love that and it's
such<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> great<00:00:38.520> place<00:00:39.059> because<00:00:39.570> people<00:00:40.469> learn

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
such a great place because people learn

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.920 
such a great place because people learn
in<00:00:40.829> such<00:00:41.040> different<00:00:41.309> ways<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.030> really

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
in such different ways and really

in such different ways and really
getting<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.230> engage<00:00:43.530> with<00:00:43.559> things<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.340> a

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
getting to engage with things and have a

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.740 
getting to engage with things and have a
go<00:00:44.579> at<00:00:44.610> stuff<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.210> really<00:00:45.329> see<00:00:45.570> what's

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750

about what's going on I think that's
really<00:00:49.379> important<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.250> helping<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.670> learn

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
really important in helping to learn

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.569 
really important in helping to learn
science<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.690> also<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.649> helping<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> enjoy

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
science and also in helping to enjoy

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.069 
science and also in helping to enjoy
science<00:00:53.940> because<00:00:54.420> science<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.780> be<00:00:54.809> really

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
science because science can be really

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.500 
science because science can be really
fun<00:00:55.260> ting<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.680> really<00:00:56.610> love<00:00:56.760> presenting<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
fun ting I really love presenting the

shows both the live site shows that we

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.549 
shows both the live site shows that we
do<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.090> studio<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.660> planetarium<00:01:01.320> shows

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
do in the studio and planetarium shows

of it this is like something my favorite

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.499 
of it this is like something my favorite
exhibits<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.460> at<00:01:14.549> Bristol<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.000> probably

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
exhibits here in at Bristol is probably

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.590 
exhibits here in at Bristol is probably
icy<00:01:16.140> bodies<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:16.950> some<00:01:17.280> dry<00:01:17.580> ice<00:01:17.610> which<00:01:18.570> is

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
icy bodies we have some dry ice which is

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.140 
icy bodies we have some dry ice which is
frozen<00:01:18.990> carbon<00:01:19.200> dioxide<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:20.310> minus<00:01:20.700> 78

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
frozen carbon dioxide it's minus 78

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.450 
frozen carbon dioxide it's minus 78
degrees<00:01:21.630> centigrade<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.040> keep<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.400> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
degrees centigrade so we keep it in a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.420 
degrees centigrade so we keep it in a
kind<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.700> special<00:01:24.210> thermals<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.159> it<00:01:26.159> comes

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
kind of special thermals and it comes

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.190 
kind of special thermals and it comes
out<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> little<00:01:27.030> conveyor<00:01:27.360> belt<00:01:27.570> into<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
out on a little conveyor belt into a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.859 
out on a little conveyor belt into a
pool<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.770> water<00:01:29.210> now<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> water<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.570> not<00:01:30.689> very

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
pool of water now the water is not very

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.780 
pool of water now the water is not very
hot<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:31.619> about<00:01:31.710> room<00:01:31.979> temperature<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
hot but it's about room temperature and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.080 
hot but it's about room temperature and
that's<00:01:33.060> much<00:01:33.390> hotter<00:01:33.720> than<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.200> dry<00:01:34.470> ice<00:01:34.500> is

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
that's much hotter than the dry ice is

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.060 
that's much hotter than the dry ice is
so<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.420> starts<00:01:37.049> telling<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.380> dry<00:01:37.530> ice<00:01:37.560> back

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
so it starts telling the dry ice back

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.120 
so it starts telling the dry ice back
into<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> gas<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.659> dry<00:01:39.840> ice<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.140> solid<00:01:40.320> this

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
into a gas the dry ice is solid this

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.700 
into a gas the dry ice is solid this
it's<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.430> cold<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.600> then<00:01:42.720> as<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.960> warms<00:01:43.110> up<00:01:43.350> its

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
it's so cold but then as it warms up its

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.100 
it's so cold but then as it warms up its
Sublime's<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:45.000> call<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.240> subliming<00:01:45.899> when<00:01:46.020> it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
Sublime's we call it subliming when it

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.539 
Sublime's we call it subliming when it
turns<00:01:46.350> straight<00:01:46.649> from<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.890> solid<00:01:47.040> into<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> gas

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
turns straight from a solid into a gas

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.789 
turns straight from a solid into a gas
without<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.329> through<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.630> liquid<00:01:48.930> phase<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
without going through a liquid phase and

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.859 
without going through a liquid phase and
this<00:01:50.159> gives<00:01:50.340> some<00:01:50.549> really<00:01:50.850> cool<00:01:51.060> effects

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
this gives some really cool effects

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.590 
this gives some really cool effects
because<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.979> carbon<00:01:53.670> dioxide<00:01:54.030> gas<00:01:54.240> coming

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
because that carbon dioxide gas coming

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.749 
because that carbon dioxide gas coming
off<00:01:54.810> our<00:01:55.020> dry<00:01:55.229> ice<00:01:55.409> kind<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.979> pushes<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.520> around

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
off our dry ice kind of pushes it around

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.480 
off our dry ice kind of pushes it around
little<00:01:57.119> Jets<00:01:57.390> come<00:01:57.719> off<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.860> see<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
little Jets come off you can see the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.550 
little Jets come off you can see the
water<00:01:59.759> vapor<00:02:00.149> condensing<00:02:00.960> around<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.409> as<00:02:01.530> well

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
water vapor condensing around it as well

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.050 
water vapor condensing around it as well
which<00:02:01.950> gives<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.310> kind<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.610> beautiful

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
which gives you this kind of beautiful

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.010 
which gives you this kind of beautiful
foggy<00:02:03.540> mist<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.369> really<00:02:05.369> love<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.610> because<00:02:06.030> well

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
foggy mist I really love it because well

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.350 
foggy mist I really love it because well
start<00:02:07.469> with<00:02:07.530> it's<00:02:07.710> really<00:02:07.950> pretty<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.520> also

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
start with it's really pretty and also

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.910 
start with it's really pretty and also
there's<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:09.780> much<00:02:09.929> science<00:02:10.349> going<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.739> there

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
there's so much science going on there

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.170 
there's so much science going on there
and<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.099> can<00:02:11.250> talk<00:02:11.400> about<00:02:11.550> all<00:02:11.790> sorts<00:02:11.970> of

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
and you can talk about all sorts of

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
and you can talk about all sorts of
different<00:02:12.360> things<00:02:12.690> with<00:02:12.930> you

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
different things with you

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.830 
different things with you
but<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:13.709> also<00:02:13.739> love<00:02:14.430> like<00:02:15.209> how<00:02:15.330> do<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.540> opposite

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
but I also love like how do the opposite

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.570 
but I also love like how do the opposite
of<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.470> not<00:02:16.560> really<00:02:17.069> talking<00:02:17.340> about<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
of that is not really talking about the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.520 
of that is not really talking about the
science<00:02:17.849> at<00:02:17.970> all<00:02:18.150> it's<00:02:18.540> kind<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.870> kids<00:02:19.140> using

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
science at all it's kind of kids using

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.250 
science at all it's kind of kids using
their<00:02:19.800> imaginations<00:02:20.870> because<00:02:21.870> we<00:02:22.019> took<00:02:22.200> a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
their imaginations because we took a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.110 
their imaginations because we took a
look<00:02:22.410> at<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.950> on<00:02:23.040> our<00:02:23.190> explanation<00:02:23.970> we

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
look at this and on our explanation we

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.610 
look at this and on our explanation we
sort<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.390> said<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.810> looks<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.230> lot<00:02:25.440> like

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
sort of said that it looks a lot like

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.770 
sort of said that it looks a lot like
comments<00:02:26.220> which<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.209> really<00:02:27.629> relevant

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
comments which is really relevant

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.020 
comments which is really relevant
because<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.349> do<00:02:28.470> get<00:02:28.650> dry<00:02:28.860> ice<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.340> water<00:02:29.760> ice

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
because you do get dry ice and water ice

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.520 
because you do get dry ice and water ice
in<00:02:30.239> comets<00:02:30.599> so<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.840> get<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.080> same<00:02:31.200> kind<00:02:31.260> of

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
in comets so you get the same kind of

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.250 
in comets so you get the same kind of
effect<00:02:31.830> when<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.660> sublime<00:02:33.660> when<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.140> gets

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
effect when the sublime when it gets

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.309 
effect when the sublime when it gets
close<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.709> star<00:02:34.940> but<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.810> can<00:02:36.930> also<00:02:37.080> use

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
close to a star but you can also use

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.170 
close to a star but you can also use
your<00:02:37.349> imagination<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.400> some<00:02:38.760> kids<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.060> said

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
your imagination and some kids have said

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.270 
your imagination and some kids have said
they<00:02:39.269> look<00:02:39.420> like<00:02:39.510> speedboats<00:02:40.200> some<00:02:40.980> kids<00:02:41.160> have

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
they look like speedboats some kids have

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.770 
they look like speedboats some kids have
said<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.549> they<00:02:41.670> look<00:02:41.819> like<00:02:42.000> they're<00:02:42.540> kind<00:02:42.660> of

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
said that they look like they're kind of

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.360 
said that they look like they're kind of
attacking<00:02:43.110> each<00:02:43.379> other<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.860> grabbing<00:02:44.160> on<00:02:44.280> to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
attacking each other and grabbing on to

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.370 
attacking each other and grabbing on to
each<00:02:44.549> other<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.150> can<00:02:45.810> kind<00:02:45.989> of<00:02:46.110> stand

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
each other and you can kind of stand

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.050 
each other and you can kind of stand
here<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.650> look<00:02:46.739> at<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:46.950> for<00:02:47.370> quite<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.970> long

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
here and look at it for quite a long

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:57.830 
here and look at it for quite a long
time<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.660> really<00:02:49.080> enjoy<00:02:49.590> it

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.900 

you
