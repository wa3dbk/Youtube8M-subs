there it's not coming out on the trail
the<00:00:54.270> only<00:00:54.420> bad<00:00:54.660> thing<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:55.110> when<00:00:55.770> I'm<00:00:55.860> wearing

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
the only bad thing is when I'm wearing

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.209 
the only bad thing is when I'm wearing
this<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.629> jacket<00:00:58.109> tends<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.590> ride<00:00:58.800> above

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
this the the jacket tends to ride above

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.150 
this the the jacket tends to ride above
it<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.539> here<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.410> Oklahoma<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:02.010> not<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
it and so here in Oklahoma it's not a

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.390 
it and so here in Oklahoma it's not a
big<00:01:02.370> deal<00:01:02.899> to<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> heavy<00:01:04.739> weapon<00:01:05.159> showing

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
big deal to have a heavy weapon showing

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.490 
big deal to have a heavy weapon showing
because<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:05.850> open<00:01:06.119> carry<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.170> prefer

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
because we have open carry but I prefer

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.960 
because we have open carry but I prefer
