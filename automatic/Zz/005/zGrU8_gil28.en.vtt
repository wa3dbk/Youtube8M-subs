00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.090

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.979
 I have made a portion here now 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.200
 Of course you can also get the recipe 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.360
 duplicate and then three 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.520

 cheap and it holds about four 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.500
 weeks in the fridge so tried the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.329
 a little bit of pasta water 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.480
 you can also give them 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.090
 olive oil quantity vary so 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.750
 do not have to 100% of my kritzer 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.340
 divide 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.560
 depending on how you feel about it 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.690
 Some people also like to taste them under one 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.490
 pesto genovese piece of butter me 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.530
 Hope we did not do that for me 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.920
 always or directly in minutes with 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.300
 rank 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.090

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.480

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.510
 soon your card 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.970
 Let's start with roasted pine nuts 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.220
 just take 30 grams and equip them 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.080
 without having fat in a pan to the 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.360
 enough own fat caution but the 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.850
 then quickly burn one 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.090
 garlic clove just in a mix 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.610
 container 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.990
 125 milliliters extra virgin olive oil 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.390
 Add and so a bowl full 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.730
 basil leaves I always cut 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.970
 directly without these thick stems off so 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.180
 you can just do that from yours 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.100
 crop cutting cuts across 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.380
 the leaf shoulders from then change 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.940
 basil simply faster after many 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.370
 people have just now in the summer 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.170
 her own basil outside on the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.990
 balcony stand like me so I have 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.010
 always enough basil in the house and there 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.280
 I just thought we do it 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.780
 pesto alla genovese today I know 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.540
 that it probably is not that 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.370
 Original pesto is but I hope 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.500
 Anyway, that's the small recipe 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.360
 do you like her so you see everything you do 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.420
 takes a lot more is not the 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.930
 now everything just to mud like you 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.209
 so beautiful in Upper Franconia says yes 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.610
 salt please do not forget that is 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.290
 in some recipes not with me 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.660
 think it is very important for example 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.340
 a pinch of salt is with us because it is 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.290
 just do it again the taste right 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.110
 makes you pretty strong and three big ones 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.060
 tablespoon of freshly grated parmesan 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.640
 Of course, you can do the parmesan in the 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.489
 Buy a piece at the cheese counter 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.920
 your trust or just then 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.709
 rub yourself with the tupperware times 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.720

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.510
 interest to have a look at that 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.890
 I have the grated parmesan 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.189
 bought, I must confess because I 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.110
 just did not have time and then do it 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.560
 you all pretty together you see that yes 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.879
 here 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.860
 I have such a very old one 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.200
 wandmixer is a bit difficult of the 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.689
 already over ten years old but does his 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.769
 work fairly reliable and why should 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.319
 I buy something new now 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.409
 works so wonderful, too 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.959
 It takes about 23 minutes to get to 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.510
 everything is well mixed and one 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.159
 creamy consistency has you can 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.099
 Of course, according to your wishes 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:12.310
 change the recipe gives walnuts 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:15.340
 there are, for example, inlaid in oil 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.049
 dried tomatoes to do all this 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.430
 you also take a tomato 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.380
 I want to do pesto myself 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.419
 I know how it tastes 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.210
 really curious on but today this time 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.560
 original so you can see if you 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.930
 Anyhow what works but I have to say 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.539
 That's enough for a 300 milliliter glass 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.020
 like this one as I said for 69 cents 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:37.270
 few cent in a euro shop you see 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.370
 Her consistency is wonderfully creamy 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.020
 and of course you can also go to meat 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.060
 or eat well with grilled food 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.710
 we will try it ourselves today 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.849
 to noodle and my time is already 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.979

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.780
