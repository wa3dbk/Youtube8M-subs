00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 Water treatment and prevention of water conveyance myocardial infarction well 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:11.670
 To issue the surgical treatment bypass flood 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.849
 Talk with Mr. Tomoyuki Yamada of Shiga Prefectural Adult Disease Center 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.090
 We thank you thank you Well first 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.039
 Please tell me about the Cabinet vein bypass 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.640
 Yes 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:26.329
 Site was inhabited by of changing the the bypass is to make a left to the new road as it is 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.599
 is 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:35.430
 In the catheter treatment, the occlusion site is extended and cured 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:42.330
 In bypass surgery , we jump over both sides and make a new blood vessel 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.050
 Coronary artery bypass grafting uses the internal thoracic artery near my veins and heart as new blood vessels 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.960
 The 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.960
 Supply blood to the oxygen-deficient myocardium 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.700
 I tend to feel scary when it comes to surgery 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:01.220
 What about the danger of surgery? 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:06.170
 This is a model of that heart , but the coronary artery running on the surface of this heart is 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:08.990
 The heart is beating, so it's time to connect cardiovascular 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.970
 I can not sew by all means 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.620
 So, conventionally, stop the heart once with a machine called artificial heart-lung machine 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.690
 It is not 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:24.680
 It is possible to break down and recently a machine called this stabilizer has been developed 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:28.580
 Now fix it to the side of the coronary artery in the heart 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.610
 This heart will not move, but does not move the coronary artery 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.750
 It will be able to say 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.820
 Heart surgery 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:42.610
 It is an operation just to connect it like a vascular shoe 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:46.200
 Thanks to that, the danger of playing shoes is also reduced to around 1% 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:50.460
 99% would be fine 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.400
 Then what kind of case is it to be applied to the Viva suit ? 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.120
 Yes 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.410
 There are three major coronary arteries 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.650
 Migito Left Left is divided double-byte in the capital times against baby 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:06.520
 And depending on the number of lesions to 4 seconds 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:13.269
 It becomes severe with west lesion three branch lesions 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:15.220
 In the case of the main trunk lesion of the left coronary artery, even if one lesion, myocardial ischemia for two regions 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:22.520
 It is a prize to be generated 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:27.830
 Generally, severe cases that went to the left main coronary artery lesions and Mr. Seed Garden will be the subject of surgery 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.490
 I think that there is also a case that you get lost in catheter treatment and bypass treatment, but there are some indicators 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.440
 Is not it 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:39.920
 Yes There is a measure of coronary artery severity called trust score 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:42.510
 The direction of Europe lesions many, the higher the score the more becomes complicated lesions based on it 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.370
 Bamboo compares the catheter therapy and bypass surgery 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:53.459
 The research is in progress The result of 3 years after the fact is released song 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:59.310
 Postoperative myocardial infarction and death in severe cases with high score of 33 or more 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:02.500
 Adverse events such as re-operation As a matter of fact, catheter treatment is 34.1% 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.650
 Bypass surgery is 19.5% 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.710
 Therefore towards the bypass is low 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:16.380
 Surgery is advanced to the one with higher syntax score 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:21.569
 This will be a European guideline The left is the type of lesion against it 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:25.109
 It shows what is either bypass catheter treatment of advanced 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:30.420
 Yellow green is advanced may be carried out 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:36.180
 Although bypass surgery in the sense that it is better not to red has been recommended in most of the examples 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:41.700
 Catheterism, as red is two places with only been recommended for simple lesions 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:47.069
 It has been shown that bypass surgery is applicable for complex lesions 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.540
 The amount of each hertz has progressed and there are still many cases where bypass surgery is more appropriate 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.989
 It means 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.019
 Is there any limitation in life after surgery 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:04:01.590
 You won't get lost just because you put on your shoes 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:07.230
 Surgery can be done more and blood flow to the heart is restored so it will be a myocardial infarction 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.530
 There are people who can play golf with less risk and can live with peace of mind 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.890
 If you can marathon 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.890
 Will be
