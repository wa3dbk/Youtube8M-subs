00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
sure if you can see the detail but what

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.730

you<00:01:10.170> do<00:01:10.320> get<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> picture<00:01:11.729> up<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:12.090> app<00:01:12.210> and

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
you do get the picture up for app and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.740 
you do get the picture up for app and
then<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:15.390> can't<00:01:15.689> adjust<00:01:15.990> put<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.159> one<00:01:17.340> side

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
then you can't adjust put it on one side

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.480 
then you can't adjust put it on one side
and<00:01:18.750> push<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.350> down<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.070> will<00:01:20.280> not

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
and push it down and this will not

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.249 
and push it down and this will not
affect<00:01:20.520> your<00:01:21.000> thumb<00:01:21.509> sticks<00:01:21.840> at<00:01:22.020> all<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.580> then

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
affect your thumb sticks at all and then

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.789 
affect your thumb sticks at all and then
then<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.950> get<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:27.500> you<00:01:28.500> do<00:01:28.619> that

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
then you get it on like that you do that

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.390 
then you get it on like that you do that
with<00:01:28.920> both<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.280> left<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.000> right<00:01:31.400> thumb

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
with both the left and the right thumb

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.719 
with both the left and the right thumb
sticks<00:01:33.259> with<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> analog<00:01:34.680> sticks<00:01:35.070> haven't

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
sticks with the analog sticks haven't

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.539 
sticks with the analog sticks haven't
tried<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.979> but<00:01:37.979> I'm<00:01:38.159> guessing<00:01:38.340> you

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
tried on the but I'm guessing you

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:50.870 
tried on the but I'm guessing you
do<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> same<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:43.970> yeah<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.450> same

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.700 

it's<00:01:51.880> just<00:01:52.150> a<00:01:52.240> bit<00:01:52.360> stuck<00:01:52.960> because<00:01:53.290> I<00:01:53.500> don't

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
it's just a bit stuck because I don't

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.380 
it's just a bit stuck because I don't
put<00:01:53.890> it<00:01:53.920> on<00:01:54.070> right<00:01:54.340> but<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:55.630> get<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.840> idea<00:01:55.960> um

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
put it on right but you get the idea um

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.090 
put it on right but you get the idea um
so<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:58.450> just<00:01:58.600> kind<00:01:58.870> of<00:01:59.020> just<00:01:59.230> like<00:01:59.380> get<00:01:59.980> the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
so you just kind of just like get the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.410 
so you just kind of just like get the
picture<00:02:00.550> up<00:02:00.820> right<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.420> then<00:02:01.660> you<00:02:01.840> kind<00:02:02.230> of

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
picture up right and then you kind of

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:14.760 
picture up right and then you kind of
just<00:02:04.420> clip<00:02:05.080> it<00:02:05.200> on<00:02:08.520> there<00:02:09.520> we<00:02:09.610> go<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:14.680> was
