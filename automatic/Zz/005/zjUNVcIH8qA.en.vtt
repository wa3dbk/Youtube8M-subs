over the time of sitting will end up

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.899 
over the time of sitting will end up
gumming<00:00:53.900> up<00:00:53.900> end<00:00:54.350> up<00:00:54.799> having<00:00:55.400> corrosion

issues<00:00:56.059> with<00:00:56.629> with<00:00:57.019> the<00:00:57.400> components<00:00:58.400> so<00:00:58.879> we

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
issues with with the components so we

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.719 
issues with with the components so we
came<00:00:59.420> out<00:00:59.510> with<00:00:59.600> this<00:00:59.659> SCF<00:01:00.080> 94<00:01:00.619> and<00:01:00.890> it<00:01:01.430> has<00:01:01.549> no

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
came out with this SCF 94 and it has no

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.329 
came out with this SCF 94 and it has no
oxygen<00:01:01.939> to<00:01:02.510> it<00:01:02.659> it<00:01:02.900> won't<00:01:03.409> go<00:01:03.799> bad<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:04.280> you

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
oxygen to it it won't go bad so you

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.350 
oxygen to it it won't go bad so you
don't<00:01:04.489> have<00:01:04.580> to<00:01:04.729> put<00:01:04.879> any<00:01:05.030> sort<00:01:05.330> of

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
don't have to put any sort of

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.090 
don't have to put any sort of
stabilizers<00:01:06.049> in<00:01:06.080> it<00:01:06.350> over<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.680> winter<00:01:06.799> time

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
stabilizers in it over the winter time

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.450 
stabilizers in it over the winter time
and<00:01:07.340> we're<00:01:08.150> kind<00:01:08.420> of<00:01:08.500> aiming<00:01:09.500> it<00:01:09.619> at<00:01:09.830> fire

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
and we're kind of aiming it at fire

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.940 
and we're kind of aiming it at fire
