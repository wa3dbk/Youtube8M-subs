00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.820
 hello and welcome to our tests 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.049
 products then in this video you 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.450
 present take it at 3 pm all 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.920
 cat public it's a gamer that we 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.789
 have developed in collaboration between 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.550
 our forum 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.410
 fitness bodybuilding shop and mickaÃ«l 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.760
 cake and Saturday that I like because 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.109
 that we managed to do in the end the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.910
 composition that had been proposed on the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.689
 forum and that is in my opinion very 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.460
 interesting and so on will gather who 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.590
 contains 38 do buxy thinking of 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.540
 proteins and therefore almost 40 years in 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.610
 protein is that there is 12 h very high 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.559
 for a gamer among these proteins in 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.170
 to have half the micellar cazine 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.320
 so a very good kind of kazim with 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.960
 the unfilled whey protein job 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.469
 also good form of ears then the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.840
 carbohydrates 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.510
 we have twenty nine grams of carbohydrates and 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.050
 it's just oatmeal 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.359
 so we're going to have no success no 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.309
 fast sugars and above all we will have 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.920
 sugars with a dynamic man a 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.420
 little seen there is different so told them 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.299
 also we have more protein than 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.340
 can we finally have 15 g of 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.140
 lipids and then of time in the form of m 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.640
 so it was the same cities were 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.590
 left that are well used by the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.479
 body for the supply of energy so 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.909
 overall we have in quotation marks a 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.680
 europa substitute that is much better 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.909
 measure that most brands for 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.310
 hope on the market simply 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.950
 because he has more protein and that 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.570
 the lipids and carbohydrates we have are 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.579
 interesting lipids and carbohydrates 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.350
 use the the use it to bhl by the 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.770
 body and not just calories 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.150
 empty then locked in a little bit the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.729
 taste and mix test I take from 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.549
 pods 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.270
 if so do twenty grams 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.680
 in 200 milliliters 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.680
 I am here chocolate scent 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.359
 so we have a little bit of moss here and 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.929
 which is pretty light bounce I think 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:05.719
 that she will fall back 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.789
 on the other hand there are plenty of small pimples 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.769
 has no deposit there are plenty of small 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.429
 pimples arguments but all the little ones 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.230
 peas actually can not be everything 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.610
 just normal that we use the 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.340
 powder the subscription to oatmeal 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.080
 so these examples we remained a mixture 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:30.530
 most to wait for the 300 it goes to 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:32.870
 start then one is a man plays there and has 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.160
 also a very sweet taste so rather 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.160
 a counselor or people a few 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.690
 some of the days very sweet and then like 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.760
 I said that this well well it simply 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.000
 remain fears but that come 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.530
 just there for juanita and so if you 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.329
 do not do it in advance or if you more 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.610
 in addition sometimes repaid their building 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.230
 this weight every time because the prod 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.239
 oats belonging to go down to 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.670
 shaker bottom so this is if you 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.599
 not whiten every time you will be at the 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.790
 end of the 3rd round 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.519
 so my style of this product we said 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.950
 a mixture of way and cooking 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.560
 quality with more protein than 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.600
 cid deficit of cheerfulness of the fibers and 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.530
 quality vegetables 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.209
 now I 'm wondering you 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.190
 quit protein points or the tests and 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.870
 sharp reviews details about this product and 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.920
 on this test no use tips 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.920
 of course every year a test
