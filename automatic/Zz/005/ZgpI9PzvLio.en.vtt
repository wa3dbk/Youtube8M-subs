00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.850
 and neither 2012 issue 51 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.799
 one of the environmental problems experienced 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.200
 agriculture today is the 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.850
 soil compaction due to the intense 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.820
 more and more machine traffic 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.780
 heavy reducing the productivity of 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.790
 cultures 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.790
 one of the ways to prevent the problem of 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.100
 Soil compaction is to replace opinion 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.529
 of factors with more tires and we have here 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.960
 then the options with that question of the type 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.969
 easy easy way to go 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.970
 for you for everyone but how 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.730
 objective here is to discuss and learn 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.370
 use other pressure issues 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.470
 that mechanical pressure 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.810
 it can be calculated from 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.860
 pressure is equal to divided force 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.800
 by the area 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.810
 then the mean pressure distribution of 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.020
 a certain force acting in a certain area 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.090
 of the force that we clearly lose 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:05.290
 such a way that the problem 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:08.649
 exists in agriculture is because 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.590
 tractors being weighed if they use tires that 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.740
 has a very small area and more 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.159
 This then increases the pressure 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.830
 so if you want to solve the problem 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.770
 which is to compact the soil so you 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.659
 uses tires that are wider 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.250
 reducing pressure on the soil 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.619
 note that by the mathematical expression 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.409
 you would not need to know 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.409
 to answer this question if you 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.270
 increases the area that is to increase the width 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.119
 of the tire 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.210
 you will be reducing the pressure already 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.540
 that the area is in the denominator pressure to 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.990
 force / area strength in the system 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.119
 International is measured in milton area is 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.549
 measured in square meter 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.520
 nilton per square meter people baptize 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.290
 This is such a peace of mind that you do not 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.900
 I needed this to respond to this 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.049
 question but the tip remains the expression 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.640
 if you need in another expression 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.640
 Let's go to the next question.
