00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
yeah today we are going to break down

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.860 
yeah today we are going to break down
how<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.219> play<00:00:11.580> aggressive<00:00:12.179> with<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.599> first

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
how to play aggressive with the first

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.849 
how to play aggressive with the first
sniper<00:00:13.290> rifle<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:14.009> modern<00:00:14.639> combat<00:00:14.880> 4<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.859> yeah

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
sniper rifle in modern combat 4 and yeah

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.950 
sniper rifle in modern combat 4 and yeah
so<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:18.000> gameplay<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.510> can<00:00:18.539> see<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
so the gameplay you can see in the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.769 
so the gameplay you can see in the
background<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:20.039> pretty<00:00:20.910> good<00:00:21.180> gameplay<00:00:21.480> but

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
background is a pretty good gameplay but

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.769 
background is a pretty good gameplay but
I'm<00:00:22.170> not<00:00:23.100> really<00:00:23.340> sure<00:00:23.760> what<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.300> end<00:00:24.449> score

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
I'm not really sure what the end score

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.300 
I'm not really sure what the end score
was<00:00:25.050> because<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:27.289> stopped<00:00:28.289> recording<00:00:28.529> during

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
was because I stopped recording during

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.600 
was because I stopped recording during
the<00:00:29.429> middle<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> game<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.179> guess<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.610> but

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
the middle of the game I guess so but

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.130 
the middle of the game I guess so but
but<00:00:33.329> actually<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> got<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.410> 2<00:00:34.980> artilleries

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
but actually I got like 2 artilleries

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.260 
but actually I got like 2 artilleries
while<00:00:37.140> playing<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.860> yeah<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.730> let's<00:00:39.149> get

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
while playing and yeah so let's get

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.869 
while playing and yeah so let's get
right<00:00:39.390> into<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> video<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.579> first<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.700> all<00:00:41.820> I

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
right into the video so first of all I

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.549 
right into the video so first of all I
would<00:00:42.149> recommend<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.780> use<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.110> normal<00:00:43.379> iron

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
would recommend to use the normal iron

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.619 
would recommend to use the normal iron
sight<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.129> that's<00:00:44.309> actual<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.910> time<00:00:45.120> same

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
sight but that's actual the time same

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.470 
sight but that's actual the time same
thing<00:00:45.660> as<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.739> already<00:00:47.160> told<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> last

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
thing as I already told you in the last

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.290 
thing as I already told you in the last
video<00:00:48.809> without<00:00:49.649> scoping<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.399> will<00:00:50.850> link<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.210> in

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
video without scoping I will link it in

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.319 
video without scoping I will link it in
the<00:00:51.360> description<00:00:51.719> though<00:00:53.300> mm-hmm<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:55.410> same

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
the description though mm-hmm so same

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.590 
the description though mm-hmm so same
attachments<00:00:57.329> as<00:00:57.449> usual<00:00:58.370> but<00:00:59.370> if<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.390> play

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
attachments as usual but if you play

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.510 
attachments as usual but if you play
aggressive<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.289> need<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.530> quickscope<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.309> I

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
aggressive you need to quickscope so I

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.060 
aggressive you need to quickscope so I
think<00:01:03.270> quick<00:01:03.870> scoping<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.350> pretty<00:01:04.619> hard<00:01:04.890> in

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
think quick scoping is pretty hard in

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.330 
think quick scoping is pretty hard in
this<00:01:05.220> game<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.570> need<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.500> get<00:01:07.680> used<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.100> it

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
this game so you need to get used to it

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.260 
this game so you need to get used to it
and<00:01:09.200> yeah<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.500> how<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> practice<00:01:11.939> quick

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and yeah so how to practice quick

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.730 
and yeah so how to practice quick
scoping<00:01:12.840> that's<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.200> point<00:01:14.240> where<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> I'm<00:01:15.930> not

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
scoping that's a point where I I'm not

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.830 
scoping that's a point where I I'm not
really<00:01:17.040> sure<00:01:17.369> what's<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.119> best<00:01:18.330> method<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
really sure what's the best method to

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.359 
really sure what's the best method to
practice<00:01:19.830> quick<00:01:20.159> scoping<00:01:20.869> but<00:01:22.040> in<00:01:23.040> modern

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
practice quick scoping but in modern

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.929 
practice quick scoping but in modern
warfare<00:01:23.580> 3<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:24.210> example<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:25.460> hosted<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.580> private

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
warfare 3 for example I hosted a private

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.090 
warfare 3 for example I hosted a private
game<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.600> always<00:01:28.259> tried<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.770> hit<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
game and I always tried to hit a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.069 
game and I always tried to hit a
specific<00:01:29.520> point<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.740> a<00:01:32.090> box<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.360> example<00:01:33.479> or

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
specific point like a box for example or

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.249 
specific point like a box for example or
even<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.530> smaller<00:01:34.829> thing<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> bottom<00:01:35.909> or

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
even a smaller thing like a bottom or

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.640 
even a smaller thing like a bottom or
stuff<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.540> if<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.229> really

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
stuff like that and if you are really

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.920 
stuff like that and if you are really
good<00:01:40.920> at<00:01:41.040> hitting<00:01:41.250> such<00:01:41.700> things<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.270> would<00:01:42.420> try

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
good at hitting such things I would try

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.760 
good at hitting such things I would try
to<00:01:42.960> play<00:01:43.350> public<00:01:44.009> games<00:01:44.509> in<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.899> case<00:01:46.170> custom

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
to play public games in this case custom

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.670 
to play public games in this case custom
games<00:01:47.009> because<00:01:47.630> those<00:01:48.630> stats<00:01:48.960> are<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:49.320> added

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
games because those stats are not added

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.200 
games because those stats are not added
to<00:01:49.710> your<00:01:50.390> statistics<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:53.090> that's<00:01:54.090> pretty

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
to your statistics and that's pretty

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.069 
to your statistics and that's pretty
good<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.600> practice<00:01:55.140> sniping<00:01:56.750> also<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.780> would

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
good to practice sniping also I would

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.069 
good to practice sniping also I would
really<00:01:58.320> recommend<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.509> really<00:02:00.509> quick<00:02:00.780> scope

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
really recommend to really quick scope

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.560 
really recommend to really quick scope
during<00:02:01.380> those<00:02:01.500> games<00:02:01.829> because<00:02:02.240> some<00:02:03.240> players

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
during those games because some players

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.870 
during those games because some players
switch<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.170> her<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.619> hardscoping<00:02:05.219> them<00:02:05.490> and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
switch to her to hardscoping them and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.999 
switch to her to hardscoping them and
that<00:02:06.119> would<00:02:06.210> be<00:02:06.329> pretty<00:02:06.600> sad<00:02:06.810> what

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
that would be pretty sad what

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.240 
that would be pretty sad what
another<00:02:08.849> tip<00:02:09.330> which<00:02:09.629> makes<00:02:10.379> quickscoping<00:02:11.160> a

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
another tip which makes quickscoping a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.680 
another tip which makes quickscoping a
little<00:02:11.520> bit

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
little bit

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.310 
little bit
more<00:02:11.810> easy<00:02:11.990> you<00:02:12.350> have<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:13.480> ya<00:02:14.480> just<00:02:14.810> aim<00:02:15.050> the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
more easy you have to ya just aim the

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.780 
more easy you have to ya just aim the
mid<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.770> screen<00:02:16.190> in<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.370> middle<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.640> the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
mid of the screen in the middle of the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.880 
mid of the screen in the middle of the
screen<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.330> actually<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.140> thing<00:02:18.590> where<00:02:18.800> you

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
screen is actually the thing where you

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.390 
screen is actually the thing where you
get<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.160> target<00:02:19.400> then<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.710> yeah<00:02:21.710> so<00:02:22.070> that's

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
get the target then and yeah so that's

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.690 
get the target then and yeah so that's
basically<00:02:22.520> how<00:02:22.970> quick<00:02:23.180> scoping<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.600> done<00:02:23.780> so

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
basically how quick scoping is done so

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.040 
basically how quick scoping is done so
I'm<00:02:25.700> shoot<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.210> run<00:02:26.240> if<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.570> don't<00:02:26.750> know<00:02:26.870> how

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
I'm shoot and run if you don't know how

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.260 
I'm shoot and run if you don't know how
but<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:27.770> think<00:02:28.100> that's<00:02:28.250> pretty<00:02:28.400> easy<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:29.240> just

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
but I think that's pretty easy you just

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.090 
but I think that's pretty easy you just
have<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.660> get<00:02:29.810> your<00:02:29.960> rhythm<00:02:30.170> because

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
have to get your rhythm because

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.150 
have to get your rhythm because
otherwise<00:02:31.340> you're<00:02:31.730> fucked<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.120> little<00:02:32.330> bit<00:02:33.160> but

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
otherwise you're fucked a little bit but

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.350 
otherwise you're fucked a little bit but
yeah<00:02:34.400> so<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:36.200> next<00:02:36.320> thing<00:02:36.710> is<00:02:37.010> probably<00:02:37.640> how

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
yeah so the next thing is probably how

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.100 
yeah so the next thing is probably how
to<00:02:38.420> survive<00:02:39.170> really<00:02:40.010> close<00:02:40.340> range<00:02:40.700> stuff<00:02:41.480> so

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
to survive really close range stuff so

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.180 
to survive really close range stuff so
first<00:02:42.320> of<00:02:42.440> all<00:02:42.560> if<00:02:42.770> you<00:02:42.890> are<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:43.010> good

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
first of all if you are a good

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.580 
first of all if you are a good
quickscoper<00:02:43.820> then<00:02:44.240> you<00:02:44.420> basically<00:02:45.020> won't

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
quickscoper then you basically won't

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.340 
quickscoper then you basically won't
need<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:45.890> secondary<00:02:46.370> weapon<00:02:46.630> but<00:02:47.630> sometimes

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
need a secondary weapon but sometimes

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.520 
need a secondary weapon but sometimes
like<00:02:48.890> you<00:02:49.550> will<00:02:50.180> be<00:02:50.450> able<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.900> see<00:02:51.170> in<00:02:51.350> this

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
like you will be able to see in this

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.100 
like you will be able to see in this
gameplay<00:02:51.770> too<00:02:52.120> you<00:02:53.120> will<00:02:53.330> need<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.600> secondary

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
gameplay too you will need a secondary

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.380 
gameplay too you will need a secondary
weapon<00:02:54.380> so<00:02:54.830> I<00:02:55.040> would<00:02:55.430> highly<00:02:55.790> recommend<00:02:56.270> the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
weapon so I would highly recommend the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.750 
weapon so I would highly recommend the
OBS<00:02:56.840> because<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:57.800> think<00:02:58.190> it's<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.520> best

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
OBS because I think it's the best

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.840 
OBS because I think it's the best
secondary<00:02:59.360> weapon<00:02:59.720> in<00:02:59.840> this<00:03:00.080> game<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.820> yeah<00:03:01.820> I

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
secondary weapon in this game and yeah I

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.140 
secondary weapon in this game and yeah I
would<00:03:02.120> recommend<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.810> use<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.170> with<00:03:04.150> jhp

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
would recommend to use it with jhp

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.330 
would recommend to use it with jhp
rounds<00:03:05.690> because<00:03:05.990> it<00:03:06.260> really<00:03:06.680> increases<00:03:07.130> the

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
rounds because it really increases the

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.150 
rounds because it really increases the
damage<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.120> makes<00:03:08.960> the<00:03:09.290> weapon<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.860> really

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
damage and makes the weapon to a really

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.600 
damage and makes the weapon to a really
good<00:03:10.460> one<00:03:10.640> so<00:03:11.800> definitely<00:03:12.800> go<00:03:13.010> with<00:03:13.220> those

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
good one so definitely go with those

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.660 
good one so definitely go with those
rounds<00:03:15.010> another<00:03:16.010> thing<00:03:16.400> is<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:18.670> vertical

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
rounds another thing is the vertical

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.199 
rounds another thing is the vertical
grip<00:03:19.790> I<00:03:20.060> guess<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:22.400> tactical<00:03:22.880> muzzle

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
grip I guess and the tactical muzzle

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.120 
grip I guess and the tactical muzzle
break<00:03:23.450> because<00:03:23.840> then<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.350> have<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.739> low<00:03:24.920> recoil

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
break because then you have a low recoil

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.690 
break because then you have a low recoil
and<00:03:26.260> yeah<00:03:27.260> like<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:27.620> can<00:03:27.800> see<00:03:28.010> here<00:03:28.190> now<00:03:28.370> I'm

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
and yeah like you can see here now I'm

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.780 
and yeah like you can see here now I'm
using<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.270> oh<00:03:29.300> PS<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:30.340> yeah<00:03:31.340> it's<00:03:31.459> a<00:03:31.520> pretty

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
using the oh PS and yeah it's a pretty

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.880 
using the oh PS and yeah it's a pretty
amazing<00:03:32.030> gun<00:03:32.420> though<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:33.970> yeah<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.890> another

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
amazing gun though and yeah so another

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.770 
amazing gun though and yeah so another
thing<00:03:37.220> is<00:03:37.400> what<00:03:37.580> to<00:03:37.610> do<00:03:37.880> if<00:03:37.910> your<00:03:38.360> enemies<00:03:38.660> are

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
thing is what to do if your enemies are

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.740 
thing is what to do if your enemies are
far<00:03:38.989> away<00:03:39.200> or<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:40.130> have<00:03:40.310> too<00:03:40.970> much<00:03:41.120> enemy<00:03:41.510> so

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
far away or you have too much enemy so

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.229 
far away or you have too much enemy so
then<00:03:42.470> I<00:03:42.500> would<00:03:42.709> definitely<00:03:43.580> go<00:03:43.730> with<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.000> stun

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
then I would definitely go with the stun

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.210 
then I would definitely go with the stun
grenades<00:03:44.570> or<00:03:44.780> with<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.200> breath<00:03:45.410> fresh<00:03:45.769> but

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
grenades or with the breath fresh but

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.300 
grenades or with the breath fresh but
flash<00:03:46.910> grenade<00:03:47.269> because<00:03:47.840> that<00:03:48.830> irritates

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
flash grenade because that irritates

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.640 
flash grenade because that irritates
your<00:03:49.489> enemy<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.239> if<00:03:50.690> you<00:03:51.050> want<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.260> go<00:03:51.380> for<00:03:51.620> a

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
your enemy and if you want to go for a

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.410 
your enemy and if you want to go for a
sniper<00:03:51.830> clips<00:03:52.310> it's<00:03:52.580> always<00:03:52.970> bad<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.300> use

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
sniper clips it's always bad to use

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.810 
sniper clips it's always bad to use
normal<00:03:53.630> needs<00:03:54.019> because<00:03:54.440> they<00:03:55.280> could<00:03:55.550> kill

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
normal needs because they could kill

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.250 
normal needs because they could kill
your<00:03:56.000> enemy<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:56.630> they're<00:03:56.810> not<00:03:57.019> really

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
your enemy and they're not really

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.570 
your enemy and they're not really
irritating<00:03:57.920> so<00:03:58.750> definitely<00:03:59.750> go<00:03:59.989> with<00:04:00.170> those

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
irritating so definitely go with those

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.080 
irritating so definitely go with those
irritating<00:04:01.580> ones<00:04:01.940> and<00:04:02.950> yeah<00:04:03.950> so<00:04:04.310> hard<00:04:04.550> scoping

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
irritating ones and yeah so hard scoping

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.930 
irritating ones and yeah so hard scoping
is<00:04:05.209> never<00:04:05.480> bad<00:04:05.750> but<00:04:06.200> I<00:04:06.650> wouldn't<00:04:07.280> recommend<00:04:07.670> it

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
is never bad but I wouldn't recommend it

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.509 
is never bad but I wouldn't recommend it
while<00:04:08.510> playing<00:04:08.750> aggressive<00:04:09.290> because<00:04:09.620> you

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
while playing aggressive because you

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.540 
while playing aggressive because you
only<00:04:10.790> have<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.390> iron<00:04:11.900> sights<00:04:12.410> view<00:04:12.920> then<00:04:13.220> and

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
only have the iron sights view then and

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.699 
only have the iron sights view then and
you<00:04:13.910> don't<00:04:14.060> know<00:04:14.360> what's<00:04:14.630> happening<00:04:15.470> behind

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
you don't know what's happening behind

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.500 
you don't know what's happening behind
you<00:04:16.040> for<00:04:16.250> example<00:04:16.519> or<00:04:16.940> just<00:04:17.600> next<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:18.200> so

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
you for example or just next to you so

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.130 
you for example or just next to you so
quick<00:04:20.510> scoping<00:04:20.960> is<00:04:21.080> definitely<00:04:21.440> better<00:04:21.590> than

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
quick scoping is definitely better than

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.240 
quick scoping is definitely better than
another<00:04:24.140> thing<00:04:24.470> which

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
another thing which

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.630 
another thing which
Herk<00:04:25.870> combination<00:04:26.870> I<00:04:27.050> would<00:04:27.260> use<00:04:27.440> I<00:04:27.710> would<00:04:28.490> go

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
Herk combination I would use I would go

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.460 
Herk combination I would use I would go
with<00:04:28.760> intervention<00:04:29.390> or<00:04:29.540> front<00:04:29.900> line<00:04:30.110> because

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
with intervention or front line because

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.900 
with intervention or front line because
intervention<00:04:31.040> give<00:04:31.160> you<00:04:31.280> pick<00:04:31.610> through<00:04:31.790> the

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
intervention give you pick through the

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.640 
intervention give you pick through the
wallhack<00:04:32.540> advantage

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
wallhack advantage

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.010 
wallhack advantage
I<00:04:33.680> call<00:04:34.460> it<00:04:34.580> wallhack<00:04:35.000> because<00:04:35.330> it's<00:04:35.540> actually

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
I call it wallhack because it's actually

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.650 
I call it wallhack because it's actually
like<00:04:36.200> wallhack<00:04:36.680> i<00:04:37.460> think<00:04:38.030> it's<00:04:38.150> integrated

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
like wallhack i think it's integrated

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.440 
like wallhack i think it's integrated
rate<00:04:38.810> or<00:04:38.990> stuff<00:04:39.590> like<00:04:39.680> that<00:04:40.270> that's<00:04:41.270> pretty

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
rate or stuff like that that's pretty

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.700 
rate or stuff like that that's pretty
cool<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:42.550> also<00:04:43.550> you<00:04:43.820> have<00:04:44.320> with<00:04:45.320> frontline

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
cool and also you have with frontline

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.180 
cool and also you have with frontline
you<00:04:46.070> got<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.490> life<00:04:47.210> perk<00:04:47.600> that<00:04:48.350> increases

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
you got the life perk that increases

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.080 
you got the life perk that increases
your<00:04:49.400> life<00:04:50.060> health<00:04:50.480> and<00:04:51.520> yeah<00:04:52.520> that<00:04:52.790> gives<00:04:52.910> you

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
your life health and yeah that gives you

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.380 
your life health and yeah that gives you
a<00:04:53.150> big<00:04:53.360> advantage<00:04:53.390> too<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:55.390> intervention

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
a big advantage too and intervention

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.850 
a big advantage too and intervention
also<00:04:56.810> could<00:04:57.560> give<00:04:58.460> you<00:04:59.260> the<00:05:00.260> up<00:05:00.560> the

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
also could give you the up the

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.240 
also could give you the up the
athleticism<00:05:01.790> i<00:05:02.180> guess<00:05:02.480> and<00:05:02.919> yeah<00:05:03.919> then<00:05:04.100> you

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
athleticism i guess and yeah then you

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.800 
athleticism i guess and yeah then you
are<00:05:04.460> running<00:05:04.580> faster<00:05:05.210> that's<00:05:05.419> pretty<00:05:05.600> cool

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
are running faster that's pretty cool

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.930 
are running faster that's pretty cool
for<00:05:06.020> rushing<00:05:06.290> too<00:05:07.240> so<00:05:09.400> another<00:05:10.400> thing<00:05:10.490> are

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
for rushing too so another thing are

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.600 
for rushing too so another thing are
killstreaks<00:05:11.720> i<00:05:11.990> would<00:05:12.169> go<00:05:12.380> with<00:05:12.560> a<00:05:12.710> recon

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
killstreaks i would go with a recon

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.520 
killstreaks i would go with a recon
drone<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:14.180> airstrike<00:05:14.840> and<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:15.169> artillery

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
drone the airstrike and the artillery

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.570 
drone the airstrike and the artillery
because<00:05:16.000> i<00:05:17.000> don't<00:05:17.780> think<00:05:18.080> that<00:05:18.290> anyone<00:05:18.580> could

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
because i don't think that anyone could

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.159 
because i don't think that anyone could
get<00:05:19.760> it<00:05:19.940> Bombur<00:05:20.360> with<00:05:20.540> the<00:05:20.660> sniper<00:05:20.900> it's

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
get it Bombur with the sniper it's

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.400 
get it Bombur with the sniper it's
pretty<00:05:21.440> difficult<00:05:22.000> it's<00:05:23.000> always<00:05:23.870> hard<00:05:24.110> to<00:05:24.200> get

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
pretty difficult it's always hard to get

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.780 
pretty difficult it's always hard to get
a<00:05:24.470> bomber<00:05:24.710> in<00:05:24.919> this<00:05:25.040> game<00:05:25.280> and<00:05:25.460> i<00:05:25.550> think

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
a bomber in this game and i think

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.840 
a bomber in this game and i think
actually<00:05:25.910> the<00:05:26.270> bomber<00:05:26.450> is<00:05:26.630> not<00:05:26.780> that<00:05:26.930> good<00:05:27.110> so

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
actually the bomber is not that good so

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.909 
actually the bomber is not that good so
in<00:05:28.850> this<00:05:29.000> part<00:05:29.360> you<00:05:29.419> can<00:05:29.540> see<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:30.470> power<00:05:30.800> of

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
in this part you can see the power of

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.100 
in this part you can see the power of
the<00:05:31.190> o-p-s<00:05:31.610> because<00:05:32.060> i<00:05:32.300> think<00:05:32.690> this<00:05:32.810> gun<00:05:33.020> is

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
the o-p-s because i think this gun is

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.930 
the o-p-s because i think this gun is
pretty<00:05:33.350> amazing<00:05:33.680> and<00:05:35.229> yeah<00:05:36.229> what<00:05:37.100> just<00:05:37.580> oh

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
pretty amazing and yeah what just oh

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.680 
pretty amazing and yeah what just oh
yeah<00:05:38.600> give<00:05:39.410> it<00:05:39.440> to<00:05:39.620> gonna<00:05:39.950> chance<00:05:40.310> and<00:05:40.700> yeah

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
yeah give it to gonna chance and yeah

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.360 
yeah give it to gonna chance and yeah
then<00:05:41.930> you<00:05:42.080> will<00:05:42.290> see<00:05:42.590> how<00:05:42.770> amazing<00:05:43.040> it

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
then you will see how amazing it

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.610 
then you will see how amazing it
actually<00:05:43.760> is<00:05:43.910> but<00:05:44.540> so<00:05:44.750> i<00:05:44.780> think<00:05:44.870> this<00:05:45.229> scene<00:05:45.500> is

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
actually is but so i think this scene is

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.350 
actually is but so i think this scene is
pretty<00:05:45.860> cool<00:05:46.070> because<00:05:46.280> it<00:05:46.640> just<00:05:46.820> shows

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
pretty cool because it just shows

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.300 
pretty cool because it just shows
through<00:05:47.690> the<00:05:47.900> the<00:05:48.380> actual<00:05:48.680> power<00:05:48.979> of<00:05:49.190> the

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
through the the actual power of the

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.790 
through the the actual power of the
o-p-s<00:05:49.640> I<00:05:49.910> hardly<00:05:50.750> see<00:05:50.960> players<00:05:51.290> playing<00:05:51.560> this

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
o-p-s I hardly see players playing this

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.090 
o-p-s I hardly see players playing this
come<00:05:52.190> on<00:05:53.080> stop<00:05:54.080> using<00:05:54.200> the<00:05:54.470> stupid<00:05:54.890> short

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
come on stop using the stupid short

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.530 
come on stop using the stupid short
check<00:05:55.280> weapon<00:05:56.080> that's<00:05:57.080> retarded<00:05:58.000> so<00:05:59.000> I<00:05:59.270> think

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
check weapon that's retarded so I think

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.010 
check weapon that's retarded so I think
in<00:05:59.810> this<00:06:00.560> incident<00:06:01.220> I<00:06:02.210> wouldn't<00:06:02.840> have<00:06:02.990> a

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
in this incident I wouldn't have a

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.860 
in this incident I wouldn't have a
chance<00:06:03.350> with<00:06:03.680> a<00:06:03.740> sniper<00:06:04.010> so<00:06:04.550> it's<00:06:04.880> never<00:06:05.570> a<00:06:05.660> bad

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
chance with a sniper so it's never a bad

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.020 
chance with a sniper so it's never a bad
idea<00:06:05.900> to<00:06:06.260> use<00:06:06.500> a<00:06:06.530> good<00:06:06.950> secondary<00:06:07.400> weapon

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
idea to use a good secondary weapon

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.060 
idea to use a good secondary weapon
I<00:06:08.060> wouldn't<00:06:08.780> recommend<00:06:08.930> the<00:06:09.320> job<00:06:09.650> to<00:06:09.950> be

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
I wouldn't recommend the job to be

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.480 
I wouldn't recommend the job to be
serious<00:06:10.550> because<00:06:10.910> I<00:06:11.840> think<00:06:12.200> the<00:06:12.560> the<00:06:12.860> recoil

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
serious because I think the the recoil

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.310 
serious because I think the the recoil
is<00:06:13.669> a<00:06:13.700> little<00:06:14.180> bit<00:06:14.300> weird<00:06:14.540> and<00:06:14.810> the<00:06:14.930> gun<00:06:15.110> has<00:06:15.290> a

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
is a little bit weird and the gun has a

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.150 
is a little bit weird and the gun has a
lower<00:06:15.590> damage<00:06:15.890> than<00:06:16.310> the<00:06:16.550> o-p-s<00:06:16.940> and<00:06:17.780> I<00:06:17.870> think

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
lower damage than the o-p-s and I think

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.710 
lower damage than the o-p-s and I think
the<00:06:19.160> o-p-s<00:06:19.460> is<00:06:19.610> better<00:06:19.820> for<00:06:20.060> hipfire<00:06:20.450> Ringo

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
the o-p-s is better for hipfire Ringo

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.640 
the o-p-s is better for hipfire Ringo
yes<00:06:23.720> so<00:06:23.960> now<00:06:23.990> I<00:06:24.830> will<00:06:25.610> get<00:06:25.880> my<00:06:26.120> second<00:06:26.810> Atari<00:06:27.350> in

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
yes so now I will get my second Atari in

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:35.980 
yes so now I will get my second Atari in
a<00:06:27.860> few<00:06:28.780> seconds<00:06:29.890> um<00:06:32.800> yeah<00:06:33.800> so<00:06:34.130> I<00:06:34.720> too<00:06:35.720> have<00:06:35.960> a

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
a few seconds um yeah so I too have a

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.990 
a few seconds um yeah so I too have a
good<00:06:36.260> accuracy<00:06:36.740> while<00:06:37.010> sniping<00:06:37.250> it's<00:06:37.669> not

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
good accuracy while sniping it's not

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.050 
good accuracy while sniping it's not
really<00:06:38.240> easy

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
really easy

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.630 
really easy
so<00:06:39.210> another<00:06:39.450> thing<00:06:39.570> is<00:06:39.810> the<00:06:40.680> sensibility<00:06:41.610> of

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
so another thing is the sensibility of

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.070 
so another thing is the sensibility of
your<00:06:42.570> screen<00:06:43.040> because<00:06:44.270> yeah<00:06:45.270> it's<00:06:45.420> really

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
your screen because yeah it's really

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.670 
your screen because yeah it's really
you're<00:06:46.410> able<00:06:46.980> to<00:06:47.010> customize<00:06:47.250> everything<00:06:47.910> and

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
you're able to customize everything and

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.020 
you're able to customize everything and
yeah<00:06:49.680> so<00:06:50.270> many<00:06:51.270> people<00:06:51.660> ask<00:06:51.870> me<00:06:52.140> what

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
yeah so many people ask me what

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.970 
yeah so many people ask me what
sensibility<00:06:54.030> is<00:06:54.150> fast<00:06:54.450> but<00:06:54.930> actually<00:06:55.830> it's

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
sensibility is fast but actually it's

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.580 
sensibility is fast but actually it's
your<00:06:56.160> choice<00:06:56.460> because<00:06:57.290> yeah<00:06:58.290> it's<00:06:58.410> how<00:06:58.530> you

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
your choice because yeah it's how you

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.680 
your choice because yeah it's how you
play<00:06:58.860> for<00:06:59.250> example<00:06:59.640> I'm<00:06:59.760> playing<00:07:00.060> on<00:07:00.210> my<00:07:00.300> iPad

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
play for example I'm playing on my iPad

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.310 
play for example I'm playing on my iPad
too<00:07:00.900> and<00:07:01.250> I'm<00:07:02.250> not<00:07:02.310> even<00:07:02.700> playing<00:07:03.150> with<00:07:03.270> a<00:07:03.420> full

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320 
too and I'm not even playing with a full

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.190 
too and I'm not even playing with a full
center<00:07:04.710> bill<00:07:04.830> 'ti<00:07:05.040> I<00:07:05.070> have<00:07:05.340> like<00:07:05.720> 3/4<00:07:06.720> stuff

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.200 
center bill 'ti I have like 3/4 stuff

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.100 
center bill 'ti I have like 3/4 stuff
like<00:07:07.380> that<00:07:07.590> and<00:07:08.130> I<00:07:08.670> think<00:07:08.940> this<00:07:09.420> really<00:07:09.780> works

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
like that and I think this really works

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.850 
like that and I think this really works
for<00:07:10.410> me<00:07:10.500> you<00:07:10.740> just<00:07:11.520> have<00:07:11.910> to<00:07:12.120> find<00:07:12.900> out<00:07:13.110> what<00:07:13.620> is

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
for me you just have to find out what is

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.970 
for me you just have to find out what is
best<00:07:14.490> for<00:07:14.700> you<00:07:14.940> I<00:07:14.970> think<00:07:15.720> if<00:07:16.050> you<00:07:16.350> are<00:07:16.380> getting

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:16.980 
best for you I think if you are getting

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.250 
best for you I think if you are getting
higher<00:07:17.220> and<00:07:17.550> higher<00:07:17.790> you<00:07:18.330> will<00:07:18.840> always<00:07:19.080> be

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.260 
higher and higher you will always be

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.790 
higher and higher you will always be
good<00:07:19.620> but<00:07:20.750> yeah<00:07:21.750> you<00:07:21.810> you<00:07:22.170> have<00:07:22.350> to<00:07:22.470> get<00:07:22.620> used

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 
good but yeah you you have to get used

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.010 
good but yeah you you have to get used
to<00:07:22.890> it<00:07:23.040> because<00:07:23.220> you<00:07:23.850> can't<00:07:24.360> just<00:07:24.600> switch

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 
to it because you can't just switch

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.530 
to it because you can't just switch
sensibilities<00:07:25.770> and<00:07:26.130> then<00:07:26.280> think<00:07:26.580> yeah<00:07:27.270> this

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:27.540 
sensibilities and then think yeah this

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.440 
sensibilities and then think yeah this
will<00:07:27.840> really<00:07:28.290> improve<00:07:28.680> my<00:07:28.950> style<00:07:29.310> no<00:07:29.910> it<00:07:30.090> won't

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:30.450 
will really improve my style no it won't

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.530 
will really improve my style no it won't
you<00:07:30.870> will<00:07:31.530> need<00:07:31.830> like<00:07:32.130> at<00:07:32.430> least<00:07:32.640> 50<00:07:33.000> kills<00:07:33.270> to

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:33.540 
you will need like at least 50 kills to

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.900 
you will need like at least 50 kills to
get<00:07:33.690> used<00:07:33.870> to<00:07:33.990> such<00:07:34.230> things<00:07:34.400> for<00:07:35.400> example<00:07:35.520> I'm

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:35.910 
get used to such things for example I'm

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.490 
get used to such things for example I'm
going<00:07:35.940> to<00:07:36.090> come<00:07:36.270> with<00:07:36.360> two<00:07:36.540> I<00:07:36.960> still<00:07:37.230> play<00:07:37.470> with

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 
going to come with two I still play with

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.460 
going to come with two I still play with
the<00:07:37.830> normal<00:07:38.130> sensibility<00:07:38.700> because<00:07:39.260> yeah<00:07:40.260> I'm

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:40.470 
the normal sensibility because yeah I'm

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.060 
the normal sensibility because yeah I'm
used<00:07:40.710> to<00:07:40.830> it<00:07:41.010> and<00:07:41.190> I<00:07:41.700> won't<00:07:41.940> need<00:07:42.210> more<00:07:43.010> so<00:07:44.010> you

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:44.070 
used to it and I won't need more so you

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:48.170 
used to it and I won't need more so you
always<00:07:44.940> have<00:07:45.330> to<00:07:45.480> think<00:07:46.290> about<00:07:46.830> what<00:07:47.760> you<00:07:48.000> will

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:48.180 
always have to think about what you will

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:53.480 
always have to think about what you will
need<00:07:48.420> for<00:07:48.480> example<00:07:49.460> the<00:07:50.460> long<00:07:51.090> Attila<00:07:51.390> the<00:07:52.490> the

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:53.490 
need for example the long Attila the the

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.140 
need for example the long Attila the the
high<00:07:53.880> sensibility<00:07:54.600> is<00:07:54.930> good<00:07:55.680> for<00:07:55.950> us<00:07:56.150> turns

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:57.150 
high sensibility is good for us turns

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.300 
high sensibility is good for us turns
and<00:07:57.540> stuff<00:07:57.810> like<00:07:57.990> that<00:07:58.230> and<00:07:58.590> if<00:07:58.800> you<00:07:58.920> have<00:07:59.070> low

00:07:59.300 --> 00:07:59.310 
and stuff like that and if you have low

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.690 
and stuff like that and if you have low
Sensibility<00:07:59.970> is<00:08:00.030> better<00:08:00.240> for<00:08:00.390> aiming<00:08:00.750> though

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:01.700 
Sensibility is better for aiming though

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.280 
Sensibility is better for aiming though
yeah<00:08:02.700> but<00:08:02.880> actually<00:08:02.970> the<00:08:03.300> game<00:08:03.480> ends<00:08:03.780> here<00:08:03.840> and

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:04.290 
yeah but actually the game ends here and

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.220 
yeah but actually the game ends here and
I<00:08:04.590> hope<00:08:04.740> this<00:08:04.980> was<00:08:05.190> helpful<00:08:05.820> and<00:08:06.090> yeah<00:08:06.870> it's

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:07.230 
I hope this was helpful and yeah it's

I hope this was helpful and yeah it's
