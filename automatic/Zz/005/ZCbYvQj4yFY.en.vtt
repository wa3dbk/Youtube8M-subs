00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.400 

the<00:00:51.250> breakthrough<00:00:51.670> of<00:00:51.730> this<00:00:51.970> game<00:00:52.270> is<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:53.230> way

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
the breakthrough of this game is the way

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.020 
the breakthrough of this game is the way
it's<00:00:53.590> been<00:00:53.739> designed<00:00:53.980> because<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:54.820> gameplay

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
it's been designed because the gameplay

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.240 
it's been designed because the gameplay
ingredients<00:00:55.930> are<00:00:56.110> tagged<00:00:56.410> are<00:00:56.710> targeting

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
ingredients are tagged are targeting

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.170 
ingredients are tagged are targeting
each<00:00:57.730> eyes<00:00:58.140> separately<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.489> this<00:01:00.489> allows<00:01:00.910> us

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
each eyes separately and this allows us

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.689 
each eyes separately and this allows us
to<00:01:01.570> train<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.500> brain<00:01:02.620> to<00:01:02.980> recover<00:01:03.129> a

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
to train the brain to recover a

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.969 
to train the brain to recover a
binocular<00:01:04.320> binocular<00:01:05.320> vision<00:01:05.500> for<00:01:05.890> the

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
binocular binocular vision for the

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.890 
binocular binocular vision for the
patient

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.530
