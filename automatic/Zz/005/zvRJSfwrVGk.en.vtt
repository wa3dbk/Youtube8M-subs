think witnessing this box is heavy it is
super<00:02:05.990> heavy<00:02:06.470> that's<00:02:07.400> one<00:02:07.550> of<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.700> heaviest

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
super heavy that's one of the heaviest

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.320 
super heavy that's one of the heaviest
boxes<00:02:08.690> that<00:02:08.869> sighs<00:02:09.140> I've<00:02:09.320> ever<00:02:09.500> seen<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:11.030> we

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
boxes that sighs I've ever seen and we

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.080 
boxes that sighs I've ever seen and we
have<00:02:11.510> another<00:02:11.960> technique<00:02:12.590> step<00:02:16.060> which<00:02:17.060> is

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
have another technique step which is

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.370 
have another technique step which is
this<00:02:17.540> one<00:02:17.810> set<00:02:19.120> 93-97<00:02:20.120> in<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.660> banged-up<00:02:20.930> box

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
this one set 93-97 in a banged-up box

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.490 
this one set 93-97 in a banged-up box
it's<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.830> logging<00:02:22.280> truck<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:23.020> it<00:02:24.020> was<00:02:24.230> also

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
it's the logging truck and it was also

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.699 
it's the logging truck and it was also
fifty<00:02:24.980> percent<00:02:25.310> off<00:02:25.520> which<00:02:25.850> I<00:02:26.000> think<00:02:26.240> was<00:02:26.709> 74

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
fifty percent off which I think was 74

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.480 
fifty percent off which I think was 74
but<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.640> main<00:02:28.910> reason<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.480> got<00:02:29.690> it<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.250> has

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
but the main reason I got it is it has

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.120 
but the main reason I got it is it has
the<00:02:31.760> power<00:02:32.120> functions<00:02:32.840> which<00:02:33.709> I'm<00:02:33.890> going<00:02:34.070> to

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
the power functions which I'm going to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.920

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
let they might be bricks used to power

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.190 
let they might be bricks used to power
the<00:02:36.610> mixer<00:02:37.610> instead<00:02:38.150> of<00:02:38.180> buying<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.600> separate

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
this one out of this set and then later

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.610 
this one out of this set and then later
