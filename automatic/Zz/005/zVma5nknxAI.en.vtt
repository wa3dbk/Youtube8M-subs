00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello friends and good today 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.639
 I bring you a very simple tutorial the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.860
 true this time I'm going to teach you 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.620
 how to take a screenshot or screenshot 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.990
 good to start there are two ways to 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.300
 take a screenshot that I know the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.550
 first form and the same is very similar to 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.060
 the other but a little longer and manual 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.769
 is going to be this we are going to press the button 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.990
 impre bread which is so 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.330
 general to the right of f 12 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.410
 that is, the button that follows f 12 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.739
 we go f 10 f 11 f 12 and there it is in 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.410
 prepare 22 keys above the 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.140
 suppress 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.600
 and well first thing if it is then we are going to 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.460
 open some editor in this case I'm going to 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.470
 open paint that is the most common and that 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.450
 I suppose we all have 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.820
 Once the paint is open, we will press 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:01:00.510
 control control vy as you see there is 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.580
 the screenshot he screenshot good 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.980
 this is the way a little longer and 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:09.010
 well now we go with the one that follows 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.440
 what is a little more short and more 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.780
 automated 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.990
 first we are going to have to open the live 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.370
 is a program to capture the screen on 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.810
 which I will leave in the description 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.240
 of the video for those who want it 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.880
 download and well the program is activated 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.920
 with the same key of the other imprepan is 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.290
 say to the right the f 12 or two keys 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.090
 above the suppress when we prioritize it 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.160
 is going to put the screen a bit gray 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.260
 we're going to have to give left click and 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.200
 hal oppressed to indicate the area that 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.390
 we want to take the catch we're going to 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.880
 have a few options this is for 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.050
 close it this is to save it in 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.570
 any part of our computer 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.140
 example on the desktop this is for 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.910
 copy it this is to print it that's 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.920
 to search similar images ie 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.500
 that maintain the same range of colors 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.360
 so to speak our to buy 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.180
 share on social networks example 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.770
 facebook or twitter and this option is for 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.920
 upload it directly to the server that 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:10.000
 manages the program ie apn src 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.700
 puntocom example we give here 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.630
 is going to start saying go up image let's go 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.630
 to let it load 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.970
 once it has been downloaded, it appears 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.800
 the link of our photo if we give to 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.270
 open is going to open directly or 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.410
 It also gives us the option to copy it 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.280
 so that you can send it by message 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.280
 to the people 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.459
 or just to paste it and access 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.900
 as you can see there is the capture but not 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.540
 is directly stored here 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.680
 as images are stored in there 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.450
 points but that does not matter is also 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.519
 the option to save it which I will 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.769
 explain below we give to 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.980
 save or controls and already just 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.329
 let's choose where we want to save it 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.269
 example here and this is the name so 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.709
 general puts screenshot royal floor and the 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.900
 number that follows the example 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.879
 screen chad 1 the next one would be saved 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.790
 with 2 with 3 with 4 with 5 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.599
 we have three png formats ie without 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.090
 background 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.599
 bmp is a format a photo format that 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.220
 it is not used much and jpg in this case 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.590
 I'll save it in jpg and I'll 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.180
 save once we've done that 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.730
 we are simply going to look for it where 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.829
 we keep in this case here and as you see 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.930
 there is good, thank you very much everyone 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.700
