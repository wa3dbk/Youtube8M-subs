00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
to add it in but anyway so I think I

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.910 
to add it in but anyway so I think I
just<00:02:04.590> add<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.159> one<00:02:05.939> more<00:02:05.990> kill<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.259> then<00:02:07.799> I'm

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
just add in one more kill and then I'm

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.550 
just add in one more kill and then I'm
gone<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.459> then<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.209> spawn<00:02:09.899> right<00:02:10.080> there<00:02:10.319> and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
believe I get 2 more kills of this I'm

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.789 
believe I get 2 more kills of this I'm
not<00:04:18.220> really<00:04:18.280> sure<00:04:18.700> so<00:04:19.109> now<00:04:20.109> I<00:04:20.139> have<00:04:20.289> 10<00:04:20.530> kills

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.000 
not really sure so now I have 10 kills
and<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:21.969> just<00:04:22.150> need<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.419> last<00:04:22.599> one<00:04:22.900> again<00:04:23.020> and

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
so you know it's pretty easy actually

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:26.800 
so you know it's pretty easy actually
once<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.200> just<00:04:26.409> set

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
once you just set

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.040 
once you just set
up<00:04:26.980> with<00:04:27.980> your<00:04:28.220> allies<00:04:28.790> you<00:04:29.210> don't<00:04:29.810> want<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:29.990> be

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
up with your allies you don't want to be

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.940 
up with your allies you don't want to be
too<00:04:30.260> close<00:04:30.500> to<00:04:30.560> them<00:04:32.230> but<00:04:33.230> like<00:04:33.740> you<00:04:33.919> don't

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
too close to them but like you don't

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.950 
too close to them but like you don't
want<00:04:34.220> them<00:04:34.370> in<00:04:34.400> front<00:04:34.820> of<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.120> but<00:04:35.630> you<00:04:35.780> don't

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
want them in front of you but you don't

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.100 
want them in front of you but you don't
necessarily<00:04:36.080> don't<00:04:36.800> want<00:04:37.040> them<00:04:37.220> there

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
necessarily don't want them there

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.409 
necessarily don't want them there
sometimes<00:04:39.110> you<00:04:39.260> want<00:04:39.410> to<00:04:39.440> be<00:04:39.500> away<00:04:39.770> from<00:04:39.830> them

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
sometimes you want to be away from them

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.930 
sometimes you want to be away from them
sometimes<00:04:41.419> you<00:04:41.720> want<00:04:42.410> to<00:04:42.470> stay<00:04:43.190> with<00:04:43.460> them<00:04:43.700> but

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
sometimes you want to stay with them but

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.670 
sometimes you want to stay with them but
kind<00:04:44.180> of<00:04:44.330> a<00:04:44.480> little<00:04:44.750> bit<00:04:44.930> more<00:04:45.139> in<00:04:45.230> front<00:04:45.500> of

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
kind of a little bit more in front of

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.530 
kind of a little bit more in front of
them<00:04:45.830> so<00:04:46.100> you<00:04:46.160> you're<00:04:46.760> still<00:04:46.970> getting<00:04:47.060> most<00:04:47.419> of

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
them so you you're still getting most of

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.980 
them so you you're still getting most of
the<00:04:47.600> kills<00:04:48.400> so<00:04:49.400> again<00:04:49.610> I<00:04:49.639> get<00:04:49.880> another<00:04:50.120> ac-130

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.180 

just<00:04:53.990> kind<00:04:54.200> of<00:04:54.260> blasting<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.830> heck<00:04:54.950> out<00:04:55.070> of

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
just kind of blasting the heck out of

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.680 
just kind of blasting the heck out of
them<00:04:55.370> they're<00:04:55.580> all<00:04:55.700> staying<00:04:55.970> inside<00:04:56.180> so<00:04:56.570> it's

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
them they're all staying inside so it's

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.510 
them they're all staying inside so it's
kind<00:04:56.870> of<00:04:56.930> hard<00:04:57.139> so<00:04:57.919> I<00:04:57.980> don't<00:04:58.130> get<00:04:58.220> too<00:04:58.400> many

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520
