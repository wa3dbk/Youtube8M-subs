00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
think I can't say that anyone has ever

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.300 
think I can't say that anyone has ever
faced<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:36.110> kind<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.440> situation<00:02:36.950> before<00:02:37.040> in

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
faced that kind of situation before in

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.949 
faced that kind of situation before in
the<00:02:37.370> fire<00:02:37.519> service<00:02:37.730> would<00:02:38.599> have<00:02:38.720> actually

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
the fire service would have actually

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.960 
the fire service would have actually
come<00:02:39.140> under<00:02:39.440> insurgent<00:02:40.220> fire<00:02:40.400> from<00:02:40.790> that

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
come under insurgent fire from that

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.430 
come under insurgent fire from that
close<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:41.390> mean<00:02:41.540> they<00:02:41.599> were<00:02:41.690> literally<00:02:42.049> 30<00:02:42.319> or

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
close I mean they were literally 30 or

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.850 
close I mean they were literally 30 or
40<00:02:42.680> meters<00:02:42.799> away<00:02:42.980> from<00:02:43.099> us<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:45.470> for<00:02:45.650> them<00:02:45.739> to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
40 meters away from us so for them to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.039 
40 meters away from us so for them to
deal<00:02:46.040> with<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:47.599> carry<00:02:47.840> out<00:02:47.900> what

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
deal with that and to carry out what

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.199 
deal with that and to carry out what
they<00:02:48.140> were<00:02:48.230> doing<00:02:48.260> was<00:02:49.250> absolutely<00:02:49.670> amazing

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
they were doing was absolutely amazing

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.449 
they were doing was absolutely amazing
to<00:02:50.360> me<00:02:50.450> think<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:51.410> force<00:02:51.620> protection<00:02:52.069> teams

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
to me think the force protection teams

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.400 
to me think the force protection teams
and<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.790> RAF<00:02:53.150> Fire<00:02:53.389> and<00:02:53.569> Rescue<00:02:53.660> Service<00:02:53.900> were
