00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.200
 i 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.059
 jaime no and by 1.070 a chapter 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.289
 sad, very sad 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.270
 let's analyze it in the first ones any 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.730
 we see to Ithaca who can not believe that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.320
 his strain has lost but it is not the only 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.390
 since all the public feels of the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.919
 same way among them they think that the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.589
 estimated lost because he had so close 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:31.439
 of connecting that blow a reality not 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:34.230
 credible for a counterattack is terrible 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.710
 a contributor who follows and the combative in 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.030
 power point and go for you clear keyboard 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.309
 then we see how he has brought up his 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.660
 arms to celebrate his victory but the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.370
 most people do not look at these 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.390
 they are still worried about polyps because 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.980
 unconscious 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.809
 Alfredo observes him with a very 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.460
 special but your coach tells you that 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.980
 do not worry because it could be there 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.260
 it would be him if he had stopped hiccoughing and 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.519
 time definitely team moves the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.230
 rhythm we make worries too much 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.239
 She tells him to strip to the canvas and why 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.219
 do not move and then we attacked to 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.129
 who gave paying you're not so old 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.470
 although two I come back with hiccups and says 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.380
 that is okay the chat rises is given 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.780
 account of the situation lost we see it 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.659
 a face that broke my heart and end 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.030
 from the conclusions chapter the second 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.560
 defeat time was very hard just like 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.030
 you I felt here in the background I was going 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.350
 to lose the fight with gonzÃ¡lez because 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.360
 there were many things to develop 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.920
 still in the manga but as everyone goes 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.720
 I did not want that land protagonist since 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.280
 these very hard but well I think this 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.170
 It's not going to be stronger and try your 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.789
 pedals I do not think that losing anymore will be 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.439
 and in fact for me to have only two 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.210
 defeats since I also do not want that 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.130
 lose more you are my story as in 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.409
 Ricardo Martinez but hey everything 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.640
 they can do critical and think every hour 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.470
 and I think it's going to have a 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.789
 training species with goal and type 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.649
 from the city with which period 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.119
 It cost a lot to win and good too 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.950
 with many characters there will surely be 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.140
 hipo is dedicated to fighting with rams more 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.880
 low but good from fight as the day 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.679
 Gonzalez as a line his rematch against 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.599
 Corporal Martinez I think to lose 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.220
 new plus assured team left him 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:01.770
 some injury still did not show us 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.209
 nothing but it is not necessary so smooth but 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.250
 ultimately prove is the second 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.539
 the world so good for you alfredo and 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.099
 as I say you change everything we have 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.810
 to him by the and he sure will have a 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.130
 epic story for the end of the series 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.130
 that establishes never lose 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.519
 here for walking too much there and I do not know 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.709
 if this defeat hurt more the same 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.569
 I do not know, you guys tell me by the hair 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.250
 his comments many stories 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.390
 thanks for this video see you in the 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.390
