Hemi<00:02:10.920> badge<00:02:11.240> and<00:02:12.240> pretty<00:02:12.570> soon<00:02:12.750> you're<00:02:13.020> gonna

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
Hemi badge and pretty soon you're gonna

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.500 
Hemi badge and pretty soon you're gonna
realize<00:02:13.650> why<00:02:14.070> don't<00:02:14.610> do<00:02:14.850> these<00:02:15.090> type<00:02:15.480> of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
realize why don't do these type of

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.560 
realize why don't do these type of
comparisons<00:02:17.090> which<00:02:18.090> one<00:02:18.240> do<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.360> think<00:02:18.390> is

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
comparisons which one do you think is

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.040 
comparisons which one do you think is
gonna<00:02:18.660> win<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> drag<00:02:19.050> race<00:02:19.230> oh<00:02:20.540> it's<00:02:21.540> hard<00:02:21.900> to

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
gonna win the drag race oh it's hard to

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.650 
gonna win the drag race oh it's hard to
say<00:02:22.230> i<00:02:22.260> want<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.560> say<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.950> old<00:02:23.160> muscle<00:02:24.120> car<00:02:24.360> cuz

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
say i want to say the old muscle car cuz

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.530 
say i want to say the old muscle car cuz
its<00:02:24.780> actual<00:02:25.230> muscle<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:26.180> compared<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.360> this

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
its actual muscle and compared to this

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.110 
its actual muscle and compared to this
so<00:02:27.810> like<00:02:27.990> you<00:02:28.500> know<00:02:28.530> i<00:02:28.920> don't<00:02:29.520> know<00:02:29.610> what<00:02:29.910> i'm

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
it from the other angle a lot of people

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.690 
it from the other angle a lot of people
want<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.260> say<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.530> older<00:03:22.830> muscle<00:03:23.190> cars<00:03:23.430> are

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
want to say the older muscle cars are

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.220 
want to say the older muscle cars are
better<00:03:23.880> but<00:03:24.180> if<00:03:24.270> you<00:03:24.360> take<00:03:24.540> them<00:03:24.720> stock<00:03:24.989> for

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
better but if you take them stock for

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.630 
better but if you take them stock for
stock<00:03:25.320> you're<00:03:25.770> putting<00:03:26.070> a<00:03:26.130> computer<00:03:26.520> up

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
stock you're putting a computer up

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.810 
stock you're putting a computer up
against<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.970> typewriter<00:03:28.489> that's<00:03:29.489> literally

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
against a typewriter that's literally

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.479 
against a typewriter that's literally
what<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.870> things<00:03:31.080> up<00:03:31.260> built<00:03:31.950> computer

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
what it is that things up built computer

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.729 
what it is that things up built computer
versus<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.510> know<00:03:33.630> just<00:03:33.870> dump<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.290> fuel<00:03:34.500> and

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
versus you know just dump the fuel and

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.170 
versus you know just dump the fuel and
burn<00:03:34.890> them<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:36.440> mean<00:03:37.580> cars<00:03:38.580> back<00:03:38.880> in<00:03:39.000> those<00:03:39.150> days

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
burn them I mean cars back in those days

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.979 
burn them I mean cars back in those days
did<00:03:39.570> not<00:03:39.720> have<00:03:39.900> rubber<00:03:40.590> on<00:03:40.920> him<00:03:41.250> for<00:03:41.989> like

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
did not have rubber on him for like

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.340 
did not have rubber on him for like
the<00:03:43.110> tires<00:03:43.350> like<00:03:43.650> literally<00:03:44.269> maybe<00:03:45.269> this<00:03:46.110> big

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
the tires like literally maybe this big

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.180 
the tires like literally maybe this big
I'm<00:03:46.620> showing<00:03:46.950> her<00:03:47.130> y'all<00:03:47.940> can<00:03:48.150> look<00:03:48.330> it<00:03:48.480> up<00:03:49.190> so

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
I'm showing her y'all can look it up so

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.120 
I'm showing her y'all can look it up so
going<00:03:50.489> around<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.850> track<00:03:51.000> obviously<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.200> SOT

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
going around the track obviously the SOT

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.110 
going around the track obviously the SOT
8009<00:03:53.760> just<00:03:54.420> takes<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.810> lead<00:03:55.019> it's<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:56.120> more

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
8009 just takes a lead it's a more

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.800 
8009 just takes a lead it's a more
advanced<00:03:57.480> sophisticated<00:03:58.350> suspension<00:03:58.590> setup

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
advanced sophisticated suspension setup

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.449 
advanced sophisticated suspension setup
obviously<00:04:03.200> next<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.530> old<00:04:04.650> car<00:04:04.950> struggling

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
obviously next to the old car struggling

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.759 
obviously next to the old car struggling
scheme<00:04:05.850> yeah<00:04:07.489> he's<00:04:08.489> holding<00:04:09.140> 88<00:04:10.140> miles<00:04:10.440> an

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
scheme yeah he's holding 88 miles an

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.900 
scheme yeah he's holding 88 miles an
hour<00:04:10.950> so<00:04:12.680> now<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:13.710> see<00:04:14.160> why<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.340> don't<00:04:14.640> do<00:04:14.760> these

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
hour so now I see why I don't do these

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.140 
hour so now I see why I don't do these
type<00:04:15.090> of<00:04:15.120> comparisons<00:04:16.220> because

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
type of comparisons because

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.060 
type of comparisons because
I<00:04:18.209> mean<00:04:18.870> this<00:04:19.079> is<00:04:19.259> really<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.829> result<00:04:20.100> I<00:04:22.070> could

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
I mean this is really the result I could

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.890 
I mean this is really the result I could
try<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.340> pick<00:04:23.940> some<00:04:24.120> more<00:04:24.240> cars<00:04:24.449> are<00:04:24.660> closer

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
try to pick some more cars are closer

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.900 
try to pick some more cars are closer
together<00:04:25.139> but<00:04:25.530> this<00:04:25.680> is<00:04:25.800> always<00:04:26.340> gonna<00:04:26.580> be<00:04:26.789> the

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
together but this is always gonna be the

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.159 
together but this is always gonna be the
result<00:04:28.130> these<00:04:29.130> older<00:04:29.490> cars<00:04:29.900> powerful<00:04:30.900> as<00:04:31.020> they

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
result these older cars powerful as they

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.700 
result these older cars powerful as they
might<00:04:31.470> be<00:04:32.900> they<00:04:33.900> can't<00:04:34.139> keep<00:04:34.289> up<00:04:34.500> with<00:04:34.530> the

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
might be they can't keep up with the
