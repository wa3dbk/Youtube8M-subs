little in bit is to stop the exhaust
going<00:02:08.090> right<00:02:08.420> through<00:02:08.450> so<00:02:09.410> no<00:02:09.920> it<00:02:10.220> won't<00:02:10.369> it

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
going right through so no it won't it

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.449 
going right through so no it won't it
will<00:02:10.729> stop<00:02:11.030> about<00:02:11.690> there<00:02:11.930> so<00:02:12.140> that's<00:02:12.290> good<00:02:12.500> via

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
will stop about there so that's good via

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.170 
will stop about there so that's good via
these<00:02:13.730> will

these will

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.920 
these will
these<00:02:14.329> exhausts<00:02:15.170> will<00:02:15.439> fit<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:17.420> Sinister

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
these exhausts will fit the Sinister

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.649

like but when I get my bike line still
this<00:02:49.849> I'll<00:02:50.060> put<00:02:50.209> an<00:02:50.329> installation<00:02:50.989> video<00:02:51.290> up

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
this I'll put an installation video up

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.690 
this I'll put an installation video up
in<00:02:51.620> about<00:02:51.799> a<00:02:51.859> month<00:02:53.290> I'll<00:02:54.290> do<00:02:54.530> how<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.189> sounds

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
in about a month I'll do how it sounds

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.599 
in about a month I'll do how it sounds
what<00:02:56.299> it<00:02:56.450> sounds<00:02:56.750> like<00:02:56.900> before<00:02:57.379> or<00:02:58.040> after<00:02:58.579> or

engineering<00:03:13.939> Cara<00:03:14.299> calipers<00:03:14.959> I'm<00:03:15.109> studying

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
engineering Cara calipers I'm studying

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.670 
engineering Cara calipers I'm studying
mechanical<00:03:16.159> engineering<00:03:16.810> at<00:03:17.810> college<00:03:18.169> so<00:03:18.409> I

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
mechanical engineering at college so I

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.000 
mechanical engineering at college so I
know<00:03:18.859> what<00:03:19.099> I'm<00:03:19.190> doing<00:03:19.519> so<00:03:19.909> I'll<00:03:20.389> put<00:03:21.010> the
