what he needed to be able to do a 1080

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.620 
what he needed to be able to do a 1080
and<00:01:35.990> they<00:01:36.140> were<00:01:36.200> able<00:01:36.409> to<00:01:36.619> see<00:01:36.950> that<00:01:37.640> he<00:01:37.850> needed

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
ramped it was a roll and they went out

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.719 
ramped it was a roll and they went out
and<00:01:41.180> designed<00:01:41.719> it<00:01:42.020> helped<00:01:42.799> pitch<00:01:43.130> it<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.369> get

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
and designed it helped pitch it to get

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.819 
and designed it helped pitch it to get
the<00:01:44.030> funds<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.780> be<00:01:45.020> able<00:01:45.049> to<00:01:45.320> make<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.500> happen

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
the funds to be able to make it happen

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.100 
the funds to be able to make it happen
and<00:01:46.340> then<00:01:46.939> they<00:01:47.240> were<00:01:47.299> able<00:01:47.479> to<00:01:47.689> coach<00:01:47.930> him
