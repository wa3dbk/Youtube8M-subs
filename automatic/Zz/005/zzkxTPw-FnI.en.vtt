00:00:15.258 --> 00:00:21.258
 Today we will let you know how easy it is to print 3D objects. 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.079
 Let's choose a model to print first. There are many model files available for download on this Thingiverse.com website. 

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:36.515
 We also offer some models from Voltivo, check out our page! 

00:00:47.427 --> 00:00:51.427
 First we choose the Caseking key ring, which is our own model. 

00:00:51.427 --> 00:00:55.427
 Download the model to your computer and prepare to print the pre-job. 

00:00:57.254 --> 00:01:01.254
 The next step is to "slice" the model, which is to slice the 3D model file into many stacks. 

00:01:01.254 --> 00:01:05.254
 Then output a file called GCODE, and wait for it to be sent to the 3D printer. 

00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:17.571
 As you can see, we design the interior of the object to be hollow, which saves material and is not visible from the outside. 

00:01:23.053 --> 00:01:27.053
 We print today in ExcelFilTM sky blue. This printer uses a wire with a diameter of 1.75 mm. 

00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:42.901
 Due to the hygroscopic nature of the wire, our wire is carefully vacuum sealed for protection during transport. 

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:50.934
 Each line volume provides a QR code to guide you to the official technical support website. 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:59.609
 We tested our wires in large numbers to find the correct print temperature for the user. 

00:02:00.243 --> 00:02:05.243
 This saves you time. You don't have to experiment like using other manufacturers' wires. 

00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:10.877
 This 3D printed reel holder can be downloaded from our Thingiverse.com page! 

00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:22.464
 Wire diameter accuracy is an important factor in determining whether a print surface is smooth. High precision also avoids printer jamming. 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.810
 Our wire precision tolerance is only 0.05 mm! This is the industry leading specification! 

00:02:23.594 --> 00:02:27.594
 This is our new product "Wire Dust Removal Block", which is simple and effective. 

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:36.585
 Can be used to prevent dust, hair and other debris from entering your printer nozzle. 

00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:44.581
 Both 3 mm and 1.75 mm wires are suitable. 

00:02:52.577 --> 00:02:56.577
 Let us start printing now! 

00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:10.321
 It is now set to print at a speed of 90 mm/sec. 

00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:15.321
 We tested the ExcelFilTM wire at 200 mm/sec on the modified Ultimaker printer. 

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:20.321
 This is faster than most printers currently on the market. 

00:03:35.974 --> 00:03:39.974
 The print quality of the first layer is very important. 

00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:57.918
 Optimized, ExcelFilTM adheres well to aluminum, glass, ceramic and polyamide (Kapton) surfaces. 

00:04:00.411 --> 00:04:04.411
 Let's go fast. 

00:04:31.176 --> 00:04:35.176
 The print is complete! Let's take a look. 

00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:42.431
 The surface of the object looks very clean and does not require post processing. 

00:04:45.434 --> 00:04:49.434
 String it on the key. 

00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:57.109
 You can also help yourself! The object download link is in the description of the movie.
