00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.480 

we<00:00:01.020> made<00:00:01.319> it<00:00:01.469> through<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:02.220> small<00:00:02.460> intestine

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
we made it through the small intestine

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.360 
we made it through the small intestine
where<00:00:03.179> most<00:00:03.629> of<00:00:03.990> our<00:00:04.140> chemical<00:00:04.500> digestion<00:00:05.040> has

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
where most of our chemical digestion has

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.000 
where most of our chemical digestion has
happened<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:05.940> most<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.810> our<00:00:06.960> absorption<00:00:07.589> has

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
happened and most of our absorption has

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.580 
happened and most of our absorption has
happened<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.670> now<00:00:09.300> we<00:00:09.360> enter<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.080> structure

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
happened and now we enter a structure

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.999 
happened and now we enter a structure
that<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:11.660> structurally<00:00:12.660> much<00:00:13.170> different<00:00:13.799> if

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
that is structurally much different if

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.430 
that is structurally much different if
you<00:00:14.190> look<00:00:14.460> at<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.820> there's<00:00:15.150> no<00:00:15.599> question<00:00:16.230> we

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
you look at it there's no question we

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.310 
you look at it there's no question we
are<00:00:16.650> somewhere<00:00:17.130> new<00:00:17.369> we<00:00:18.240> are<00:00:18.270> no<00:00:18.630> longer<00:00:18.990> in

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
are somewhere new we are no longer in

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.090 
are somewhere new we are no longer in
Kansas<00:00:19.980> anymore<00:00:20.520> because<00:00:21.510> we<00:00:21.689> exit<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.439> ileum

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
Kansas anymore because we exit the ileum

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.910 
Kansas anymore because we exit the ileum
and<00:00:23.400> we<00:00:24.240> enter<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.810> giant<00:00:25.380> green<00:00:25.529> thing

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
and we enter this giant green thing

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.990 
and we enter this giant green thing
which<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.760> large<00:00:26.970> intestine<00:00:29.000> another

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
which is the large intestine another

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.900 
which is the large intestine another
name<00:00:30.300> for<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.019> large<00:00:31.230> intestine<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.669> says

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
name for the large intestine that says

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.160 
name for the large intestine that says
intestine<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.710> colon<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.899> just<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
intestine is the colon and just like the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.139 
intestine is the colon and just like the
small<00:00:37.469> intestine<00:00:37.980> has<00:00:38.160> multiple<00:00:38.640> parts<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
small intestine has multiple parts the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.100 
small intestine has multiple parts the
large<00:00:39.390> intestine<00:00:39.960> has<00:00:40.110> multiple<00:00:40.890> parts<00:00:42.110> food

travels<00:00:43.829> from<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.160> ileum<00:00:45.050> into<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.200> first

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
travels from the ileum into the first

travels from the ileum into the first
part<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.340> small<00:00:47.610> intestine<00:00:48.020> which<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
part of the small intestine which is the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.430 
part of the small intestine which is the
cecum<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:51.090> from<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> large<00:00:51.719> intestine<00:00:52.199> note

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
cecum so from the large intestine note

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.080 
cecum so from the large intestine note
from<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> ileum<00:00:56.180> we<00:00:57.180> go<00:00:57.390> into<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> cecum<00:00:59.090> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
from the ileum we go into the cecum the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.649 
from the ileum we go into the cecum the
cecum<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.140> little<00:01:01.410> pouch<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.000 

because<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.810> ileum<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.470> long<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
because the ileum is so long and the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.730 
because the ileum is so long and the
jejunum<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:08.970> long<00:01:09.260> basically<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:10.530> i'm

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
jejunum is so long basically if i'm

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.250 
jejunum is so long basically if i'm
going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.040> if<00:01:11.340> we're<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.630> expect<00:01:13.080> that

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
going to if we're going to expect that

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.450 
going to if we're going to expect that
you<00:01:13.320> know<00:01:13.439> from<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.920> gross<00:01:14.159> anatomy

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you know from a gross anatomy

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.969 
you know from a gross anatomy
perspective<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:15.930> part<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.680> small

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
perspective what part of the small

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.789 
perspective what part of the small
intestine<00:01:17.009> are<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.450> you're<00:01:19.320> close<00:01:19.770> to

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
intestine are we in if you're close to

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.440 
intestine are we in if you're close to
the<00:01:20.159> large<00:01:20.400> intestine<00:01:20.549> if<00:01:21.000> you're<00:01:21.150> close<00:01:21.420> to

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
the large intestine if you're close to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.109 
the large intestine if you're close to
the<00:01:21.750> cecum<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.070> know<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.759> are<00:01:23.939> in

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
the cecum then you know that you are in

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.289 
the cecum then you know that you are in
the<00:01:24.299> ileum<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:26.009> cecum<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.820> little<00:01:27.090> pouch

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
the ileum the cecum this little pouch

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.880 
the ileum the cecum this little pouch
the<00:01:28.229> appendix<00:01:29.130> actually<00:01:29.759> hangs<00:01:30.180> off<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.890> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the appendix actually hangs off of the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.340 
the appendix actually hangs off of the
cecum<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.000> appendix<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.540> literally<00:01:34.200> this

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
cecum and the appendix is literally this

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.190 
cecum and the appendix is literally this
little<00:01:34.650> wormy<00:01:35.070> thing<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:36.000> hangs<00:01:36.689> off<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.079> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
little wormy thing that hangs off of the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.109 
little wormy thing that hangs off of the
pouch<00:01:37.549> now<00:01:38.689> this<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.869> awesome<00:01:40.320> because<00:01:41.119> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
pouch now this is awesome because the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.999 
pouch now this is awesome because the
cecum<00:01:43.189> food<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.640> cecum<00:01:44.970> travels<00:01:46.009> upward

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
cecum food in the cecum travels upward

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.330 
cecum food in the cecum travels upward
in<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.930> ascending<00:01:48.930> colon<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.979> then<00:01:52.979> it

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
in the ascending colon and then it

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.620 
in the ascending colon and then it
trapped<00:01:54.030> travels<00:01:54.979> across<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:57.090> transverse

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
trapped travels across in the transverse

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
trapped travels across in the transverse
colon

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.500 

and<00:02:02.610> then<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.810> travels<00:02:04.290> down<00:02:04.760> in<00:02:05.760> the

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
and then it travels down in the

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:15.020 
and then it travels down in the
descending<00:02:07.140> colon<00:02:11.870> what<00:02:12.870> how<00:02:13.830> nice<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.520> that

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
descending colon what how nice is that

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.400 
descending colon what how nice is that
and<00:02:15.200> then<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.590> travels<00:02:17.340> through<00:02:17.460> kind<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.120> an

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
and then it travels through kind of an

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.800 
and then it travels through kind of an
s-shaped<00:02:19.850> space<00:02:20.870> no<00:02:21.870> tube<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.820> s-shaped

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
s-shaped space no tube and that s-shaped

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.250 
s-shaped space no tube and that s-shaped
tube<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.350> called<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.830> sigmoid<00:02:27.080> does<00:02:28.080> that

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
tube is called the sigmoid does that

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.360 
tube is called the sigmoid does that
sound<00:02:28.590> like<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:29.040> curly<00:02:29.780> word<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.920> sigmoid

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
sound like a curly word the sigmoid

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.640 
sound like a curly word the sigmoid
colon<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.970> then<00:02:34.010> rectum<00:02:35.010> means<00:02:35.810> straight<00:02:36.810> so

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
colon and then rectum means straight so

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.120 
colon and then rectum means straight so
the<00:02:37.830> tube<00:02:38.150> sigmoids<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.890> then<00:02:40.890> it

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
the tube sigmoids and then it

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.550 
the tube sigmoids and then it
straightens<00:02:41.880> out<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.960> your<00:02:43.170> rectum

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
straightens out and that is your rectum

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.180 
straightens out and that is your rectum
the<00:02:44.460> rectum<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:44.940> straight<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:46.530> rectum<00:02:46.890> is

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
the rectum is straight and the rectum is

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.570 
the rectum is straight and the rectum is
where<00:02:47.550> dude<00:02:47.970> we're<00:02:48.180> on<00:02:48.360> our<00:02:48.660> way<00:02:48.690> out<00:02:49.580> only

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
absorption of nutrients happens in the

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.199 
absorption of nutrients happens in the
small<00:03:45.810> intestine<00:03:46.350> there<00:03:46.650> is<00:03:46.830> some<00:03:47.340> nutrient

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
small intestine there is some nutrient

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.640 
small intestine there is some nutrient
absorption<00:03:48.330> that<00:03:48.870> happens<00:03:49.200> in<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.440> large

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
absorption that happens in the large

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.770 
absorption that happens in the large
intestine<00:03:50.190> but<00:03:50.310> most<00:03:50.670> of<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.330> water

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
intestine but most of it is water

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.979 
intestine but most of it is water
absorption<00:03:52.709> so<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.610> function<00:03:54.300> of<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.780> large

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
absorption so the function of the large

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.870 
absorption so the function of the large
intestine<00:03:55.170> really<00:03:55.830> is<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.220> absorb<00:03:56.580> water

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
intestine really is to absorb water

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.360 
intestine really is to absorb water
we've<00:03:57.600> got<00:03:57.630> some<00:03:57.959> important<00:03:58.470> nutrients<00:03:59.100> that

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
we've got some important nutrients that

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.930 
we've got some important nutrients that
are<00:03:59.670> produced<00:04:00.480> by<00:04:00.570> bacteria<00:04:00.890> what<00:04:01.940> bacteria

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
are produced by bacteria what bacteria

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.420 
are produced by bacteria what bacteria
make<00:04:03.330> vitamin<00:04:03.780> K<00:04:04.080> in<00:04:04.410> your<00:04:04.620> large<00:04:04.860> intestine

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
make vitamin K in your large intestine

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.479 
make vitamin K in your large intestine
and<00:04:05.610> then<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.420> absorb<00:04:06.959> that<00:04:07.170> which<00:04:07.920> that's

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
and then you absorb that which that's

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.780 
and then you absorb that which that's
awesome<00:04:09.500> so<00:04:10.500> there<00:04:10.650> is<00:04:10.829> some<00:04:11.130> absorption<00:04:11.489> of

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
awesome so there is some absorption of

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.280 
awesome so there is some absorption of
important<00:04:12.269> stuff<00:04:12.420> that's<00:04:12.660> happening<00:04:13.049> in<00:04:13.200> your

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
large intestine but for the most part

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:15.850 
large intestine but for the most part
its<00:04:15.299> water

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
its water

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.180
