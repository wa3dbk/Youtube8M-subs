00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
track this is head shake hills I believe

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.910 
track this is head shake hills I believe
three<00:00:21.240> laps<00:00:21.449> AI<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.650> hardest

three laps AI is on the hardest

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.759 
three laps AI is on the hardest
difficulty<00:00:23.220> which<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.609> all<00:00:23.880> time<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:25.500> think

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
difficulty which is all time and I think

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.259 
difficulty which is all time and I think
I'm<00:00:25.859> gonna<00:00:26.010> go<00:00:26.070> for<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.279> 25<00:00:26.730> second<00:00:27.119> head<00:00:27.240> start

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
one but it's one that I never really got

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.240 
one but it's one that I never really got
the<00:00:41.280> hang<00:00:41.550> out<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.270> I've<00:00:43.230> been<00:00:43.350> doing<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.890> few

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the hang out so I've been doing a few

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.190 
the hang out so I've been doing a few
little<00:00:44.430> Moto's<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.420> getting<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> little

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
little Moto's on it and getting a little

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.569 
little Moto's on it and getting a little
bit<00:00:46.350> better<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.010> definitely<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.370> fun

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
bit better and it's definitely a fun

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.069 
bit better and it's definitely a fun
track<00:00:47.879> once<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.329> kind<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> hang<00:00:48.960> of

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
track once you kind of get the hang of

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.090 
track once you kind of get the hang of
it<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:50.270> here<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.420> go<00:00:51.660> see<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.710> clear<00:00:52.920> this

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
it so here we go see if I can clear this

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.799 
it so here we go see if I can clear this
still<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.670> little<00:00:53.850> sketch<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.539> first

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
still a little sketch you see that first

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.119 
still a little sketch you see that first
part<00:00:55.250> not<00:00:56.250> bad<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.550> usually<00:00:56.969> take<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.239> outside

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
part not bad I usually take this outside

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.680 
part not bad I usually take this outside
cut<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.850> can<00:00:59.969> launch<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.270> pretty

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
cut in so you can launch that pretty

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.740 
cut in so you can launch that pretty
easy<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.410> then<00:01:01.530> cut<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:02.000> inside<00:01:03.000> there<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
easy and then cut this inside there and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.230 
easy and then cut this inside there and
again<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.739> lot<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.250> inside<00:01:05.580> lines<00:01:05.820> there<00:01:06.060> at<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
again a lot of inside lines there at the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.060 
again a lot of inside lines there at the
beginning<00:01:06.439> commander<00:01:07.439> because<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.920> just

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
beginning commander because this is just

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.310 
beginning commander because this is just
a<00:01:08.130> little<00:01:08.310> floater<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.900> don't<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.200> be

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
a little floater so you don't have to be

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.469 
a little floater so you don't have to be
going<00:01:10.470> get<00:01:10.830> too<00:01:10.950> much<00:01:11.100> momentum<00:01:11.250> into<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.970> way

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
going get too much momentum into it way

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.800 
going get too much momentum into it way
wide<00:01:12.810> there<00:01:13.670> that's<00:01:14.670> okay<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.420> wasn't<00:01:15.600> very

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
wide there that's okay that wasn't very

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.080 
wide there that's okay that wasn't very
pretty<00:01:16.080> but<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:17.159> alright<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.820> little

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
pretty but it's alright it's a little

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.859 
pretty but it's alright it's a little
scrub<00:01:18.420> into<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.500> roller<00:01:19.830> section<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:21.720> got

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
scrub into this roller section you got

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.060 
scrub into this roller section you got
to<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.080> kind<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.380> go<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> flow<00:01:22.770> of

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
to just kind of go with the flow of

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.100 
to just kind of go with the flow of
there<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.580> move<00:01:23.759> move<00:01:24.240> your<00:01:24.390> body<00:01:24.570> around<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
there and move move your body around a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.209 
there and move move your body around a
lot

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
lot

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.520 
lot
inside<00:01:28.030> I'm<00:01:28.539> not<00:01:28.719> sure<00:01:28.990> if<00:01:29.109> I'll<00:01:29.229> still<00:01:29.439> be

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
inside I'm not sure if I'll still be

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.139 
inside I'm not sure if I'll still be
able<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.710> clear<00:01:29.979> this<00:01:30.189> I<00:01:30.369> usually<00:01:30.520> launch<00:01:30.850> this

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
able to clear this I usually launch this

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.080 
able to clear this I usually launch this
whole<00:01:31.329> thing<00:01:31.630> but<00:01:31.960> that<00:01:32.170> was<00:01:32.259> a<00:01:32.289> little<00:01:32.439> sloppy

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
whole thing but that was a little sloppy

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.490 
whole thing but that was a little sloppy
I'm<00:01:34.479> just<00:01:34.659> want<00:01:34.780> to<00:01:34.840> try<00:01:34.929> to<00:01:34.990> put<00:01:35.170> in<00:01:35.289> some

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
I'm just want to try to put in some

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.149 
I'm just want to try to put in some
decently<00:01:36.009> quick<00:01:36.850> smooth<00:01:37.210> laps<00:01:37.600> here<00:01:38.170> at<00:01:38.350> the

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
decently quick smooth laps here at the

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.099 
decently quick smooth laps here at the
beginning<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:39.969> usually<00:01:40.090> try<00:01:40.359> to<00:01:40.390> triple<00:01:40.899> that

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
beginning you usually try to triple that

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:45.959 
beginning you usually try to triple that
there<00:01:41.799> but<00:01:42.280> I<00:01:42.869> messed<00:01:43.869> it<00:01:44.020> up<00:01:44.609> as<00:01:45.609> you<00:01:45.759> can<00:01:45.850> see

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
there but I messed it up as you can see

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.279 
there but I messed it up as you can see
I'm<00:01:46.060> obviously<00:01:46.270> doing<00:01:46.719> this<00:01:46.810> as<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.020> live

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
I'm obviously doing this as a live

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.339 
I'm obviously doing this as a live
commentary<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.670> I'm<00:01:48.759> playing<00:01:49.030> while<00:01:49.299> I<00:01:49.329> try<00:01:50.319> to

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:50.349 
commentary so I'm playing while I try to

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:53.490 
commentary so I'm playing while I try to
talk<00:01:50.649> and<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:52.420> makes<00:01:52.599> it<00:01:52.750> interesting<00:01:53.020> that's

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
talk and it makes it interesting that's
