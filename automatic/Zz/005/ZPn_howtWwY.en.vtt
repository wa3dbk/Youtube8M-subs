 pacifist guards is that the one in front

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.989
 let's talk about the difficulty 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.349
 I do not want to say that the game is 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.060
 easy but one looks how many guards have 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.160
 got around I guess not 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.870
 I have the slightest good opportunity 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.100
 even so let's try and see how 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.100
 we were given to see 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.150
 those days the stretches here I have it free 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.860
 in case I want to masturbate not by 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.500
 tell you how good I am again if it is that 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.720
 look at this deployment I feel very 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.840
 male is not that the game is easy in 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.819
 absolute not much less but what 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.370
 true is that fuck is that I'm very good 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.380
 is that it is so I am very good and I have a 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.290
 incredible technique then as you see the 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.600
 enemies leave me about 2 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.880
 seconds with that exclamation in red and 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.490
 If I do not today I'm going to attack you but they scream 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.530
 who attacked you then you already tell you 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.919
 that fuck tell you a little no because if 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.110
 it would not be impossible, yes, I am that soldier 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.520
 seeing all the let's say carpet of 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.529
 corpses that are just below 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.659
 we would think maybe 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.659
 It's better for me to run but you're a 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:42.849
 brave he says no no no no no yo yo yo 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:42.849
