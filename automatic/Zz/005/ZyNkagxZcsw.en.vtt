00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
made the other round reincarnation wrong

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.069 
made the other round reincarnation wrong
series<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.640> what<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.000> one<00:00:36.239> okay<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.780> one

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
series so what is this one okay this one

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.100 
series so what is this one okay this one
is<00:00:37.260> based<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.520> size<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.059> mod<00:00:39.210> 10<00:00:39.480> point<00:00:39.750> 1

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
is based on size and mod 10 point 1

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.139 
is based on size and mod 10 point 1
point<00:00:40.350> 6<00:00:41.100> which<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.670> latest<00:00:41.940> one<00:00:42.090> I

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
point 6 which is the latest one I

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.889 
point 6 which is the latest one I
believe<00:00:42.860> that<00:00:43.860> means<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.460> 4.2<00:00:45.180> base<00:00:45.570> from

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
believe that means it's a 4.2 base from

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.650 
believe that means it's a 4.2 base from
so<00:00:46.170> let's<00:00:46.469> go<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> settings<00:00:48.620> about<00:00:49.620> phone<00:00:50.660> you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
so let's go to settings about phone you

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.170 
so let's go to settings about phone you
can<00:00:52.289> see<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:53.190> point-to-point<00:00:53.460> tube<00:00:54.000> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
can see it is for point-to-point tube a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.720 
can see it is for point-to-point tube a
strong<00:00:55.010> cm<00:00:56.010> 10.1<00:00:56.730> point<00:00:57.480> six<00:00:57.930> okay<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.399> what

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
strong cm 10.1 point six okay so what

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.670 
strong cm 10.1 point six okay so what
that<00:00:59.760> means<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.020> kind<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
that means is that this is kind of a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.189 
that means is that this is kind of a
older<00:01:02.370> version<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.760> Android<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.420> considering

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
older version of Android but considering

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.120 
older version of Android but considering
the<00:01:04.229> galaxy<00:01:04.769> ace<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.700> probably<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.330> best

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
the galaxy ace it is probably the best

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.280 
the galaxy ace it is probably the best
new<00:01:08.130> roms<00:01:08.490> musician<00:01:09.210> from<00:01:09.390> after<00:01:09.840> four<00:01:10.080> point

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
new roms musician from after four point

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.429 
new roms musician from after four point
out<00:01:10.460> it<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.729> kind<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.270> best<00:01:12.510> rom<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.049> run

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
out it is kind of the best rom to run

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.999 
out it is kind of the best rom to run
for<00:01:13.770> 13<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:14.640> very<00:01:15.330> useful<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.380> be<00:01:16.530> run<00:01:16.799> on

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
for 13 is not very useful to be run on

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.200 
for 13 is not very useful to be run on
this<00:01:17.720> phone<00:01:18.720> yet<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.439> 4.4<00:01:20.340> will<00:01:20.640> only<00:01:20.909> be

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
this phone yet and 4.4 will only be

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.570 
this phone yet and 4.4 will only be
available<00:01:21.420> after<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.990> while<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.439> guess<00:01:22.710> 4.4<00:01:23.400> will

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
available after a while I guess 4.4 will

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.080 
available after a while I guess 4.4 will
be<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.939> bit<00:01:24.479> more<00:01:24.810> useful<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.040> case<00:01:26.490> range

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
be a bit more useful in the case range

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.990 
be a bit more useful in the case range
because<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.659> only<00:01:27.869> request<00:01:28.290> 54<00:01:28.680> MB<00:01:28.950> RAM<00:01:29.000> well

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
because it only request 54 MB RAM well

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.840 
because it only request 54 MB RAM well
this<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.479> doesn't<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.840> 550<00:01:31.590> mb<00:01:32.040> ram<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.549> II

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
this one doesn't have 550 mb ram but II

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.280 
this one doesn't have 550 mb ram but II
I<00:01:33.299> can<00:01:34.229> run<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.460> let's<00:01:35.939> go<00:01:36.720> through<00:01:36.750> the
