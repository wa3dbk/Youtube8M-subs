00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.290
 for some time it was believed that the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.400
 human brain does not produce new 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.930
 neurons 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.150
 it is as if throughout our life our 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.429
 brain was only losing its neurons 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.780
 as we use them but the search 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.469
 scientist has shown that this is not 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.660
 truth 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.490
 our brain produces several neurons 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.490
 newborn every day 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.390
 we call neurogenesis the process of 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.500
 generation of new neurons in the brain 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.000
 of the animals 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.920
 believed that only during the 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.960
 initial development of the animal could 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.300
 new nerve cells are generated but 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.980
 today there is ample evidence that 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.809
 neurogenesis occurs throughout life 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.270
 adult we can also produce 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.920
 thousands of new cells daily 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.820
 which integrated different parts of the 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.110
 our body 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.940
 some of these cells become 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.100
 neurons that integrate our system 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.199
 a region of the hippocampus called 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.670
 is the cradle of many 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.519
 of these new neurons 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.379
 The sad part is that it is similar to 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.210
 sea turtles that barely leave the 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.400
 and have seen many times 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.979
 food from many hungry predators 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.449
 Neuropsies die soon 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.310
 one more thing that scientists 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.869
 found is that there are things that we 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.090
 we can do to keep these 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.010
 live neurons for much longer 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.900
 different researches showed that 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.850
 learning new things may allow 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.590
 these neurons survive in the brain but 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.360
 It's not just you to go out learning any 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.979
 there is something new that 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.740
 probability of new neurons 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.840
 survive the all-indicating the greatest 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.790
 survival of new neurons depends on 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.430
 especially learning things 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.070
 difficult situations that require more effort 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.660
 learn a new language plus it's worth 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.340
 emphasize that the effects of learning 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.560
 of new things in the survival of 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.380
 depends on the production of new 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.030
 neurons learn new things will not 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.370
 necessarily increase the number of 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.840
 General neurons in your brain but can 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.300
 to make the neurons that had 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.010
 been generated survive longer 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.409
 we know things like practices 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.659
 Sports sexual activity and to 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.100
 even some medications may increase 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.290
 the production of neurons 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.960
 at the same time as aging 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.120
 stress and lack of sleep and the consumption of 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.380
 drugs such as alcohol reduces the production of 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.509
 neurons 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.909
 regardless of whether the new neurons 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.340
 will survive or can not 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:15.800
 depend entirely on you and who you leave 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.720
 winning with this is also you know a 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.640
 task that will require great effort and 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.900
 probably produce several neurons 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.329
 for the brain to use
