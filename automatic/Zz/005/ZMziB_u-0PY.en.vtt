he's<00:00:41.030> pulling<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:41.810> yarn<00:00:42.080> after<00:00:42.590> he's<00:00:42.710> tied<00:00:42.980> it

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
he's pulling the yarn after he's tied it

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.100 
he's pulling the yarn after he's tied it
on<00:00:43.310> and<00:00:43.760> pulling<00:00:44.360> it<00:00:44.570> right<00:00:44.600> through<00:00:44.930> the

on and pulling it right through the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:56.770 
on and pulling it right through the
machine<00:00:45.230> through<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:46.010> different<00:00:46.340> guides<00:00:55.780> I'm

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
machine through the different guides I'm

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.200 
machine through the different guides I'm
gonna<00:00:56.960> come<00:00:57.200> around<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.710> other<00:00:57.940> knot<00:00:58.940> is

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
gonna come around to the other knot is

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.560 
gonna come around to the other knot is
after<00:00:59.600> came<00:00:59.870> through<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.230> last<00:01:01.330> thread<00:01:02.330> guide

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
after came through the last thread guide

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.090 
after came through the last thread guide
now<00:01:02.870> it's<00:01:03.080> going<00:01:03.410> through<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.710> loop<00:01:03.920> where

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
now it's going through the loop where

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.710 
now it's going through the loop where
he's<00:01:04.220> pulling<00:01:04.670> it<00:01:04.790> through<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.059> loop<00:01:05.210> er<00:01:05.570> if

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
he's pulling it through the loop er if

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.450 
he's pulling it through the loop er if
you<00:01:05.840> tie<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.110> knot<00:01:06.290> tight<00:01:06.740> enough<00:01:07.040> it'll<00:01:07.220> pull

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
you tie the knot tight enough it'll pull

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.760 
you tie the knot tight enough it'll pull
right<00:01:07.640> on<00:01:07.700> through<00:01:08.120> as<00:01:08.270> you<00:01:08.450> can<00:01:08.600> see<00:01:08.840> he<00:01:09.590> has

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
right on through as you can see he has

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.400 
right on through as you can see he has
the<00:01:09.800> knot<00:01:10.160> now<00:01:10.460> he's<00:01:10.670> gonna<00:01:10.820> cut<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:11.290> and<00:01:12.290> now

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
the knot now he's gonna cut it and now

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.790 
the knot now he's gonna cut it and now
he's<00:01:12.680> threaded<00:01:13.220> in<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:14.540> looper<00:01:15.229> yarn<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:15.740> the

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
he's threaded in the looper yarn in the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.130 
he's threaded in the looper yarn in the
serger<00:01:16.670> so<00:01:17.000> now<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.300> next<00:01:17.570> thing<00:01:17.869> he's<00:01:17.990> going

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
serger so now the next thing he's going

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.450 
serger so now the next thing he's going
to<00:01:18.200> do<00:01:18.350> he's<00:01:18.500> going<00:01:18.680> to<00:01:18.740> switch<00:01:19.010> the<00:01:19.220> top

thread on the top we sell white and

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.310 
thread on the top we sell white and
black<00:01:28.670> thread<00:01:29.030> for<00:01:29.360> different<00:01:29.720> matches<00:01:30.140> of

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
black thread for different matches of

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:41.160 
black thread for different matches of
serging<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:32.090> he's<00:01:32.270> tying<00:01:32.600> knot<00:01:33.200> in<00:01:33.440> that<00:01:33.619> also

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.950 

and<00:01:41.740> when<00:01:41.830> he<00:01:41.890> gets<00:01:42.040> to<00:01:42.190> the<00:01:42.520> tension<00:01:43.390> disks<00:01:43.780> he

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
and when he gets to the tension disks he

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.780 
and when he gets to the tension disks he
may<00:01:44.110> relieve<00:01:44.500> a<00:01:44.530> little<00:01:44.770> pressure<00:01:45.159> on<00:01:45.340> them<00:01:45.610> so

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
may relieve a little pressure on them so

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.610 
may relieve a little pressure on them so
we<00:01:45.880> can<00:01:45.970> get<00:01:46.150> it<00:01:46.270> through<00:01:46.450> I'm<00:01:47.080> gonna<00:01:47.229> pull<00:01:47.500> it

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
we can get it through I'm gonna pull it

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.810 
we can get it through I'm gonna pull it
until<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:47.979> knot<00:01:48.159> comes<00:01:48.490> down<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:50.020> he's<00:01:50.590> gonna

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
until the knot comes down and he's gonna

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.160 
until the knot comes down and he's gonna
put<00:01:51.820> his<00:01:51.909> tweezers<00:01:52.360> in<00:01:52.510> there<00:01:52.690> spread<00:01:53.020> the

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
put his tweezers in there spread the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.020 
put his tweezers in there spread the
disks<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:53.800> that<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.250> yarn<00:01:54.430> goes<00:01:54.729> through

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
disks so that the yarn goes through

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.910 
disks so that the yarn goes through
better<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.690> actual<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.140> sewing<00:01:56.500> thread<00:01:56.530> that

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
better the actual the sewing thread that

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.820 
better the actual the sewing thread that
is<00:01:57.720> you<00:01:58.720> can<00:01:58.869> see<00:01:59.080> where<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.350> knot<00:01:59.530> is<00:01:59.740> going

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
is you can see where the knot is going

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.899 
is you can see where the knot is going
through<00:02:00.340> right<00:02:00.550> there<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:06.340> right<00:02:06.400> at<00:02:06.820> least

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
through right there all right at least

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.080 
through right there all right at least
through<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:07.690> one<00:02:07.930> he's<00:02:08.350> gonna<00:02:08.500> follow<00:02:09.090> right

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
through that one he's gonna follow right

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.199 
through that one he's gonna follow right
through<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.569> way<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:10.869> was<00:02:11.020> threaded<00:02:12.209> we'll

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
through the way it was threaded we'll

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.530 
through the way it was threaded we'll
also<00:02:13.390> do<00:02:13.780> another<00:02:14.430> video<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:15.940> showing

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
also do another video on showing

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.510 
also do another video on showing
threading<00:02:17.200> from<00:02:17.380> scratch<00:02:17.770> going<00:02:18.250> through

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
threading from scratch going through

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.710 
threading from scratch going through
each<00:02:18.670> device<00:02:20.850> clarity<00:02:21.850> we<00:02:22.000> removed<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.480> side

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
each device clarity we removed the side

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.190 
each device clarity we removed the side
cover<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:23.320> you<00:02:23.350> can<00:02:23.590> see<00:02:23.890> where<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:25.200> yarn

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
cover so you can see where the yarn

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:35.660 
cover so you can see where the yarn
follows

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.820 

through<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.540> disks<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.140> under<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.530> little

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
through the disks and under that little

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.360 
through the disks and under that little
post<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:39.600> if<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.110> just<00:02:40.350> hide<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.890> your<00:02:41.069> thread

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
post and if you just hide on your thread

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.520 
post and if you just hide on your thread
you<00:02:41.490> could<00:02:41.670> pull<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.030> all<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.180> way<00:02:42.390> through

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
you could pull it all the way through

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.420 
you could pull it all the way through
and<00:02:43.530> now<00:02:43.680> he's<00:02:43.860> going<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.069> thread<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.400> back

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
and now he's going to thread it back

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:59.890 
and now he's going to thread it back
through<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.940> needle

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.750
