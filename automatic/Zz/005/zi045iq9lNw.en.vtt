00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hi everyone, guys, rooms welcome 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.480
 in this new dragon ball video 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.429
 servers dedicated to super dragon ball 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.590
 as you know the dragon ball anime between 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.360
 quotation marks is resumed after really 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.400
 many years and so in this 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.049
 episode we 're going to celebrate that 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.529
 which was the second episode of the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.760
 series 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.410
 I recommend guys we try to 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.330
 exceed 2,000 likes and if you want 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.250
 let this series of videos continue 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.840
 dedicated to super dragonball without doing 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.269
 spoiler just tell you that in this 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.849
 second episode all the attention is 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.830
 been in practice on vegeta 15 we will go to 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.170
 choose him maybe in this one 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.450
 version here and then the attention was 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.399
 also on the son of vegeta or trunks 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.230
 that at the end of dragon ball z was 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.510
 little one for which we go to choose 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.910
 he admitted that there is a version 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.329
 nice here if I'm not mistaken this is 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.410
 own outfit that to trans in 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.480
 in the anime I remember it at the moment 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.610
 anyway girls let's go and then 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.469
 we also see a little where to fight 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.690
 I would say that the industrial area can be 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.520
 do or at the capsule corporation a 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.920
 their home and here we are then in 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.840
 practice the two are training in 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.580
 virtue perhaps of further things that 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.500
 who knows can happen in the future 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.439
 I'm in dragonball now 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.000
 enemies that appear every 5 6 months 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.610
 so in their lives guys have 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.650
 I dealt with about fifty 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.790
 people who wanted at least 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.890
 conquer the earth 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.790
 then there were those who wanted to destroy things 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.130
 of this type 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.140
 dragonball super girls a series that 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.310
 I'm really enjoying it for the moment 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.560
 in the first two episodes 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.079
 do not worry I will not spoiler is not that 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.890
 was shown who knows what we say 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.750
 we are still in a peaceful climate where 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.600
 we didn't see any enemies, though 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.970
 so you can see the background 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.500
 really curious to see then how it is 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.450
 the scene will evolve 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.390
 then I know that in quotation marks you are 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.270
 releasing also the manga in Japan 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.310
 that is the various chapters of the manga and therefore 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.350
 I want to see if they go hand in hand 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.040
 or practically treat the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.829
 same thing 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.320
 or if they add things to the manga 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.700
 then in the soul and do not show 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.549
 sometimes guys always like that 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.390
 in fact in the soul being then of the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.729
 bets they have to get 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.819
 the viewer attached to the screen 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.980
 of the tv to the tablet what it is must 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.959
 do cool things add characters 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.390
 that sometimes things don't exist like that 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.130
 so now we will see exactly what 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.660
 it happens we got a little lost in 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.640
 we have not given the right chat 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.800
 attention to the clash so here it is 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.560
 we transform the super vegeta two 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.660
 trans don't think it will turn me not 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.090
 are boys how to go about serious to do 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.709
 transform the enemies that is, I explain to myself 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.470
 example trunks now you could 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.720
 transform the super sayan what I have to 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.400
 make myself to actually allow it 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.100
 to do is what is there as it can on 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.900
 encourage it to make it transform to 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.820
 moment I do not know ok there is the super 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.590
 guard I used it for no reason 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.660
 then there is a move of the meteorite crash 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.860
 guys and we really used it 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.140
 so much in the 100 videos and passes that I have 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.030
 done on dragon ball there is raga I think 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.100
 the series I made on dragon ball is 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.590
 been historical because I am that 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.840
 main there is game walkthrough with 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.410
 all of the yes has reached almost 50 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.870
 episodes 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.940
 then there was a stop joining cabbage 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.360
 move brough we talk with a flash 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.380
 final then just so many done 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.060
 other videos 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.430
 we had a blast together and 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.799
 so here it is that it destroys the 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.320
 son there is always bad him too 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.299
 towards the wife of the wife e 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.459
 so raga we won this fight 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.410
 of course to celebrate vegeta 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.760
 we make others a good idea is 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.829
 also retrace the last 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.570
 dragon ball z events then 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.519
 guys we choose this version of 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.829
 it grows to the one with the halo then 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.780
 basically in quotes he died for 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.750
 challenge kid combo then guys me 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.640
 I always recommend you follow the most of 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.680
 my series a what if dedicated to dragon 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.390
 ball of that series through also the 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.360
 your advice especially us 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.280
 we invent from alternative stories 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.080
 on the contrary concerning the world of 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.500
 dragon 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.500
 example what would have happened if it happened 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.440
 had always been good what it would be 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.980
 success if he bards that he was not dead 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.140
 had he succeeded in defeating frazer then 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.880
 lots of other things like what it would be 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.130
 success if broli had been able 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.410
 to destroy goals there was really race 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.780
 so many beautiful things we can come up with 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.270
 together and then within the limits of course 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.530
 what the game dragon boat service 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.600
 try to reconstruct through i 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.940
 fight these little stories really 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.190
 a great idea in my opinion why there 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.930
 we live something together that is different 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.120
 around you can't even see that much 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.760
 at least I believe and then it is not that it is always 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.510
 on youtube to watch what they do 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.250
 the others 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.160
 I try to concentrate more on what he does 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.110
 on what I do because we say 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.880
 that doing so many videos a day does not 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.400
 I can't even concentrate on that 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.560
 others do, but I'm dying words 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.660
 the throws I wanted somehow 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.680
 to meet you but here we are dying 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.740
 to the greatest 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.330
 I'm dying look nora gay 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.900
 to start the fight from scratch if 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.320
 give up 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.260
 here's some buu I'll put it to the mat 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.660
 come over another one over and over again 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.730
 final flash my friend 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.620
 it hurts looks with two final flashes 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.860
 guys we knocked out michael 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.050
 iii vmo smeared three supreme moves 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.600
 one after the other and we destroyed it 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.520
 so I dare say that our dear 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.830
 vegeta finally had her potuti 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.650
 estimates revenge against this cabbage of 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.950
 kit boom and how to celebrate vegeta if not 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.260
 obviously using it against goku 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.360
 in fact, little little girls without it 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.150
 you know how to spoil it 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.160
 in practice both goku and vegeta are being 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.720
 training and then maybe just in 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.790
 this clash we can see between 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.220
 quotes at what point they arrived with 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.440
 the training we make them fight at 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.030
 sanctuary of god here is called so 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.490
 obviously tears call him in 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.860
 very very different way and this for 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.270
 schooners we can consider him a man of 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.280
 lots of training 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.720
 here in fact guys right in the room 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.970
 of the spirit of the contained time 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.560
 then inside this structure yes 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.469
 a brothel is trained both times 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.419
 focus 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:10.639
 francsco years all the others so here 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.400
 in fact we will finally see if legend 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.589
 after so much effort he succeeded for certain 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.330
 at least to overcome goals 

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:21.020
 in the meantime he is taking a beating 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.430
 it is not that then it seems so however from the ci 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.710
 they took away some energy 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.629
 after the beatings now right now that is 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.930
 taking him we go with a big attack 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:31.339
 bang so you take off super energy 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.529
 guardian made the attack again 

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:35.449
 before useless then when you press super 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:36.110
 guard must do it by force for a 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:38.839
 some time 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.819
 what is a meat to me to that which arrives 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:44.569
 I heard the sound but it didn't arrive 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:47.439
 the ray of the classroom that has done 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:50.180
 it is transformed or raga is not possible 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:52.879
 then here you play hard is when the 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.860
 game gets tough vegetative comes into play 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:57.259
 guys then I let it take in the anime 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.389
 just the same and it's up to us to watch 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:01.460
 caught this made us a super 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:03.770
 dog knows to me is that we behind 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.870
 therefore we are undermining his blow 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.870
 never managed a big attack on me 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.199
 bang mom my boys vegeta unleashed 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.110
 here 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:13.879
 goku with super healthy transformation 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.490
 third level failed to 

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:18.229
 exceed us yet here has made us one 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.689
 nice combo beat us there 

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:22.339
 sent away and then delivered in a 

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:24.620
 pack we said we fucked up 

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:26.089
 but an explosion of the spirit does not 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.999
 I never did this was just for fun 

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:32.719
 here is removed and then caught in 

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:34.789
 the last final goku flash but no 

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:37.699
 and no no final lightning, instead 

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:40.159
 noses moved just in time and then 

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:43.159
 nothing I wanted to beat him 

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:45.289
 hit well like that and then let's go to 

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:47.509
 final flash guys let's see a 

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:49.699
 command coop and then finally the 

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:51.169
 revenge of vegeta has shown that with 

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:53.509
 his training finally succeeded 

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:55.610
 to overcome goku then we will see precisely six 

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:57.319

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.449
