don't<00:00:10.830> know<00:00:10.920> if<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.130> including<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.790> code

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
don't know if this is including the code

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.299 
don't know if this is including the code
number<00:00:12.509> or<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:13.230> number<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.620> code<00:00:13.889> cards<00:00:14.190> or

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
number or the number of code cards or

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.279 
number or the number of code cards or
not<00:00:14.490> but<00:00:15.000> i<00:00:15.030> believe<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.420> total<00:00:15.780> number<00:00:16.080> came

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
not but i believe the total number came

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.460 
not but i believe the total number came
up<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.650> just<00:00:17.070> under<00:00:17.449> 8,000<00:00:18.449> cards<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.020> i<00:00:19.289> think

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
up to just under 8,000 cards and i think

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.590 
up to just under 8,000 cards and i think
if<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.619> include<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.039> code<00:00:20.250> cards<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:21.270> puts<00:00:21.510> it

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
if you include the code cards it puts it

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.470 
if you include the code cards it puts it
over<00:00:21.779> 8,000<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:23.100> ideally<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:24.090> know<00:00:24.180> we'd<00:00:24.300> love

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
over 8,000 so ideally you know we'd love

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.179 
over 8,000 so ideally you know we'd love
to<00:00:24.570> get<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.720> buyer<00:00:24.930> for<00:00:24.960> one<00:00:25.740> buyer<00:00:25.980> for

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
to get a buyer for one buyer for

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.650 
to get a buyer for one buyer for
everything<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.699> would<00:00:26.910> be<00:00:26.939> even<00:00:27.539> by

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
everything but that would be even by

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.599 
everything but that would be even by
ebay<00:00:28.019> standards<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.830> over<00:00:29.429> eight<00:00:29.580> hundred

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
ebay standards like over eight hundred

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.849

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
of them all and now we're kind of

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.870 
of them all and now we're kind of
zooming<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.950> seeing<00:01:31.950> everything<00:01:32.250> else<00:01:32.640> so

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
zooming in and seeing everything else so

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.569 
zooming in and seeing everything else so
you're<00:01:33.270> seeing<00:01:33.600> exactly<00:01:33.990> what<00:01:34.409> your<00:01:34.590> game<00:01:34.799> but

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579
