00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.920
 And then people ask here to talk 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.050
 a little bit of the license transfer 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.030
 which I commented in the previous video of 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.460
 The staff's coffee shops looked good 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.660
 person does not know how it works if 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.890
 Do not know how it is 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.630
 so you're doing the application on 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.939
 brief for you here to also say that it is 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.050
 well, sure, no problem with 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.119
 as long as you're a sensible person 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.349
 a right person the right person and the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.300
 person who is growing too 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.980
 because I say it 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.380
 from the moment that the person who 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.730
 borrow your game tag or you borrow 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.170
 A person 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.840
 all your personal information 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.030
 Sunday are bound to submit by 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.950
 example your credit card details 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.980
 etc and such but let's go 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.750
 already the boot this subject comes here put 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.600
 the profile of the person on the thumb drive 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.800
 put yours in with your xbox in case 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.200
 have multiple profiles is that they can 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.870
 win two profiles here from my store 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.520
 American I like to play games or 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.229
 can also download the profile but the way 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.719
 easier to insure by pelÃ© because 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.429
 reason just playing my game tech 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:10.530
 even so in this case it would be keeping 

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:12.630
 friends had rendered uncredited 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.490
 in what I say be careful also with 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.439
 personal data because sometimes you 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.289
 lend a person in bad faith is the person 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.109
 go there and shop in his wide 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.789
 using your credit card but I 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:26.909
 I was very malicious even when 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.950
 is a friend of the brother's cousin a friend of 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.639
 Truth in a hurry, okay, I'm alone. 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.329
 I caught them there even games I picked up the exchange 

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:38.909

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.649
 he wanted both right're worth 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.319
 interesting to do the exchange Jorge 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.329
 increases our collection even now you 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.249

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.369

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.380

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.539
 limit every once in a year and that they 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.829
 can be transferred between consoles right 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.929
 close only worse your lessons of 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.580

 There you come from games, just home, that 's the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.070
 My list of games are games that I 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.080
 I have the person you choose what you 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.470
 close and send the game down 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.510
 again and again because I said 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.970
 be careful so watch close to friends 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.010
 really even if you have anyway 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.000
 the suspicious talking, the guy will catch 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.020

 make that transfer license together 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.470
 there is no problem there is a means 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.810
 interesting to microsoft provides 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.670

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.430
 to even have no no 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.260
 against indication is not illegal 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.610
 You'll only catch the game that will not 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.830
 promise you are not an evil person 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.750
 you will not use this 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.630
 opportunity to erase personal data 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.180
 and such but it is an interesting way of 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.740
 Are you having the games on time? 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.990
 but it does not have so many games 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.180
 There you meet a friend and you have 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:43.480
 many games does not seem to get tag 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:46.390
 It has 69 games downloaded here on debut 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.980
 so many games there and he ran the 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.650

 that you had some games in the new 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.730
 so it's not easy, because you do not 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.650
 will pay the young you will get a 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.490
 friend but this is an interesting way 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.960
 huh 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.900
 we know that original game is not 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.450
 cheap then who that his presence 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.490
 here in this online package 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.920
 in case of one more complete game you want 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.990
 download again there you will be 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.989
 return is to download the game 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.609
 complete for your hd to remember is that 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.370
 have to have a hd to download 8 a 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.780
 pendrive of both gigas but if it goes 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.669
 limit the amount of gold you 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.820
 will be able to download but it is a form 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.800
 interesting a way 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.600
 there is no secret, just look how 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.730
 said he transfers the stock license of 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.010
 students choose a game you want 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.820
 however to download again without problem 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.640
 some 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.050
 and soon after as I said I used it in 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.410
 pen drive shape 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.060
 You'll be logged off at the library. 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.980
 of your friend will return the pen drive 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.260
 for him and ended the energy problem 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.910
 It's quite easy to assemble your collection of 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.920
 games so you have liked who 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.590
 understands a bit about licenses 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.610
 anything and commit to the next 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.610
 people talked
