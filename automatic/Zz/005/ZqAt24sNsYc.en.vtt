00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.700
 In this video I would like to briefly 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.510
 show how easy the handling of the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.309
 mulsanne basis for this in advance on each 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.400
 case the desired longer water in 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.310
 samobor fill in mind that the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.960
 minimal applus tap fill the here 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.090
 as the name suggests, the Drain 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.849
 lies and the maximum apple quantity 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.980
 about for hÃ¼ls lucy in samovar once 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.189
 is not over- or . marked 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.170
 is fallen short of 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.910
 if the water is in it can be up 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.820
 sit on thereby the contact 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.969
 given and the process can also 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.160
 to be started 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:47.390
 I'll show you that now 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.160
 switch on the back of the aroma 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.660
 down here is one 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.230
 this switch is located 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.969
 currently down to off and 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.699
 I'll press it on right away 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.859
 So press up up here 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.090
 are also still one 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.820
 switch the upper symbol indicates that 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.500
 should be cooked and that ours 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.310
 symbol indicates that kept warm 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.900
 shall be 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.600
 I'm cooking right now 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.759
 of course I would like to press that 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.680
 cooking process when the suitcase 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.450
 is completed this switch 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:28.650
 automatically switch to keep warm 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:31.009
 but that shows again 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.009
 more accurate 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:41.590
 and that is where I start the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:43.420
 cooking process you can already see that 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.880
 now the lamp of the purchase 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.530
 shines 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.500
 once the cooking process is completed 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:55.500
 is the lamp umspringt on the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.500
 election process 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.610
 one has a loud crack now hear that 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.890
 behind the switch as just shown by 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.300
 cooking process on the keep warm process 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.530
 jumped and in front you can see that too 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.930
 to the lights Hanover indicates to me 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.920
 gets the water now you were heard 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.709
 also brought a very light 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.660
 So now I can just get the water in 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.090
 Samowar warm for a long time 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.880
 Hold depending on how long I have tea 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.580
 would like to show drink now 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.820
 in what speed the water 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:54.950
 from the samovar comes just grazes 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:58.750
 subordinate and of hope and the 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.750
 Run in desired quantity 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.600
 if you now 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.320
 I will drink it with tea, of course 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.020
 Make sure that the collector completely 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.660
 is turned back on the back 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:22.090
 back to the switch from press 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.800
 Thus, the room was stop that 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.540
 Keep water warm and then best 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.750
 Of course, still pull the power plug 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.090
 so nothing can happen and one 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.280
 long life is guaranteed yes 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.840
 it's so easy to have fun with 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.840
