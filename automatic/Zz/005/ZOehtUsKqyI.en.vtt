00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.639
 who was the father of the child you dance with damian boos 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:33.399
 I did not get melted for she was 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:35.199
 I want to do more 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:37.069
 it's my determination 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.679
 a few years ago 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:40.499
 but when it's mine 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.769
 I came to the city to do 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.769
 I had no problems 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.289
 every other day 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:51.219
 some that 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:53.319
 I was a bit more afraid 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.229
 He acted when he was a girl. 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:04:00.619
 they felt at ease unbelievable is that he arrives at the mst he denies 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.619
 so much of so much love 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:05.909
 do not roll 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.909
 a real effect I say I had this happiness 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.389
 this offer 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.389
 nathalie is looking for another 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.330
 even though you most likely even by the way it was a way 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.150
 natural you started 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.150
 that you are one of the first leaders in the world 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.680
 when we hear under this speaker we hear a lot spoken with the aek 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.680
 with a face that started in the early 60's 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:08.029
 it's people listen 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:11.559
 I heard in the United States it's a ddd radio historian 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.189
 but 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:20.460
 I honestly title that day I have not yet seen any record of the 50s 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.900
 of someone doing this with the discs after 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:27.939
