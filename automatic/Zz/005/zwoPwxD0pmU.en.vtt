the jump ring and open it a little bit
players<00:01:52.400> usually<00:01:52.759> come<00:01:52.939> in<00:01:53.060> pretty<00:01:53.180> handy<00:01:53.299> and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
players usually come in pretty handy and

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.850 
players usually come in pretty handy and
you're<00:01:55.850> gonna<00:01:56.000> try<00:01:56.299> to<00:01:56.420> get<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.530> go<00:01:57.680> through

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
you're gonna try to get it to go through

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.410 
you're gonna try to get it to go through
here<00:01:58.220> which<00:01:58.399> can<00:01:58.610> be<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.820> little<00:01:58.970> tricky

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
here which can be a little tricky

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.749 
here which can be a little tricky
because<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.409> back<00:02:00.560> of<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.799> shell<00:02:01.070> is<00:02:01.340> closed

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
because the back of the shell is closed

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:14.500 
because the back of the shell is closed
a<00:02:01.940> little<00:02:02.180> bit<00:02:05.799> there<00:02:06.799> we<00:02:06.979> got<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:14.300> then

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
a little bit there we got it and then

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.800 
a little bit there we got it and then
we'll<00:02:14.810> close<00:02:14.840> them<00:02:15.319> up<00:02:17.769> there<00:02:18.769> we<00:02:18.890> go<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:20.690> like

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
we'll close them up there we go you like

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.289 
we'll close them up there we go you like
to<00:02:20.959> spin<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.410> left<00:02:21.680> back<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.850> then<00:02:26.000> we<00:02:26.120> need

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
to spin that left back and then we need

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.390 
to spin that left back and then we need
a<00:02:26.330> second<00:02:26.870> jump<00:02:27.140> ring<00:02:27.380> otherwise<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:28.069> earring

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
a second jump ring otherwise the earring

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
a second jump ring otherwise the earring
would<00:02:28.580> hang<00:02:28.819> funny<00:02:30.489> that<00:02:31.489> jump<00:02:31.880> ring<00:02:32.120> we're
