Skarloey is and this turntable those
eight<00:00:35.420> different<00:00:36.199> ways<00:00:36.850> so<00:00:37.850> first<00:00:38.290> we're

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
eight different ways so first we're

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.560 
eight different ways so first we're
gonna<00:00:39.379> take<00:00:40.420> this<00:00:41.420> track<00:00:42.879> so<00:00:43.879> this<00:00:44.210> track

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
gonna take this track so this track

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.289 
gonna take this track so this track
lines<00:00:45.350> around<00:00:45.830> this<00:00:46.100> way<00:00:46.309> from<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.670> turntable

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:47.299 
lines around this way from the turntable

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:50.680 
lines around this way from the turntable
goes<00:00:48.019> around<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.409> bin<00:00:48.650> and<00:00:48.949> here<00:00:49.549> we<00:00:49.729> see<00:00:49.970> Luke

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
goes around the bin and here we see Luke

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.710 
goes around the bin and here we see Luke
and<00:00:52.000> Frank<00:00:53.470> with<00:00:54.470> a<00:00:54.739> quarry<00:00:55.190> train<00:00:55.659> now<00:00:56.659> you

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
and Frank with a quarry train now you

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.160 
and Frank with a quarry train now you
might<00:00:57.019> be<00:00:57.049> wondering<00:00:57.170> well<00:00:57.979> what<00:00:58.790> why<00:00:59.570> Frank

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
might be wondering well what why Frank

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.359 
might be wondering well what why Frank
is<00:01:00.500> on<00:01:01.430> here<00:01:01.940> on<00:01:02.500> this<00:01:03.500> narrow<00:01:03.830> gauge<00:01:04.129> layout

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
is on here on this narrow gauge layout

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.320 
is on here on this narrow gauge layout
as<00:01:05.030> well<00:01:05.089> as<00:01:05.420> Mike<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:06.650> Arsdale<00:01:07.189> engines<00:01:07.610> I'm

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
as well as Mike the Arsdale engines I'm

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.090 
as well as Mike the Arsdale engines I'm
just<00:01:08.780> gonna<00:01:08.930> stir<00:01:09.229> them<00:01:09.470> in<00:01:09.590> with<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:09.860> narrow

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
just gonna stir them in with the narrow

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:18.190 
just gonna stir them in with the narrow
gauge<00:01:10.310> engines<00:01:12.040> since<00:01:15.729> they<00:01:16.729> possibly<00:01:17.509> are

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
gauge engines since they possibly are

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.929 
gauge engines since they possibly are
the<00:01:18.619> same<00:01:20.469> gauge<00:01:21.469> or<00:01:21.890> whatever<00:01:22.250> I<00:01:22.520> don't<00:01:22.789> know

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
the same gauge or whatever I don't know

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.029 
the same gauge or whatever I don't know
I<00:01:23.390> just<00:01:23.750> put<00:01:23.929> them<00:01:24.109> on<00:01:24.259> here<00:01:24.700> so<00:01:26.469> it<00:01:27.469> lines

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
I just put them on here so it lines

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.340 
I just put them on here so it lines
around<00:01:28.520> there<00:01:29.829> and<00:01:30.829> then<00:01:31.189> comes<00:01:31.520> back<00:01:31.670> around

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
around there and then comes back around

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.359 
around there and then comes back around
to<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.890> turntable<00:01:34.299> where<00:01:35.299> Skarloey<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.369> and

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
to the turntable where Skarloey is and

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.929 
to the turntable where Skarloey is and
now<00:01:37.579> we're<00:01:37.820> going<00:01:37.909> to<00:01:37.999> take<00:01:38.740> this<00:01:39.740> track<00:01:40.219> next

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
now we're going to take this track next

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.529 
now we're going to take this track next
to<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.210> barrel<00:01:41.689> and<00:01:42.189> it<00:01:43.189> goes<00:01:43.520> over<00:01:43.939> here<00:01:44.329> to

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
to the barrel and it goes over here to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:51.309 
to the barrel and it goes over here to
the<00:01:44.749> shed<00:01:45.789> where<00:01:46.789> Mike<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:47.929> Duncan<00:01:48.679> are<00:01:50.319> now

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
the shed where Mike and Duncan are now

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.580 
the shed where Mike and Duncan are now
we're<00:01:51.890> gonna<00:01:51.979> go<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.569> track<00:01:53.840> beside<00:01:54.380> it

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
we're gonna go to the track beside it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.260 
we're gonna go to the track beside it
that<00:01:55.249> goes<00:01:55.490> this<00:01:55.880> way<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:56.569> here<00:01:57.469> we<00:01:57.740> have

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
that goes this way and here we have

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.980 
that goes this way and here we have
rusty<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.799> the<00:02:00.799> Sodor<00:02:01.189> cement<00:02:01.969> cars<00:02:02.299> and<00:02:02.749> in

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.530 
ebay a week ago at the making of this
video<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:44.410> these<00:02:45.410> are<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:46.730> magic<00:02:46.910> buffers

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
video and these are the magic buffers

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.440 
video and these are the magic buffers
that<00:02:49.209> lead<00:02:50.209> into<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.870> narrow<00:02:51.260> gauge<00:02:51.530> railway

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
that lead into the narrow gauge railway

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.480 
that lead into the narrow gauge railway
so<00:02:55.450> like<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.630> can<00:02:56.840> travel<00:02:57.170> on<00:02:57.650> all<00:02:58.250> the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
so like you can travel on all the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.330 
so like you can travel on all the
different<00:02:58.670> real<00:02:59.270> for<00:02:59.810> daily<00:02:59.930> wages<00:03:01.180> as<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:04.040> in

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
different real for daily wages as so in

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.880 
different real for daily wages as so in
my<00:03:04.580> series<00:03:05.680> so<00:03:07.180> she<00:03:08.180> will<00:03:08.450> appear<00:03:09.260> on<00:03:09.500> the

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
my series so she will appear on the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:17.500 
my series so she will appear on the
narrow<00:03:10.100> gauge<00:03:10.340> layout<00:03:11.410> if<00:03:12.519> she<00:03:13.519> needs<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:16.510> so

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
narrow gauge layout if she needs to so

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.830 
narrow gauge layout if she needs to so
then<00:03:17.950> this<00:03:18.950> goes<00:03:19.370> back<00:03:19.760> around<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.570> curve

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
then this goes back around the curve

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.509 
then this goes back around the curve
past<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.530> grist<00:03:21.709> mill<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:22.130> back<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.400> the

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
past the grist mill and back to the

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.330 
past the grist mill and back to the
turntable<00:03:22.760> where<00:03:23.239> skarloey's<00:03:24.220> now<00:03:25.220> we're

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
turntable where skarloey's now we're

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.300 
turntable where skarloey's now we're
gonna<00:03:25.430> take<00:03:25.730> this<00:03:26.150> track<00:03:26.660> from<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.739> turntable

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
and then we get to is V switch and we're

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.680 
and then we get to is V switch and we're
gonna<00:03:30.980> go<00:03:31.190> this<00:03:31.459> way<00:03:31.820> so<00:03:32.720> we<00:03:32.870> come<00:03:33.230> back<00:03:33.470> around

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
gonna go this way so we come back around

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:45.120 
gonna go this way so we come back around
where<00:03:35.690> we<00:03:35.750> find<00:03:37.600> Peter<00:03:38.600> Sam<00:03:39.850> at<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:42.799> junction

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
which is Provins gate in the series so

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:57.060 
which is Provins gate in the series so
it<00:03:51.200> up<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.970> around<00:03:53.870> here<00:03:54.350> onto<00:03:54.739> this<00:03:54.890> bridge

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070

and then back around this way around a

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.370 
and then back around this way around a
curve<00:04:00.260> or<00:04:00.500> we<00:04:00.650> find<00:04:00.920> Rheneas<00:04:01.820> and<00:04:02.140> then<00:04:03.140> it

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
curve or we find Rheneas and then it

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.830 
curve or we find Rheneas and then it
comes<00:04:03.620> through<00:04:03.680> to<00:04:03.950> another<00:04:04.130> switch<00:04:04.840> and

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
comes through to another switch and

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.640 
comes through to another switch and
we're<00:04:06.410> gonna<00:04:06.500> take<00:04:06.910> this<00:04:07.910> track<00:04:08.510> so<00:04:09.470> this

actually which is the V Swift right
there<00:05:53.350> and<00:05:54.350> then<00:05:55.010> that<00:05:55.730> V<00:05:56.060> switch<00:05:56.270> right<00:05:56.510> there

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
there and then that V switch right there

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.490 
there and then that V switch right there
and<00:05:57.050> then<00:05:58.010> this<00:05:58.280> switch<00:05:58.640> over<00:05:59.300> here<00:06:00.760> in<00:06:01.760> that

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
and then this switch over here in that

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.190 
and then this switch over here in that
those<00:06:03.500> are<00:06:03.680> the<00:06:03.830> three<00:06:04.130> main<00:06:04.370> pieces<00:06:05.200> that

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200
