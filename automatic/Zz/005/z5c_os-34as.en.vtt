00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.069
 what I show you today has me 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.170
 dear lore I taught you to turn it off 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.260
 on slow motion so that's exactly how it is 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.230
 it's all about fingerhakeln again 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.839
 perfect beautiful drawstring you would have 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.830
 need about two meters long 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.189
 pieces of yarn are in the middle 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.189
 simple sling 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.840
 and take this bend the right one 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.840
 index finger 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.160
 you hold the knot with your right 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.380
 hand fixed that is the end thread 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.480
 actually the right one you grasp of 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.840
 in the top of the loop with the left 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:58.790
 forefinger take the second thread 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:05.690
 through and shoot the right thread 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:09.110
 easy on so trick is now that 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.260
 These always knot from one hand to 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.979
 others change that means you pull now 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.670
 a little bit on this thread 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:23.180
 so now you hold the knot with the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:30.740
 left hand with the right index finger 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:32.650
 from the top into the loop the right one 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.910
 thread through 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.970
 Bad is on the right now 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:42.440
 index finger and the knot changes into 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:46.250
 the right hand so that you with the left 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.430
 hand to draw the thread can not 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.890
 firm but already to pull again with 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.490
 the left index finger from above into the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.729
 pull the loop and the thread through it 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.070
 node changes into the left hand with 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:06.500
 the right hand you see the sling 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:09.850
 on right index finger from above in the 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.470
 do not sling from below 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.060
 I always get upset from above 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.430
 in the loop rides by pick 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.380
 knoten changes his right hand there 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.489
 will then be so to the cord 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.709
 left hand can pull the loop 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:32.780
 with the left index finger from the top in 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.700
 The sling simply grasp the thread 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.470
 by picking 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:42.650
 the knot changes back to the left 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:45.049
 Hand and thread the thread lightly and 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.080
 again with the right index finger of 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.530
 through the thread in the top of the loop 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.530
 pick up 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.300
 Now the sling is on the right 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.310
 finger the cord changes to the right 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.360
 hand and middle left you pull the 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.250
 thread 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.250
 and so on 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.180
 and of course that works too 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.670
 You see, here's a perfect 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.650
 small cords and no knots more be there 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.470
 is already a piece of cordes always the 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.550
 hand changes from the top in the 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.620
 catch a sling 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.050
 The cord changes to the left hand 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.710
 put on so you see her a whole 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.720
 perfect nice round drawstring and 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.310
 Of course you can do it in two colors as well 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.260
 I'll show you that too 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.640
 you really have to know that 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.190
 long piece of thread 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.470
 you have to try a little bit 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.020
 how much thread through a piece of cord 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.360
 I need've been here now two threads 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.360
 taken a simple sling made 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.390
 we do not need the short threads and 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.420
 the long threads 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.830
 then we put left and right again 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.020
 apart 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.460
 and make it just the same 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.620
 we take the loop from above 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.750
 take the different colored rides it 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.130
 even easier because you two 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:18.380
 different colors have hold the 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:22.340
 tighten knot tighten the thread of 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:26.780
 in the loop thread tighten up 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:29.000
 put on another color so tighten 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.530
 just about my finished we go here 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:38.030
 it a bit easier if you then 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:39.650
 always the other color by pulling and 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.070
 Of course , it also looks bicoloured 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.120
 so funny out a perfect one 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.120
 draw a lot of fun with it
