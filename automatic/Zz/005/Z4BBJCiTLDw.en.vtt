end I had an old drill truck lying

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.280 
end I had an old drill truck lying
around<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.330> I<00:02:29.420> thought<00:02:29.660> looked<00:02:29.690> pretty<00:02:30.080> good

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
around that I thought looked pretty good

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.140 
around that I thought looked pretty good
glued<00:02:30.770> in<00:02:30.920> there<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.280> that's<00:02:31.430> that's<00:02:31.880> what<00:02:32.060> I

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
glued in there so that's that's what I

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.880 
glued in there so that's that's what I
use<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.870> don't<00:02:32.959> have<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.350> do<00:02:33.500> that<00:02:33.680> if<00:02:33.800> you

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
use you don't have to do that if you

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.530 
use you don't have to do that if you
want<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.280> can<00:02:34.459> just<00:02:34.640> use<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.970> end<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.420> the
