00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
let's talk a little bit about sideshow I

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.660

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
know the DLC is like somewhat old at

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.889 
know the DLC is like somewhat old at
this<00:01:41.789> point<00:01:41.880> no<00:01:42.149> it's<00:01:42.270> been<00:01:42.389> out<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.719> little

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
this point no it's been out for a little

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.199 
this point no it's been out for a little
bit<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.740> sideshow<00:01:44.189> ever<00:01:44.399> since<00:01:44.639> I<00:01:44.759> saw<00:01:44.969> like
