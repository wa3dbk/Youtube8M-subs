why would you put all the effort into
doing<00:00:49.800> great<00:00:50.190> things<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.180> first<00:00:51.480> place<00:00:51.840> so

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
doing great things in the first place so

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.470

what<00:00:52.890> if<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.250> ended<00:00:53.579> world<00:00:53.820> hunger

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
what if you ended world hunger

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.540 
what if you ended world hunger
you<00:00:54.570> didn't<00:00:54.930> truly<00:00:55.320> save<00:00:55.620> anyone's<00:00:56.219> life

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
you didn't truly save anyone's life

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.569 
you didn't truly save anyone's life
putting<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.840> hard<00:00:58.079> effort<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.680> analogous<00:00:59.250> as

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
putting in a hard effort is analogous as

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.330 
putting in a hard effort is analogous as
Albert<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.570> put<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> man<00:01:01.739> pushing<00:01:02.250> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
Albert can you put it to a man pushing a
