00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
hello everybody today I'm going to show

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.630 
hello everybody today I'm going to show
you<00:00:02.460> this<00:00:02.639> GE<00:00:03.060> hybrid<00:00:03.929> flood<00:00:04.290> bulb<00:00:04.589> now<00:00:05.520> these

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
you this GE hybrid flood bulb now these

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.099 
you this GE hybrid flood bulb now these
have<00:00:05.790> been<00:00:05.940> out<00:00:06.060> for<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.299> while<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.750> I've<00:00:06.870> had

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
have been out for a while and I've had

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.530 
have been out for a while and I've had
this<00:00:07.350> for<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.980> while<00:00:08.099> I've<00:00:08.700> got<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:09.120> when<00:00:09.360> it

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
this for a while I've got it when it

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.330 
this for a while I've got it when it
first<00:00:10.290> came<00:00:10.590> out<00:00:10.740> cuz<00:00:10.920> I<00:00:10.980> thought<00:00:11.160> it<00:00:11.250> was

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
first came out cuz I thought it was

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.970 
first came out cuz I thought it was
really<00:00:11.670> interesting<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.590> spinoff

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
really interesting and this is a spinoff

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.540 
really interesting and this is a spinoff
from<00:00:14.929> the<00:00:15.929> first<00:00:16.199> ones<00:00:16.560> which<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.010> actually<00:00:17.460> an

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
from the first ones which is actually an

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.179 
from the first ones which is actually an
a-shaped<00:00:18.029> bulb<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.289> there's<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.680> halogen

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
a-shaped bulb and there's the halogen

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.370 
a-shaped bulb and there's the halogen
capsule<00:00:20.609> on<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.789> inside<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.359> was<00:00:21.510> also<00:00:21.689> when

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
capsule on the inside this was also when

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.320 
capsule on the inside this was also when
they<00:00:22.500> first<00:00:22.710> came<00:00:23.100> out<00:00:24.289> and<00:00:25.849> this<00:00:26.849> one<00:00:27.119> is

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
they first came out and this one is

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.480 
they first came out and this one is
daylight<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:28.980> really<00:00:29.250> tell<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
daylight so you can really tell the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.749 
daylight so you can really tell the
difference<00:00:29.580> between<00:00:30.679> halogen<00:00:31.679> bulb<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
difference between halogen bulb and the

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.030 
difference between halogen bulb and the
daylight<00:00:33.149> CFL<00:00:33.660> which<00:00:33.840> i<00:00:33.989> think<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.410> pretty

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
daylight CFL which i think is pretty

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.100 
daylight CFL which i think is pretty
cool<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.640> also<00:00:36.180> think<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.570> neat<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.960> can

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
cool I also think it's neat that you can

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.729 
cool I also think it's neat that you can
see<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.410> ballasts<00:00:37.829> down<00:00:38.129> here<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:39.620> don't<00:00:40.620> get<00:00:40.710> a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
see the ballasts down here I don't get a

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.110 
see the ballasts down here I don't get a
closer<00:00:40.950> look<00:00:41.219> at<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.610> minute

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
closer look at that in a minute

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.020 
closer look at that in a minute
but<00:00:42.899> here's<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.260> packaging<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.950> see<00:00:44.879> that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
but here's the packaging I see that

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.970 
but here's the packaging I see that
these<00:00:45.120> also<00:00:45.480> come<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.780> boxes<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.680> guess

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
these also come in boxes but I guess

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.799 
these also come in boxes but I guess
when<00:00:47.129> they<00:00:47.219> first<00:00:47.430> came<00:00:47.640> out<00:00:47.700> there<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.270> these

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
when they first came out there and these

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:58.790 
when they first came out there and these
plastic<00:00:49.469> things<00:00:51.890> here's<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> back<00:00:57.800> let's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
plastic things here's the back let's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.930 
plastic things here's the back let's
take<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.250> out<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.520> here<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:01.760> let's<00:01:02.760> get<00:01:02.879> a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
take it out of here so let's get a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.530 
take it out of here so let's get a
closer<00:01:03.180> look<00:01:03.449> at<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.690> ballast<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:09.270> there<00:01:09.420> you

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
closer look at this ballast so there you

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.730 
closer look at this ballast so there you
go<00:01:12.200> see<00:01:13.200> all<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> circuitry<00:01:15.740> it's

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
go see all the circuitry it's

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.260 
go see all the circuitry it's
interesting<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.430> kind<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.850> circuit

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
interesting you kind of have a circuit

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.950 
interesting you kind of have a circuit
board<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.689> then<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> branch<00:01:19.170> off<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:20.960> try

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
board and then a branch off of one try

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.679 
board and then a branch off of one try
to<00:01:21.990> fit<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.740> there<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.479> very<00:01:24.479> nice

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
to fit it all in there it's very nice

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.510 
to fit it all in there it's very nice
and<00:01:24.869> shiny<00:01:25.580> how's<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.729> going<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:28.520> there

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and shiny how's it going and there

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.069 
and shiny how's it going and there
should<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.790> an<00:01:29.939> etch<00:01:30.119> oh<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.570> course<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:30.960> all

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
should be an etch oh of course it's all

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.530 
should be an etch oh of course it's all
the<00:01:31.140> way<00:01:31.229> around<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> bottom<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:32.390> which<00:01:33.390> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
the way around the bottom here which you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.260 
the way around the bottom here which you
can't<00:01:33.780> Sikhs<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.729> ballast<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.150> way

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
can't Sikhs the ballast is in the way

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.460 
can't Sikhs the ballast is in the way
but<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.740> 15<00:01:37.740> watt<00:01:38.659> 120<00:01:39.659> volt<00:01:42.170> in<00:01:43.170> here<00:01:43.350> we

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
but it's 15 watt 120 volt in here we

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.179 
but it's 15 watt 120 volt in here we
have<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.280> CFL<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.939> they're<00:01:45.509> halogen<00:01:46.189> capsule

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
have the CFL and they're halogen capsule

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.760 
have the CFL and they're halogen capsule
in<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.000> inside<00:01:48.799> so<00:01:50.450> let's<00:01:51.450> singing<00:01:52.409> here<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
in the inside so let's singing here and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.149 
in the inside so let's singing here and
turn<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.189> now<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.530> believe<00:01:55.530> it's<00:01:55.770> made<00:01:55.979> out

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
turn it on now I believe it's made out

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.399 
turn it on now I believe it's made out
of<00:01:56.189> glass<00:01:56.430> but<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.790> can't<00:01:57.090> really<00:01:57.270> tell<00:01:57.600> because

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
of glass but I can't really tell because

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.859 
of glass but I can't really tell because
of<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.250> seam<00:01:59.640> right<00:01:59.670> here<00:02:00.000> kind<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.630> feels

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
of the seam right here kind of feels

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.819 
of the seam right here kind of feels
like<00:02:01.009> plasticy<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.549> don't<00:02:03.420> know<00:02:03.680> anyway

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
like plasticy but I don't know anyway

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.789 
like plasticy but I don't know anyway
I'll<00:02:05.280> turn<00:02:05.640> off<00:02:05.820> these<00:02:06.060> big<00:02:06.840> lights<00:02:07.049> let's

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
I'll turn off these big lights let's

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.900 
I'll turn off these big lights let's
turn<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.160> here<00:02:08.399> we<00:02:08.459> go<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:11.190> first<00:02:11.370> off<00:02:11.670> we<00:02:11.879> have

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
turn on here we go so first off we have

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.470 
turn on here we go so first off we have
the<00:02:12.060> halogen<00:02:12.690> bulb<00:02:12.930> on

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
the halogen bulb on

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.100 
the halogen bulb on
as<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.500> can<00:02:14.620> see<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.129> it<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:15.340> very<00:02:15.550> bright<00:02:16.110> you

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
as you can see and it is very bright you

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.420 
as you can see and it is very bright you
can<00:02:17.200> see<00:02:17.409> it<00:02:17.500> there<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:17.799> doesn't<00:02:17.950> like<00:02:18.190> very

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
can see it there it doesn't like very

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.759 
can see it there it doesn't like very
evenly<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.480> camera<00:02:19.840> is<00:02:19.900> going<00:02:19.930> way<00:02:20.440> out

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
evenly and the camera is going way out

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.369 
evenly and the camera is going way out
of<00:02:20.890> focus<00:02:21.069> oh<00:02:21.480> well<00:02:22.480> we'll<00:02:22.780> fix<00:02:22.959> that<00:02:23.080> there<00:02:23.319> we

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
of focus oh well we'll fix that there we

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.899 
of focus oh well we'll fix that there we
go<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:24.489> you<00:02:24.549> start<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.299> see<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:26.430> CFL<00:02:27.430> come<00:02:27.730> in

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
go and you start to see the CFL come in

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:32.309 
go and you start to see the CFL come in
as<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.120> CFL<00:02:28.659> is<00:02:28.780> daylight<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:31.959> can<00:02:32.049> see<00:02:32.200> the

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
as a CFL is daylight so you can see the

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.550 
as a CFL is daylight so you can see the
CFLs<00:02:32.769> turning<00:02:33.129> on<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.790> course<00:02:33.940> takes<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.690> while

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
CFLs turning on of course takes a while

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.140 
CFLs turning on of course takes a while
to<00:02:35.590> do<00:02:35.980> so<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.959> you<00:02:38.019> have<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.349> halogen<00:02:39.150> capsule

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
to do so so you have the halogen capsule

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.770 
to do so so you have the halogen capsule
there<00:02:40.329> on<00:02:40.599> and<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.890> CFL<00:02:42.370> starting<00:02:43.239> to

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
there on and the CFL starting to

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.600 
there on and the CFL starting to
brighten<00:02:44.739> up<00:02:45.209> take<00:02:46.209> another<00:02:46.510> look<00:02:47.370> very<00:02:48.370> neat

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
brighten up take another look very neat

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.300 
brighten up take another look very neat
you<00:02:48.910> have<00:02:49.030> like<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:50.230> incandescent<00:02:50.590> colored

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
you have like the incandescent colored

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.300 
you have like the incandescent colored
light<00:02:51.549> with<00:02:52.060> daylight<00:02:52.629> as<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.829> can<00:02:53.950> tell<00:02:54.160> it

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
light with daylight as you can tell it

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.080 
light with daylight as you can tell it
really<00:02:54.489> lights<00:02:54.700> this<00:02:54.910> up<00:02:55.090> very<00:02:55.299> nicely<00:02:55.629> and<00:02:57.090> it

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
really lights this up very nicely and it

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.819 
really lights this up very nicely and it
does<00:02:58.299> kind<00:02:58.569> of<00:02:58.599> get<00:02:58.750> warm<00:02:58.989> but<00:02:59.470> that's<00:02:59.650> from

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
does kind of get warm but that's from

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.270 
does kind of get warm but that's from
the<00:03:00.040> halogen<00:03:00.609> bulb<00:03:01.299> that<00:03:01.690> is<00:03:01.750> long<00:03:02.109> oh<00:03:02.319> there

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
the halogen bulb that is long oh there

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.990 
the halogen bulb that is long oh there
it<00:03:03.370> goes<00:03:03.519> it<00:03:03.760> just<00:03:03.790> shut<00:03:04.450> off<00:03:04.599> and<00:03:05.730> now<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:06.819> can

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
it goes it just shut off and now you can

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.979 
it goes it just shut off and now you can
see<00:03:07.470> halogen<00:03:08.470> is<00:03:08.590> off<00:03:08.739> in<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.160> CFL<00:03:09.549> is<00:03:09.700> on<00:03:09.989> so

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
see halogen is off in the CFL is on so

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.710 
see halogen is off in the CFL is on so
the<00:03:11.109> CFL<00:03:11.500> has<00:03:11.859> taken<00:03:12.280> over<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.670> here<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.629> is

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
the CFL has taken over and here it is

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.400 
the CFL has taken over and here it is
lighting<00:03:14.620> up<00:03:14.739> this<00:03:15.040> area<00:03:15.930> get<00:03:16.930> a<00:03:16.959> better<00:03:17.140> look

at the bottom here and see more

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.370 
at the bottom here and see more
circuitry<00:03:21.880> in<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.239> inside<00:03:22.599> with<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.200> light

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380

bulb<00:03:29.919> I<00:03:30.130> really<00:03:30.370> like<00:03:30.549> it<00:03:30.700> because<00:03:30.819> you<00:03:31.150> have

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
bulb I really like it because you have

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.339 
bulb I really like it because you have
daylight<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:33.250> halogen<00:03:33.790> in<00:03:34.569> the<00:03:34.780> in<00:03:35.139> there

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
daylight and a halogen in the in there

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.620

so<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.709> have<00:03:35.829> the<00:03:35.950> two<00:03:36.130> different<00:03:36.280> shades<00:03:36.700> of

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
so you have the two different shades of

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.699 
so you have the two different shades of
light<00:03:38.079> or<00:03:38.380> colors<00:03:38.739> of<00:03:38.980> light<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:40.440> makes<00:03:41.440> for<00:03:41.650> a

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
light or colors of light and makes for a

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.400 
light or colors of light and makes for a
really<00:03:41.919> interesting<00:03:42.220> bulb<00:03:43.019> so<00:03:44.019> I<00:03:44.049> hope<00:03:44.260> you
