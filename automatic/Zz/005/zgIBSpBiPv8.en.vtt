00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.190
 and hello guys welcome to this new 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.830
 video and today is I come with another tutorial 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:20.810
 explaining how to download from aig端es 6 a 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.060
 helps 5.1.1 and if it is your case 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.170
 I will follow the tutorial I will briefly explain 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:30.030
 it is very fast how to download to the version of 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.430
 aig端es 5.1.1 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.680
 I for example install water 6 for 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.780
 try but I did not like there are some 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.620
 enough errors reboots every two 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.330
 for three 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.130
 then I'm interested in going back to the version 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:47.580
 stable the last one that is aig端es 5.1.1 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:52.500
 so for that we must have the 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:55.080
 iowa version is 5.1.1 downloaded as 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.530
 I always leave the download links 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.250
 in the description 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.040
 and download the aig端es file 5.1.1 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.450
 of your device in this case is the 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.469
 version 5.1 point 1 for iphone 4 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.590
 then we go here to shift itunes 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:17.430
 restore and we select the version of 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.090
 iwork 5.1.1 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.550
 we give it to restore and now it will start 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.670
 the whole process of restoration to the 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.250
 version 5.1 point one as you see is not 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.200
 has to do nothing of the other world nor 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.710
 arrangements contains umbrella or any 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.380
 guy like that here does not matter if 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.840
 you have the shhh saved the blogs 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.170
 saved does not matter all that 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.409
 it does not take to simply restore 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.289
 as I said shift restore and 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.560
 we selected version 5.1.1 of 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.590
 our device and that's it 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.240
 above all we have to select 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.390
 our version squeezing shift because 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.789
 if we give it to restore it will come out 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.509
 an error then as I say shift 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.829
 restore and select and nothing if 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.500
 you have any doubt 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.080
 Comment any question a 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.019
 comment below the video and I 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.880
 I will answer as soon as I read it and nothing now 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.180
 it would already be restoring the iphone to the 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.170
 version 5.1 point 1 and it simply remains 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.459
 wait for this process to be over 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.310
 and nothing to say guys always 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.200
