there's so many guys out there right now
that<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:41.479> know<00:04:41.630> they're<00:04:41.810> it's<00:04:42.560> so<00:04:42.770> hard<00:04:42.979> to

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
that you know they're it's so hard to

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.430 
that you know they're it's so hard to
come<00:04:43.250> from<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.430> back<00:04:43.550> to<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.850> front<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:44.440> if

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
come from the back to the front and if

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.200 
come from the back to the front and if
you<00:04:45.590> can<00:04:45.740> start<00:04:45.950> the<00:04:46.070> front<00:04:46.340> you<00:04:46.460> have<00:04:48.100> right

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
you can start the front you have right

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.909 
you can start the front you have right
for<00:04:50.210> me<00:04:50.360> it's<00:04:50.960> a<00:04:51.020> lot<00:04:51.139> easier<00:04:51.290> to<00:04:51.470> get<00:04:51.590> start

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
for me it's a lot easier to get start

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.500 
for me it's a lot easier to get start
and<00:04:52.310> stay<00:04:52.460> up<00:04:52.580> there<00:04:52.729> so<00:04:52.940> I<00:04:53.000> would<00:04:53.090> say<00:04:53.330> it's

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
and stay up there so I would say it's

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.629 
and stay up there so I would say it's
definitely<00:04:53.570> sad<00:04:54.110> about<00:04:54.200> for<00:04:54.620> me<00:04:54.740> okay<00:04:55.220> okay
