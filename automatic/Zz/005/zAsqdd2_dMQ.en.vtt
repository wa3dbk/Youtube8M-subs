00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
anyway it's a radiator the heat source

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.500 
anyway it's a radiator the heat source
is<00:01:10.650> my<00:01:10.800> wood<00:01:11.010> stove<00:01:11.510> from<00:01:12.510> outside

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
is my wood stove from outside

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.550 
is my wood stove from outside
and<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:14.900> water<00:01:15.170> temperature<00:01:15.650> should

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
and the water temperature should

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.770 
and the water temperature should
this<00:01:18.130> is<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.369> exit<00:01:18.850> water<00:01:19.030> temperatures<00:01:19.600> at

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
this is the exit water temperatures at

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.720 
this is the exit water temperatures at
165<00:01:20.710> degrees

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
165 degrees

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.210 
165 degrees
it<00:01:23.000> should<00:01:23.180> be<00:01:23.210> about<00:01:23.300> 165<00:01:24.110> that's<00:01:24.620> going<00:01:25.010> back

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
it should be about 165 that's going back

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.890 
it should be about 165 that's going back
out

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
out

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.670 
out
got<00:01:26.020> 185<00:01:26.710> degree<00:01:27.610> water<00:01:27.790> coming<00:01:28.330> in

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
got 185 degree water coming in

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.850 
got 185 degree water coming in
and<00:01:30.360> hoping<00:01:31.360> that<00:01:31.600> this<00:01:31.840> timing<00:01:32.650> were<00:01:32.740> going

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
and hoping that this timing were going

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.410 
and hoping that this timing were going
to<00:01:32.920> be<00:01:32.980> this<00:01:33.280> is<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:33.490> first<00:01:33.730> test<00:01:34.000> so<00:01:34.240> i'm<00:01:34.300> not

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
to be this is the first test so i'm not

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.480 
to be this is the first test so i'm not
exactly<00:01:34.750> sure<00:01:34.980> shooting<00:01:35.980> for<00:01:36.130> four<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.430> six

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490

boiler and running it plumbing it into a

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.210 
boiler and running it plumbing it into a
refrigerator<00:02:32.570> and<00:02:33.570> if<00:02:33.780> this<00:02:33.990> works<00:02:34.260> next<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.190> a

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
refrigerator and if this works next is a

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.860 
refrigerator and if this works next is a
clothes<00:02:35.550> dryer<00:02:35.820> off<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:36.510> we're<00:02:36.690> going<00:02:36.810> to

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
clothes dryer off of this we're going to

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.870 
clothes dryer off of this we're going to
try<00:02:36.990> clothes<00:02:37.290> dryer<00:02:37.590> but<00:02:37.800> I'm<00:02:38.580> looking

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
try clothes dryer but I'm looking

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.100 
try clothes dryer but I'm looking
forward<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.270> seeing<00:02:39.450> how<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:39.900> going<00:02:40.020> to

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
forward to seeing how this is going to

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.170 
forward to seeing how this is going to
work<00:02:40.290> in<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.560> checkup<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.040> rotate<00:02:41.640> these<00:02:41.820> trays

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
work in a checkup and rotate these trays

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.130 
work in a checkup and rotate these trays
probably<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.810> couple<00:02:42.960> hours<00:02:44.720> believe<00:02:45.720> that

hours rotated the trays a couple of

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.780 
hours rotated the trays a couple of
times<00:03:37.600> see<00:03:38.140> this<00:03:38.290> one<00:03:38.530> tray<00:03:38.800> is<00:03:38.980> a<00:03:39.010> little<00:03:39.580> bit

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
times see this one tray is a little bit

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
times see this one tray is a little bit
more<00:03:40.000> dry<00:03:40.600> than<00:03:40.950> than<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.130> rest<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.810> so

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
more dry than than the rest and so

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.699 
more dry than than the rest and so
that's<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.770> more<00:03:45.810> experiment<00:03:46.810> to<00:03:46.930> do<00:03:47.080> but<00:03:47.320> so

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
that's a more experiment to do but so

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.880 
that's a more experiment to do but so
far<00:03:47.920> so<00:03:47.980> good<00:03:48.600> looks<00:03:49.600> tasty<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.260> it<00:03:50.380> is<00:03:50.530> I<00:03:50.740> had

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
far so good looks tasty and it is I had

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.990 
far so good looks tasty and it is I had
some<00:03:51.070> of<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.220> teriyaki<00:03:51.520> is<00:03:51.970> very<00:03:52.180> good<00:03:52.420> and

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
some of the teriyaki is very good and

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.090 
some of the teriyaki is very good and
anyway<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.030> think<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:55.420> got<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.890> last

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
anyway I think I got the last

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.860 
anyway I think I got the last
measurement<00:03:57.880> of<00:03:58.060> temperature<00:03:58.209> i<00:03:58.510> got<00:03:58.750> was

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
measurement of temperature i got was

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.410 
measurement of temperature i got was
about<00:03:58.959> 144<00:04:00.360> 145<00:04:01.360> degrees<00:04:01.570> in<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.560> center<00:04:02.950> and

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
about 144 145 degrees in the center and

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.680 
about 144 145 degrees in the center and
so<00:04:04.420> I<00:04:04.720> believe<00:04:04.959> 140<00:04:05.590> 250<00:04:06.280> is<00:04:06.970> sufficient<00:04:07.630> to

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
so I believe 140 250 is sufficient to

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.680 
so I believe 140 250 is sufficient to
make<00:04:08.070> jerky<00:04:09.239> okay<00:04:10.239> so<00:04:10.630> so<00:04:11.170> far<00:04:11.350> so<00:04:11.470> good<00:04:11.590> and

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
make jerky okay so so far so good and

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.469 
make jerky okay so so far so good and
keep<00:04:13.690> updating<00:04:14.320> and<00:04:14.820> so<00:04:15.820> we're<00:04:16.120> able<00:04:16.209> to<00:04:16.359> get

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
the homemade would dryer I think I have

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.870

enough room to add six or seven wartrace

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.969 
enough room to add six or seven wartrace
so<00:04:43.150> we<00:04:43.240> should<00:04:43.419> be<00:04:43.510> able<00:04:43.570> to<00:04:43.690> do<00:04:43.810> 14<00:04:44.290> batches<00:04:44.830> at

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
so we should be able to do 14 batches at

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.219 
so we should be able to do 14 batches at
a<00:04:45.010> time<00:04:45.479> and<00:04:46.479> that'll<00:04:46.750> be<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:46.870> pretty<00:04:47.050> good

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.980 
a time and that'll be a pretty good
quantity<00:04:47.710> and<00:04:48.060> this<00:04:49.060> was<00:04:49.270> done<00:04:49.450> again<00:04:49.750> right

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
quantity and this was done again right

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.810
