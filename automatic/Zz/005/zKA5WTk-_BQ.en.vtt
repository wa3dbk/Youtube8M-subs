dealer<00:01:07.760> we've<00:01:08.760> developed<00:01:09.240> an<00:01:09.660> antenna<00:01:10.369> over

dealer we've developed an antenna over

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.690 
dealer we've developed an antenna over
the<00:01:11.520> last<00:01:11.670> few<00:01:12.420> years<00:01:13.310> that's<00:01:14.310> three<00:01:14.550> and<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the last few years that's three and a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.100 
the last few years that's three and a
half<00:01:14.850> him<00:01:15.090> precisely<00:01:17.270> we've<00:01:18.270> been<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.960> out

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
half him precisely we've been going out

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.060 
half him precisely we've been going out
portable<00:01:20.270> with<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:22.170> setup<00:01:22.410> and<00:01:24.890> now<00:01:25.890> we've

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
portable with this setup and now we've

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.400 
portable with this setup and now we've
developed<00:01:26.960> two<00:01:28.430> antennas<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:30.140> are<00:01:31.140> mainly

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
developed two antennas that are mainly

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.779 
developed two antennas that are mainly
for<00:01:31.680> portable<00:01:32.539> although<00:01:33.539> they<00:01:33.690> would<00:01:34.550> do<00:01:35.550> just

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
for portable although they would do just

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.900 
for portable although they would do just
as<00:01:35.880> well<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> back<00:01:36.539> garden<00:01:37.229> or<00:01:37.640> top<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.789> a

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.910 
as well in the back garden or top of a
flat<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.630> wherever<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.410> want<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.649> put<00:01:40.770> them

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920

really far is it

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.690 
really far is it
this<00:01:43.410> is<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> 20<00:01:44.160> meter<00:01:44.700> Delta<00:01:45.300> loop<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:47.580> it

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
this is the 20 meter Delta loop and it

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.749 
this is the 20 meter Delta loop and it
worked<00:01:47.910> from<00:01:48.240> 10<00:01:48.830> 20<00:01:49.830> down<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.160> 10<00:01:50.369> meters

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.230 
worked from 10 20 down to 10 meters
quite<00:01:51.270> comfortably<00:01:52.490> sometimes<00:01:53.490> with<00:01:53.729> an<00:01:53.850> ITU

alright getting back to the 20 meter
Delta<00:03:31.299> loop<00:03:31.500> I'm<00:03:32.500> going<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.769> raise<00:03:32.919> it<00:03:33.190> optimum

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
Delta loop I'm going to raise it optimum

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.020 
Delta loop I'm going to raise it optimum
level<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:36.280> could<00:03:36.459> work<00:03:36.639> it<00:03:36.819> quite

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
level is you could work it quite

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.180 
level is you could work it quite
comfortably<00:03:37.480> at<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:38.019> level<00:03:38.699> but<00:03:39.699> ever<00:03:39.879> so

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
comfortably at this level but ever so

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.130 
comfortably at this level but ever so
I<00:03:41.220> can't<00:03:42.030> look<00:03:42.210> around<00:03:42.480> teller<00:03:43.520> so<00:03:44.520> higher<00:03:45.140> you

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
I can't look around teller so higher you

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.200 
I can't look around teller so higher you
get<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.470> antenna<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:48.810> better<00:03:49.020> area<00:03:50.060> just<00:03:51.060> put

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
get the antenna the better area just put

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:57.680 
get the antenna the better area just put
this<00:03:51.330> one<00:03:52.730> 25<00:03:53.730> 30<00:03:54.090> foot<00:03:54.360> I<00:03:55.250> know<00:03:56.250> they<00:03:56.690> will

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
this one 25 30 foot I know they will

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:08.360 
this one 25 30 foot I know they will
test<00:03:58.020> it<00:03:58.200> on<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:59.450> on<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.570> radio<00:04:07.250> and<00:04:08.250> of

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
test it on the on the radio and of

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.770 
test it on the on the radio and of
course<00:04:08.960> the<00:04:09.960> antenna<00:04:10.380> is<00:04:10.620> directional

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.260 

although<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:15.960> does<00:04:16.170> have<00:04:16.200> for<00:04:16.730> very<00:04:17.730> very<00:04:18.000> good

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
although it does have for very very good

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.630 
although it does have for very very good
capabilities<00:04:19.080> and<00:04:20.660> it's<00:04:21.660> very<00:04:21.930> very<00:04:22.140> neat<00:04:22.830> the

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
capabilities and it's very very neat the

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.380 
capabilities and it's very very neat the
way<00:04:23.670> it<00:04:23.970> works<00:04:25.040> so<00:04:26.060> that's<00:04:27.060> what<00:04:27.270> we're<00:04:27.510> doing

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
way it works so that's what we're doing

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.570 
way it works so that's what we're doing
I'll<00:04:30.390> test<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.900> antennas<00:04:31.410> now<00:04:31.620> with<00:04:32.460> the

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
I'll test the antennas now with the

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.130 
I'll test the antennas now with the
radio<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:34.740> see<00:04:34.980> how<00:04:35.040> we<00:04:35.160> do<00:04:35.340> with<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:36.140> with

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
radio and see how we do with the with

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.110 
radio and see how we do with the with
this<00:04:37.290> new<00:04:37.560> antenna<00:04:38.280> it's<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:38.610> first<00:04:38.850> time

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
this new antenna it's the first time

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.240 
this new antenna it's the first time
that<00:04:39.330> I've<00:04:39.420> erected<00:04:39.870> this<00:04:39.990> antenna<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:41.130> it'll

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
that I've erected this antenna so it'll

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.800 
that I've erected this antenna so it'll
be<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.460> first<00:04:41.640> time<00:04:41.940> it's<00:04:42.120> been<00:04:42.270> used<00:04:42.330> on<00:04:42.720> the

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
be the first time it's been used on the

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.130 
be the first time it's been used on the
radio<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:45.720> also<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.650> 6<00:04:46.920> meter<00:04:47.190> variety<00:04:48.020> as<00:04:49.020> I

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
radio and also the 6 meter variety as I

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.810 
radio and also the 6 meter variety as I
say<00:04:50.090> they<00:04:51.090> are<00:04:51.990> quite<00:04:52.200> neat<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:52.980> quite<00:04:53.280> simple

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
say they are quite neat and quite simple

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.920 
say they are quite neat and quite simple
but<00:04:54.720> very<00:04:54.750> effective<00:04:56.120> so<00:04:57.120> no<00:04:57.450> further<00:04:57.600> ado

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
but very effective so no further ado

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.720 
but very effective so no further ado
we'll<00:05:00.930> carry<00:05:01.290> with<00:05:01.530> these<00:05:01.650> portable<00:05:02.070> antennas

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
we'll carry with these portable antennas

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.460 
we'll carry with these portable antennas
the<00:05:02.940> 6<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.720> 2<00:05:04.590> meter<00:05:04.800> Delta<00:05:05.190> loop<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.580> also<00:05:05.700> the

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
the 6 to 2 meter Delta loop and also the

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.920 
the 6 to 2 meter Delta loop and also the
20<00:05:07.470> meter<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:08.010> 10<00:05:08.220> meter<00:05:08.520> delta<00:05:08.880> loop<00:05:09.060> and<00:05:09.660> give

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
20 meter to 10 meter delta loop and give

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:37.550 
20 meter to 10 meter delta loop and give
you<00:05:10.080> a<00:05:10.669> operational<00:05:11.840> failing<00:05:12.840> of<00:05:12.960> them
