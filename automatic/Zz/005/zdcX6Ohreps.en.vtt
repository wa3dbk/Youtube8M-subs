 today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.900
 review 2 blaise matuidi version 2d of a 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.540
 form available in the bins since 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.310

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.180
 there 18th team of the week travels the 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.460
 stall in my team 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.680
 league 1 of usually at the level of 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.240
 Stats Here you statins range 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.380
 who are scrolling so I 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.690
 invite you to pause or to 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.400
 put back to see them 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.379
 the matuidi blaise seconds a form a 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.720
 been loaned by a subscriber so here under 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.879
 thank you man, it's great fun and 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.500
 so nice tapas so there statins 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.370
 game still so blaise matuidi second 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.710
 a woman what can we say about 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.059
 I was a little disappointed I have not 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.000
 really sure i was a little disappointed i 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.489
 found bitter more galley with him who 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.899
 with the regular so strange even if you 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.940
 get any improvements 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.140
 I think especially in the speed he's going 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.399
 much faster he has a better 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.920
 pass quality for me it's really 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.300
 that or August out of 100 a difference with 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.950
 those blush matuidi there so that's when 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.330
 even the second boost so starts to 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.039
 have a big improvement by 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.190
 report at stadium level versus 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:11.960
 to the regulars and I found it a shame 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.640
 I found it a shame that we feel it 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.400
 we feel a deference we feel a 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.330
 difference but a low difference that 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.560
 does a bit like waiting for them a second 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.470
 a form that is to say a difference 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.450
 but not so blatant even though I 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.189
 ended I prefer I have the impression of 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.240
 prefer the regular so as 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.070
 I explained in terms of speed 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.229
 so the speed really more he takes 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.080
 a next improvement of + 2 on the 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.090
 map and speed level it feels 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.070
 still the quality of pass at the level 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.259
 the revival and openings it remains 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.670
 still very very clean his game of 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.020
 head I unfortunately could not 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.460
 the illustrated I put them in the most 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.920
 because she is the leading stat 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.939
 almost remains correct but I really 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.369
 failed to illustrate you 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.840
 unfortunately and after that here is in 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.280
 the most of blaise matuidi second a 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.259
 form what we can say is that already 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.670
 he has a physical it is his physical sound 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.409
 physical it's really its attributes 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.259
 physical that allow it to be 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.409
 to be good so it's in force in 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.299
 balance in agility it really holds 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.860
 very very good on his legs moving 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.000
 deceased he's mouthing circles you 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.619
 do not worry she's playing in the middle and 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.420
 attackers mouth it is really 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.200
 very very good defensively it's true 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.640
 that it is 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.930
 well i have mine mc it's true when 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.069
 even death it would have been better even 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.690
 if they will unfortunately alas this 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.400
 strong strong contribution that can pose 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.890
 problem for a recovery medium seen 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.680
 which goes up a lot but it's true that 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.970
 he has stats defensively and 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.530
 defensively I felt when 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.330
 even more I really felt 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.310
 something defensively with him 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.440
 five offensively it's bad is 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.580
 to say offensively it's bad yes and 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.690
 no that is when you go 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.670
 in front of the goal it's going to be bad because 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.290
 that he's rotten he's rotten in front of 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.319
 the cages he has a disgusting finish 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.730
 65 in finish but after quality not 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.200
 it's really very very good and it 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.900
 brings offensively it matters in 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.670
 redundant but failing redundant 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.690
 as he committed I have a lot of 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.489
 time you can find yourself in inferiority 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.690
 on the defensive phases like that that 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.819
 can be really problematic of this 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.680
 side there so in the most what I have 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.360
 put I put the pass quality that 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.860
 really huge 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.170
 and you feel an increase by 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.170
 compared to regular his speed his 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.819
 physical as I spoke then for 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.079
 the laps the defensive stages so in 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.280
 interception is really very very good 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.950
 it's going to be really a day based on 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.569
 Interception anticipation at the level 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.310
 slips tackled tagle standing he has to 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.590
 very very good stats tackle mud he 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.090
 has almost 90 I believe the a89 some 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.609
 something like that so it's really very 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.109
 very good tackle slid my stack the tackle 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.299
 very rarely I rarely use the state 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.120
 glide helene i have not tested but it to 1 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.459
 83 84 I think so that can it can 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.540
 really be very very good and so 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.650
 so here's the blaise matuidi it's 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.359
 really that's bigger 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.130
 characteristics after in the east - 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.720
 as I explained so to the finish 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.069
 that I just ignoble in front of the goal 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.850
 it's really bad you saw 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.639
 a lot of failed strikes 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.739
 I do not have a good goal in this review 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:47.209
 after we have the positioning as 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.040
 I explained they have me so much so 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.560
 it's a plus because it'll bring you 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.760
 an oversupply offensively but it remains 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.530
 a moment too because it's okay 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.599
 bring you an inferiority defensively 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.090
 and on the counter attacks of times you 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.829
 can pay him cash and the two stars 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.959
 technical gesture he's just despicable 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.530
 technically I think it's the worst 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.650
 technically player 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.380
 so I could test now it's 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.569
 really really really bad and 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.520
 So So here anyway in real life 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.019
 we all know that matuidi blues by the 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.760
 main features sarah is 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.230
 the one I mentioned yesterday too 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.419
 from somewhere it's realistic 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.590
 but as it's fifa you could 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.330
 maybe wait for mu so here is 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.460
 it was the last clip so on this 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.230
 knocked out by petr cech 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.930
 so at the blaise balance sheet 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.880
 matuidi in the most I put the jump 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.440
 vision speed because he still 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.600
 a pretty interesting vision for a 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.860
 middle in the middle relayer vision speed 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.480
 the ball checks it does very 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.950
 good physical checks so like 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.130
 I explained physically ben here 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.550
 it's own tagging aggressiveness game 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.890
 head 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.750
 interception tackle slipped tackle mud 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.060
 the pass quality so that's okay 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.430
 to be it's main its main 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.840
 positive stats and so in the east - I 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.860
 put the finish because in front of the goal 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.600
 it's a catastrophe 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.510
 the positioning has certainly been 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.919
 in the excitement but as I said it can 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.030
 to be a plus at the same time but good me 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.169
 I put it frozen put a little in the 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.430
 mores that's where he has a lot 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.510
 wind but after that I have 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.000
 enormously forced on too 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.350
 but it's a lot of wind and 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.020
 the two stars technical gesture because 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.910
 that technically it's technically it 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.490
 at 79 on the map but that's it 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.960
 really really bad I did not put 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.580
 the price neither in nor in the east - 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.289
 I will talk about the price is in the process 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.630
 to fall again and again 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.490
 there are there totti this weekend balaÃ¯a 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.990
 attackers coming out just now and 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.490
 in the weekend normally I believe 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.620
 it's sunday is going to be there totti 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.240
 complete in the packs so you're fine 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.010
 not that is enormously and so its price 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.600
 risk of falling again and again 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.910
 I did not put the statistics with him 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.740
 because it's useless it's more of a 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.000
 defensive player than anything else and so 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.590
 that was the end of match 87 and 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.570
 I hope this review of blaise 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.490
 matuidi version 2d of a form you has 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.870
 pleased I would like the next 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.890

 the world has yes and do not forget to 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.010

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.990
