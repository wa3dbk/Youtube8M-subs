00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.400 
the Vegas show and the beginning of the
film<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.090> quite<00:02:39.360> spectacular<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.260> would

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
film is quite spectacular and I would

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
love to go to a show like that in Vegas

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.880 
love to go to a show like that in Vegas
for<00:02:41.940> real<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.930> does<00:02:43.260> really<00:02:43.440> make<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.710> very

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
for real it does really make you very

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.440 
for real it does really make you very
interested<00:02:44.310> more<00:02:44.580> interested<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.000> magic<00:02:45.120> this

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
interested more interested in magic this

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.420 
interested more interested in magic this
movie<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:46.620> then<00:02:46.710> they<00:02:46.830> have<00:02:46.920> some<00:02:47.190> others

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
movie but then they have some others

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.830 
movie but then they have some others
like<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.760> think<00:02:47.910> like<00:02:48.000> two<00:02:48.150> other<00:02:48.300> magic<00:02:48.690> shows

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
like I think like two other magic shows

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.960 
like I think like two other magic shows
afterwards<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.710> they<00:02:50.250> are<00:02:50.430> on<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.610> smaller

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
afterwards and they are on a smaller

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.600 
afterwards and they are on a smaller
scale<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.320> think<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.130> because<00:02:53.430> they're

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
scale and I think that because they're

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.060 
scale and I think that because they're
in<00:02:53.700> contrast<00:02:54.240> to<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.390> first<00:02:55.070> Fantastic

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
in contrast to that first Fantastic

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.850 
in contrast to that first Fantastic
Vegas<00:02:56.430> show<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:57.630> highlights<00:02:58.290> how<00:02:58.470> small<00:02:58.710> they

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
Vegas show it highlights how small they

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.880 
Vegas show it highlights how small they
feel<00:02:59.100> that<00:02:59.820> said<00:03:00.150> though<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.780> was<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.230> very<00:03:01.560> nice

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
feel that said though it was a very nice

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.740 
feel that said though it was a very nice
change<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.340> pace<00:03:02.400> film<00:03:02.850> I<00:03:03.030> really<00:03:03.390> had<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.570> good

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
change of pace film I really had a good

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.180 
change of pace film I really had a good
time<00:03:03.960> watching<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.530> was<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.680> nice<00:03:04.860> light

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
time watching it it was a nice light

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.910 
time watching it it was a nice light
action<00:03:05.460> caper<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.270> I<00:03:06.960> think<00:03:07.560> that's<00:03:07.710> the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
action caper and I think that's the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.380 
action caper and I think that's the
reason<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.280> liked<00:03:08.520> it<00:03:08.640> was<00:03:08.760> largely<00:03:09.090> due<00:03:09.360> to

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
reason I liked it was largely due to

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.150 
reason I liked it was largely due to
Mark<00:03:09.660> Ruffalo's<00:03:10.050> performance<00:03:10.620> he's

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
Mark Ruffalo's performance he's

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.520 
Mark Ruffalo's performance he's
fantastic<00:03:11.480> he<00:03:12.480> really<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.870> star<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.440> the

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
fantastic he really is the star of the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.770 
fantastic he really is the star of the
film<00:03:13.740> you<00:03:14.220> go<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.700> follow<00:03:14.940> his<00:03:15.210> detective

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
film you go you follow his detective

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.210 
film you go you follow his detective
more<00:03:16.050> than<00:03:16.230> these<00:03:16.350> magicians<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.010> he's

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
more than these magicians that he's

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.550 
more than these magicians that he's
trying<00:03:17.490> to<00:03:17.610> capture<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.990> think<00:03:19.260> that

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
trying to capture so I think that

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.050 
trying to capture so I think that

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
Banner in that film but I he just put a

Banner in that film but I he just put a
smile<00:03:32.520> on<00:03:32.550> my<00:03:32.970> face<00:03:33.000> when<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.480> saw<00:03:33.690> him<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.080> if

movie<00:03:36.690> right<00:03:36.960> now<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.410> think<00:03:37.800> other<00:03:38.070> studios

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
movie right now I think other studios

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.610 
movie right now I think other studios
would<00:03:38.700> be<00:03:38.790> very<00:03:39.090> smart<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.930> know<00:03:40.050> grab<00:03:40.350> him

would be very smart to you know grab him

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.620 
would be very smart to you know grab him
because<00:03:41.280> he's<00:03:41.520> just<00:03:41.640> he's<00:03:41.970> very<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.360> come<00:03:42.480> he

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
because he's just he's very you come he

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.090 
because he's just he's very you come he

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
comes across really well and he did a

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.190 
comes across really well and he did a
really<00:03:44.160> nice<00:03:44.460> job<00:03:44.840> not<00:03:45.840> only<00:03:45.870> was<00:03:46.140> his

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
dialogue sequences but he held his own

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.000
