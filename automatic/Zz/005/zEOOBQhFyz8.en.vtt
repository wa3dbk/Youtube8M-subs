00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.149
 This is the Russian jet system 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.299
 volley fire 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.860
 hurricane in a matter of minutes she destroy 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.370
 whole armored units 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.070
 technology 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.450
 artillery positions manpower 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.670
 and a whole military base 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.440
 just imagine just one volley 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.620
 enough to enter enemy territory 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.580
 lead hail of 40 hectares 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.840
 hitting everything in its path and 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.610
 the system possesses not only 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.640
 crushing firepower 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.770
 the car quickly maneuver on and is capable 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.770
 shy away from enemy counterstrikes 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.690
 in the 60s the Soviet government 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.989
 union 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.190
 set a task for designers 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.979
 create a new jet system 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.559
 salvo fire that could hit 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:59.979
 enemy at a distance of 35 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.500
 kilometers then it seemed just 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.129
 incredible 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.860
 maximum firing range 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.250
 popular those years systems from was 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.350
 about 20 kilometers 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.930
 but the engineers managed to deliver 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.180
 tasks and got a weapon which 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.550
 could destroy tanks and launchers 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.180
 nuclear and chemical weapons installations 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.360
 This was a real breakthrough, no analogue 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.180
 in the world could not compare with a hurricane 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.450
 such a system was successfully established 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.510
 tests and 1 basically I would sleep for a long time 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:40.830
 remained secrets unlike hail 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:45.200
 which was widely sold was used in 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:49.020
 Hurricane restrained in various parts of the world 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.600
 he was probably seen for the first time in a parade 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.600
 70s 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.240
 downloaded strange convenience in quality 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.590
 base designers used chassis zil 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.590
 130 5 l m 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.479
 it ensured high throughput and 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.090
 maneuverability machine equipped immediately 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.600
 two engines each rotated 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.760
 its wheels 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.600
 this solution provided additional 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.420
 reliability 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.610
 fiberglass cabin done this 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.710
 minimized weight and allowed 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.780
 install heavy launcher on the chassis 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.420
 installation 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.660
 also with its impressive dimensions 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.570
 hurricane system pretty quickly 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.270
 car accelerates to 70 kilometers 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.750
 hour and can easily produce volleys during 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.090
 time of short stops in order 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.040
 to get ready for the crew shot 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.500
 only need a few minutes 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.109
 moreover, after the launch of rocket shells 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.209
 hurricane also quickly able to withdraw from 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.090
 deployment sites and take cover from 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.480
 counterstrike 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.840
 greater survival on the battlefield she 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.140
 for almost three minutes 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.230
 leaves his position after a volley and 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:15.269
 can leave 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:22.530
 allows you to not get double shooting 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:25.590
 and save the crews fighting machine car 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.200
 equipped with 16 caliber 220 missiles 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.720
 millimeters for the first time in the world for this 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.620
 system was developed cassette projectile 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.230
 in his warhead 30 shrapnel destiny 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.299
 the supplies that underwhelmed hit 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.519
 the territory is almost at right angles 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.250
 This solution allowed 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.350
 maximum possible damage area 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.630
 splinters 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.270
 despite the fact that in the arsenal of a hurricane is not 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.960
 guided missiles 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.820
 designers managed to achieve 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.310
 maximum for a similar system 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.920
 accuracy ensure effective 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.950
 defeat manpower and technology in one gulp 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:06.680
 two three combat vehicles had to be very 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:09.380
 seriously take measures to let 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.730
 tighten process tolerances 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:16.040
 weight fluctuation test 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.860
 powder charge weights very clearly 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.220
 exhibited a stabilization system for 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.050
 due to this compared to peers 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.050
 who existed before in the world 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.930
 will restore and samples at one time. 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.390
 we have this verbal a 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.510
 all this system is able to mine 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.400
 enemy territory in her battle kit 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.530
 there is a special missile 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.740
 which can scatter 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.340
 anti-tank mines as a result of one 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.350
 volley 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.790
 large area around the enemy 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:52.440
 becomes just impassable 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:58.000
 we were also the first shells to 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:05:01.090
 minefield setting with a pier 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.790
 for so were the first 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:07.950
 anti-tracked mines to combat 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.280
 technique today 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:14.980
 developed mine which hit 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.300
 armored subnet projection so by 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:21.340
 all bottom projection except 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.290
 anti-tank and anti-personnel mines in 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.860
 arsenal of high-explosive hurricane 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.380
 shells 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.510
 shells incendiary warhead and 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.849
 also with head volume 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.189
 detonating action 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.020
 shells with bulk detonating head 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:37.259
 part has a large destructive 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.550
 forces and allow you to solve problems 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:42.100
 clearance and damage well 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.600
 reinforced goals 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.220
 and high-explosive fragmentation projectile 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.260
 lumped in which almost 50 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:55.470
 kilogram 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:59.200
 would you so he intended to destroy 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:02.410
 engineering structures so field 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:06.690
 conditions for shooting including 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:09.360
 settlement and when 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:14.100
 incapacitation defeat 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:18.040
 things like the airfield you 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:20.350
 mentioned complex can be applied in 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.750
 a variety of conditions even with 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:26.020
 the use of chemical or 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.730
 nuclear weapons hurricane will hit the enemy in 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.550
 any time of day and in any 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.110
 climatic conditions 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.110
 the system will work properly and in 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.210
 minus 40 and plus 50 degrees Celsius and 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.130
 its real effectiveness 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.380
 she proved during modern 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:45.120
 military conflicts in afghanistan and chechnya 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.120
 and South Ossetia 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:53.020
 I must say that the designers continue 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:55.629
 improve the salvo fire system 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.879
 Hurricane plans to create gunsmiths 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:07:00.819
 new rocket which will be controlled and 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:02.949
 guided by gps technology this 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:05.019
 It means that it will be possible not only to beat 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:07.719
 squares but at the same time hit 

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:12.239
 dozens of individual goals for example 

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:12.239
 detached buildings or armored vehicle
