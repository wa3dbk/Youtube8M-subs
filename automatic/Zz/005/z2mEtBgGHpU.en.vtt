00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 they are considered one of the most spectacular 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.069
 ballet ensembles of the twentieth 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.150
 century the barrier over 100 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.509
 years they became legendary 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.759
 russian impresario sergej diaghilev 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.250
 never seen in paris 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.029
 choreographies to back then as well 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.490
 revolutionary sounds of claude 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.619
 debussy or igor strawinsky tore that 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.710
 audience to Enthisterungsstürmen out 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.210
 or were booed because they 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.189
 shocked the ball he is the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.109
 pioneer of the modern ballet now 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:39.239
 has the ensemble of the semperoper dresden 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:41.160
 she revives that is one of the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.000
 physically it will roll for you 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.160
 dancer can give women both 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.890
 sex and desire 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.390
 and an incredible inspiration for 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.390
 modern choreographies 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.540
 the story of women now in dresden 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.400
 Coming to the stage is fast told 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.080
 Two men involved in one not 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.810
 completely voluntary lovemaking 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.400
 who one young the other parent the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.380
 allusion to news about 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.580
 abuse cases in church circles is 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.580
 quite wanted 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.340
 so clear and pictorial is modern 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:29.920
 rarely ballet but the choreographer directs 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.920
 Bubenicek loves clear messages 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.330
 I think you do not have to be so dramatic 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.369
 his 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.520
 as a human, you fall in love with yourself, you know 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.420
 be yourself and you fall in love and 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.420
 you can not handle that 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.800
 this really shocking news 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.450
 on TV 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.740
 that has me so busy that 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.080
 I could not stop it 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.490
 thinking 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:03.950
 and i thought okay thats maybe 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.440
 a good idea for women's vfl 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.590
 the animal is eternal in us 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.810
 have provocation exactly 100 years 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.260
 the balance this figure first on the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.290
 stage brought back then in the early summer of 1912 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.500
 irritated the star waslaw nijinsky with 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.989
 almost unearthly artificiality in la 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.069
 premiere he formulated on the 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.439
 uninhibited with the veil of a stage 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.689
 Since then, this choreography has also been valid 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.319
 the valerius as a guide in the 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.319
 modern 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.500
 the tsv had to be 100 years ago 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.170
 Women a revolution in motion 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.790
 But society is not just 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.340
 this young beautiful man on the stage 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.959
 but in the end he had an orgasm 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.819
 on stage and that was shocking 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.819
 and the audience 100 years ago 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.459
 the twins josie and otto bubenicek 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.830
 are both dancers as well 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.510
 choreographers and equipment with theirs 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.879
 they are working on the way between new 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.620
 york saint petersburg and hamburg in 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:30.329
 dresden have the two czechs and 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.489
 It was newly created for women for me 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.890
 very interesting the costumes of that time 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.349
 to transport them to our days 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.360
 to make modern ones and I got those 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.720
 old pictures looked like the women 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:47.970
 from nijinsky at that time looked like you had to 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.250
 the balance is the right balance 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.140
 to find between tradition before 100 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.769
 years and the claim of the ballet 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.930
 the audience tries today the new 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.480
 ballet evening at the semperoper four 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.730
 pieces of valerius including that too 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.829
 legendary le secret burned this 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.159
 spring offerings and the wedding of 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:10.200
 lanús are reloaded and relaunched 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.870
 this mixture from the view back 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.970
 paired with an experimental 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.480
 body language that develops an enormous 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.480
 force 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.230
 b 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.010
 There is enough wisdom in our world 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.770
 the mark the traditionally strongest 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.600
 they also live for us and for me 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.979
 Personally, I also liked an identity 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:44.720
 to build for my company and that is 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:47.070
 a bit traditional with modern 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.889
 the requirements for the new 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.060
 ballettabend are high that 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.030
 choreographic spectrum demands that 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.290
 dancers a tremendous versatility 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.050
 and it demands very simple 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:03.270
 Expressive something something modern 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:05.340
 We barely allow ballet today 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.229
 So have a strong focus on 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.450
 the aesthetics and the physical energy 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:13.470
 and show the audience great effects 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.970
 but we are in the theater we can 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.280
 that's what we use in society 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.510
 see and can show it off that 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.510
 audience thinks about it 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.330
 if I could do that then it would be 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.180
 I'm happy that would be great 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.789
 The soul of the ballets incredible 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.819
 A ballet evening rejuvenates itself 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:41.099
 great feeling dare that is courageous 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:44.520
 and maybe a little bit again 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:47.240
 little shocking as the women before 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.240
