00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
control on the throttle kind of stay

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.490 
control on the throttle kind of stay
stay<00:02:11.090> where<00:02:11.270> you<00:02:11.330> want<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.660> you<00:02:14.200> just<00:02:15.200> let<00:02:15.380> us

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
charging cable give it some tension like

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.040 
charging cable give it some tension like
putting<00:02:24.740> this<00:02:24.830> on<00:02:25.040> because<00:02:25.810> don't<00:02:26.810> want<00:02:26.960> to

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
get caught up in the sticks from then

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.930 
get caught up in the sticks from then

on this stick another thing I did is the
trim<00:02:57.980> on<00:02:58.010> this<00:02:58.190> helicopter<00:02:58.550> is<00:02:59.030> is<00:02:59.240> terrible

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
trim on this helicopter is is terrible

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.960 
trim on this helicopter is is terrible
you<00:03:00.080> constantly<00:03:01.070> have<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.370> adjust<00:03:01.610> it<00:03:01.790> in

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
you constantly have to adjust it in

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.060 
you constantly have to adjust it in
flight<00:03:02.270> and<00:03:02.750> they<00:03:03.230> got<00:03:03.380> these<00:03:03.470> little<00:03:03.650> knobs

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
flight and they got these little knobs

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.710 
flight and they got these little knobs
here<00:03:05.050> it's<00:03:06.050> really<00:03:06.230> it's<00:03:06.530> kind<00:03:06.740> of<00:03:06.800> a<00:03:06.890> pain<00:03:07.100> to

take your hands off the sticks what I
did<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:11.570> I<00:03:11.690> took<00:03:11.750> this<00:03:11.990> little<00:03:12.050> camp<00:03:12.530> from<00:03:12.770> a

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
did is I took this little camp from a

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.420 
did is I took this little camp from a
travel<00:03:13.550> sized<00:03:13.760> shampoo<00:03:14.690> bottle<00:03:15.020> I<00:03:15.340> cut<00:03:16.340> a<00:03:16.370> hole

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.850 
travel sized shampoo bottle I cut a hole
in<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.880> and<00:03:17.060> I<00:03:17.540> should<00:03:17.780> slip<00:03:18.020> over<00:03:18.230> this<00:03:18.500> knot

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
control while I'm flying and as the

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.550 
control while I'm flying and as the
battery<00:03:25.570> discharges<00:03:26.570> you<00:03:26.810> have<00:03:27.110> to<00:03:27.230> trim<00:03:27.440> it

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
battery discharges you have to trim it

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.810 
battery discharges you have to trim it
over<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.040> over<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.280> over<00:03:28.490> again<00:03:28.580> while

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
over and over and over again while

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.920 
over and over and over again while
you're<00:03:28.880> flying<00:03:29.090> so<00:03:29.330> this<00:03:29.450> is<00:03:29.570> just<00:03:29.750> nice<00:03:29.900> to

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
you're flying so this is just nice to

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.610 
you're flying so this is just nice to
have<00:03:30.610> quick<00:03:31.610> adjustments<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.270> light<00:03:32.620> the

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
have quick adjustments and light the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
have quick adjustments and light the
other<00:03:33.710> thing<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.010> did<00:03:34.130> is<00:03:34.250> while<00:03:34.490> you're

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
other thing it did is while you're

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.490 
other thing it did is while you're
carrying<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.330> baskets<00:03:35.810> there<00:03:36.020> that<00:03:36.200> it<00:03:36.290> comes

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
carrying the baskets there that it comes

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.950 
carrying the baskets there that it comes
with<00:03:36.590> this<00:03:37.430> thing<00:03:37.640> flies<00:03:37.880> okay<00:03:38.360> when<00:03:38.780> there's

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
with this thing flies okay when there's

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.380 
with this thing flies okay when there's
no<00:03:39.200> weight<00:03:39.410> on<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.680> at<00:03:39.860> all<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:41.090> give<00:03:41.240> it<00:03:41.360> the

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
no weight on it at all you give it the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.750 
no weight on it at all you give it the
slightest<00:03:42.170> little<00:03:42.350> input<00:03:42.860> on<00:03:42.980> throttle<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:43.640> a

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
slightest little input on throttle and a

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.630 
slightest little input on throttle and a
single<00:03:44.060> rocket<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.570> ceiling<00:03:45.520> so<00:03:46.520> what<00:03:46.610> I

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
single rocket to the ceiling so what I

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.960 
single rocket to the ceiling so what I
did<00:03:46.880> is<00:03:46.970> I<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:47.450> taped<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.900> penny<00:03:48.140> here<00:03:48.850> it's<00:03:49.850> at

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
did is I I taped a penny here it's at

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.970 
did is I I taped a penny here it's at
the<00:03:50.060> bottom<00:03:50.260> this<00:03:51.260> behind<00:03:51.590> Center<00:03:51.830> gravity

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
the bottom this behind Center gravity

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.560 
the bottom this behind Center gravity
actually<00:03:52.430> slows<00:03:52.640> it<00:03:52.820> down<00:03:52.850> a<00:03:53.000> little<00:03:53.240> slows

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
actually slows it down a little slows

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.140 
actually slows it down a little slows
down<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.870> forward<00:03:54.140> flight<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:54.680> uh<00:03:55.000> it<00:03:56.000> makes

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
down the forward flight and uh it makes

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.540 
down the forward flight and uh it makes
it<00:03:56.360> easier<00:03:57.230> to<00:03:57.410> pick<00:03:57.920> up<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.130> baskets

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
it easier to pick up the baskets

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.440 
it easier to pick up the baskets
actually<00:03:59.590> slows<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:00.740> down<00:04:00.770> and<00:04:01.160> it<00:04:02.030> also<00:04:02.180> makes

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
actually slows it down and it also makes

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.800 
actually slows it down and it also makes
it<00:04:02.680> makes<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.890> throttle<00:04:04.220> curve<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.490> lot<00:04:04.640> a<00:04:05.000> lot

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
it makes the throttle curve a lot a lot

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.960 
it makes the throttle curve a lot a lot
better<00:04:06.080> I<00:04:06.350> know<00:04:06.800> can<00:04:07.340> you<00:04:07.370> do<00:04:07.520> that<00:04:07.670> this

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
better I know can you do that this

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.110 
better I know can you do that this
thing's<00:04:08.209> actually<00:04:08.360> really<00:04:08.690> fun<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:08.990> fly<00:04:09.170> and

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
thing's actually really fun to fly and

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.600 
thing's actually really fun to fly and
I'm<00:04:11.120> pretty<00:04:11.330> easy<00:04:11.390> so<00:04:11.930> let's<00:04:12.430> see<00:04:13.430> how<00:04:13.550> it

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
I'm pretty easy so let's see how it

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.700 
I'm pretty easy so let's see how it
flies
