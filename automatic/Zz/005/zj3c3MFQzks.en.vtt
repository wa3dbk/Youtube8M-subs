00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.570
 hi to all the guys and here we are 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.250
 finally in this brand new video 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.290
 then today in this guide today 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.550
 during my absence 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.680
 private messages have arrived 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.190
 in addition to comments in certain videos 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.280
 on how to advance in the quest that is how 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.410
 finish the quest with blood ties 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.420
 then to start I want to tell you how 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.640
 activate this first of all 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.870
 you must have finished this e 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.330
 purify the stones 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.550
 I don't know if you remember when 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.590
 you must purify those sacred stones 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.899
 that Iraqi ladies have been corrupted 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.360
 once done this will unlock the 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.360
 possibility to activate this one 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.329
 you have to go to wolf and wild blood 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.210
 talk to him and ask him how long 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.579
 he is the first player he will tell you 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.700
 which in the past was to his brother who 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.490
 it's called thor killed he never disappeared 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.520
 he will tell you that he turned into a bear 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.550
 Were and will ask you to look for it then 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.020
 here there will be various places to find the 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.119
 brother because there is no place well 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.659
 precise also considering that the mission does not 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.520
 I will give you a precise place is random I will you 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.250
 I will show places where there is 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.970
 likely to find it for example here 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.479
 near the mine of the broken zone 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.520
 when you meet him he shares if 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.680
 It is fine he will tell you that will not tell you 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.049
 nothing will turn into this bear 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.049
 Were and will attack you want 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.780
 you simply have to kill it so 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.030
 such as to recover the letter it has on 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.080
 his corpse on his body but there is a 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.960
 but why you 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.930
 besides finding it already in life there is one 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.790
 probability that you find him already dead 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.470
 what it means to find his body 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.110
 from human 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.530
 died even though you didn't kill him ad 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.759
 example how I show you now in the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.079
 video in the area near the cave 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.019
 glacial along the coast 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:16.630
 here in fact I found only the 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.610
 corpse he was not alive in fact not 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.609
 turned the corpse found you 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.910
 as always you need to recover the letter 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:25.870
 to then deliver it to wolf blood 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.409
 wild that is 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.769
 brother now I show you other places in 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:35.080
 to find talk ir susa called orchid 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.150
 then the first place 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.560
 no excuse of the third place and close to 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.510
 dan fall mine then close 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.579
 at the syringe observatory 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.920
 I always recommend nearby not 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.829
 in that precise place nearby and 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.299
 surroundings then has a little more north of 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:57.190
 body rock as you are seeing 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:03:00.310
 in the images then finally near the 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.319
 refuge bujold here especially along the 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.780
 coast in the southernmost part of this 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.920
 shelter always near the coasts one 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.709
 Once this is done, then you have recovered 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.129
 from the letter as you have seen before not 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.170
 you have to make it back to wolf blood 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.950
 wild tell him that you met 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.379
 I can brother you killed him because there 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.819
 attack him he will thank you and give you 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.670
 something will thank you with 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.159
 the increase in variability between archers 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.190
 to parry one-handed weapons two-handed weapons 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.989
 and heavy armor now you don't see me 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.180
 because I already have all the 100 skills 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.329
 but it will give you this blessing, we say 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.359
