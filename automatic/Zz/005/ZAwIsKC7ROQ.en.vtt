200 mile an hour temp this car was
designed<00:03:30.080> with<00:03:30.380> one<00:03:30.650> thing<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.160> one<00:03:31.610> thing

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
designed with one thing and one thing

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.340 
designed with one thing and one thing
only<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.330> that<00:03:32.420> is<00:03:33.050> sheer<00:03:33.680> speed<00:03:34.460> a<00:03:35.200> zero<00:03:36.200> to

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
only and that is sheer speed a zero to

60 time of 1.9 four seconds to put that

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.880 
60 time of 1.9 four seconds to put that
into<00:03:41.000> perspective<00:03:41.180> that<00:03:41.990> means<00:03:42.380> that<00:03:42.680> it's

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
into perspective that means that it's

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.190 
into perspective that means that it's
technically<00:03:43.490> faster<00:03:44.030> zero<00:03:44.330> to<00:03:44.420> 60<00:03:44.960> in<00:03:45.170> a

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.580 
foot-pounds of torque yeah how are you
getting<00:04:15.770> that<00:04:16.130> much<00:04:16.430> power<00:04:16.850> well<00:04:17.540> I<00:04:17.750> used<00:04:18.080> DC

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
getting that much power well I used DC

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.460 
getting that much power well I used DC
motors<00:04:19.040> very<00:04:19.549> briefly<00:04:19.820> AC<00:04:20.090> motors<00:04:20.660> are<00:04:20.870> a<00:04:20.900> lot

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
motors very briefly AC motors are a lot

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.980 
motors very briefly AC motors are a lot
more<00:04:21.739> like<00:04:22.040> turbocharged<00:04:23.030> 4-cylinder<00:04:23.690> rotors

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
more like turbocharged 4-cylinder rotors

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.600 
more like turbocharged 4-cylinder rotors
that<00:04:24.020> can<00:04:24.230> rev<00:04:24.440> very<00:04:24.770> very<00:04:24.980> high<00:04:25.160> but<00:04:25.490> they

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
that can rev very very high but they

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.420 
that can rev very very high but they
don't<00:04:25.790> have<00:04:26.210> as<00:04:26.390> much<00:04:26.660> low-end<00:04:27.170> torque<00:04:27.430> DC

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
don't have as much low-end torque DC

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.400 
don't have as much low-end torque DC
motors<00:04:28.820> are<00:04:28.910> much<00:04:29.120> more<00:04:29.360> like<00:04:29.510> a<00:04:29.540> 1,200<00:04:30.290> cubic

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
motors are much more like a 1,200 cubic

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.440 
motors are much more like a 1,200 cubic
inch<00:04:30.740> v8<00:04:30.830> their<00:04:31.310> torque<00:04:31.760> monsters<00:04:32.210> but<00:04:32.330> you

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
inch v8 their torque monsters but you

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.090 
inch v8 their torque monsters but you
can<00:04:32.660> travel<00:04:32.930> them<00:04:33.080> very<00:04:33.260> high<00:04:33.380> so<00:04:33.770> what<00:04:34.010> we

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
can travel them very high so what we

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.090 
can travel them very high so what we
decided<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.610> do<00:04:34.790> was<00:04:35.180> to<00:04:35.330> keep<00:04:35.600> that

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
decided to do was to keep that

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.040 
decided to do was to keep that
unbelievable<00:04:37.100> torque<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:37.700> get<00:04:37.910> me<00:04:38.060> top<00:04:38.450> speed

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
unbelievable torque and get me top speed

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.300 
unbelievable torque and get me top speed
so<00:04:39.290> I<00:04:39.320> can<00:04:39.470> prove<00:04:39.590> to<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:39.770> world<00:04:39.890> that<00:04:40.070> it's

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
so I can prove to the world that it's

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.190 
so I can prove to the world that it's
not<00:04:40.490> just<00:04:40.760> a<00:04:40.820> quick<00:04:41.060> car<00:04:41.300> but<00:04:41.510> it's<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.690> fast<00:04:42.020> car

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
not just a quick car but it's a fast car

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.250 
not just a quick car but it's a fast car
yeah<00:04:42.710> I<00:04:42.980> use<00:04:43.460> overdrive<00:04:44.000> units<00:04:44.360> you<00:04:44.870> will<00:04:45.080> get

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
yeah I use overdrive units you will get

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.290 
yeah I use overdrive units you will get
up<00:04:45.320> to<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.470> certain<00:04:45.710> speed<00:04:46.040> say<00:04:46.310> 70<00:04:46.790> 80<00:04:46.940> miles<00:04:47.150> an

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
up to a certain speed say 70 80 miles an

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.909 
up to a certain speed say 70 80 miles an
hour<00:04:47.390> you'll<00:04:47.660> throw<00:04:47.900> into<00:04:48.140> one<00:04:48.290> overdrive<00:04:48.740> and

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
hour you'll throw into one overdrive and

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.830 
hour you'll throw into one overdrive and
the<00:04:49.040> car<00:04:49.280> literally<00:04:49.790> will<00:04:50.180> throw<00:04:50.480> you<00:04:50.540> back

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
the car literally will throw you back

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.810 
the car literally will throw you back
into<00:04:51.080> the<00:04:51.230> seat<00:04:51.410> again<00:04:51.680> because<00:04:52.280> it's<00:04:52.490> dropped

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
into the seat again because it's dropped

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.000 
into the seat again because it's dropped
the<00:04:52.970> RPMs<00:04:53.390> way<00:04:53.660> down<00:04:53.870> yeah<00:04:54.260> he<00:04:54.350> goes<00:04:54.500> oh<00:04:54.620> hello

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
the RPMs way down yeah he goes oh hello

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.440 
the RPMs way down yeah he goes oh hello
I've<00:04:55.220> got<00:04:55.400> 1,800<00:04:55.820> foot-pounds<00:04:56.330> of<00:04:56.390> torque

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
I've got 1,800 foot-pounds of torque

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.260 
I've got 1,800 foot-pounds of torque
again<00:04:56.900> let's<00:04:57.770> just<00:04:57.890> the<00:04:58.310> give<00:04:58.550> a<00:04:58.730> drink<00:04:58.970> shall

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
again let's just the give a drink shall

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.100 
again let's just the give a drink shall
we<00:04:59.590> accelerate

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
we accelerate

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.960 
we accelerate
and<00:05:02.560> second<00:05:03.280> oh<00:05:03.400> wow<00:05:05.400> hahahaha

and second oh wow hahahaha
but<00:05:07.840> obviously<00:05:08.310> when<00:05:09.310> you're<00:05:09.460> in<00:05:09.580> a<00:05:09.610> muscle

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
but obviously when you're in a muscle

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.290 
but obviously when you're in a muscle
car<00:05:10.330> you're<00:05:10.780> gonna<00:05:10.870> want<00:05:11.139> to<00:05:11.199> do<00:05:11.379> this<00:05:12.159> test<00:05:12.759> to

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
car you're gonna want to do this test to

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:25.400 
car you're gonna want to do this test to
see<00:05:13.509> if<00:05:13.539> we<00:05:13.689> can<00:05:13.840> do<00:05:14.050> a<00:05:14.319> Burnout

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.980 

here<00:05:25.980> we<00:05:26.160> go<00:05:26.400> with<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.360> world's<00:05:27.660> quietest

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
here we go with the world's quietest

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:40.870 
here we go with the world's quietest
burnout

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.870 

is<00:05:41.450> still<00:05:41.720> going<00:05:41.960> oh<00:05:42.260> this<00:05:42.920> thing<00:05:43.190> just<00:05:43.430> wants

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
is still going oh this thing just wants

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.210 
is still going oh this thing just wants
to<00:05:44.030> spin<00:05:44.690> and<00:05:45.050> spin<00:05:45.740> and<00:05:46.070> spin<00:05:48.100> well<00:05:49.100> I<00:05:49.130> think

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
to spin and spin and spin well I think

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.620 
to spin and spin and spin well I think
one<00:05:49.490> thing<00:05:49.640> that<00:05:49.700> you<00:05:49.850> guys<00:05:50.000> are<00:05:50.060> doing<00:05:50.330> is

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
one thing that you guys are doing is

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.420 
one thing that you guys are doing is
that<00:05:50.660> you're<00:05:50.870> taking<00:05:51.470> something<00:05:51.890> which<00:05:52.190> is

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
that you're taking something which is

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.040 
that you're taking something which is
good<00:05:53.030> for<00:05:53.180> the<00:05:53.270> environment<00:05:53.390> but<00:05:53.750> you're<00:05:53.930> also

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
good for the environment but you're also

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.660 
good for the environment but you're also
showing<00:05:54.590> you<00:05:55.040> can<00:05:55.190> be<00:05:55.310> good<00:05:55.460> for<00:05:55.610> the

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
showing you can be good for the

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.110 
showing you can be good for the
environment<00:05:55.760> and<00:05:56.740> faster<00:05:57.740> I've<00:05:58.190> noticed<00:05:58.670> most

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
environment and faster I've noticed most

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.000 
environment and faster I've noticed most
of<00:05:59.300> the<00:05:59.360> haters<00:05:59.750> come<00:06:00.320> from<00:06:00.500> people<00:06:00.710> who<00:06:00.740> read

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
of the haters come from people who read

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.460 
of the haters come from people who read
magazines<00:06:01.580> or<00:06:01.850> just<00:06:02.570> read<00:06:02.810> about<00:06:02.900> things<00:06:03.230> you

magazines or just read about things you
have<00:06:03.590> opinions<00:06:03.860> if<00:06:04.460> you<00:06:04.610> go<00:06:04.730> to<00:06:04.790> a<00:06:04.940> track<00:06:05.270> where

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480 
have opinions if you go to a track where

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.510 
have opinions if you go to a track where
a<00:06:05.510> guy<00:06:05.690> spent<00:06:06.080> hours<00:06:06.470> and<00:06:06.590> hours<00:06:06.680> and<00:06:06.950> 1000

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
and faster down the track you know what

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.730 
and faster down the track you know what
these<00:06:10.580> guys<00:06:10.760> care<00:06:11.000> about<00:06:11.060> speed<00:06:11.780> then<00:06:12.470> they<00:06:12.590> go

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
these guys care about speed then they go

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.410 
these guys care about speed then they go
