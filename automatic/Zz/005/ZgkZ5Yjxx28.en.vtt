so basically we've got the matte medium
and<00:00:32.800> the<00:00:33.400> flow<00:00:33.610> improver<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.500> to<00:00:36.489> begin<00:00:36.640> with

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
and the flow improver so to begin with

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.910 
and the flow improver so to begin with
on<00:00:37.390> all<00:00:37.809> my<00:00:37.960> payments<00:00:38.440> they're<00:00:38.559> basically

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
on all my payments they're basically

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.340 
on all my payments they're basically
painted<00:00:39.309> onto<00:00:39.460> a<00:00:39.580> black<00:00:39.850> a<00:00:40.210> black<00:00:40.720> canvas<00:00:40.960> so

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
painted onto a black a black canvas so

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.410 
painted onto a black a black canvas so
rather<00:00:42.160> than<00:00:42.280> using<00:00:42.489> a<00:00:42.610> light<00:00:42.790> a<00:00:43.000> lighter<00:00:43.210> base

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
rather than using a light a lighter base

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.790 
rather than using a light a lighter base
colour<00:00:43.720> I'll<00:00:43.900> always<00:00:44.080> just<00:00:44.170> use<00:00:44.470> a<00:00:44.500> black

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
colour I'll always just use a black

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.280 
colour I'll always just use a black
because<00:00:45.250> I<00:00:45.280> do<00:00:45.370> a<00:00:45.460> lot<00:00:45.699> of<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:45.940> rather<00:00:46.839> the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
because I do a lot of the rather the

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.710 
because I do a lot of the rather the
drawing<00:00:47.650> out<00:00:47.800> all<00:00:47.980> be<00:00:48.129> done<00:00:48.280> in<00:00:48.309> chalk<00:00:48.720> tops

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
drawing out all be done in chalk tops

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.969 
drawing out all be done in chalk tops
anything<00:00:49.989> just<00:00:50.170> works<00:00:50.320> better<00:00:50.530> on<00:00:50.619> them<00:00:50.799> on

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:50.979 
anything just works better on them on

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:52.649 
anything just works better on them on
the<00:00:51.070> black<00:00:51.250> surface<00:00:51.760> and<00:00:52.059> that's<00:00:52.239> and<00:00:52.540> I<00:00:52.629> think

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
the black surface and that's and I think

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:54.390 
the black surface and that's and I think
you<00:00:52.869> kind<00:00:53.110> of<00:00:53.140> get<00:00:53.290> a<00:00:53.320> darkness<00:00:53.860> to<00:00:54.040> the<00:00:54.159> image

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
you kind of get a darkness to the image

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.649 
you kind of get a darkness to the image
as<00:00:54.519> well<00:00:54.670> going<00:00:54.850> all<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.119> way<00:00:55.150> through<00:00:55.449> that

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
as well going all the way through that

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.950 
as well going all the way through that
way<00:00:55.809> yeah<00:00:56.229> so<00:00:56.970> what<00:00:57.970> I<00:00:58.000> would<00:00:58.089> do<00:00:58.420> is<00:00:58.540> obviously

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
way yeah so what I would do is obviously

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.000 
way yeah so what I would do is obviously
I<00:00:59.339> just<00:01:00.339> use<00:01:00.460> use<00:01:00.850> a<00:01:00.879> lot<00:01:01.119> of<00:01:01.150> black<00:01:02.010> you're

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
I just use use a lot of black you're

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.649 
I just use use a lot of black you're
gonna<00:01:03.129> mix<00:01:03.369> in<00:01:03.610> your<00:01:03.640> your<00:01:04.360> matte<00:01:04.510> medium

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
gonna mix in your your matte medium

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.539 
gonna mix in your your matte medium
basically<00:01:05.379> just<00:01:05.619> to<00:01:05.770> keep<00:01:05.890> it<00:01:06.070> smooth<00:01:06.369> the

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
basically just to keep it smooth the

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:07.620 
basically just to keep it smooth the
whole<00:01:06.700> way<00:01:06.850> through<00:01:07.090> so<00:01:07.270> you're<00:01:07.360> not<00:01:07.479> gonna

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
whole way through so you're not gonna

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.160 
whole way through so you're not gonna
have<00:01:07.869> patches<00:01:08.140> all<00:01:09.040> throughout<00:01:09.369> the<00:01:09.520> canvas

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
have patches all throughout the canvas

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.609 
have patches all throughout the canvas
so<00:01:11.170> put<00:01:11.740> that<00:01:12.070> in<00:01:12.220> that<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.990> you're<00:01:14.140> also<00:01:14.290> using

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
so put that in that so you're also using

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.469 
so put that in that so you're also using
the<00:01:14.830> fly<00:01:15.040> improver<00:01:15.640> yeah<00:01:16.000> I'm<00:01:16.090> going<00:01:16.299> to<00:01:16.330> put

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
the fly improver yeah I'm going to put

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.719 
the fly improver yeah I'm going to put
the<00:01:16.659> flow<00:01:17.200> improve<00:01:17.500> just<00:01:17.740> in<00:01:17.830> with<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.549> water

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
the flow improve just in with the water

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.580 
the flow improve just in with the water
so<00:01:19.390> it's<00:01:19.509> going<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:19.659> last<00:01:19.900> a<00:01:20.049> lot<00:01:20.170> obviously

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
so it's going to last a lot obviously

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.770 
so it's going to last a lot obviously
it'll<00:01:21.550> last<00:01:21.730> a<00:01:21.850> lot<00:01:21.940> longer<00:01:22.000> just<00:01:22.540> make<00:01:22.690> the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
it'll last a lot longer just make the

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.260 
it'll last a lot longer just make the
paint<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.140> keep<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.320> paint<00:01:23.500> consistent<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
paint and keep the paint consistent and

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.660 
paint and keep the paint consistent and
then<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.700> just<00:01:27.880> get<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.120> decent<00:01:28.540> age<00:01:28.690> I<00:01:28.810> always

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
then you just get a decent age I always

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.220 
then you just get a decent age I always
liked<00:01:30.670> it<00:01:30.820> quite<00:01:31.060> quite<00:01:31.540> Finn<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:31.960> be<00:01:32.050> honest

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
liked it quite quite Finn to be honest

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.820 
liked it quite quite Finn to be honest
when<00:01:32.350> I<00:01:32.380> put<00:01:32.590> it<00:01:32.680> on<00:01:32.800> just<00:01:33.400> because<00:01:33.730> a<00:01:34.170> lot<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.409> a

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
when I put it on just because a lot of a

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.530 
when I put it on just because a lot of a
lot<00:01:35.980> of<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.159> canvases<00:01:36.610> are<00:01:36.730> a<00:01:36.760> lot<00:01:36.970> a<00:01:37.210> lot

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
lot of the canvases are a lot a lot

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.340 
lot of the canvases are a lot a lot
larger<00:01:37.750> so<00:01:38.320> you<00:01:39.100> just<00:01:39.280> tend<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:41.020> easier

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
larger so you just tend to it's easier

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.320 
larger so you just tend to it's easier
to<00:01:41.500> spread<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.830> paint<00:01:42.070> basically

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:56.610 

I<00:01:53.310> see<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.370> again<00:01:54.970> ma'am<00:01:55.240> nice<00:01:55.480> and<00:01:55.780> flat<00:01:55.990> and

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
I see you again ma'am nice and flat and

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.890 
I see you again ma'am nice and flat and
it<00:01:56.740> also<00:01:56.890> obviously<00:01:57.490> where's<00:01:58.030> where<00:01:58.810> it's

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
it also obviously where's where it's

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.900 
it also obviously where's where it's
been<00:01:59.050> thinned<00:01:59.320> out<00:01:59.500> with<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.310> flow<00:02:00.490> improver

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
been thinned out with the flow improver

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.410 
been thinned out with the flow improver
as<00:02:01.000> well

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
as well

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.690 
as well
you<00:02:01.690> can<00:02:01.840> still<00:02:02.080> see<00:02:02.230> the<00:02:02.350> green<00:02:02.590> green<00:02:03.430> coming

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
you can still see the green green coming

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.620 
you can still see the green green coming
through<00:02:04.000> so<00:02:04.620> and<00:02:05.620> I<00:02:05.680> think<00:02:05.860> that<00:02:05.980> helps<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:07.540> a

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
through so and I think that helps it's a

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.210 
through so and I think that helps it's a
very<00:02:07.840> it's<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.110> very<00:02:08.140> durable<00:02:08.500> paint<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.100> way

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
very it's a very durable paint that way

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.980 
very it's a very durable paint that way
so<00:02:09.280> if<00:02:09.580> you're<00:02:09.700> using<00:02:09.910> masking<00:02:10.360> tape<00:02:10.570> chalks

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
so if you're using masking tape chalks

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.780 
so if you're using masking tape chalks
and<00:02:11.230> stuff<00:02:11.380> they're<00:02:11.530> not<00:02:11.680> gonna<00:02:11.830> it's<00:02:12.730> not

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
and stuff they're not gonna it's not

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.450 
and stuff they're not gonna it's not
going<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.060> shred<00:02:13.840> up<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.080> paint<00:02:14.320> or<00:02:14.530> peel<00:02:15.250> any

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
going to shred up the paint or peel any

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.020 
going to shred up the paint or peel any
of<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.580> paint<00:02:15.790> away<00:02:15.910> with<00:02:16.240> it<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.850> what<00:02:19.000> I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
of the paint away with it and what I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.420 
of the paint away with it and what I
usually<00:02:19.570> do<00:02:19.840> then<00:02:20.050> is<00:02:20.260> probably<00:02:21.220> put<00:02:21.340> about

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
usually do then is probably put about

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.240 
usually do then is probably put about
two<00:02:21.700> layers<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:22.270> black<00:02:22.900> on<00:02:23.140> let<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:24.040> let<00:02:24.220> that

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
two layers of black on let that let that

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.040 
two layers of black on let that let that
dry<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.970> then<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.480> have<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.660> grid<00:02:25.840> will<00:02:26.020> be

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
dry and then you have the grid will be

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.650 
dry and then you have the grid will be
gridded<00:02:26.500> up<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:26.740> chalk<00:02:26.980> yeah<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.970> then<00:02:28.270> again

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
gridded up in chalk yeah and then again

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.730 
gridded up in chalk yeah and then again
so<00:02:28.840> then<00:02:28.990> it<00:02:29.110> will<00:02:29.170> be<00:02:29.230> putting<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.560> color

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
so then it will be putting the color

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.770 
so then it will be putting the color
directly<00:02:29.890> on<00:02:30.310> which<00:02:30.670> again<00:02:31.300> with<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.540> Windsor

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
directly on which again with the Windsor

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.030 
directly on which again with the Windsor
Newton<00:02:31.930> paints<00:02:32.260> have<00:02:32.320> been<00:02:32.470> quite<00:02:32.680> good<00:02:32.890> in

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
Newton paints have been quite good in

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.160 
Newton paints have been quite good in
the<00:02:33.100> sense<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:34.630> don't<00:02:34.720> have<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:34.990> put<00:02:35.140> too

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
the sense that you don't have to put too

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.080 
the sense that you don't have to put too
many<00:02:35.440> layers<00:02:35.650> on<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:35.980> like<00:02:36.370> colors<00:02:36.700> like<00:02:36.850> reds

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
many layers on I like colors like reds

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.150 
many layers on I like colors like reds
and<00:02:37.240> yellows<00:02:37.330> usually<00:02:38.230> take<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.440> take<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:38.980> few

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
and yellows usually take a take a few

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.100 
and yellows usually take a take a few
layers<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.610> stick<00:02:39.790> onto<00:02:40.000> onto<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.600> black<00:02:40.840> base

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
layers to stick onto onto a black base

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.850 
layers to stick onto onto a black base
yeah<00:02:42.040> again<00:02:42.970> with<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.560> with<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.680> matte

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
yeah again with the with the matte

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.860 
yeah again with the with the matte
medium<00:02:45.010> that's<00:02:45.459> gonna<00:02:45.640> keep<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.150> keep<00:02:46.750> it

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
medium that's gonna keep it keep it

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.510 
medium that's gonna keep it keep it
consistent<00:02:47.140> throughout<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:48.010> when<00:02:48.400> you're

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
consistent throughout so when you're

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.880 
consistent throughout so when you're
putting<00:02:48.700> on<00:02:48.850> say<00:02:49.209> four<00:02:49.510> layers<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.590> yellow

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
putting on say four layers of a yellow

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.949 
putting on say four layers of a yellow
of<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.310> yellow<00:02:51.550> color<00:02:51.580> you're<00:02:52.450> not<00:02:52.480> gonna<00:02:52.720> get

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
of a yellow color you're not gonna get

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.140 
of a yellow color you're not gonna get
certain<00:02:53.290> points<00:02:53.680> sticking<00:02:54.280> ahead<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:55.030> other

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
certain points sticking ahead of other

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.750 
certain points sticking ahead of other
points<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:55.860> using<00:02:56.860> these<00:02:56.980> mediums<00:02:57.489> now

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
points and using these mediums now

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.640 
points and using these mediums now
together<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.390> artists<00:02:58.780> acrylic<00:02:59.140> when<00:02:59.410> you're

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
the canvases in the sense that I will

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.150 
the canvases in the sense that I will
put<00:03:09.280> one<00:03:09.459> color<00:03:09.670> down<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.860> use<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:11.890> hairdryer

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
put one color down and use a hairdryer

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.920 
put one color down and use a hairdryer
just<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.820> quickly<00:03:13.000> dry<00:03:13.269> that<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:13.600> I<00:03:13.660> could<00:03:13.720> put

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
just to quickly dry that so I could put

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.960 
just to quickly dry that so I could put
the<00:03:14.019> next<00:03:14.260> color<00:03:14.470> on<00:03:14.620> as<00:03:14.769> well<00:03:14.920> so<00:03:14.950> I'm<00:03:15.370> I'm

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160 
a lot of masking tape on the canvas and
then<00:03:51.250> just<00:03:51.850> to<00:03:51.940> get<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.209> super<00:03:52.480> like<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:52.900> really

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
then just to get the super like a really

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.220 
then just to get the super like a really
super<00:03:53.470> straight<00:03:53.680> line<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:55.450> remember<00:03:56.200> a

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
super straight line and I remember a

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.750 
super straight line and I remember a
problem<00:03:56.530> I've<00:03:56.650> had<00:03:56.709> in<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.010> past<00:03:57.040> is<00:03:57.459> it's

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
problem I've had in the past is it's

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.180 
problem I've had in the past is it's
been<00:03:57.970> very<00:03:58.240> much<00:03:58.420> if<00:03:58.870> you<00:03:59.170> water<00:03:59.380> the

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
been very much if you water the

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.490 
been very much if you water the
then<00:04:00.340> too<00:04:00.550> much<00:04:00.790> then<00:04:01.630> it's<00:04:01.810> gonna<00:04:01.960> when<00:04:02.380> it

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
then too much then it's gonna when it

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.870 
then too much then it's gonna when it
dries<00:04:02.740> it's<00:04:03.010> going<00:04:03.040> to<00:04:03.220> shift<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.610> color<00:04:03.790> is

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
dries it's going to shift the color is

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.730 
dries it's going to shift the color is
going<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.060> shift<00:04:04.270> too<00:04:04.450> much<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:04.960> if<00:04:05.380> you<00:04:05.500> use

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
going to shift too much and if you use

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.310 
going to shift too much and if you use
the<00:04:05.890> pain<00:04:06.070> pure<00:04:06.670> from<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:06.970> tube<00:04:07.210> when<00:04:08.200> you're

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
the pain pure from the tube when you're

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.600 
the pain pure from the tube when you're
taking<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.620> masking<00:04:08.980> tape<00:04:09.010> off<00:04:09.310> it's<00:04:09.490> going

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
taking the masking tape off it's going

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.100 
taking the masking tape off it's going
to<00:04:09.700> take<00:04:09.880> paint<00:04:10.120> off<00:04:10.300> where<00:04:10.570> it's<00:04:10.690> where<00:04:10.990> it's

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
to take paint off where it's where it's

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.110

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
on too thick so I finally with the

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.640 
on too thick so I finally with the
mediums<00:04:13.450> they've<00:04:13.630> pretty<00:04:14.230> much<00:04:14.350> to<00:04:14.500> give<00:04:14.620> you

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
like the perfect balance between there

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.630 
like the perfect balance between there
yeah<00:04:16.630> it's<00:04:17.019> not<00:04:17.140> it's<00:04:17.650> not<00:04:17.769> ruining<00:04:18.220> it's<00:04:18.519> not

losing<00:04:19.330> any<00:04:19.570> depth<00:04:19.840> losing<00:04:20.500> any<00:04:20.620> color<00:04:20.890> but

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
losing any depth losing any color but

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.070 
losing any depth losing any color but
also<00:04:21.459> it's<00:04:21.790> not<00:04:21.910> losing<00:04:22.300> any<00:04:22.540> actual<00:04:22.870> paint

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.140 
also it's not losing any actual paint
when<00:04:23.290> I<00:04:23.410> when<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:23.830> dip<00:04:24.040> there<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.700> masking<00:04:25.000> tape

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
when I when I dip there the masking tape

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.320 
when I when I dip there the masking tape
off<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:26.200> the<00:04:26.740> matte<00:04:26.950> mediums<00:04:27.460> are<00:04:27.850> you<00:04:28.000> seeing

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
off and the matte mediums are you seeing

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:35.070 
off and the matte mediums are you seeing
it<00:04:28.570> more<00:04:28.780> as<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:28.960> change<00:04:29.290> of<00:04:29.470> scene<00:04:33.600> no<00:04:34.600> no<00:04:34.840> I<00:04:34.870> had

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
it more as a change of scene no no I had

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.840 
it more as a change of scene no no I had
haven't<00:04:35.620> had<00:04:35.710> any<00:04:35.860> any<00:04:36.220> problems<00:04:36.580> with<00:04:36.700> it

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
haven't had any any problems with it

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.360 
haven't had any any problems with it
with<00:04:37.150> it<00:04:37.270> at<00:04:37.360> all<00:04:37.540> like<00:04:37.990> I<00:04:38.110> say<00:04:38.260> it<00:04:38.410> works<00:04:38.620> and

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
with it at all like I say it works and

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.670 
with it at all like I say it works and
one<00:04:39.520> of<00:04:39.640> the<00:04:39.750> big<00:04:40.750> benefits<00:04:41.140> of<00:04:41.200> the<00:04:41.320> range<00:04:41.530> is

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
one of the big benefits of the range is

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.440 
one of the big benefits of the range is
that<00:04:41.770> you<00:04:41.860> can<00:04:42.040> mix<00:04:42.280> like<00:04:42.820> I<00:04:42.850> can<00:04:43.060> use<00:04:43.240> the

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
that you can mix like I can use the

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.150 
that you can mix like I can use the
matte<00:04:43.900> medium<00:04:44.080> on<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.530> color<00:04:44.710> but<00:04:44.860> I<00:04:44.890> can<00:04:45.040> also

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
matte medium on the color but I can also

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.490 
matte medium on the color but I can also
put<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.730> flow<00:04:45.880> improve<00:04:46.240> with<00:04:46.960> that<00:04:47.200> as<00:04:47.320> well

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
put the flow improve with that as well

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.920 
put the flow improve with that as well
so<00:04:47.830> it's<00:04:48.310> not<00:04:48.370> as<00:04:48.580> if<00:04:48.730> I'm<00:04:48.850> restricted<00:04:49.570> just

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
so it's not as if I'm restricted just

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.450 
so it's not as if I'm restricted just
using<00:04:50.290> it<00:04:50.410> in<00:04:50.500> that<00:04:50.530> one<00:04:50.860> session<00:04:51.310> where<00:04:51.400> I'm

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
using it in that one session where I'm

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.730 
using it in that one session where I'm
painting<00:04:51.910> I<00:04:52.030> can<00:04:52.140> if<00:04:53.140> it's<00:04:53.290> going<00:04:53.500> really<00:04:53.620> well

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
painting I can if it's going really well

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.620 
painting I can if it's going really well

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
I can keep that color basically and like
