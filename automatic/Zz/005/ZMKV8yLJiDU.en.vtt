this<00:00:17.570> is<00:00:17.930> technically<00:00:20.020> combination<00:00:21.020> of<00:00:21.259> sand

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
this is technically combination of sand

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.920 
this is technically combination of sand
and<00:00:22.250> off<00:00:22.820> soda<00:00:23.529> and<00:00:25.779> actually<00:00:26.779> this

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
and off soda and actually this

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.490 
and off soda and actually this
combination<00:00:27.919> is<00:00:28.669> naturally<00:00:29.629> found<00:00:29.869> some

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
combination is naturally found some

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.299 
combination is naturally found some
places<00:00:31.270> in<00:00:32.270> the<00:00:32.329> world<00:00:32.680> like<00:00:33.680> for<00:00:33.829> example<00:00:33.920> in

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
places in the world like for example in

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.729 
places in the world like for example in
Syria<00:00:34.790> you<00:00:35.420> can<00:00:35.660> literally<00:00:36.079> go<00:00:36.440> out<00:00:36.469> of<00:00:36.710> your

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
Syria you can literally go out of your

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.060 
Syria you can literally go out of your
house<00:00:37.070> and<00:00:37.450> dig<00:00:38.450> up<00:00:38.629> some<00:00:38.870> dirt<00:00:38.899> put<00:00:39.739> it<00:00:39.860> in<00:00:39.980> a

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
house and dig up some dirt put it in a

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.660 
house and dig up some dirt put it in a
pot<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:40.640> cook<00:00:41.059> it<00:00:41.210> until<00:00:41.660> it's<00:00:42.399> turn<00:00:43.399> into

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
pot and cook it until it's turn into

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.650 
pot and cook it until it's turn into
glass<00:00:43.879> I<00:00:47.560> think<00:00:48.560> it<00:00:48.739> is<00:00:48.860> hard<00:00:49.160> to<00:00:49.310> imagine<00:00:49.660> how

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
glass I think it is hard to imagine how

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.080 
glass I think it is hard to imagine how
it<00:00:50.780> was<00:00:50.930> once<00:00:51.920> found<00:00:52.520> I<00:00:52.960> like<00:00:53.960> a<00:00:53.989> steep

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
it was once found I like a steep

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.620 
it was once found I like a steep

the<00:01:01.630> oldest<00:01:02.020> beats<00:01:02.980> we<00:01:03.190> know<00:01:03.370> are<00:01:03.550> from<00:01:04.210> China

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
the oldest beats we know are from China

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.190 
the oldest beats we know are from China

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.700 

compared<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.480> metal<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.290> it's<00:01:28.590> very

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
compared to metal it's it's very

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.350 
compared to metal it's it's very
difficult<00:01:29.300> different<00:01:30.300> to<00:01:30.660> work<00:01:30.780> with<00:01:31.050> itself

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
difficult different to work with itself

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.380 
difficult different to work with itself
it's<00:01:33.360> much<00:01:33.720> softer<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.920> tell<00:01:35.390> when

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
it's much softer as you can tell when

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.700 
it's much softer as you can tell when
it's<00:01:36.570> hot<00:01:37.520> then<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.820> cools<00:01:39.120> off<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.780> gets

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
it's hot then when it cools off it gets

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.090 
it's hot then when it cools off it gets
in<00:01:40.920> very<00:01:41.340> hard<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:46.260> nature<00:01:46.440> of<00:01:46.620> the<00:01:46.710> class<00:01:46.890> is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
in very hard the nature of the class is

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.600 
in very hard the nature of the class is
to<00:01:47.130> go<00:01:47.400> round<00:01:48.620> enter<00:01:49.620> all<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.010> patterns<00:01:50.430> in

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
to go round enter all the patterns in

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.930 
to go round enter all the patterns in
the<00:01:50.640> trophy<00:01:51.180> collection<00:01:52.040> are<00:01:53.040> based<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.790> this

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
the trophy collection are based on this

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.900 
the trophy collection are based on this
fact<00:01:54.620> different<00:01:55.620> colors<00:01:56.250> melt<00:01:56.610> at<00:01:56.880> different

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
fact different colors melt at different

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.060 
fact different colors melt at different
occasions<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:59.430> can<00:01:59.640> see<00:01:59.940> race<00:02:00.920> surface<00:02:01.920> of

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
occasions so you can see race surface of

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.150 
occasions so you can see race surface of
bead<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.640> some<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.360> colors<00:02:03.570> sink<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:05.040> the

bead and some of the colors sink to the

bead and some of the colors sink to the
butter<00:02:05.510> to<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:06.630> core<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:06.960> meat<00:02:11.480> before<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.540> put

following the laws of nature the beard

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:28.319 
following the laws of nature the beard
is<00:02:24.040> left<00:02:24.370> with<00:02:25.650> extremely<00:02:26.650> strong<00:02:27.519> sense
