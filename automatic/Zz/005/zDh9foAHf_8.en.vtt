just went ahead and pulled my hair to
the<00:04:41.770> front<00:04:41.980> and<00:04:42.100> just<00:04:42.280> kind<00:04:42.460> of<00:04:42.520> messed<00:04:42.730> around

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
the front and just kind of messed around

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.370 
the front and just kind of messed around
with<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.240> curls<00:04:43.510> so<00:04:43.690> they<00:04:43.810> were<00:04:43.870> in<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.140> style

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
with the curls so they were in the style

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:55.080 
with the curls so they were in the style
I<00:04:44.590> wanted

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.430 

so<00:04:56.090> even<00:04:56.330> though<00:04:56.360> my<00:04:56.570> pajamas<00:04:57.050> were<00:04:57.169> pretty

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
so even though my pajamas were pretty

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.990 
so even though my pajamas were pretty
cute<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:57.889> stylish<00:04:58.070> I<00:04:58.430> thought<00:04:58.610> maybe<00:04:58.850> I

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
cute and stylish I thought maybe I

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.370
