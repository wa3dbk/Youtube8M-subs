00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:04.820
 thanks to her pretty is pascale made at 24 years old 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.250
 after finishing his studies he had a professional experience 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.189
 rewarding 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:13.749
 for three years he worked in Lille in an association that offers 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.259
 animations around the game 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.509
 so passionate about the world of traditional wooden games he decided to 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.939
 to embark on his own adventure last September he created his 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.989
 society by adopting the status of self-entrepreneur 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:33.199
 not to mention it's missing is to promote wood games 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.360
 traditional wooden 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.300
 the studio is well greenhouse animations 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.670
 with the game I come from structures I come instead 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.880
 the place of the victory an animation for the moment we also the houses 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.720
 of retirement 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.780
 after - goals also it is to make workshops of manufacture thus to propose 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.429
 to structures and to children or 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.769
 many to the elderly or to adults made by the same place 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.310
 pascal manufactured most wooden activity games for the agent 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.660
 centralizing a denial 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.660
 not that the cell molecules that allow it 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.790
 when he settled down and pascal wanted to limit spending 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.660
 we love each other but he had to invest in material I shoot a lot of good or 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.810
 recovery for the factories the game 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.670
 then for the machines I had already a few weeks after I 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.170
 also recovers a lot of machines 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.670
 after adjusting machines like this to the cast of the saga 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.370
 and after the biggest investment that is indispensable it's a 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.710
 van for them carries game when I'm going to do the animations the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.140
 hotels and manufacturing 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.800
 when he is not on the road or in his workshop and pascal takes the opportunity to 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.700
 complete administrative tasks 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.020
 yes, here we go 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.930
 to uncle at home 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.570
 the museum laid out a small point of the role in the living room 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:13.279
 So here we come to the test 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:17.179
 beyond two square meters of business the company office 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:19.019
 herself 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.049
 so basically 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.270
 my main tool 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.039
 it's the computer 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:24.859
 with the mailbox 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.700
 it is in this space that pascal organizes these appointments 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.629
 where he is prospecting 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.180
 it also supports the company's accounting that thanks to the status 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.849
 of self-entrepreneur is totally simplified one just has to hold a 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.099
 newspaper so that means to charge 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.169
 the sales 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.169
 after we can develop a little smaller if we wish 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:48.189
 the action is a little or even a little better a little better see on the year 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.909
 almost a quarter of the curves know a little the mauves that better the words 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.049
 it's a little less good 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.319
 the other benefit of the status of self-entrepreneur his abilities the 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.279
 pay expenses only in proportion to its turnover 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:07.180
 if this turnover exceeds 32,000 euros annually then it will have 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:10.099
 no doubt about another legal status for his company
