gauge<00:02:43.410> my<00:02:44.410> first<00:02:44.680> question<00:02:45.160> was<00:02:45.340> yeah<00:02:45.760> but<00:02:46.150> how

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
gauge my first question was yeah but how

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.360 
gauge my first question was yeah but how
long<00:02:46.630> are<00:02:46.900> these<00:02:46.989> dual<00:02:47.349> batteries<00:02:47.890> gonna<00:02:48.099> last

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
long are these dual batteries gonna last

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.510 
long are these dual batteries gonna last
when<00:02:48.640> I'm<00:02:48.760> out<00:02:48.910> on<00:02:48.940> location<00:02:49.590> no<00:02:50.590> problem<00:02:51.340> I've

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
when I'm out on location no problem I've

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.760 
when I'm out on location no problem I've
yet<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:51.850> run<00:02:52.120> them<00:02:52.330> out<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.569> power<00:02:52.720> at<00:02:53.560> this

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
yet to run them out of power at this

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.199 
yet to run them out of power at this
point<00:02:54.040> I'm<00:02:54.160> figuring<00:02:54.610> they<00:02:54.730> last<00:02:54.970> forever

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
point I'm figuring they last forever

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.510 
point I'm figuring they last forever
that's<00:02:56.080> one<00:02:56.290> of<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.470> benefits<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:57.040> an<00:02:57.160> LED
