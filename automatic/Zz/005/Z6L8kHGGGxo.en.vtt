00:00:14.017 --> 00:00:23.017
 Plants cultivated as bonsai are often placed in very narrow pots, their root system must have an excellent soil rich in mineral salts 

00:00:24.293 --> 00:00:26.293
 to ensure the healthy and lush development of the plant 

00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:40.481
 For bonsai in general, soils rich in organic substance and mineral salts are preferred, very well drained and aerated, to allow water and air to cross the ground 

00:00:41.022 --> 00:00:45.022
 an excessively compact soil leads to a poor development of the root system 

00:00:46.343 --> 00:00:53.343
 For bonsai we use soil composed of chopped peat, mixed with some materials that favor its permeability 

00:00:54.492 --> 00:01:00.492
 preferably, lapillus or pumice stone is used, preferably with a fairly fine grain size 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:23.400
 A good amount of akadama is always placed inside the bonsai soil, it is a special land, originating from Japan 

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:30.482
 it is a soil of volcanic, clayey origin, which is cooked several times and reduced to granules 

00:01:30.812 --> 00:01:40.810
 this soil guarantees to the bonsai a good content of mineral salts, besides it favors the passage of air and water inside the substratum, thanks to its structure in granules; 

00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:48.770
 besides the akadama also has a beautiful color and appearance, certainly very pleasant in the bonsai plant pots 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.800
 To guarantee the plant an always healthy soil and therefore an optimal development of the root system it is advisable to intervene by repotting it 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:07.600
 and then changing all the substrate every year, if it is young plants, every 2-3 years for the "older" bonsai 

00:02:08.202 --> 00:02:12.200
 Proceed by removing the plant from the pot, perfectly cleaning the roots from the soil 

00:02:26.606 --> 00:02:33.610
 therefore the thicker and woody roots are cut, if present, and the whole root system is shortened by about a third 

00:02:45.372 --> 00:02:55.370
 On this occasion the plant is also pruned to prevent the remaining root system from being able to supply mineral salts and water to the entire crown 

00:03:02.363 --> 00:03:13.360
 Then anchor the plant to the pot and fill all the spaces of the container with fresh soil, taking care not to compact the soil too much and not to leave empty cavities
