00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
fast to make the sharp turn so we turn

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.950 
fast to make the sharp turn so we turn
like<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:15.870> very<00:00:16.199> hard<00:00:17.270> budge<00:00:18.270> flight<00:00:18.660> does<00:00:18.930> a

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
like this very hard budge flight does a

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.710 
like this very hard budge flight does a
half<00:00:19.230> circle<00:00:19.529> then<00:00:20.130> goes<00:00:20.400> head-on<00:00:21.000> toward<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
half circle then goes head-on toward the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.290 
half circle then goes head-on toward the
Germans<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:23.550> two<00:00:23.730> groups<00:00:24.029> past<00:00:24.390> each<00:00:24.600> other

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.839

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
it's a lethal game of hunter and hunted

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.819 
it's a lethal game of hunter and hunted
as<00:00:34.090> each<00:00:34.420> side<00:00:34.780> tries<00:00:35.230> to<00:00:35.470> get<00:00:35.620> on<00:00:35.649> the<00:00:35.800> other

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.689 
as each side tries to get on the other
is<00:00:36.190> vulnerable<00:00:36.760> six<00:00:37.149> o'clock

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
is vulnerable six o'clock

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:47.410 
is vulnerable six o'clock
now<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.750> got<00:00:40.309> four<00:00:41.309> me-109

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.960 

and<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.570> formas<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.559> coming<00:00:49.890> around

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.170 

they<00:00:53.600> want<00:00:53.780> to<00:00:53.870> fight<00:00:54.670> so<00:00:55.670> they're<00:00:55.850> coming

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
they want to fight so they're coming

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.780 
they want to fight so they're coming
around<00:00:56.300> and<00:00:56.840> we're<00:00:57.740> coming<00:00:58.070> around<00:00:58.190> now<00:00:58.550> and<00:00:58.730> a

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
around and we're coming around now and a

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.030 
around and we're coming around now and a
big<00:00:58.970> les<00:00:59.210> circle<00:00:59.660> with<00:00:59.810> this<00:01:00.200> goes<00:01:00.440> about<00:01:00.800> two

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
big les circle with this goes about two

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.180 
big les circle with this goes about two
times<00:01:01.340> each<00:01:02.140> time<00:01:03.140> we<00:01:03.320> come<00:01:03.530> around<00:01:03.770> I'm<00:01:04.160> a

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
times each time we come around I'm a

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.220 
times each time we come around I'm a
little<00:01:04.489> closer<00:01:04.730> to<00:01:05.090> get<00:01:05.300> them<00:01:05.449> in<00:01:05.630> trail<00:01:05.930> with

little closer to get them in trail with

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.710 
little closer to get them in trail with
them<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:06.920> we've<00:01:07.130> turned<00:01:07.490> their<00:01:07.820> advantage<00:01:08.300> now

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720

tighter<00:01:15.770> turn<00:01:16.130> gives<00:01:16.490> them<00:01:16.640> an<00:01:16.730> inside<00:01:17.180> track

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
tighter turn gives them an inside track

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.470

the<00:01:18.710> smaller<00:01:19.040> turning<00:01:19.580> radius<00:01:19.940> allows<00:01:20.240> the

the smaller turning radius allows the
