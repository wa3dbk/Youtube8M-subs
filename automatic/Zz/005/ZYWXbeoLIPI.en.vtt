00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.769
 People I'm here in the kitchen for 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.610
 make another video of recipes for 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.530
 you 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.900
 many people are asking for more europe

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.029
 microwave brigadier revenue 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.070
 this recipe is very easy to make and is 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.750
 very practical, anyone can do 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.369
 after I learned how to do the first 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.050
 in the microwave I never if not 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.939
 not so if you want evaluation of 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.650
 microwave brightness recipe and only 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.180
 keep watching the video 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.640
 so you're going to need three 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.960
 ingredients you'll need 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.180
 unsalted butter powdered chocolate powder 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.180
 or using nescau your country supports 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.879
 anyone you choose and also 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.350
 will need a note or a box of 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.770
 condensed milk 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.870
 the revenue is made in a 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.480
 glass container 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.760
 preferably your big good as well 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.789
 as much as we are going to make only one in 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.860
 recipe the zico brandÃ£o because when 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.049
 you put a microwave the brigadeiro 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.270
 will rise significantly is then it will 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.820
 win but at the time painted in microwaves 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.310
 and it goes up a lot so I'll use a 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:21.590
 Great lunch, it's good to start people. 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:24.890
 Open the milk box, you 're the same. 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.900
 if you can, this is it. 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.950
 and it will travel all condensed milk here 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.950
 in the glass container 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:48.130
 O will now be two tablespoons goin ' 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.430
 nescau of the same great abnormal trail 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.920
 it is not dessert spoon tap too 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.869
 two full spoons and where are you going? 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.509
 make a dessert spoon that this 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:05.789
 without salt 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:05.789
 is less in that quantity 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:30.010
 so we 'll mix everything up 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:34.840
 Until he gets more or less 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.000
 microwave instance 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.580
 When I have time to go, otherwise 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.459
 power already leaves there in power mode 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.329
 and I'm going to leave four minutes in the 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.329
 microwave're 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:05.950
 the brigadeiro after these four years 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:08.499
 it will come out of the microwave - in that 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.319
 consistency still net 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:13.689
 People are going to give a little stir just in this 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.120
 here I did not need it but if I left more 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:18.760
 a little thicker than this 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.329
 Give a little stir, we'll go now. 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:28.269
 put on for another 2 minutes in the microwave 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:30.450
 so we'll leave it for another 2 minutes in the 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.450
 microwave 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.610
 ready to chance plus two minutes 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.170
 now how different consistency people 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.200
 You see, he's already a lot more goals. 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.660
 It's bubbling so let's take it now. 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.520
 he here microwave and then the two 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.920
 minutes it will have more or less in that 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.750
 consistency, it's just that he'll be fine. 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.069
 but it has this consistency to 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.470
 people will be able to pass to him for a 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.340
 another piece of usefulness then 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.590
 come on 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.600
 Now you're going to spend the whole brigadeiro. 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.120
 now another dish I think the 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.230
 people are going to eat 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.060
 Look at the smell that gets people then 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.190
 People will be like this when he went 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.110
 Cooling down a bit, it's going to get more 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.590
 this will become more consistent and 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.390
 You do not even spoon and eat, and I like it. 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.250
 Same likes more or less like it 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.750
 so I like it cold in the 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.370
 refrigerator my father too 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.620
 but if you want to leave it would be 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.270
 without any help and eat too 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.800
 It works fine if you want to 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.350
 refrigerator and then at lunchtime to 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.090
 joaquim also gets hot then people 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.950
 the end result that he still here 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.530
 It's very hot, we'll have this season. 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.560
 What is it but is it a delight to look at? 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.960
 consistency that is people after 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.680
 he dry looks good a gorilla to do 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.810
 marbles 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.080
 so this is what I hope you have 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.450

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.460
