00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:08.519
 hello dear friends swami would be two 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.440
 tell you about three ways 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.870
 so you have the foot of minecraft let's 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.360
 let's get down to the first way in order 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.440
 so you need to minekravt enough 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.690
 do the following 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:24.000
 go to the start menu and select the panel 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:27.390
 control all the elements and open here I 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.170
 leaved do not know how to recognize the very 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:36.510
 he control panel choose again 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:40.829
 I press you a button at f and enter these 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:45.090
 meaning but these are exactly whether the letters 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.539
 the very first of n. and the last three 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.329
 numbers 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:55.620
 the number is up to 048 and the letter m is the second 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.149
 the value of this x-x is already the same 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.940
 value 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.300
 I will lay out in the comments this memory 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.170
 promptly which you are ready to give to you 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.790
 I am ready to give 15 gigs all of us here 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.650
 did click ok this was the first way he 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.070
 easy in my opinion 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:22.090
 forever so it was in my opinion the easiest 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.700
 the way and the easiest the most effective 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.570
 rather the second method for the second method 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.550
 we will need a task pitcher open and 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.600
 in it we press process and we look for two such here 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.080
 I have the file name 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.410
 first java flex press plan right button 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:46.270
 mouse priority and high with us 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:51.190
 A window appears reading is not a priority or 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.940
 not the dispatcher hello clicked and the same 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.340
 do with just not that one already did 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.390
 here all the same we press 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:05.340
 close and the third way for the third 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.770
 ways you just need to download 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:15.240
 optifine and this is such a mod reference to it 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:20.650
 It will be sufficient here just like 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:24.579
 on credit say something 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.560
 choose settings in general yes but i need 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:30.069
 was open to being in the controller 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.290
