isn't<00:02:55.709> actually<00:02:55.829> glass<00:02:56.220> fiber<00:02:56.489> it's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
isn't actually glass fiber it's

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.729 
isn't actually glass fiber it's
basically<00:02:57.000> just<00:02:57.120> there<00:02:57.510> for<00:02:57.540> decoration<00:02:57.739> it's

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
basically just there for decoration it's

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.589 
basically just there for decoration it's
kind<00:02:58.919> of<00:02:58.950> like<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.099> sticker<00:02:59.459> underneath<00:02:59.700> looks

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
kind of like a sticker underneath looks

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.360 
kind of like a sticker underneath looks
really<00:03:00.870> cool<00:03:01.019> but<00:03:01.079> actually<00:03:01.560> has<00:03:01.709> no<00:03:01.919> function

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
really cool but actually has no function

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.309 
really cool but actually has no function
whatsoever<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.510> do<00:03:03.629> get<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.840> very<00:03:03.900> flexible

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
whatsoever so you do get a very flexible

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.890 
whatsoever so you do get a very flexible
fairly<00:03:04.980> thin<00:03:05.189> plastic<00:03:05.909> soleplate<00:03:06.540> on<00:03:06.780> the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
fairly thin plastic soleplate on the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.629 
fairly thin plastic soleplate on the
bottom<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:07.739> that<00:03:07.799> pattern<00:03:08.159> itself<00:03:08.400> is

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
bottom so that pattern itself is

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.789 
bottom so that pattern itself is
relatively<00:03:09.060> similar<00:03:09.450> as<00:03:09.750> well<00:03:09.959> but<00:03:10.560> not

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
relatively similar as well but not

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.470 
relatively similar as well but not
identical<00:03:11.010> in<00:03:11.579> that<00:03:11.760> because<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.180> don't<00:03:12.329> have

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
identical in that because you don't have

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.179 
identical in that because you don't have
that<00:03:12.870> glass<00:03:13.109> fiber<00:03:13.409> just<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:13.829> provide<00:03:14.040> that

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
that glass fiber just to provide that

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.399 
that glass fiber just to provide that
extra<00:03:14.250> stiffness<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.510> studs<00:03:15.780> themselves<00:03:16.260> are

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
extra stiffness the studs themselves are

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:17.990 
extra stiffness the studs themselves are
a<00:03:16.439> little<00:03:16.620> bit<00:03:16.829> thicker<00:03:17.040> they're<00:03:17.340> not<00:03:17.489> as<00:03:17.669> kind

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
a little bit thicker they're not as kind

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.759 
a little bit thicker they're not as kind
of<00:03:18.150> sharp<00:03:18.479> so<00:03:18.959> they<00:03:19.079> don't<00:03:19.229> penetrate<00:03:19.650> the

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
of sharp so they don't penetrate the

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.680 
of sharp so they don't penetrate the
ground<00:03:20.010> as<00:03:20.190> easily<00:03:20.519> but<00:03:21.150> still<00:03:21.389> perform

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
ground as easily but still perform

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.030 
ground as easily but still perform
really<00:03:21.930> really<00:03:22.139> well<00:03:22.260> on<00:03:22.500> natural<00:03:22.949> grass

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
really really well on natural grass

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.979 
really really well on natural grass
plane<00:03:23.370> surfaces<00:03:23.819> you<00:03:24.329> got<00:03:24.479> your<00:03:24.629> two<00:03:24.780> heel

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
plane surfaces you got your two heel

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.930

slides<00:03:25.290> in<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.560> back<00:03:25.590> with<00:03:26.310> no<00:03:26.370> hole<00:03:26.729> going

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.580 
slides in the back with no hole going
through<00:03:27.180> as<00:03:27.329> you<00:03:27.479> can<00:03:27.629> see<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.290> then<00:03:28.379> you<00:03:28.470> have

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
through as you can see and then you have

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.530 
through as you can see and then you have
the<00:03:28.709> exact<00:03:29.069> same<00:03:29.280> layout<00:03:29.519> in<00:03:29.699> the<00:03:29.790> front<00:03:30.060> just

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
the exact same layout in the front just

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.819 
the exact same layout in the front just
like<00:03:30.689> I<00:03:30.780> said<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.079> studs<00:03:31.349> aren't<00:03:31.680> as<00:03:31.799> sharp

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
like I said the studs aren't as sharp

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.800 
like I said the studs aren't as sharp
that's<00:03:32.729> pretty<00:03:32.939> much<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.209> as<00:03:33.329> far<00:03:33.359> as<00:03:33.689> the

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
that's pretty much it as far as the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.750 
that's pretty much it as far as the
unboxing<00:03:34.379> portion<00:03:34.739> of<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.889> video<00:03:35.099> goes<00:03:35.340> and

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
unboxing portion of the video goes and

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.129 
unboxing portion of the video goes and
move<00:03:36.000> on<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.299> quick<00:03:36.510> way<00:03:36.689> and<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.019> can

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
move on to a quick way and so you can

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.719 
move on to a quick way and so you can
get<00:03:37.229> an<00:03:37.319> idea<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.680> how<00:03:37.859> light<00:03:38.099> these<00:03:38.280> guys<00:03:38.519> are

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:38.729 
get an idea of how light these guys are

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.509 
get an idea of how light these guys are
well<00:03:39.689> the<00:03:39.900> Valachi<00:03:40.229> is<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.530> takedown<00:03:40.859> model<00:03:41.370> and

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
well the Valachi is a takedown model and

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.159 
well the Valachi is a takedown model and
it<00:03:41.609> definitely<00:03:42.060> isn't<00:03:42.209> as<00:03:42.479> light<00:03:42.780> as<00:03:42.989> the

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
it definitely isn't as light as the

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.899 
it definitely isn't as light as the
top-end<00:03:43.379> vapor<00:03:43.799> it<00:03:44.280> still<00:03:44.609> is<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.819> very

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
top-end vapor it still is a very

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.089 
top-end vapor it still is a very
lightweight<00:03:45.359> soccer<00:03:45.810> shoe<00:03:46.079> both<00:03:46.319> in<00:03:46.530> hand<00:03:46.889> and

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
lightweight soccer shoe both in hand and

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.830 
lightweight soccer shoe both in hand and
on<00:03:47.250> feet<00:03:47.579> so<00:03:48.000> I'm<00:03:48.060> gonna<00:03:48.180> weigh<00:03:48.359> them<00:03:48.569> for<00:03:48.750> you

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
on feet so I'm gonna weigh them for you

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.719 
on feet so I'm gonna weigh them for you
today<00:03:48.959> in<00:03:49.229> real<00:03:49.409> time<00:03:49.680> keep<00:03:50.159> in<00:03:50.310> mind<00:03:50.489> this<00:03:50.579> is

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:50.729 
today in real time keep in mind this is

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.210 
today in real time keep in mind this is
a<00:03:50.759> brand<00:03:51.090> new<00:03:51.239> pair<00:03:51.479> in<00:03:51.629> a<00:03:51.689> size<00:03:51.720> 9<00:03:52.259> u.s.<00:03:52.590> we're

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
a brand new pair in a size 9 u.s. we're

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.249 
a brand new pair in a size 9 u.s. we're
gonna<00:03:53.310> throw<00:03:53.639> it<00:03:53.759> on<00:03:53.849> the<00:03:54.000> scale<00:03:54.299> and<00:03:54.569> you<00:03:54.629> can

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:55.259 
gonna throw it on the scale and you can

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:57.800 
gonna throw it on the scale and you can
see<00:03:55.379> that<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.620> weighs<00:03:55.769> in<00:03:55.949> at<00:03:56.180> 7.6<00:03:57.180> ounces<00:03:57.629> so

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
see that it weighs in at 7.6 ounces so

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.869 
see that it weighs in at 7.6 ounces so
below<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.290> 8<00:03:58.409> ounce<00:03:58.590> mark<00:03:58.919> really<00:03:59.430> good<00:03:59.669> for

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
below the 8 ounce mark really good for

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.879 
below the 8 ounce mark really good for
any<00:04:00.030> takedown<00:04:00.540> model<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.109> like<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.620> said<00:04:01.799> if

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
any takedown model and like I said if

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.259 
any takedown model and like I said if
you're<00:04:01.949> looking<00:04:02.280> for<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.489> mercurial<00:04:03.030> feel

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
you're looking for that mercurial feel

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.030 
you're looking for that mercurial feel
but<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:03.900> don't<00:04:04.049> have<00:04:04.139> the<00:04:04.259> budget<00:04:04.650> for<00:04:04.680> the

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
but you don't have the budget for the

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.280 
but you don't have the budget for the
top-end<00:04:05.250> vapor<00:04:05.639> the<00:04:06.239> Valachi<00:04:06.569> is<00:04:06.720> definitely

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
top-end vapor the Valachi is definitely

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.319 
top-end vapor the Valachi is definitely
a<00:04:07.319> really<00:04:07.590> solid<00:04:07.859> model<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.400> look<00:04:08.549> at<00:04:08.759> that's

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
a really solid model to look at that's

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.550 
a really solid model to look at that's
pretty<00:04:09.569> much<00:04:09.659> it<00:04:09.810> as<00:04:09.930> far<00:04:10.109> as<00:04:10.169> the<00:04:10.259> weigh-in

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
pretty much it as far as the weigh-in

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.499 
pretty much it as far as the weigh-in
portion<00:04:10.889> goes<00:04:11.069> then<00:04:11.639> move<00:04:11.790> on<00:04:11.939> to<00:04:12.090> a<00:04:12.120> quick<00:04:12.299> on

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:12.509 
portion goes then move on to a quick on

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:14.119 
portion goes then move on to a quick on
feet<00:04:12.810> so<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.019> can<00:04:13.109> get<00:04:13.199> a<00:04:13.259> better<00:04:13.379> idea<00:04:13.829> as<00:04:14.009> to

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
feet so you can get a better idea as to

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.009 
feet so you can get a better idea as to
how<00:04:14.220> these<00:04:14.370> shoes<00:04:14.609> fit<00:04:14.849> and<00:04:15.150> what<00:04:15.479> the<00:04:15.629> sizing

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
how these shoes fit and what the sizing

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.949 
how these shoes fit and what the sizing
is<00:04:16.139> like<00:04:16.549> here's<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.609> look<00:04:17.789> at<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.180> Valachi<00:04:18.509> zon

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
is like here's a look at the Valachi zon

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.870 
is like here's a look at the Valachi zon
feet<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.560> judging<00:04:20.159> by<00:04:20.250> how<00:04:20.400> they<00:04:20.549> look<00:04:20.759> you

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
feet and judging by how they look you

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.190 
feet and judging by how they look you
would<00:04:21.000> probably<00:04:21.299> guess<00:04:21.450> that<00:04:21.479> I<00:04:21.659> have<00:04:21.690> fairly

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
would probably guess that I have fairly

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.779 
would probably guess that I have fairly
wide<00:04:22.380> feet<00:04:22.680> but<00:04:23.010> that's<00:04:23.159> not<00:04:23.340> actually<00:04:23.550> the

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
wide feet but that's not actually the

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.700 
wide feet but that's not actually the
case<00:04:23.820> at<00:04:24.150> all<00:04:24.330> it's<00:04:24.870> just<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.169> relatively

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
case at all it's just a relatively

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.260 
case at all it's just a relatively
narrow

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
narrow

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.749 
narrow
so<00:04:26.930> if<00:04:27.020> you<00:04:27.229> have<00:04:27.379> wider<00:04:27.650> feet<00:04:27.979> it's<00:04:28.490> probably

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
so if you have wider feet it's probably

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.100 
so if you have wider feet it's probably
best<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:29.030> stay<00:04:29.090> away<00:04:29.389> from<00:04:29.449> the<00:04:29.660> mercurial

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
best to stay away from the mercurial

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.379 
best to stay away from the mercurial
series<00:04:30.410> altogether<00:04:30.949> the<00:04:31.580> synthetic<00:04:31.819> upper<00:04:32.270> is

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
series altogether the synthetic upper is

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.700 
series altogether the synthetic upper is
relatively<00:04:32.840> soft<00:04:33.050> from<00:04:33.289> right<00:04:33.440> out<00:04:33.560> of<00:04:33.650> the

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
relatively soft from right out of the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.680 
relatively soft from right out of the
box<00:04:33.949> but<00:04:34.460> give<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:34.639> a<00:04:34.789> couple<00:04:35.000> days<00:04:35.449> of

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
box but give it a couple days of

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.180 
box but give it a couple days of
break-in<00:04:36.050> time<00:04:36.229> and<00:04:36.440> they<00:04:36.500> will<00:04:36.620> soften<00:04:36.830> up<00:04:37.099> a

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
break-in time and they will soften up a

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.550 
break-in time and they will soften up a
bit<00:04:37.220> more<00:04:37.639> as<00:04:38.240> far<00:04:38.479> as<00:04:38.659> sizing<00:04:39.110> goes<00:04:39.139> I

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
bit more as far as sizing goes I

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.869 
bit more as far as sizing goes I
definitely<00:04:40.159> would<00:04:40.250> recommend<00:04:40.639> going<00:04:40.759> through

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:40.879 
definitely would recommend going through

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:43.270 
definitely would recommend going through
the<00:04:41.090> size<00:04:41.300> I'm<00:04:41.870> wearing<00:04:41.930> my<00:04:42.229> usual<00:04:42.379> size<00:04:42.740> 9<00:04:42.979> us

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
the size I'm wearing my usual size 9 us

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.129 
the size I'm wearing my usual size 9 us
here<00:04:43.580> and<00:04:43.759> the<00:04:43.909> fit<00:04:44.090> in<00:04:44.180> length<00:04:44.419> is<00:04:44.599> absolutely

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
here and the fit in length is absolutely

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.869 
here and the fit in length is absolutely
perfect<00:04:45.530> you<00:04:45.979> just<00:04:46.009> have<00:04:46.280> to<00:04:46.400> be<00:04:46.490> careful

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
perfect you just have to be careful

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:48.159 
perfect you just have to be careful
about<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.180> width<00:04:47.360> because<00:04:47.690> if<00:04:47.780> you<00:04:47.870> do<00:04:48.020> have

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
about the width because if you do have

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.469 
about the width because if you do have
wider<00:04:48.440> feet<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:49.280> mercurial<00:04:49.729> series<00:04:50.000> overall

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
wider feet the mercurial series overall

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.600 
wider feet the mercurial series overall
is<00:04:50.659> just<00:04:50.690> not<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.139> good<00:04:51.379> pick<00:04:51.590> for<00:04:51.620> you<00:04:51.949> that's

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
is just not a good pick for you that's

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.010 
is just not a good pick for you that's
pretty<00:04:52.759> much<00:04:52.940> it<00:04:53.120> as<00:04:53.270> far<00:04:53.300> as<00:04:53.449> the<00:04:53.599> arm<00:04:53.780> Peter
