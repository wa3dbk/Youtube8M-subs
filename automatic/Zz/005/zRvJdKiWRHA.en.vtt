00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.240
 hello to all and isis and today and this little earlier for you 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.570
 explain% how to remember entering tertio a point 6 thomas is not because 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.059
 that I realized that there are many people who had been either 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.280
 prescribed by paid last summer as this team could return in 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.890
 principle to the point that on the rcea by grace 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.089
 per month and if the solution 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.570
 first of all go to the link that I play or dominate at polls to 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:31.479
 under on the video but say tailor or his words set the bind file 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.080
 in vain consistel interlude to return in dotted current which is sure 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.530
 it's a bit creepy 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.350
 so in the end you have 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.110
 only small black dot 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.500
 all of you what are you going to do when you have this skeptical gesture 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.790
 I do not think you know how to get started 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.790
 executed for that sense appt to your own blood 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.620
 so why if you have not started running 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.620
 you start control panel 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.980
 you go into category the current we little more points you have 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.410
 so muliaina taskbar 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.520
 you click 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.520
 but the start menu times 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.900
 to personalize 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.630
 and there you tick% 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.950
 order it ran you do ok applied 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.940
 and leave you 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.230
 no M 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.580
 started qt for its part farting data top 100 ok 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.580
 so you're in the mail file cra he dared the file worthy 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.970
 so you advocate this pair 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.400
 you delete it 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 and you have the master because he 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.790
 than 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.910
 on the team 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.910
 you put it 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.860
 flying these thugs 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.390
 and then stutter 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.040
 so you actually do not try to heal 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.840
 and at age 27 takes six points 6 and you can play quietly 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.490
 here he is going to go hoping to have helped you appr club
