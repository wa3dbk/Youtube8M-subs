year as you can realize the festival of

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.090 
year as you can realize the festival of
Sapporo<00:00:53.300> don't<00:00:53.929> be<00:00:54.109> achieved<00:00:54.469> without<00:00:54.620> some

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
Sapporo don't be achieved without some

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.399 
Sapporo don't be achieved without some
cipro<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:55.940> this<00:00:56.449> is<00:00:56.600> what<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.899> local<00:00:57.199> will<00:00:57.379> be

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
cipro and this is what the local will be

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.289 
cipro and this is what the local will be
traditionally<00:00:58.159> do<00:00:58.309> during<00:00:58.549> the<00:00:58.789> festival

00:00:59.289 --> 00:00:59.299 
traditionally do during the festival

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.490 
traditionally do during the festival
they<00:00:59.869> produce<00:01:00.079> cipro<00:01:01.960> but<00:01:02.960> how<00:01:03.170> do<00:01:03.229> they

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
they produce cipro but how do they

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.609 
they produce cipro but how do they
produce<00:01:03.769> it<00:01:04.239> well<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.780> best<00:01:05.990> way<00:01:06.080> to<00:01:06.200> start

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
produce it well the best way to start

produce it well the best way to start
making<00:01:06.799> cipro

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
making cipro

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.940 
making cipro
is<00:01:07.820> with<00:01:08.210> a<00:01:08.240> source<00:01:08.570> of<00:01:08.689> sugar<00:01:08.899> which<00:01:09.680> in<00:01:09.830> our

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
is with a source of sugar which in our

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.999 
is with a source of sugar which in our
case<00:01:10.009> is<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.610> solid<00:01:11.270> remains<00:01:11.420> of<00:01:11.780> grapes<00:01:12.049> also

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
case is the solid remains of grapes also

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.969 
case is the solid remains of grapes also
known<00:01:13.250> as<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.789> great<00:01:14.030> promise<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:15.500> next<00:01:15.770> step

known as the great promise the next step

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.090 
known as the great promise the next step
is<00:01:16.399> obtaining<00:01:16.940> alcohol<00:01:17.750> from<00:01:18.050> this<00:01:18.229> sugarless

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
is obtaining alcohol from this sugarless

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.760 
is obtaining alcohol from this sugarless
environment<00:01:19.789> by<00:01:20.330> adding<00:01:20.630> yeast<00:01:21.080> to<00:01:21.560> cause

between 20 to 25 percent alcohol by
