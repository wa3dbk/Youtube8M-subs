00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.330 
time and reason i made this video is
because<00:04:41.900> there<00:04:42.680> was<00:04:42.770> a<00:04:42.800> point<00:04:43.010> in<00:04:43.130> my<00:04:43.190> life

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
because there was a point in my life

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.520 
because there was a point in my life
where<00:04:43.789> i<00:04:43.820> had<00:04:44.120> to<00:04:44.240> do<00:04:44.360> some<00:04:44.570> reflection<00:04:45.440> and

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
where i had to do some reflection and

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.500 
where i had to do some reflection and
someone<00:04:45.830> asked<00:04:46.190> me<00:04:46.250> that<00:04:46.460> question<00:04:46.520> and<00:04:47.270> that

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
someone asked me that question and that

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.700 
someone asked me that question and that
was<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.660> best<00:04:48.020> question<00:04:48.410> they<00:04:48.500> could<00:04:48.620> have

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
was the best question they could have

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.430 
was the best question they could have
ever

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
ever

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.440 
ever
because<00:04:49.650> it<00:04:49.770> put<00:04:49.920> me<00:04:50.040> on<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.280> right<00:04:50.310> path<00:04:50.880> and

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
because it put me on the right path and

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.990 
because it put me on the right path and
I<00:04:51.600> had<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.900> determine<00:04:52.520> what<00:04:53.520> I<00:04:53.550> was<00:04:53.820> really

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
I had to determine what I was really

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.860 
I had to determine what I was really
doing<00:04:54.170> so<00:04:55.170> god<00:04:55.800> bless<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:56.310> I<00:04:56.670> hope<00:04:57.600> that<00:04:57.750> you
