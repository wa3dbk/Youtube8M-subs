00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.199 
came with it and you know guys this is a
pretty<00:02:55.239> it's<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.540> pretty<00:02:55.690> simple<00:02:55.930> shoe<00:02:57.209> not

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
pretty it's a pretty simple shoe not

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.569 
pretty it's a pretty simple shoe not
much<00:02:58.420> going<00:02:58.750> on<00:02:58.840> on<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:59.290> but<00:02:59.950> that's<00:03:00.250> kind<00:03:00.549> of

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
much going on on it but that's kind of

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.030 
much going on on it but that's kind of
what<00:03:00.700> makes<00:03:00.820> it<00:03:01.000> sick<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.739> think<00:03:02.920> there's

what makes it sick and I think there's

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.850 
what makes it sick and I think there's
too<00:03:03.190> much<00:03:03.310> going<00:03:03.459> on<00:03:03.579> with<00:03:03.790> those<00:03:03.880> galaxy<00:03:04.420> ones

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860
