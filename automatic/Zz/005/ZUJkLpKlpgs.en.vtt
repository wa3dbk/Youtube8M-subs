00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
by experience and some people just can't

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.830 
by experience and some people just can't
help<00:02:33.080> themselves<00:02:33.940> but<00:02:34.940> there<00:02:35.690> is<00:02:35.810> a

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
help themselves but there is a

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.420 
help themselves but there is a
difference<00:02:36.320> between<00:02:36.500> an<00:02:36.770> ugly<00:02:37.130> handwriting

and an illegible handwriting mine will

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.190 
and an illegible handwriting mine will
probably<00:02:40.580> always<00:02:40.730> be<00:02:41.030> kind<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.360> ugly<00:02:41.570> but<00:02:42.170> I

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
probably always be kind of ugly but I

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.140 
probably always be kind of ugly but I
can<00:02:42.500> make<00:02:42.739> an<00:02:42.920> effort<00:02:43.070> and<00:02:43.459> produce<00:02:43.910> a
