I'm<00:00:30.179> always<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.779> awe<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.289> everything<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.160> you

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:32.490 
I'm always in awe of everything that you

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.150 
I'm always in awe of everything that you
know<00:00:32.610> Takeshi<00:00:33.120> does<00:00:33.470> he<00:00:34.470> blows<00:00:34.710> me<00:00:34.860> away<00:00:34.890> every

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
know Takeshi does he blows me away every

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.530 
know Takeshi does he blows me away every
time<00:00:35.400> and<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.670> really<00:00:35.910> like<00:00:36.060> this<00:00:36.240> new<00:00:38.330> this<00:00:39.330> new

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
time and I really like this new this new

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.720 
time and I really like this new this new
direction<00:00:39.720> that<00:00:40.020> cos<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.560> going<00:00:40.830> into<00:00:40.980> too<00:00:41.400> as

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
direction that cos is going into too as

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:50.330 
direction that cos is going into too as
well<00:00:41.970> I<00:00:47.390> think<00:00:48.390> half<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.290> is<00:00:49.620> about

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
well I think half of it is is about

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.430 
well I think half of it is is about
helping<00:00:50.640> other<00:00:51.240> folks<00:00:51.660> but<00:00:51.990> I<00:00:52.050> think<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
helping other folks but I think the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.830 
helping other folks but I think the
other<00:00:52.590> half<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:53.040> just<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.780> idea<00:00:54.780> of

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
other half is just like the idea of

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.530 
other half is just like the idea of
discovering<00:00:55.790> and<00:00:56.790> watching<00:00:57.330> something

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
discovering and watching something

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.260 
discovering and watching something
growing<00:00:58.640> and<00:00:59.640> fulfilling<00:01:00.600> its<00:01:00.840> destiny<00:01:02.270> being

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
growing and fulfilling its destiny being

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.600 
growing and fulfilling its destiny being
a<00:01:03.420> part<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.960> manifestation<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:05.580> I

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
a part of that manifestation is what I

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.290 
a part of that manifestation is what I
like<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:09.750> know<00:01:09.870> outside<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.850> obvious

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
like you know outside of the the obvious

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.400 
like you know outside of the the obvious
cachet<00:01:12.780> um<00:01:13.500> loads<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.550> experience<00:01:15.410> everything

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
cachet um loads of experience everything

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.950 
cachet um loads of experience everything
is<00:01:16.590> about<00:01:16.800> visibility<00:01:17.420> but<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.570> about<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
is about visibility but it's about the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.630 
is about visibility but it's about the
right<00:01:19.140> visibility<00:01:19.800> and<00:01:19.980> so<00:01:20.130> when<00:01:20.280> you're<00:01:20.400> able

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
right visibility and so when you're able

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.970 
right visibility and so when you're able
to<00:01:20.670> team<00:01:20.940> up<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.330> fashion<00:01:21.510> house<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.230> mean

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
to team up with the fashion house I mean

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.969 
to team up with the fashion house I mean
it<00:01:23.220> usually<00:01:23.850> tastes<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.490> job<00:01:26.490> one<00:01:26.790> for<00:01:26.820> them

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
it usually tastes is job one for them

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.270 
it usually tastes is job one for them
so<00:01:28.840> it's<00:01:29.840> kind<00:01:30.110> of<00:01:30.200> it's<00:01:30.649> good<00:01:30.920> when<00:01:31.130> you're

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
so it's kind of it's good when you're

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.999 
so it's kind of it's good when you're
able<00:01:31.549> to<00:01:31.579> work<00:01:31.909> against<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:32.990> canvas<00:01:33.229> of<00:01:33.649> a

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
able to work against the canvas of a

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:43.109 
able to work against the canvas of a
major<00:01:35.619> major<00:01:36.619> fashion<00:01:37.100> house<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:41.390> manual<00:01:41.899> is

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
major major fashion house the manual is

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.069 
major major fashion house the manual is
as<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:44.899> mentor<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.610> know<00:01:46.759> basically<00:01:47.720> I<00:01:47.840> take

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
as a mentor so you know basically I take

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.859 
as a mentor so you know basically I take
his<00:01:48.229> lead<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:48.740> when<00:01:49.549> it<00:01:49.640> comes<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:49.970> heart<00:01:50.149> and

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
his lead and when it comes to heart and

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.499 
his lead and when it comes to heart and
see<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.409> know<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:51.799> respect<00:01:52.640> his<00:01:52.969> taste<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:53.450> I

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
see you know I respect his taste and I

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:54.779 
see you know I respect his taste and I
respect<00:01:53.840> his<00:01:53.990> work

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
respect his work

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.429 
respect his work
so<00:01:55.789> pretty<00:01:56.659> much<00:01:56.750> I<00:01:57.229> have<00:01:58.219> my<00:01:58.399> ideas<00:01:58.850> but

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
so pretty much I have my ideas but

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.080 
so pretty much I have my ideas but
they'll<00:02:00.439> almost<00:02:00.709> be<00:02:01.039> edited<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:01.640> then<00:02:01.759> ran

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
they'll almost be edited and then ran

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.120 
they'll almost be edited and then ran
through<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.450> proper<00:02:02.780> machine<00:02:03.140> because<00:02:04.069> I

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
through the proper machine because I

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.740 
through the proper machine because I
don't<00:02:04.280> want<00:02:04.399> to<00:02:04.490> just<00:02:04.610> do<00:02:04.819> something<00:02:05.179> is<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.630> do

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
don't want to just do something is to do

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.910 
don't want to just do something is to do
it<00:02:05.869> I<00:02:05.929> want<00:02:06.110> to<00:02:06.140> do<00:02:06.259> it<00:02:06.349> because<00:02:06.470> it<00:02:06.770> matters

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
it I want to do it because it matters

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.350 
it I want to do it because it matters
and<00:02:07.250> it's<00:02:07.369> going<00:02:07.549> to<00:02:07.610> mean<00:02:07.759> something<00:02:08.060> in<00:02:08.299> the

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
and it's going to mean something in the

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:08.949 
and it's going to mean something in the
future

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
future

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.650 
future
I<00:02:12.099> like<00:02:13.099> collaborating<00:02:13.849> because<00:02:13.970> I'm<00:02:14.299> able<00:02:14.450> to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
I like collaborating because I'm able to

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.920 
I like collaborating because I'm able to
learn<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.530> sponge

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.770 

and<00:02:18.409> when<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.590> do<00:02:18.709> things<00:02:19.010> on<00:02:19.159> my<00:02:19.189> own<00:02:19.310> is<00:02:19.780> they

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
and when I do things on my own is they

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.750 
and when I do things on my own is they
see<00:02:20.840> basically<00:02:21.650> because<00:02:22.099> that's<00:02:22.489> probably

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
see basically because that's probably

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.479 
see basically because that's probably
what<00:02:23.060> makes<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.510> most<00:02:23.629> sense<00:02:23.780> at<00:02:24.079> that<00:02:24.230> time

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
what makes the most sense at that time

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.210 
what makes the most sense at that time
but<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:25.700> know<00:02:25.790> I'm<00:02:26.000> unusually<00:02:26.659> open<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:28.040> what

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
but you know I'm unusually open to what

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.860 
but you know I'm unusually open to what
makes<00:02:28.430> sense<00:02:28.730> it's<00:02:29.030> got<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.209> little<00:02:29.480> sense<00:02:29.659> of

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
makes sense it's got a little sense of

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.929 
makes sense it's got a little sense of
the<00:02:29.930> anything<00:02:30.319> there's<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.400> most<00:02:31.519> important

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939 
the anything there's the most important

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.240 
the anything there's the most important
part<00:02:32.120> is<00:02:32.299> the<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.920> learning

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
experience just sponging as much as you

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.370 
experience just sponging as much as you
can<00:02:37.640> while<00:02:37.970> you're<00:02:38.359> working<00:02:38.510> around<00:02:38.810> masters
