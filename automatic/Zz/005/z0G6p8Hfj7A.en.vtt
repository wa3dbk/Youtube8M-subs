we have big goals for your youtube
channel<00:01:46.750> this<00:01:47.750> was<00:01:47.930> obviously<00:01:48.110> a<00:01:48.800> huge<00:01:49.400> loss

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
channel this was obviously a huge loss

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.670 
channel this was obviously a huge loss
for<00:01:49.940> me<00:01:50.330> is<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:50.690> was<00:01:50.810> almost<00:01:50.930> devastating

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
for me is it was almost devastating

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.370 
for me is it was almost devastating
because<00:01:52.390> youtube<00:01:53.390> channels<00:01:53.810> they<00:01:54.050> just<00:01:54.260> they

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
because youtube channels they just they

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.830 
because youtube channels they just they
take<00:01:54.620> so<00:01:54.890> long<00:01:55.160> to<00:01:55.460> grow<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:56.690> know<00:01:56.810> I

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
take so long to grow and you know I

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.110 
take so long to grow and you know I
really<00:01:57.200> believe<00:01:57.650> that<00:01:57.730> youtube<00:01:58.730> channels

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
really believe that youtube channels

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.060 
really believe that youtube channels
grow<00:01:59.360> at<00:01:59.570> like<00:01:59.690> an<00:01:59.840> exponential<00:02:00.500> rate<00:02:00.530> meaning

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
grow at like an exponential rate meaning

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.600 
grow at like an exponential rate meaning
that<00:02:01.420> they<00:02:02.420> get<00:02:02.600> bigger<00:02:03.100> faster<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.280> know<00:02:04.370> the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
that they get bigger faster you know the

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.910 
that they get bigger faster you know the
bigger<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:05.000> are<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.180> faster<00:02:05.810> they<00:02:05.960> grow<00:02:06.200> and

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
bigger you are the faster they grow and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.740 
bigger you are the faster they grow and
maybe<00:02:07.310> that<00:02:07.460> sounds<00:02:07.580> obvious<00:02:07.880> but<00:02:08.179> it's<00:02:08.599> like

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
maybe that sounds obvious but it's like

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.410 
maybe that sounds obvious but it's like
every<00:02:09.170> week<00:02:09.410> you<00:02:09.440> grow<00:02:09.890> more<00:02:10.180> than<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:11.300> did

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
every week you grow more than you did

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.750 
every week you grow more than you did
the<00:02:11.569> week<00:02:11.720> before<00:02:12.069> it's<00:02:13.069> not<00:02:13.189> like<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.400> steady

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
the week before it's not like a steady

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.610 
the week before it's not like a steady
incline<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.359> know<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:14.750> obviously<00:02:14.930> starting

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
incline you know so obviously starting

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.140 
incline you know so obviously starting
from<00:02:15.799> Ground<00:02:16.040> Zero<00:02:16.159> it's<00:02:16.609> obviously<00:02:17.060> just

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
from Ground Zero it's obviously just

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.320 
from Ground Zero it's obviously just
it's<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.629> super

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
it's a super

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.990 
it's a super
process<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.250> course<00:02:20.460> was<00:02:20.730> just

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
process and I of course was just

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.970 
process and I of course was just
completely<00:02:21.390> blunt<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.470> almost<00:02:22.710> made<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
completely blunt and I almost made the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.890 
completely blunt and I almost made the
final<00:02:23.400> decision<00:02:23.430> did<00:02:23.970> not<00:02:24.000> start<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.780> new

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
final decision did not start a new

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.560 
final decision did not start a new
channel<00:02:25.550> but<00:02:26.550> just<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.820> continue<00:02:27.090> up<00:02:27.360> with

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
channel but just to continue up with

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.750 
channel but just to continue up with
uploading<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.380> i-10<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.770> go<00:02:28.890> beast<00:02:29.130> mode<00:02:29.250> you

rocky movies are just like the

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.850 
rocky movies are just like the
definition<00:02:48.660> of<00:02:48.750> inspiration<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:49.710> if<00:02:49.800> you

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
definition of inspiration so if you

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.230 
definition of inspiration so if you
haven't<00:02:50.130> watched<00:02:50.310> him<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.730> highly<00:02:51.120> recommend

haven't watched him I highly recommend
you<00:02:51.570> do<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.960> um<00:02:52.640> after<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.000> decided<00:02:54.150> I

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
you do that um after that I decided I

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.060 
you do that um after that I decided I
you<00:02:54.870> know<00:02:54.960> I<00:02:54.990> wasn't<00:02:55.290> gonna<00:02:55.380> let<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:55.740> get<00:02:55.920> me

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
you know I wasn't gonna let this get me

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.490 
you know I wasn't gonna let this get me
down<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.510> know<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.630> was<00:02:57.930> gonna<00:02:57.990> start<00:02:58.350> over

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
down and you know I was gonna start over

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.230 
down and you know I was gonna start over
and<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.190> was<00:02:59.250> gonna<00:02:59.370> work<00:02:59.640> harder<00:03:00.000> on<00:03:00.060> this

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
and I was gonna work harder on this

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.650 
and I was gonna work harder on this
newer<00:03:00.450> channel<00:03:00.930> than<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.530> ever<00:03:01.560> had<00:03:01.860> before<00:03:02.040> and

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
newer channel than I ever had before and

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.030 
newer channel than I ever had before and
like<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:03.780> said<00:03:03.840> it's<00:03:04.110> really<00:03:04.440> hard<00:03:04.650> starting

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
like I said it's really hard starting

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.340 
like I said it's really hard starting
off<00:03:05.250> but<00:03:05.490> you<00:03:05.550> know<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:05.790> told<00:03:06.120> myself<00:03:06.240> God<00:03:07.050> had<00:03:07.320> a

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
off but you know I told myself God had a

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.990 
off but you know I told myself God had a
reason<00:03:07.440> for<00:03:07.770> discontinuing<00:03:08.100> my<00:03:08.670> former

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
reason for discontinuing my former

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.670 
reason for discontinuing my former
channel<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.050> know<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.170> don't<00:03:10.410> know<00:03:10.530> what

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
channel and you know I don't know what

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.380 
channel and you know I don't know what
that<00:03:10.709> reason<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.250> but<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:11.850> have<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.240> believe

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
that reason is but I have to believe

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.070 
that reason is but I have to believe
that<00:03:12.860> certain<00:03:13.860> doors<00:03:14.280> closed<00:03:14.640> on<00:03:14.850> us<00:03:15.080> closed

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
that certain doors closed on us closed

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.600 
that certain doors closed on us closed
on<00:03:16.260> me<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:16.800> that<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.220> know<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.490> will

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
on me so that you know that will

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.610 
on me so that you know that will
continue<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.209> walk<00:03:18.420> down<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:18.720> hallway<00:03:19.170> and

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
continue to walk down that hallway and

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.350 
continue to walk down that hallway and
find<00:03:19.920> other<00:03:20.160> doors<00:03:20.459> that<00:03:20.670> are<00:03:20.700> open<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:21.150> have

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
find other doors that are open to have

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.840 
find other doors that are open to have
even<00:03:21.660> greater<00:03:21.900> opportunities<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.250> whether

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
even greater opportunities and whether

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.090 
even greater opportunities and whether
or<00:03:24.030> not<00:03:24.120> you're<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.360> Christian<00:03:24.870> or<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.110> religious

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
or not you're a Christian or a religious

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.430 
or not you're a Christian or a religious
person<00:03:26.340> yourself<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:27.600> think<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.170> same

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
person yourself I think the same

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.320 
person yourself I think the same
concepts<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.160> apply<00:03:29.459> that<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:29.910> know<00:03:30.000> things

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
concepts to apply that you know things

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.509 
concepts to apply that you know things
do<00:03:30.540> happen<00:03:30.570> for<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:31.140> reason<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:32.220> may<00:03:32.340> not<00:03:32.459> be

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
me believe that there is a plan for

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.150 
me believe that there is a plan for
things<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.269> I<00:04:18.690> think<00:04:18.900> we<00:04:19.019> can<00:04:19.140> all<00:04:19.290> relate<00:04:19.979> to

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
things and I think we can all relate to

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.890 
things and I think we can all relate to
this<00:04:20.280> outside<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.120> terms<00:04:21.359> of<00:04:21.479> video<00:04:21.690> games

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
this outside of the terms of video games

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.409 
this outside of the terms of video games
but<00:04:22.169> in<00:04:22.620> terms<00:04:22.890> of<00:04:23.040> relationships<00:04:23.790> it's

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
but in terms of relationships it's

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.880 
but in terms of relationships it's
obviously<00:04:24.810> really<00:04:25.200> hard<00:04:25.410> going<00:04:25.590> through<00:04:25.710> a

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
obviously really hard going through a

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.240 
obviously really hard going through a
separation<00:04:26.100> with<00:04:26.700> someone<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.150> care<00:04:27.330> about

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
separation with someone you care about

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.280 
separation with someone you care about
and<00:04:28.370> but<00:04:29.300> obviously<00:04:29.420> I<00:04:29.750> mean<00:04:29.900> if<00:04:30.020> we<00:04:30.170> all

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
and but obviously I mean if we all

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.990 
and but obviously I mean if we all
married<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.710> first<00:04:30.950> girl<00:04:31.250> we<00:04:31.520> ever<00:04:31.670> liked
