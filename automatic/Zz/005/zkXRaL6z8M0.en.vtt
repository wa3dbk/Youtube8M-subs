fingers back onto the strings but it

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.920 
fingers back onto the strings but it
never<00:01:30.580> seems<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:30.970> kind<00:01:31.240> of<00:01:31.330> sound<00:01:31.600> quite<00:01:31.900> right

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
playing fours okay just get used to what

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.780 
playing fours okay just get used to what
the<00:02:10.750> feeling<00:02:11.230> of<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.440> is<00:02:11.590> like<00:02:11.830> try<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.220> keep

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
the feeling of it is like try and keep

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.760 
the feeling of it is like try and keep
it<00:02:12.970> nice<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.300> even<00:02:15.990> trying<00:02:16.990> to<00:02:17.080> feel<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.380> little

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
it nice and even trying to feel a little

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.090 
it nice and even trying to feel a little
bit<00:02:17.890> of<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.100> groove<00:02:18.310> on<00:02:19.500> it's<00:02:20.500> very<00:02:20.709> difficult

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
bit of a groove on it's very difficult

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.440 
bit of a groove on it's very difficult
while<00:02:21.250> you're<00:02:21.400> thinking<00:02:21.430> about<00:02:21.850> teaching<00:02:22.090> but

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
while you're thinking about teaching but

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.650 
while you're thinking about teaching but
hopefully<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:22.959> get<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.140> idea<00:02:24.450> getting<00:02:25.450> used

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
hopefully you get the idea getting used

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.550 
hopefully you get the idea getting used
to<00:02:25.810> relaxing<00:02:26.530> that<00:02:26.769> cord<00:02:27.340> hand<00:02:28.080> in<00:02:29.080> between

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
to relaxing that cord hand in between

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.130 
to relaxing that cord hand in between
the<00:02:29.800> different<00:02:30.190> picks<00:02:30.550> okay<00:02:31.360> practice<00:02:32.019> it

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
the different picks okay practice it

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.840 
the different picks okay practice it
with<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.380> sixth<00:02:32.650> string<00:02:32.860> root<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.250> with<00:02:33.760> the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
with the sixth string root and with the

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.040 
with the sixth string root and with the
fifth<00:02:34.060> string<00:02:34.269> root<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.630> course

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
fifth string root of course

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.140 
fifth string root of course
okay<00:02:35.380> again<00:02:35.739> applying<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.850> a<00:02:36.880> jazz

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
okay again applying it to a jazz

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.850 
okay again applying it to a jazz
standard<00:02:37.660> would<00:02:37.810> be<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.959> really<00:02:38.440> really<00:02:38.650> good

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
standard would be a really really good

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.160 
standard would be a really really good
idea<00:02:39.180> probably<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.269> best<00:02:40.480> way<00:02:40.630> to<00:02:40.660> do<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.019> so

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
idea probably the best way to do it so

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.440 
idea probably the best way to do it so
that<00:02:41.560> would<00:02:41.620> be<00:02:41.769> called<00:02:41.980> playing<00:02:42.280> fours<00:02:42.700> now

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
that would be called playing fours now

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.990 
that would be called playing fours now
another<00:02:44.170> kind<00:02:44.680> of<00:02:44.830> thing<00:02:45.190> that<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.370> started<00:02:45.700> out

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
another kind of thing that I started out

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.400 
another kind of thing that I started out
point<00:02:46.299> when<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.480> was<00:02:46.570> playing<00:02:46.810> jazz<00:02:47.110> for<00:02:47.320> the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
point when I was playing jazz for the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.680 
point when I was playing jazz for the
first<00:02:47.620> time<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:48.070> was<00:02:49.000> playing<00:02:49.209> with<00:02:49.299> a<00:02:49.390> lot<00:02:49.570> more

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
first time I was playing with a lot more

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.420 
first time I was playing with a lot more
experienced<00:02:50.320> people<00:02:50.500> than<00:02:50.799> myself<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.280> kind

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
experienced people than myself and kind

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.650 
experienced people than myself and kind
of<00:02:51.549> sitting<00:02:51.820> on<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.000> edge<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.330> piano

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
of sitting on the edge of the piano

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.420 
of sitting on the edge of the piano
stool<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.049> fumbling<00:02:53.620> my<00:02:53.739> way<00:02:54.010> through<00:02:54.250> the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
stool and fumbling my way through the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.870 
stool and fumbling my way through the
tunes

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
tunes

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.030 
tunes
I<00:02:54.970> found<00:02:55.570> playing<00:02:55.810> fours<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.530> little<00:02:56.920> bit

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
I found playing fours a little bit

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.350 
I found playing fours a little bit
difficult<00:02:57.250> especially<00:02:57.670> on<00:02:57.970> getting<00:02:58.269> the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
difficult especially on getting the

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.509 
difficult especially on getting the
chord<00:02:58.630> changes<00:02:59.080> in<00:02:59.140> time<00:02:59.440> so<00:02:59.769> I<00:02:59.950> started

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
chord changes in time so I started

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.340 
chord changes in time so I started
playing<00:03:00.670> this<00:03:00.880> other<00:03:01.090> rhythm<00:03:01.510> which<00:03:01.690> I<00:03:02.019> was

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
playing this other rhythm which I was

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.870 
playing this other rhythm which I was
kind<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.590> copying<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.010> piano<00:03:03.340> player<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.790> I

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
kind of copying the piano player that I

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.100 
kind of copying the piano player that I
was<00:03:04.000> working<00:03:04.180> with<00:03:04.360> that<00:03:04.510> time<00:03:04.690> but<00:03:04.989> it's

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
was working with that time but it's

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.770 
was working with that time but it's
doing<00:03:05.320> more<00:03:05.440> of<00:03:05.500> this<00:03:05.620> sort<00:03:05.769> of<00:03:05.890> thing<00:03:09.299> one<00:03:10.299> two

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
doing more of this sort of thing one two

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.890 
doing more of this sort of thing one two
and<00:03:11.049> three<00:03:11.410> four<00:03:11.890> one<00:03:12.340> two<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.030> three<00:03:13.420> four

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.460 
one
three<00:03:15.400> four<00:03:15.910> because<00:03:16.810> you're<00:03:16.960> putting<00:03:17.230> your

three four because you're putting your

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
hand down on beats two and four as well

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.030 
hand down on beats two and four as well
it<00:03:19.510> gets<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.810> used<00:03:20.020> to<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.320> idea<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.770> the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
it gets you used to that idea of the

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.310 
it gets you used to that idea of the
click<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.880> feeling<00:03:22.300> of<00:03:22.360> jazz<00:03:22.630> being<00:03:22.900> on<00:03:23.080> beats

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
click the feeling of jazz being on beats

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.870 
click the feeling of jazz being on beats
two<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.650> four<00:03:23.860> which<00:03:24.340> is<00:03:24.490> something<00:03:24.670> we're

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
two and four which is something we're

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.880 
two and four which is something we're
going<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.060> talk<00:03:25.210> about<00:03:25.360> a<00:03:25.480> little<00:03:25.630> later<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:26.620> if

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
going to talk about a little later so if

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.200 
going to talk about a little later so if
you<00:03:27.010> just<00:03:27.190> start<00:03:27.400> off<00:03:27.520> with<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.700> G<00:03:27.940> major

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
you just start off with the G major

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.890 
you just start off with the G major
seventh<00:03:28.630> chord<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:29.080> you<00:03:29.440> play<00:03:29.800> one<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.300> then

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
seventh chord and you play one and then

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.840 
seventh chord and you play one and then
when<00:03:32.830> you<00:03:32.980> put<00:03:33.160> your<00:03:33.280> hand<00:03:33.520> in

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
when you put your hand in

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.820 
when you put your hand in
just<00:03:34.540> let<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:34.780> have<00:03:35.020> a<00:03:35.050> little<00:03:35.350> click<00:03:35.530> I'm<00:03:35.680> not

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
just let it have a little click I'm not

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.409 
you use just a little bit of time
between<00:04:23.860> chords<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.760> think<00:04:24.970> about<00:04:25.210> what's

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
between chords to think about what's

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.630

recommend that you practice this up on

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.250 
recommend that you practice this up on
one<00:05:06.490> chord<00:05:06.880> before<00:05:07.390> you<00:05:07.600> start<00:05:07.870> trying<00:05:08.110> to

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
one chord before you start trying to

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.930 
one chord before you start trying to
apply<00:05:08.500> it<00:05:08.620> to<00:05:08.740> a<00:05:08.830> jazz<00:05:09.130> standard<00:05:09.400> that's<00:05:09.820> a

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940

nice you know with all of these things
the<00:05:25.470> first<00:05:25.710> half<00:05:25.980> is<00:05:26.160> getting<00:05:26.310> it<00:05:26.520> right<00:05:26.550> and

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
the first half is getting it right and

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.430 
the first half is getting it right and
getting<00:05:27.210> it<00:05:27.510> kind<00:05:27.690> of<00:05:27.810> if<00:05:27.930> you<00:05:27.960> like<00:05:28.170> getting

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.810 
getting it kind of if you like getting
the<00:05:28.500> maths<00:05:28.740> right<00:05:29.010> get<00:05:29.280> it<00:05:29.400> getting<00:05:29.730> the

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
the maths right get it getting the

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.790 
the maths right get it getting the
mechanics<00:05:30.300> good<00:05:30.570> and<00:05:30.810> getting<00:05:31.260> it<00:05:31.440> so<00:05:31.650> it's

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
mechanics good and getting it so it's

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.620 
mechanics good and getting it so it's
technically<00:05:32.580> the<00:05:32.700> right<00:05:32.730> thing<00:05:33.150> but<00:05:33.360> then<00:05:33.510> the

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
technically the right thing but then the

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.060
