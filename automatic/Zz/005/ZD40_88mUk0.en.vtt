00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.670
 6 we can go outside to grab a nice terrace again 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.890
 barbara in amsterdam 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.300
 do you know the best terraces 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.979
 this is my top five 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:13.329
 at that age, drastically in old west stands on the jacob van lennepstraat 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.739
 pieter job center bit that should of course not be missing 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:26.119
 this will also be the nicest neighborhood 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.359
 a large collection and no longer for it 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.359
 games 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.180
 the plus points are that we actually still find a place 4 and 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.180
 that you contact so quickly other people 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.870
 the best kept secrets of Amsterdam 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.480
 that number four 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.230
 yet standing is hidden next to a candle and close to the waterlooplein 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.980
 the company know that it is sitting here then that i am the same time 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.550
 because of all this it was not possible to recover from all the hustle and bustle 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.880
 you only get healthy and organic at the intersection 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.760
 you can go here for me 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.760
 colombo 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.080
 That is another plus of this time when you finish the ad so you can get one 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.080
 fourth child lie down in the gas 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.190
 by the number three next to the central station on the eleventh floor of the 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.570
 kept a diary 2011 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.570
 typically Italian 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.430
 I remain I am myself and this is the church factory 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.260
 and that comes of course for the powerful view but the translation of 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.970
 a polder 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.409
 the cocktails and snacks and baths wÃ¼rttemberg but how much point 3 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.650
 an extra plus here is already sitting out in 2011, not in Amsterdam 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.129
 when I am abroad 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.569
 number two is thus increasing 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.950
 now its the name i must admit to be honest is honest 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.439
 After the application of local residents, the American ones were in New York 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.259
 You don't have to spend too much time on tourists 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:49.259
 the Amsterdammers left sp.a 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.319
 overlooking the Amsterdam film the water and the tree district you are so the whole 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.449
 bye bye 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:59.719
 but above all it is number one 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:04.659
 then you have how often you hit the elandsgracht the waterfront waterfront 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.579
 is inspired by the most beautiful part of paramaribo on the Surinamese river and net 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.969
 As in Suriname, waterfront is in the center of the city on the water and that 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.379
 put this a tenth place to relax 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.249
 this is a real meeting place because there are all kinds of different types here 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:24.479
 around her with bearded hats that there is a bowl of sapienza 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.219
 reservation is not possible so you must have his plan approved on time 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:34.259
 other social behavior place in power 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.559
 braber 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:44.150
 Sint-Niklaas
