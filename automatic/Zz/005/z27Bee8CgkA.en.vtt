00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello dear friends work today 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.529
 like the softbox mahlow they use as 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.529
 hard light source 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.480
 both today we are back in the studio 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.940
 of marcel photos itself could be the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.280
 check out on facebook today we have 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.780
 this october the last time he already 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.060
 Just take a picture 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.370
 repurposed okay I'm always lying 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.840
 the same day about 20 minutes later 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.280
 we now have who the same time 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.590
 converted and that we have 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.840
 simply from this in the softbox the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.390
 software and i would like one 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.070
 softbox for hard light and hard 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.110
 light is very very interesting 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.699
 a bit harder to control 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.620
 but there is a lot 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.390
 interesting look in the picture I show 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.860
 Take a quick look so you see that's on 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.200
 very very hard shade compared 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.670
 for a very very very last time 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.340
 hard shadow but it does too 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.670
 interesting I'll go to the short here 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.060
 Incidentally, model again terrific alarm 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.280
 or veh we have this huge ob 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.080
 the box without use so very hard 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.610
 direct light from the side 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.990
 of course because we want that, of course 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.759
 it's such a shade to the side 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.800
 Throws pretty far down 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.110
 positioned that you see the 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.580
 Center is almost here 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.560
 shoulder height approximately 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.819
 yes, if you have a smaller softbox 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.649
 then you have to go a little bit higher 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.420
 because it's so big 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.800
 the entire light-so about it over it to 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.470
 if euro sox is a little smaller 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.940
 go a little higher and what 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.039
 important now is not hard if 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.410
 the model turns away dennis face 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.910
 dark on the side where they are 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.560
 turning away so on this page would be very 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.240
 face completely dark because now 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.340
 very very hard shadows are present 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.270
 The model means when I said what I mean 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.039
 always said that I always in the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.770
 direction with the nose in the direction 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.110
 to light the face here completely 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.399
 is lit and here a tough one 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.690
 shadow arises and this hard 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.459
 shadow here at the side does that 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.860
 picture very very interesting look at you 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.510
 again 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.920
 So it can be that something is me 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.290
 she really likes to talk about her too 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.150
 play light that makes it interesting 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.550
 to play with shadow with light 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.290
 Just give it a try 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.300
 hard lightrad light source could 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.099
 also for example in the worst case in the 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.260
 it would take about that 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.510
 bring the same or just once 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.850
 use a flash without light color or 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.680
 just from your softbox times 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.470
 take out the insert and so on 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.760
 Doing the whole thing a little bit from the side 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.200
 So a typical kevin kline loose 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.200
 So I did that before and 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.820
 to now have the hollow throat in here 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.110
 So we have the background so 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.970
 rolled out a bit because we too 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.590
 times the feet have been photographed with but 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.390
 also have some pictures made where it 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.250
 just go to your knees and that 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.150
 horny in a picture for one of the long 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.830
 I find shadows very interesting 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.930
 it always has to go there 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.580
 be turned and even the shadow of 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.050
 on the side is here you have to 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.910
 Pay attention to how the model moves 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.100
 because there are some shadows then 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.320
 very funny look at the side so there 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.610
 always pay attention and always the pictures 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.080
 control and also the picture 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.790
 watch how it changes 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.790
 shadow when I changed this and that 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.430
 at the aperture 11 currently 160 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.170
 shutter speed iso 100 white lightning and 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.170
 We have about the blitz now about 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.930
 Level 3 regulated what that means yes 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.240
 So that would be exactly what you know of course 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.950
 vary depending on how strong a flash 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.990
 is depending on how big your light form 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.400
 After how much space is available 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.170
 so that you can not now, unfortunately, 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.090
 to generalize means to try something 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.370
 is about studying 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.750
 I hope so learned what if there is 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.970
 no thumbs up subscribes to the 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.810
 Kanal and see you next time 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.810
 happy times
