00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.490
 with youtube friends as they are 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.590
 welcome to a new video of 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.390
 minecraft because they tell you guys and in 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.580
 this case is to do a review of 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.350
 texture I have not done for a long time 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.270
 a very good one and many have been 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.220
 asking what is the name of the 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.810
 texture that I have been using in 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.090
 these latest videos like that of the 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.460
 acidity or acraf that's why I decided to 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.170
 present this and the truth is that 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.910
 the texture is very cool because 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.800
 maintains some aspects of the texture 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.560
 original but it gives another touch more 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.550
 colorful this texture is called 3 t3 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.500
 simple has the resolution 16 x 16 by 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.480
 what the ATC will not be increased or 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.460
 diminished it will be as if you had the 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.360
 default texture this texture was 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.399
 created by 3 t3 rn to 768 what name more 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.620
 creative and remember that they can happen to 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.030
 the description to download I'm going 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.829

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.110

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.300

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.770
 how to install this type of textures 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.050
 I will leave a video below in the description 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.050

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:19.060
 both in android and in ios and good 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.060

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.390

 same guys that was the whole review of 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.920
 texture is actually very cool because 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.990
 as I said, it maintains some aspects 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.030
 of the original text of minecraft and 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.830
