 recipes 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.299
 and today i will show you the recipe which 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.040
 it has long been promised homemade cakes 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.349
 I showed my previous recipes 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.890
 how to cook babaganush pate of 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:21.199
 eggplant and chickpea hummus so these 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.060
 Home-made cakes are great for 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.980
 hummus u and k babaganush 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.310
 in different countries, these cakes are known 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.369
 under different names in india this 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.050
 chapatis we are better known as pit 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.180
 and now I'll show you how to cook them 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.370
 These flat cakes are prepared very simply them 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.480
 can be served with any dish as 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.510
 plain bread 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.480
 and besides, these tortillas are empty inside 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:53.260
 of them you can make such pockets and 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.260
 fill them with any fillings to your taste 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.170
 pita or chapati can be cooked as from 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.500
 common wheat flour 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.780
 so from wheat wholegrain of course 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.580
 whole wheat flour tortillas much 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.800
 more useful but unfortunately now 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.920
 no whole wheat flour so I 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.630
 I will prepare from usually on two glasses of flour 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:30.890
 add a teaspoon of salt and 4 tablespoons 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:36.380
 spoons of oil stir fray flour 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:39.009
 and start adding water add water 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.009
 little by little 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.820
 add water until 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:56.630
 get soft 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:02:00.980
 about my skirt and mom will not do 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.670
 cakes here dough is ready it should 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.820
 get so soft and pliable 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.020
 now put it in a bowl set 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.840
 film and leave in a warm place 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.880
 rest for ten minutes the dough is rested 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.570
 Now we powder the table with flour 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:25.190
 we pinch off a piece of dough about here 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:28.610
 this size we roll it into a ball slightly 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.630
 roll in flour and roll out very 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.630
 thin cake 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.010
 and in this way we roll everything 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.380
 the dough that we have warmed up 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.580
 the pan should be dry 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:56.959
 without oil and lay on it by 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:00.050
 queues of rolled flat cakes baked on 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.540
 about half a minute with 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:07.360
 each side of the cake should start 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.920
 bubbles are bubbling 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:16.640
 you can flip and point to another 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:20.000
 side along the way light the fire under 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.989
 I use this grid from the grid 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.630
 convection oven 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.430
 you can use any grill better 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.610
 just fine act on it more convenient 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.360
 bake sleep and ignite fall to brush 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:37.150
 fire and remove the cake from the pan and 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.150
 we transfer to the lattice for a while 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:51.800
 here is the cake went to inflate is inflated 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.660
 she due to water vapor which 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:01.560
 heat up inside the tortillas and inflates 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:04.430
 its like a ball from the inside when tortilla 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:09.380
 bloated it can be removed from the fire 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:12.450
 she is ready and bake the next batch 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:17.060
 when you take a cake from the fire it 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.060
 stops swelling it deflates 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.340
 you can cook chapati in the same way 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.440
 oven without pan for this oven 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.820
 heat up to maximum temperature 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.310
 I have this set of 250 degrees Celsius 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.240
 oven rack in the lower part 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:40.320
 oven grate in the oven too 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.840
 large and flat cakes may sag due 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.820
 of this they rise badly therefore 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.190
 you can put this lattice out from under 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.750
 aerogrill or other finely unclean 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:05:02.580
 lattice so that the cakes do not sag and 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:05:05.220
 cook like this close the oven and wait 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.130
 when the cake will swell in the oven 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.160
 Chapati cakes swell longer than 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.640
 open fire but less their risk 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.990
 burn on an open fire you need to follow 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.990
 ensuring that they are not burnt 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:25.110
 I personally prefer this way 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:29.810
 baking chapati in the oven here's a tortilla 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:32.729
 went to duat himself little by little bubbles 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.540
 the pellet is inflated internal 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:39.600
 a cavity is formed then a cake can 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:43.260
 will cut in half and get two 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:47.470
 pocket in the pocket can be put any 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:52.630
 stuffing for fitting mousse or babaganush 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:55.050
 with various vegetables and herbs recipes 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:06:00.850
 hummus and eggplant posts babaganush 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:06.400
 See my previous video chapati 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:10.720
 ready they can be cut in half to 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:13.320
 get pockets get these 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.590
 pockets that can be put stuffing 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:20.100
 no, we are laying here everything we want 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.100
 for example tomatoes 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.270
 i wish you bon appetite and 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.360
 good health to new meetings on 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.659
