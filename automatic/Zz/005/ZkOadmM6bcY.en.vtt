hello<00:00:00.930> YouTube<00:00:01.500> I've<00:00:02.190> just<00:00:02.490> completed<00:00:02.909> my

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
hello YouTube I've just completed my

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.820 
hello YouTube I've just completed my
latest<00:00:03.419> project<00:00:04.069> and<00:00:05.069> that<00:00:05.220> would<00:00:05.370> be<00:00:06.589> p38<00:00:07.589> or

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
latest project and that would be p38 or

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.669 
latest project and that would be p38 or
as<00:00:08.250> close<00:00:08.370> as<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.760> can<00:00:08.820> get<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.179> one<00:00:09.349> then<00:00:10.349> the

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
as close as I can get to one then the

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.700 
as close as I can get to one then the
bounds<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.099> gmod<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.990> not<00:00:12.990> parenting<00:00:13.469> things

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
bounds of gmod and not parenting things

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.800 
bounds of gmod and not parenting things
I<00:00:13.980> don't<00:00:14.670> like<00:00:14.849> parenting<00:00:15.450> things<00:00:16.010> anyway

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
I don't like parenting things anyway

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.470 
I don't like parenting things anyway
these<00:00:18.810> engines<00:00:19.289> were<00:00:19.470> going<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.830> go<00:00:19.949> into<00:00:20.130> it

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
these engines were going to go into it

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.279 
these engines were going to go into it
but<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.800> had<00:00:22.800> like<00:00:22.980> ten<00:00:23.430> frames<00:00:23.850> when<00:00:24.510> they<00:00:25.230> were

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
but I had like ten frames when they were

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.310 
but I had like ten frames when they were
in<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.680> even<00:00:26.279> even<00:00:27.060> with<00:00:27.210> kenton<00:00:27.720> I'll<00:00:27.930> admit<00:00:28.109> I

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
in it even even with kenton I'll admit I

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.420 
in it even even with kenton I'll admit I
tried<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:29.990> even<00:00:30.990> with<00:00:31.140> pantry<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.710> was<00:00:31.800> low<00:00:32.099> and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
tried it even with pantry it was low and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.810 
tried it even with pantry it was low and
right<00:00:33.180> now<00:00:33.300> we're<00:00:33.480> running<00:00:33.780> like<00:00:33.989> 20<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.829> at

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
right now we're running like 20 so at

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.840 
right now we're running like 20 so at
least<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.360> slideshow<00:00:37.430> these<00:00:38.430> engines

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
least it's not a slideshow these engines

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.660 
least it's not a slideshow these engines
here<00:00:39.090> are<00:00:39.450> Alison<00:00:40.110> b12<00:00:40.590> they<00:00:41.010> were<00:00:41.070> wit<00:00:41.430> went

here are Alison b12 they were wit went

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.200 
here are Alison b12 they were wit went
into<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> p38<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.280> left<00:00:44.760> hand<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
into the p38 and the left hand and the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.450 
into the p38 and the left hand and the
right<00:00:45.270> hand<00:00:45.420> both<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.260> different<00:00:46.460> firing

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
right hand both have different firing

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.540 
right hand both have different firing
orders<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.870> made<00:00:49.590> two<00:00:49.860> different<00:00:50.190> engines

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
orders and I made two different engines

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.619 
orders and I made two different engines
with<00:00:51.120> two<00:00:51.270> different<00:00:51.449> firing<00:00:51.960> orders<00:00:53.480> you<00:00:54.480> can

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
with two different firing orders you can

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:16.060 
with two different firing orders you can
kind<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.170> see<00:00:55.520> anyway

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.200 

they're<00:01:17.070> happy<00:01:17.450> easy<00:01:18.450> access<00:01:18.750> system<00:01:20.210> okay

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
they're happy easy access system okay

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.930 
they're happy easy access system okay
now<00:01:21.510> next<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.470> plane<00:01:22.800> what<00:01:23.460> does<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> plane

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
now next the plane what does the plane

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.250 
now next the plane what does the plane
do<00:01:24.350> well<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.470> does<00:01:25.620> many<00:01:25.890> things<00:01:27.680> it<00:01:28.680> has

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
do well it does many things it has

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.910 
do well it does many things it has
a<00:01:30.350> new<00:01:31.070> year<00:01:31.370> that's<00:01:32.180> right<00:01:32.620> that<00:01:33.620> was<00:01:33.770> the

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
a new year that's right that was the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.320 
a new year that's right that was the
thing<00:01:34.070> that's<00:01:34.280> stopping<00:01:34.550> me<00:01:34.760> most<00:01:35.060> from

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
thing that's stopping me most from

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.160 
thing that's stopping me most from
completing<00:01:35.720> this<00:01:35.900> project

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.450 

all<00:01:41.170> right<00:01:41.320> it's<00:01:41.710> a<00:01:41.770> little<00:01:41.920> bit<00:01:42.130> different

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
all right it's a little bit different

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.649 
all right it's a little bit different
than<00:01:42.579> my<00:01:42.729> other<00:01:42.759> landing<00:01:43.180> gear<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:44.560> close<00:01:45.659> get

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
than my other landing gear but close get

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:58.210 
than my other landing gear but close get
rid<00:01:46.750> of<00:01:46.810> this<00:01:46.930> camera

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.170 

the<00:01:59.220> landing<00:01:59.550> gear<00:01:59.730> has<00:02:00.950> suspension<00:02:02.180> yeah

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
the landing gear has suspension yeah

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.620 
the landing gear has suspension yeah
because<00:02:03.690> we<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:04.050> suspension<00:02:05.300> my<00:02:06.300> other<00:02:06.480> one

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
because we like suspension my other one

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.320 
because we like suspension my other one
didn't<00:02:07.040> it's<00:02:08.040> got<00:02:08.220> four<00:02:08.550> machine<00:02:08.850> guns<00:02:09.090> and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
didn't it's got four machine guns and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.290 
didn't it's got four machine guns and
big<00:02:09.869> ass<00:02:10.050> cannon<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.710> don't<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.790> pew<00:02:12.090> pew

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
big ass cannon I don't have pew pew

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.900 
big ass cannon I don't have pew pew
working<00:02:13.160> mysteriously<00:02:14.160> stopped<00:02:14.490> working

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
working mysteriously stopped working

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.080 
working mysteriously stopped working
recently<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.660> i<00:02:16.220> used<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.400> space<00:02:18.000> build<00:02:18.270> thing

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
recently so i used a space build thing

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.210 
recently so i used a space build thing
propellers<00:02:21.090> might<00:02:21.900> be<00:02:22.020> wondering<00:02:22.200> Tony<00:02:22.890> did

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
propellers might be wondering Tony did

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.490 
propellers might be wondering Tony did
you<00:02:23.310> go<00:02:23.490> back<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.910> propeller<00:02:24.300> tool<00:02:24.630> no

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
you go back to the propeller tool no

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.050 
you go back to the propeller tool no
these<00:02:26.010> are<00:02:26.190> Finn<00:02:26.400> propellers<00:02:27.000> they<00:02:27.930> turn<00:02:29.060> like

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
these are Finn propellers they turn like

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.600 
these are Finn propellers they turn like
so<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.910> reason<00:02:33.060> they're<00:02:33.300> like<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.690> is

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
so the reason they're like that is

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.480 
so the reason they're like that is
because<00:02:35.690> they<00:02:36.690> are<00:02:36.900> that's<00:02:37.680> right<00:02:37.980> they're

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
because they are that's right they're

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.000 
because they are that's right they're
adjustable<00:02:38.970> brothers<00:02:39.830> something<00:02:40.830> I've<00:02:40.980> been

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
adjustable brothers something I've been

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.690 
adjustable brothers something I've been
wanting<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.300> do<00:02:42.420> for<00:02:42.450> quite<00:02:42.840> some<00:02:43.050> time<00:02:43.700> as

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
wanting to do for quite some time as

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.190 
wanting to do for quite some time as
soon<00:02:44.910> as<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.150> start<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:45.600> you're<00:02:45.780> probably<00:02:45.930> not

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
soon as I start this you're probably not

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.480 
soon as I start this you're probably not
gonna<00:02:46.320> be<00:02:46.410> able<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.650> hear<00:02:46.770> my<00:02:46.920> voice<00:02:47.100> because<00:02:47.310> I

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
gonna be able to hear my voice because I

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.150 
gonna be able to hear my voice because I
know<00:02:47.550> my<00:02:47.760> microphone<00:02:48.270> can<00:02:48.810> be<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:49.140> little<00:02:49.740> bit

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
know my microphone can be a little bit

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.210 
know my microphone can be a little bit
quiet<00:02:50.720> but<00:02:51.720> i'm<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:51.840> going<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.140> fly<00:02:52.890> once

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
quiet but i'm just going to fly once

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.100 
quiet but i'm just going to fly once
around<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.610> map<00:02:53.850> maybe<00:02:54.300> try<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.840> shoot<00:02:55.050> a

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
around the map maybe try and shoot a

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.080 
around the map maybe try and shoot a
plane<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.590> placed<00:02:55.980> maybe<00:02:56.550> try<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:56.940> do<00:02:57.060> a

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
plane that placed maybe try and do a

00:02:57.090 --> 00:05:09.380 
plane that placed maybe try and do a
loop<00:02:59.120> okay

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:20.410 

we<00:05:09.990> heard
