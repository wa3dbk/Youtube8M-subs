to go in and show you normal mode right
now<00:00:15.740> now<00:00:16.740> basically<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.250> object<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.820> to

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
now now basically the object is to

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.410 
now now basically the object is to
collect<00:00:18.510> all<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.590> stars<00:00:19.939> by<00:00:20.939> tapping<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
screen now as you do so red orbs will

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.349 
screen now as you do so red orbs will
spawn<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.830> obviously<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.760> want<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.000> miss

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
spawn and obviously you want to miss

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.650 
spawn and obviously you want to miss
these<00:00:27.859> or<00:00:28.859> they<00:00:29.099> will<00:00:29.279> end<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.699> game<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:30.179> you

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.330 

moree<00:00:36.660> collect<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:38.460> harder<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.850> gets<00:00:40.340> green

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
moree collect the harder it gets green

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.549 
moree collect the harder it gets green
orbs<00:00:41.969> will<00:00:42.149> spawn<00:00:42.450> every<00:00:43.050> once<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.379> while

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
orbs will spawn every once in a while

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.130 
orbs will spawn every once in a while
and<00:00:43.890> their<00:00:44.280> power<00:00:44.520> ups<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.270> basically<00:00:45.750> there's

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
and their power ups so basically there's

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.540 
and their power ups so basically there's
seven<00:00:46.469> different<00:00:46.590> power-ups<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.340> get

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
seven different power-ups you can get

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.420 
seven different power-ups you can get
and<00:00:48.410> you<00:00:49.410> never<00:00:49.590> know<00:00:49.710> what<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.039> until<00:00:50.370> you

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and you never know what it is until you

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.569 
and you never know what it is until you
actually<00:00:50.969> get<00:00:51.780> them<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.860> that's<00:00:53.010> slow<00:00:53.370> down

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
actually get them and that's slow down

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.819 
actually get them and that's slow down
so<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.969> slows<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.390> red<00:00:54.570> balls<00:00:54.780> down<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.680> me

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
so it slows the red balls down for me

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.490 
so it slows the red balls down for me
for<00:00:56.039> about<00:00:56.129> five<00:00:56.460> seconds<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:58.350> they

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
for about five seconds and then they

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:25.609 
for about five seconds and then they
start<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:58.890> again<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.810> there's<00:01:25.170> another<00:01:25.409> one

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
start up again and there's another one

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.179 
start up again and there's another one
hopefully<00:01:25.799> if<00:01:26.130> some<00:01:26.340> good<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.790> will<00:01:26.909> help<00:01:27.030> us

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
hopefully if some good that will help us

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.530 
hopefully if some good that will help us
more<00:01:29.189> stars<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.909> didn't<00:01:30.150> really<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.450> it
