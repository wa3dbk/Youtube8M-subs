00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570 

I<00:00:00.089> knew<00:00:00.480> going<00:00:00.780> into<00:00:01.110> buying<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:01.860> house<00:00:02.129> that

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
I knew going into buying this house that

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.050 
I knew going into buying this house that
I<00:00:03.030> would<00:00:03.480> have<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.899> pay<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.799> have<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:05.430> asbestos

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
I would have to pay to have the asbestos

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.530 
I would have to pay to have the asbestos
removed<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.660> I<00:00:06.720> think<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:08.330> don't<00:00:09.330> know

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
removed and I think that I don't know

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.900 
removed and I think that I don't know
how<00:00:09.780> many<00:00:09.840> people<00:00:10.530> think<00:00:11.190> about<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.670> when

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
how many people think about that when

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.459 
how many people think about that when
when<00:00:12.240> they<00:00:12.360> go<00:00:12.480> into<00:00:12.630> purchasing<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.259> property

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
when they go into purchasing a property

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.900 
when they go into purchasing a property
but<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.219> something<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.670> was<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:14.880> my

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
but this is something that was in my

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.439 
but this is something that was in my
mind<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:16.560> factored<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.070> into<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.880> cost<00:00:18.119> I

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
mind and I factored that into the cost I

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.240 
mind and I factored that into the cost I
guess<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.140> purchasing<00:00:21.050> so<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.080> contacted<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
guess of purchasing so I contacted a

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.460 
guess of purchasing so I contacted a
number<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:24.080> removalists<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.199> got<00:00:25.320> some

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
number of removalists and got some

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.750 
number of removalists and got some
prices<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.130> they<00:00:26.250> were<00:00:26.400> sort<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.730> know

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
prices and they were sort of you know

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.000 
prices and they were sort of you know
rooting<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.330> within<00:00:27.570> what<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.900> would<00:00:28.890> have

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
rooting it within what I would have

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.150 
rooting it within what I would have
thought<00:00:29.189> was<00:00:29.429> fair<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:31.080> kind<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.590> job

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
thought was fair for that kind of a job

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.209 
thought was fair for that kind of a job
I<00:00:32.219> mean<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:32.610> fairly<00:00:33.440> involved<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.950> actual

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
I mean it's fairly involved the actual

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.040 
I mean it's fairly involved the actual
process<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.820> learned<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.300> lot<00:00:36.420> sort<00:00:36.989> of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
process and I learned a lot sort of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.790 
process and I learned a lot sort of
going<00:00:37.410> through<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.890> what<00:00:38.370> they<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.030> do

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
going through this what they have to do

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.139 
going through this what they have to do
in<00:00:40.800> terms<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.340> suiting<00:00:41.700> up<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
in terms of suiting up and the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.450 
in terms of suiting up and the
respirators<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:42.870> sealing<00:00:43.620> off<00:00:43.739> areas<00:00:44.219> and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
respirators and sealing off areas and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.060 
respirators and sealing off areas and
things<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.059> very<00:00:45.239> intricate<00:00:45.510> job<00:00:46.070> in

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
things and it's a very intricate job in

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.729 
things and it's a very intricate job in
the<00:00:47.430> process<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.090> getting<00:00:48.210> these<00:00:48.539> quotes<00:00:48.960> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the process of getting these quotes to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.340 
the process of getting these quotes to
have<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:51.149> asbestos<00:00:51.539> removed<00:00:52.110> from<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
have the the asbestos removed from the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.110 
have the the asbestos removed from the
sleepout<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:53.760> sort<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.660> inside<00:00:55.199> walls<00:00:55.559> and

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
sleepout in sort of inside walls and

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.490 
sleepout in sort of inside walls and
removing<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> damaged<00:00:57.629> panels<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> backs

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
removing the damaged panels on the backs

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.750 
removing the damaged panels on the backs
there<00:00:58.739> was<00:00:58.829> no<00:00:58.980> way<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.190> was<00:00:59.430> going<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.609> leave

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
there was no way I was going to leave

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.990 
there was no way I was going to leave
those<00:01:00.949> we<00:01:01.949> discovered<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.699> there<00:01:02.879> was

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
those we discovered that there was

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.240 
those we discovered that there was
asbestos<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.750> bathroom<00:01:04.260> as<00:01:04.710> well<00:01:04.949> and

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
asbestos in a bathroom as well and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.929 
asbestos in a bathroom as well and
apparently<00:01:05.700> that's<00:01:05.939> very<00:01:06.270> common<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.939> you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
apparently that's very common and you

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.840 
apparently that's very common and you
know<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.299> was<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> old<00:01:09.810> original<00:01:10.850> 1950s

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
know this was the old original 1950s

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.770 
know this was the old original 1950s
bathroom<00:01:12.710> underneath<00:01:13.710> these<00:01:14.040> tiles<00:01:14.760> at<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
bathroom underneath these tiles at the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.149 
bathroom underneath these tiles at the
back<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> shower<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:16.890> see<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
back of the shower that you can see the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.710 
back of the shower that you can see the
sort<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.369> turquoise<00:01:17.610> color<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> bit<00:01:18.509> hazy

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
sort of turquoise color it's a bit hazy

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.440 
sort of turquoise color it's a bit hazy
because<00:01:18.960> there<00:01:19.140> wasn't<00:01:19.290> any<00:01:19.500> light<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.979> there

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
because there wasn't any light in there

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.050 
because there wasn't any light in there
up<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.960> about<00:01:22.920> where<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.310> showerhead<00:01:23.729> ease

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
up to about where the showerhead ease

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.179 
up to about where the showerhead ease
which<00:01:24.750> would<00:01:24.900> pretty<00:01:25.110> view<00:01:25.320> about<00:01:25.470> about<00:01:25.830> six

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
which would pretty view about about six

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.149 
which would pretty view about about six
foot<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.729> that's<00:01:27.560> asbestos<00:01:28.560> sheeting<00:01:29.009> all

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
foot or so that's asbestos sheeting all

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.160 
foot or so that's asbestos sheeting all
the<00:01:29.670> way<00:01:29.759> around<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> bathroom<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.810> floor

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the way around the bathroom to the floor

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.090 
the way around the bathroom to the floor
and<00:01:32.090> above<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.689> just<00:01:34.020> regular<00:01:34.229> plaster

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
and above it is just regular plaster

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.069 
and above it is just regular plaster
board<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.549> found<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.479> don't<00:01:36.720> know<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:36.930> that's

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
board we found so I don't know if that's

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.690 
board we found so I don't know if that's
been<00:01:37.259> changed<00:01:37.740> or<00:01:37.829> whatever<00:01:38.040> at<00:01:38.159> some<00:01:38.369> point

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
been changed or whatever at some point

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.940 
been changed or whatever at some point
so<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.420> course<00:01:39.570> if<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.409> wanted<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.740> renovate

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
so of course if I wanted to renovate

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.499 
so of course if I wanted to renovate
which<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.369> did<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.610> wanted<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.119> pull<00:01:42.329> out<00:01:42.479> that

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
which I did I wanted to pull out that

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.410 
which I did I wanted to pull out that
entire<00:01:42.930> bathroom<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.920> had<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:44.939> had<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.090> remove

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
entire bathroom I had we had to remove

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.240 
entire bathroom I had we had to remove
all<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.170> those<00:01:46.259> tiles<00:01:46.710> all<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.130> asbestos

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
all of those tiles all the asbestos

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.420 
all of those tiles all the asbestos
behind<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.200> was<00:01:49.350> another<00:01:49.590> major<00:01:49.950> job

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
behind it so that was another major job

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.469 
behind it so that was another major job
so<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.700> was<00:01:50.820> something<00:01:51.180> else

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
so that was something else

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.359 
so that was something else
to<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.869> know<00:01:52.020> think<00:01:52.649> about<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.979> factored

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
to you know think about and factored

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.010 
to you know think about and factored
into<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.729> cost<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.420> was<00:01:54.540> okay<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.960> know

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
into it cost but that was okay you know

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.260 
into it cost but that was okay you know
so<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:56.040> did<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.399> as<00:01:56.610> well<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:56.969> pulled

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
so so we did that as well and we pulled

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.439 
so so we did that as well and we pulled
all<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.840> out<00:01:58.049> as<00:01:58.259> well
