00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.050 

hello<00:00:01.050> guys<00:00:01.230> welcome<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.860> my<00:00:02.370> video<00:00:02.639> and

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hello guys welcome to my video and

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.670 
hello guys welcome to my video and
consider<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.780> following

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
consider the following

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.890 
consider the following
consider<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.910> following<00:00:08.599> so<00:00:09.599> today<00:00:09.870> I

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
consider the following so today I

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.900 
consider the following so today I
accidentally<00:00:10.620> spilled<00:00:10.679> water<00:00:11.130> on<00:00:11.309> my<00:00:11.519> floor

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
accidentally spilled water on my floor

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.140 
accidentally spilled water on my floor
and<00:00:11.940> then<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.599> thought<00:00:12.960> hmmm<00:00:13.740> if<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.759> let<00:00:14.969> this

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
and then I thought hmmm if I let this

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.170 
and then I thought hmmm if I let this
sit<00:00:15.389> out<00:00:15.599> shouldn't<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.619> evaporate<00:00:17.430> then<00:00:18.000> I

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
sit out shouldn't it evaporate then I

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.650 
sit out shouldn't it evaporate then I
was<00:00:18.359> like<00:00:18.539> wait<00:00:18.990> shouldn't<00:00:19.830> water<00:00:20.250> only

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
was like wait shouldn't water only

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.060 
was like wait shouldn't water only
evaporate<00:00:21.660> at<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> hundred<00:00:22.109> degrees<00:00:22.350> Celsius

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
evaporate at a hundred degrees Celsius

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.519 
evaporate at a hundred degrees Celsius
since<00:00:23.670> that's<00:00:24.000> when<00:00:24.300> water<00:00:24.630> turns<00:00:25.019> into<00:00:25.140> water

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
since that's when water turns into water

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.070 
since that's when water turns into water
vapor<00:00:25.890> right<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.210> my<00:00:27.330> question<00:00:27.930> to

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
vapor right so this is my question to

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.339 
vapor right so this is my question to
you<00:00:28.109> guys<00:00:28.470> today<00:00:28.820> why<00:00:29.820> do<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:30.269> see<00:00:30.599> evaporation

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
you guys today why do we see evaporation

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.260 
you guys today why do we see evaporation
well<00:00:31.740> not<00:00:31.980> necessarily<00:00:32.610> really<00:00:32.759> seeing<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
well not necessarily really seeing the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.970 
well not necessarily really seeing the
evaporation<00:00:33.899> process<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.620> actually

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
evaporation process but it's actually

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.290 
evaporation process but it's actually
there<00:00:35.160> but<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.550> know<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.700> can't<00:00:35.940> really<00:00:36.090> see

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
there but you know you can't really see

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.790 
there but you know you can't really see
it<00:00:36.329> cuz<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.899> gas<00:00:37.079> phase<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:37.469> anyways

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
it cuz it's in the gas phase but anyways

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.970 
it cuz it's in the gas phase but anyways
why<00:00:38.399> do<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.910> see<00:00:39.210> evaporation<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.590> water

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
why do we see evaporation of the water

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.299 
why do we see evaporation of the water
when<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:41.969> leave<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.329> out<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.079> long<00:00:43.350> at<00:00:43.829> room

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
when we leave it out for so long at room

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.220 
when we leave it out for so long at room
temperature<00:00:45.030> I'll<00:00:45.480> give<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.840> moment<00:00:46.200> to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
temperature I'll give you a moment to

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.110 
temperature I'll give you a moment to
think<00:00:46.440> about<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.730> while<00:00:47.910> you're

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
think about this so while you're

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.400 
think about this so while you're
thinking<00:00:48.149> about<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.960> you're<00:00:49.200> probably

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
thinking about that you're probably

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.200 
thinking about that you're probably
wondering<00:00:49.980> why<00:00:50.160> do<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.520> have<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.449> bag<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.710> my

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
wondering why do I have a bag on my

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.889 
wondering why do I have a bag on my
bench<00:00:54.210> weight<00:00:55.140> or<00:00:55.350> squat<00:00:55.680> rack<00:00:55.949> or<00:00:56.309> this

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
bench weight or squat rack or this

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.200 
bench weight or squat rack or this
barbell<00:00:57.899> well<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.980> grew<00:00:59.280> up<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.579> family<00:00:59.760> that

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
barbell well I grew up in a family that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.840 
barbell well I grew up in a family that
loves<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.930> compromise<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.370> learned<00:01:02.699> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
loves to compromise and I learned a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.630 
loves to compromise and I learned a
valuable<00:01:03.030> thing<00:01:03.359> how<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.019> use<00:01:04.799> my<00:01:05.040> surrounding

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
valuable thing how to use my surrounding

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.210 
valuable thing how to use my surrounding
or<00:01:05.850> my<00:01:06.000> environment<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:07.070> everyday<00:01:08.070> things

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
or my environment for everyday things

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.980 
or my environment for everyday things
that<00:01:08.790> we<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:10.200> order<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.510> decrease<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
that we have in order to decrease the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.179 
that we have in order to decrease the
value<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.530> something<00:01:13.770> or<00:01:14.610> let's<00:01:15.600> say<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.320> make

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
value in something or let's say to make

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.910 
value in something or let's say to make
something<00:01:17.490> much<00:01:17.820> cheaper<00:01:18.420> using<00:01:19.290> alternative

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
something much cheaper using alternative

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.179 
something much cheaper using alternative
sources<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:21.240> basically<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:22.439> bag<00:01:22.860> it

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
sources so basically this bag it

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.710 
sources so basically this bag it
contains<00:01:24.000> us<00:01:24.420> five<00:01:25.049> pounds<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.119> jar<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.420> guess

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
contains us five pounds of jar I guess

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.830 
contains us five pounds of jar I guess
so<00:01:28.110> there<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.409> go<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.799> don't<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.159> buy<00:01:29.310> a

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
so there you go I don't have to buy a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.789 
so there you go I don't have to buy a
five-pound<00:01:30.840> weight<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.259> cost<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.619> five

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
five-pound weight that cost like five

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.710 
five-pound weight that cost like five
dollars<00:01:32.009> well<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:32.909> get<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.329> three

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
dollars well I can just get like a three

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.020 
dollars well I can just get like a three
dollar<00:01:33.840> milk<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.799> drink<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.520> then

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
dollar milk that I can drink it and then

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.330 
dollar milk that I can drink it and then
as<00:01:36.210> well<00:01:36.420> as<00:01:36.450> use<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.840> carton<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:38.100> came

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
as well as use the carton that it came

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.660 
as well as use the carton that it came
with<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.600> yeah<00:01:40.530> there's<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.220> compromise

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
with it so yeah there's a compromise

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.819 
with it so yeah there's a compromise
experience<00:01:42.420> right<00:01:42.600> there<00:01:42.630> anyways<00:01:43.470> let's<00:01:43.710> get

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
experience right there anyways let's get

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.639 
experience right there anyways let's get
back<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.790> answer<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.659> question<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
back to the answer to that question and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.469 
back to the answer to that question and
so<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.009> answer<00:01:47.189> has<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.549> do<00:01:47.790> with<00:01:47.970> collisions

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
so the answer has to do with collisions

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.149 
so the answer has to do with collisions
of<00:01:48.600> random<00:01:48.869> water<00:01:49.049> molecules<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.740> causes<00:01:50.040> an

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
of random water molecules that causes an

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.609 
of random water molecules that causes an
uneven<00:01:50.610> distribution<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.390> kinetic<00:01:51.689> energy<00:01:51.930> at

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
uneven distribution of kinetic energy at

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.020 
uneven distribution of kinetic energy at
any<00:01:52.649> given<00:01:53.009> point<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.369> time<00:01:53.399> further

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
any given point in time further

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.370 
any given point in time further
described<00:01:54.420> as<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> Maxwell<00:01:55.259> Boltzmann

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
described as the Maxwell Boltzmann

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.289 
described as the Maxwell Boltzmann
distribution<00:01:55.909> essentially<00:01:56.909> what<00:01:57.180> is

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
distribution essentially what is

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.330 
distribution essentially what is
happening<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.590> mullen<00:01:58.860> molecules

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
happening is that the mullen molecules

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.670 
happening is that the mullen molecules
near<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.700> surface<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.630> acquire<00:02:01.020> enough

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
near the surface can acquire enough

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.789 
near the surface can acquire enough
energy<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.280> escape<00:02:02.880> as<00:02:03.119> water<00:02:03.420> vapor<00:02:03.689> due<00:02:04.229> to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
energy to escape as water vapor due to

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.069 
energy to escape as water vapor due to
collisions<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.700> water<00:02:06.000> molecules<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.899> the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
collisions of water molecules and the

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.900 
collisions of water molecules and the
kinetic<00:02:07.439> energy<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.250> now<00:02:08.429> you're<00:02:08.670> probably

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
kinetic energy so now you're probably

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.029 
kinetic energy so now you're probably
wondering<00:02:09.629> why<00:02:09.959> does<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.770> be<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
wondering why does it have to be the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.619 
wondering why does it have to be the
surface<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.819> water<00:02:12.000> how<00:02:12.209> come<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:12.480> don't

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
surface of the water how come we don't

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.720 
surface of the water how come we don't
see<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:13.080> evaporation<00:02:13.620> process<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.640> the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
see that evaporation process like in the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.000 
see that evaporation process like in the
middle<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.599> like<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.230> interior<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.920> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
middle and like the interior of the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.680 
middle and like the interior of the
puddle<00:02:17.340> while<00:02:17.849> I<00:02:17.879> have<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.120> do<00:02:18.360> with<00:02:18.569> the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
puddle while I have to do with the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.540 
puddle while I have to do with the
surface<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.379> puddle<00:02:19.620> which<00:02:19.980> has<00:02:20.250> more

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
surface of the puddle which has more

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.670 
surface of the puddle which has more
contact<00:02:21.120> with<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.450> environment<00:02:21.680> surrounding

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
contact with the environment surrounding

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.760 
contact with the environment surrounding
environment<00:02:23.520> than<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.720> interior<00:02:25.349> of<00:02:25.650> the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
environment than the interior of the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.530 
environment than the interior of the
puddle<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.190> that's<00:02:26.370> why<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:26.550> see<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
puddle so that's why you see that the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.869 
puddle so that's why you see that the
exterior<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.739> puddle<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.160> evaporating

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
exterior of the puddle is evaporating

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.400 
exterior of the puddle is evaporating
more<00:02:30.000> quickly<00:02:30.239> than<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.720> interior<00:02:31.260> and

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
more quickly than the interior and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.710 
more quickly than the interior and
that's<00:02:31.560> why<00:02:31.709> whenever<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.310> see<00:02:32.519> a<00:02:32.790> droplet<00:02:33.330> it

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
that's why whenever you see a droplet it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.390 
that's why whenever you see a droplet it
usually<00:02:34.110> evaporates<00:02:34.680> from<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.890> outside

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
usually evaporates from the outside

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.720 
usually evaporates from the outside
inside<00:02:35.879> or<00:02:36.269> outside<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.440> center<00:02:37.700> anyways

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
inside or outside to the center anyways

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.699 
inside or outside to the center anyways
thus<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.390> kinetic<00:02:39.660> energy<00:02:40.140> at<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.349> exterior

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
thus the kinetic energy at the exterior

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.979 
thus the kinetic energy at the exterior
is<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.040> lot<00:02:41.190> higher<00:02:41.400> than<00:02:41.640> interior<00:02:42.330> that's<00:02:42.780> why

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
is a lot higher than interior that's why

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.410 
is a lot higher than interior that's why
you<00:02:43.050> see<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.680> evaporation<00:02:44.489> process<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:45.150> way

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
you see the evaporation process that way

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.540 
you see the evaporation process that way
well<00:02:46.080> not<00:02:46.260> necessarily<00:02:46.379> you<00:02:46.980> really<00:02:47.250> see<00:02:47.400> the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
well not necessarily you really see the

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.309 
well not necessarily you really see the
evaporation<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.269> gas<00:02:48.450> molecules<00:02:48.660> but<00:02:49.170> you

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
evaporation of the gas molecules but you

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.509 
evaporation of the gas molecules but you
know<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.680> know<00:02:49.830> what<00:02:50.010> I'm<00:02:50.129> doing<00:02:50.400> right

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
know and you know what I'm doing right

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.000 
know and you know what I'm doing right
yeah<00:02:50.700> that's<00:02:50.730> yeah<00:02:51.180> anyways<00:02:51.590> anyways<00:02:52.590> it's

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
yeah that's yeah anyways anyways it's

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.550 
yeah that's yeah anyways anyways it's
really<00:02:53.220> hot<00:02:53.430> today<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.970> elli<00:02:54.959> weather<00:02:55.319> is

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
really hot today and elli weather is

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.009 
really hot today and elli weather is
really<00:02:56.010> bad<00:02:56.220> in<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.700> summer<00:02:57.090> cuz<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.720> know<00:02:57.780> my

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
really bad in the summer cuz you know my
