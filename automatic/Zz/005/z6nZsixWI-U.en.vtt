00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:14.940
 hello all by yourself host alexander 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.670
 leading man here and now almost 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.480
 one o'clock am going to sleep but before bed 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.410
 I wanted to skunk anansie brick about life 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.810
 In America, it probably will be a story about 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.720
 one of the downsides of life in the United States I analyzed 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.660
 just got my mail and i just got it 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.550
 how much but I and have long known this no 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.440
 annoying for a long time but I think that 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.020
 need to share 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.290
 how much does any advertising hate me 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.890
 who send by mail with postal 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.670
 box and send paper advertising 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.579
 so I do not really understand how you can 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.000
 propagate rice aikman permanent 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.180
 says you need to save the trees there 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.190
 greenpeace coasters from recycled 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.530
 paper and so on and so forth when 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.479
 you every day 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.600
 dump tons of waste paper in the mail 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.780
 that you have to Naham and it is not 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.030
 just like paper is still with all sorts 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.220
 plastic folds there 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.130
 with all the other stuff that they are so 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.420
 easily recycled i.e. it is 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.000
 Well here's absurd how I would probably 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.549
 I will include two points in this letter because 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.950
 that there is no another letter 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.170
 which well send them to me monthly 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.960
 this is one of the spam options 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.939
 well it's not such a bad option i 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.869
 once upon a time went vegas if you 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:47.850
 come in in my video probably somehow 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:50.220
 here yes and scroll down download 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.640
 more there are such thrash his videos but we 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.670
 there drank a lot played in the casino and 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.469
 occupied with any nonsense I will shorten one 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.200
 shorter rested with de you there with dima 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.460
 gray product heights from these videos which 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.259
 about vegas here since you are such an america 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.959
 not seen and then it's all so 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.540
 Vegas I pulled well, about two and a 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.480
 half thousand 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.530
 three days well, it was enough 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.180
 a large amount of money and at first I was 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.510
 2 and a half point address for the period 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.790
 3 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:30.280
 at first I was in the plus one and a half food later 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.330
 somehow quickly lost everything she wanted 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.820
 the grace is still a minus here captive and let down 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.770
 so here it is one of the examples of spam 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.530
 this is not now constantly sending out 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:48.900
 vegas from the hotel where we stayed 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.900
 cosmopolitan send every month 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.970
 I do not know special offers on 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.680
 $ 100 free dinner 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.800
 free game and 575 dollars 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.630
 offer free on game 3 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.700
 free nights at the hotel 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.590
 every month after we lost 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.930
 they start they caused me myself 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.730
 and I gave them my address nuendo 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.530
 when checking in but it was on my old 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.100
 address they have to send a new ie 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:22.450
 I do not know how they do it further 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.790
 after that from spam which is in something 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.160
 may be useful this is different such 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.790
 every kind of crazy spam we can 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.950
 lower your of the lawn how much 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.290
 you pay for the car essentially they want 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.030
 just to make you refinance 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.860
 melted for them is not the fact that this 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.110
 will be lower they do not even know about me 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.780
 car if you know I do not know how much on it 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.550
 left 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.709
 complete nonsense have this paper pick it up 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.810
 it 's not even nauseous air is taken on 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.140
 it's all cut down trees don't know or there 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.880
 rice forged but one hell is superfluous 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.430
 electricity costs to this 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.920
 do then some come and not 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.010
 know how newspapers 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.680
 also comes advertising there from past 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.650
 some of these comments that are already 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.780
 long gone in six years that's how much 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.570
 there is probably so much garbage 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.220
 began to come and sometimes by soils and on 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.959
 mail is just lazy to parse 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.610
 week let's say I did not understand by me 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.440
 Here is such a pile of folded begin 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:25.040
 through these papers to rustle and what of them 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.070
 valuable that is not valuable that is also some sort 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:32.000
 advertising then scho like some there 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.620

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.130

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.230
 I don't know there 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.200
 these cyclists don't know where 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:45.290
 gone, that is , a journal has been sent to my name 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.920
 Well, as if I did not subscribe, I already 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.570
 came in 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.460
 I had even more was even more 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.670
 it was even worse 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.840
 but I did this opt out was a little bit 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:58.500
 better but still no matter how much 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.120
 so 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.480
 just decided to share with you and 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.880
 be prepared that you will just have 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.160
 I’m not flooded with paper here 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.650
 I know how to deal with it and 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.040
 that is, those methods that they are not wrong 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:18.340
 work well as they should so here 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.080
 before Greenpeace must be unhappy and 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.740
 In general, any normal person is not 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:26.590
 must sit and 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:29.530
 rake for three hours all sorts of spam to 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:33.400
 find one letter there which he is waiting 

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:35.590
 some document important yes such matters in 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.930
 Generally who lives in America write below 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.540
 comments like you have with this case if 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:43.600
 you managed to get rid who lives in 

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:46.450
 Russia I do not know and maybe in Russia now 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:49.389
 Already in the CIS countries or in general I wait 

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:51.550

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:54.520
