it was going on everybody right now I'm
starting<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.230> motion<00:00:04.589> sensor<00:00:04.830> um<00:00:06.020> right<00:00:07.020> here

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
starting a motion sensor um right here

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.680 
starting a motion sensor um right here
is<00:00:09.240> my<00:00:09.570> little<00:00:10.790> trigger<00:00:11.790> sensor<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.360> case<00:00:12.509> they

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
is my little trigger sensor in case they

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.499 
is my little trigger sensor in case they
hit<00:00:12.840> my<00:00:12.990> truck<00:00:13.259> or<00:00:13.440> something<00:00:13.620> but<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.509> decided

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.480 
hit my truck or something but I decided
to<00:00:15.690> go<00:00:15.929> with<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.230> motion<00:00:16.410> sensor<00:00:16.949> in<00:00:17.070> case<00:00:17.279> to

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
to go with the motion sensor in case to

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.170 
to go with the motion sensor in case to
get<00:00:17.670> inside<00:00:18.330> within<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:19.070> 2<00:00:20.070> feet<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.699> know<00:00:20.880> I

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
get inside within a 2 feet you know I

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.300 
get inside within a 2 feet you know I
don't<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.930> don't<00:00:22.170> want<00:00:22.410> them<00:00:22.529> touching<00:00:22.949> or

just<00:00:29.670> tapped<00:00:29.939> into<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.359> sensors<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
just tapped into the sensors to the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.030 
just tapped into the sensors to the
motions<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.610> vibrating<00:00:33.180> sensors<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.260> I'm

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
motions to the vibrating sensors and I'm

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.670 
motions to the vibrating sensors and I'm
going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.610> install<00:00:38.000> one<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.120> these<00:00:39.379> this<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.440> a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
going to install one of these this is a

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.580 
going to install one of these this is a
motion<00:00:41.579> sensor<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:42.090> right<00:00:42.270> here<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:43.290> put<00:00:43.500> it

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
motion sensor this right here you put it

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.580 
motion sensor this right here you put it
like<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.980> middle<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:46.020> middle<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.440> your

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
is I just had like I said I tapped into

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.070 
is I just had like I said I tapped into
these<00:01:04.850> two<00:01:05.850> these<00:01:06.000> sensors<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.540> my<00:01:06.659> alarm<00:01:06.930> is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
these two these sensors and my alarm is

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.570 
these two these sensors and my alarm is
the<00:01:07.229> auto<00:01:07.380> page<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.549> any

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the auto page and you can do this to any

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.440 
the auto page and you can do this to any
alarm<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.150> want<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.659> then<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.409> did<00:01:10.650> this

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
alarm you want and then I did this

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.990 
alarm you want and then I did this
see<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:13.040> color<00:01:14.040> coded<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.580> mean<00:01:14.760> if<00:01:14.909> you

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
see it's just color coded I mean if you

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.460 
see it's just color coded I mean if you
don't<00:01:15.090> know<00:01:15.210> how<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.390> if<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.869> can't<00:01:16.110> do<00:01:16.290> this

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
don't know how to if you can't do this

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.219 
don't know how to if you can't do this
and<00:01:16.770> you're<00:01:17.030> pretty<00:01:18.030> much<00:01:18.150> retarded<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:19.110> you

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
and you're pretty much retarded have you

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.270 
and you're pretty much retarded have you
asked<00:01:19.470> me<00:01:19.619> um<00:01:19.880> but<00:01:20.880> yeah<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.390> example

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
asked me um but yeah like for example

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.460 
asked me um but yeah like for example
blue<00:01:23.280> goes<00:01:23.610> with<00:01:23.640> blue<00:01:24.229> black<00:01:25.229> goes<00:01:25.439> with

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
blue goes with blue black goes with

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.219 
blue goes with blue black goes with
black<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.700> um<00:01:26.880> also<00:01:27.840> what<00:01:28.200> I

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
black and so on and um also what I

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.789 
black and so on and um also what I
decided<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:29.659> was<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> little<00:01:31.079> toggle

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
decided to get was a little toggle

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.719 
decided to get was a little toggle
switch<00:01:32.009> right<00:01:32.460> here<00:01:33.920> this<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.250> got<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.579> because

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
switch right here this I got it because

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.569 
switch right here this I got it because
I'm<00:01:36.439> like<00:01:37.439> when<00:01:37.619> I'm<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:37.860> car<00:01:38.130> shows<00:01:38.400> or

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
I'm like when I'm at car shows or

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.929 
I'm like when I'm at car shows or
something<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:39.060> don't<00:01:39.119> want<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.630> uh<00:01:40.790> you<00:01:41.790> know

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
something I don't want to be uh you know

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.550 
something I don't want to be uh you know
I<00:01:41.970> don't<00:01:42.240> want<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.420> be<00:01:42.570> for<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.320> be<00:01:43.439> going

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
I don't want to be for it to be going

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.520 
I don't want to be for it to be going
off<00:01:43.860> every<00:01:44.250> second<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.229> decided<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.350> put

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
off every second so I decided to put

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.370 
off every second so I decided to put
that<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.829> there<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.159> for<00:01:47.340> convenience<00:01:47.520> um

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
that on there just for convenience um

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.499 
that on there just for convenience um
right<00:01:49.380> now<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> garage<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.390> can

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
right now I have a garage but as you can

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.350 
right now I have a garage but as you can
see<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.869> not<00:01:52.020> even<00:01:52.170> finished<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.360> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
see it's not even finished it and the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.179 
see it's not even finished it and the
thing<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.689> hate<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.869> most<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.530> when<00:01:55.710> cats<00:01:55.979> get

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
thing I hate the most is when cats get

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.160 
thing I hate the most is when cats get
near<00:01:56.399> my<00:01:56.520> car<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.060> they<00:01:57.630> end<00:01:57.810> up<00:01:57.899> scratching

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
near my car and they end up scratching

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.830 
near my car and they end up scratching
it<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:59.579> will<00:01:59.820> stop<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.090> from<00:02:00.270> doing<00:02:00.540> but

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
it so this will stop it from doing but

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.550 
it so this will stop it from doing but
um<00:02:01.040> if<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.189> have<00:02:02.310> any<00:02:02.460> questions<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.030> uh<00:02:03.560> hit
