performance<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.580> think<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> really

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
performance I think this is a really

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.330 
performance I think this is a really
great<00:00:22.109> card<00:00:22.560> trick<00:00:22.769> it's<00:00:22.949> got<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> lot<00:00:23.310> of

great card trick it's got a lot of

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.790 
great card trick it's got a lot of
people<00:00:23.609> fooled<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.720> hopefully<00:00:25.650> you've

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
people fooled so hopefully you've

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.250 
people fooled so hopefully you've
watched<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.310> performance<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.150> here<00:00:27.990> we<00:00:28.080> go

this<00:00:28.859> trick<00:00:29.189> uses<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.150> Gilbreth<00:00:30.720> principle

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
this trick uses the Gilbreth principle

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.260 
this trick uses the Gilbreth principle
which<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> mathematical<00:00:32.369> principle<00:00:32.820> if<00:00:33.030> you

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
which is a mathematical principle if you

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.030 
which is a mathematical principle if you
do<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> youtube<00:00:34.020> search<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.590> Gilbreth

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
do a youtube search on Gilbreth

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.639 
do a youtube search on Gilbreth
principle<00:00:35.640> you'll<00:00:36.090> see<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.480> I've<00:00:36.630> done<00:00:36.660> five

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
principle you'll see that I've done five

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.250 
principle you'll see that I've done five
videos<00:00:38.129> using<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.760> principle

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
videos using this principle

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.840 
videos using this principle
schwarzenegger<00:00:40.260> magic<00:00:40.680> also<00:00:40.890> has<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> couple

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
schwarzenegger magic also has a couple

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.310 
schwarzenegger magic also has a couple
of<00:00:41.940> videos<00:00:42.210> where<00:00:42.480> he's<00:00:42.690> applied<00:00:43.079> this

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
of videos where he's applied this

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.950 
of videos where he's applied this
principle<00:00:43.550> so<00:00:44.550> what<00:00:45.239> you're<00:00:45.390> going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.660> use

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
principle so what you're going to use

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.619 
principle so what you're going to use
for<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.469> trick<00:00:46.739> regular<00:00:47.610> deck<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.940> cards<00:00:48.390> and

cards you can feel that so if you're

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.039 
cards you can feel that so if you're
using<00:01:29.070> cards<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.759> have<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> border<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.869> like

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
using cards that have a border just like

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.109 
using cards that have a border just like
the<00:01:31.170> bicycle<00:01:31.560> cards<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.549> actually<00:01:32.700> push

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the bicycle cards you can actually push

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.590 
the bicycle cards you can actually push
off<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.720> show<00:01:34.680> most<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> cards<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.479> can

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
off and show most of the cards you can

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.030 
off and show most of the cards you can
tell<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> spectator<00:01:37.049> okay<00:01:37.680> what<00:01:37.829> I'm<00:01:37.920> going

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
tell the spectator okay what I'm going

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.010 
tell the spectator okay what I'm going
to<00:01:38.070> do<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.729> don't<00:01:38.939> say<00:01:39.119> I've<00:01:39.270> got<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> whole

deck of cards that are facedown just

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.069 
deck of cards that are facedown just
spread<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> cards<00:01:42.450> out<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.840> looks<00:01:43.020> like

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079

spread the cards out it looks like
you've<00:01:43.320> got<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> normal<00:01:43.860> deck<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.280> you're

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
you've got a normal deck and you're

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.399 
you've got a normal deck and you're
hiding<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> bottom<00:01:45.540> twelve<00:01:45.869> cards<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.320> the

you<00:01:49.079> close<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.560> cards<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.430> don't<00:01:50.610> flash

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
you close the cards that you don't flash

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.440 
you close the cards that you don't flash
so<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:52.020> do<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> nice<00:01:52.380> tight<00:01:52.710> close<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.490> now

so just do a nice tight close and now

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.550 
so just do a nice tight close and now
you're<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.750> tell<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.020> spectator<00:01:55.500> to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
you're going to tell the spectator to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.679 
you're going to tell the spectator to

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
cards down on the table because they

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.459 
cards down on the table because they
could<00:01:59.369> push<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.759> top<00:01:59.939> card<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.479> flash<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.310 
could push the top card and flash the
cards<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.490> when<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:03.090> them<00:02:03.299> set<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.540> ask

them to cut the cards you want to hold

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.730 
them to cut the cards you want to hold
the<00:02:06.270> cards<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.780> your<00:02:06.810> hand<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.229> say<00:02:07.380> cut<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
cards in half they'll take about half

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.490 
cards in half they'll take about half
the<00:02:09.720> cards<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.430> then<00:02:11.599> you<00:02:12.599> flip<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.170> bottom

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the cards and then you flip the bottom

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.500 
the cards and then you flip the bottom
/<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:14.370> now<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.550> bottom<00:02:14.790> cards<00:02:15.210> are<00:02:15.300> face<00:02:15.450> up

/ so now the bottom cards are face up
top<00:02:16.440> cards<00:02:16.770> are<00:02:16.890> face<00:02:17.040> down<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.610> what<00:02:18.270> you

top cards are face down and what you
have<00:02:18.570> here<00:02:18.840> now<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.710> 24<00:02:20.430> card<00:02:20.730> stack<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.720> the
