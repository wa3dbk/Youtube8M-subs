scale<00:03:28.840> I'd<00:03:29.530> be<00:03:29.829> a<00:03:29.859> pound<00:03:30.160> lighter

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
scale I'd be a pound lighter

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.000 
scale I'd be a pound lighter
I<00:03:30.940> just<00:03:31.629> ate<00:03:31.840> like<00:03:31.989> 12<00:03:32.319> pounds<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.680> food<00:03:32.859> the

I just ate like 12 pounds of food the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.439 
I just ate like 12 pounds of food the
day<00:03:33.129> before<00:03:33.280> how<00:03:33.579> can<00:03:33.760> I<00:03:33.819> be<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:33.970> pound<00:03:34.209> lighter

day before how can I be a pound lighter

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.319 
day before how can I be a pound lighter
because<00:03:35.169> my<00:03:35.349> metabolism<00:03:35.709> speed<00:03:36.400> up<00:03:36.579> to<00:03:37.209> the

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
because my metabolism speed up to the

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.699 
because my metabolism speed up to the
point<00:03:37.569> where<00:03:37.750> I<00:03:37.780> thought<00:03:38.049> that<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.440> had<00:03:38.470> all

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
point where I thought that it had all

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.080 
point where I thought that it had all
this<00:03:38.799> calories<00:03:39.220> coming<00:03:39.400> in<00:03:39.519> had<00:03:39.639> to<00:03:39.730> be<00:03:39.819> burned

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
this calories coming in had to be burned

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.180 
this calories coming in had to be burned
and<00:03:40.870> when<00:03:40.959> you<00:03:41.049> dropped<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.650> carobs<00:03:42.010> and

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
and when you dropped the carobs and

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.720 
and when you dropped the carobs and
calories<00:03:42.609> back<00:03:42.819> down<00:03:43.169> it<00:03:44.169> kept<00:03:44.620> going<00:03:44.859> know

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
calories back down it kept going know

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.610 
calories back down it kept going know
eventually<00:03:45.970> it's<00:03:46.209> gonna<00:03:46.329> slow<00:03:46.599> down<00:03:46.629> but<00:03:47.500> by

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
eventually it's gonna slow down but by

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.409 
eventually it's gonna slow down but by
the<00:03:47.680> time<00:03:47.889> it<00:03:47.949> slows<00:03:48.250> down<00:03:48.489> it's<00:03:48.819> time<00:03:49.150> for

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
the time it slows down it's time for

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.990 
the time it slows down it's time for
that<00:03:49.569> refeed<00:03:49.989> deal<00:03:50.169> again<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:51.250> was<00:03:51.370> just<00:03:51.400> one

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
that refeed deal again that was just one

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.059 
that refeed deal again that was just one
way<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.299> I<00:03:52.359> used<00:03:52.599> in<00:03:52.780> it's<00:03:53.530> been<00:03:53.709> turned<00:03:53.889> many

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
way that I used in it's been turned many

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.319 
way that I used in it's been turned many
different<00:03:54.459> things<00:03:54.549> I<00:03:54.790> call<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.000> metabolic

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
different things I call a metabolic

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.960 
different things I call a metabolic
momentum<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.470> where<00:03:56.650> it's<00:03:57.280> almost<00:03:57.430> like<00:03:57.760> you

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
momentum to where it's almost like you

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.819 
momentum to where it's almost like you

can push on the gas in your car and you
take<00:03:59.859> off<00:04:00.280> when<00:04:00.849> you<00:04:00.909> take<00:04:01.060> your<00:04:01.180> foot<00:04:01.299> off<00:04:01.419> you

take off when you take your foot off you
still<00:04:01.840> continue<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:02.980> coast<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.340> little<00:04:03.549> bit

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
still continue to coast a little bit

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:04.890 
still continue to coast a little bit
till<00:04:03.819> you<00:04:03.879> start<00:04:04.090> to<00:04:04.150> slow<00:04:04.299> down<00:04:04.480> and<00:04:04.659> you<00:04:04.750> hit

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
till you start to slow down and you hit

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.039 
till you start to slow down and you hit
the<00:04:05.019> gas<00:04:05.139> again<00:04:05.970> speed<00:04:06.970> up<00:04:07.120> take<00:04:07.780> your<00:04:07.900> foot

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
the gas again speed up take your foot

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.839 
the gas again speed up take your foot
off<00:04:08.139> coast<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:08.980> that's<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.400> way<00:04:09.519> it<00:04:09.639> worked

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
off coast and that's the way it worked

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.479 
off coast and that's the way it worked
and<00:04:10.239> it<00:04:11.049> worked<00:04:11.199> really<00:04:11.440> well<00:04:11.560> you<00:04:12.040> know<00:04:12.159> I<00:04:12.190> got

cheated on my diet

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.170 
cheated on my diet
never<00:04:26.949> ate<00:04:27.099> anything<00:04:27.370> that<00:04:27.610> wasn't<00:04:27.759> planned

never ate anything that wasn't planned

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.770 
never ate anything that wasn't planned
on<00:04:28.419> it<00:04:28.599> and<00:04:28.840> I<00:04:29.759> put<00:04:30.759> these<00:04:30.909> refeeds<00:04:31.360> in<00:04:31.509> about

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
on it and I put these refeeds in about

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.230 
on it and I put these refeeds in about
four<00:04:32.110> weeks<00:04:32.139> into<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:32.979> diet<00:04:33.189> worked<00:04:34.000> like<00:04:34.150> a

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
four weeks into the diet worked like a

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.589 
four weeks into the diet worked like a
charm

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
charm

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.779 
charm
so<00:04:35.530> let<00:04:35.650> that<00:04:35.740> be<00:04:35.860> a<00:04:35.889> lesson<00:04:35.949> to<00:04:36.310> that<00:04:36.340> they<00:04:36.580> are

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
so let that be a lesson to that they are

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.869 
so let that be a lesson to that they are
a<00:04:37.120> very<00:04:37.629> good<00:04:37.870> tool<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.139> be<00:04:38.439> used<00:04:38.740> but<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:39.580> have

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:39.879 
a very good tool to be used but you have

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.369 
a very good tool to be used but you have
to<00:04:40.060> know<00:04:40.150> how<00:04:40.300> to<00:04:40.330> use<00:04:40.659> them<00:04:40.810> if<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:41.020> use<00:04:41.199> them

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
to know how to use them if you use them

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:43.170 
to know how to use them if you use them
wrong<00:04:41.590> it's<00:04:42.099> going<00:04:42.280> to<00:04:42.340> slow<00:04:42.580> your<00:04:42.699> progress

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
wrong it's going to slow your progress

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.879 
wrong it's going to slow your progress
and<00:04:43.419> it's<00:04:43.569> going<00:04:43.659> to<00:04:43.719> make<00:04:44.050> you<00:04:44.199> gain<00:04:44.530> fat

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
and it's going to make you gain fat

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.339 
and it's going to make you gain fat
instead<00:04:45.189> of<00:04:45.370> speeding<00:04:45.699> up<00:04:45.879> your<00:04:45.939> metabolism

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
instead of speeding up your metabolism

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.779 
instead of speeding up your metabolism
so<00:04:47.349> hopefully<00:04:47.740> you've<00:04:47.949> if<00:04:48.460> you're<00:04:48.610> working

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
so hopefully you've if you're working

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:49.890 
so hopefully you've if you're working
with<00:04:48.909> a<00:04:49.000> trainer<00:04:49.240> or<00:04:49.479> a<00:04:49.509> coach<00:04:49.659> or

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
with a trainer or a coach or

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.450 
with a trainer or a coach or
nutritionist<00:04:50.439> etc<00:04:50.860> or<00:04:50.949> whatever<00:04:51.159> you<00:04:51.250> want<00:04:51.400> to

nutritionist etc or whatever you want to

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.520 
nutritionist etc or whatever you want to
call<00:04:51.610> them<00:04:51.669> a<00:04:51.759> guru<00:04:51.969> then<00:04:52.780> they<00:04:52.960> understand

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
call them a guru then they understand

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.719 
call them a guru then they understand
this<00:04:53.650> concept<00:04:53.889> and<00:04:54.250> they're<00:04:54.400> not<00:04:54.550> just

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
this concept and they're not just
