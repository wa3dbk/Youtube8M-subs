 you will realize by placing the 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:52.990
 mouse over the images to add a 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.550
 image you just have to drag 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:00.580

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.079
 shot in English here so you have the 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.480
 time that will last your image is here 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:31.120
 the time that will last the animation is

 apart from this animation which is 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.640
 specific to the globe you have other 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.380
 animations common to all images 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.239
