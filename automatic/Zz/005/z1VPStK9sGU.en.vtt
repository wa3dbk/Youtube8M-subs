00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.030 

he<00:01:38.330> built<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.690> Summer<00:01:38.930> Palace<00:01:38.990> but<00:01:39.680> this

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
he built the Summer Palace but this

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.730 
he built the Summer Palace but this
being<00:01:40.280> Norway<00:01:40.760> it<00:01:41.330> can<00:01:41.510> only<00:01:41.600> be<00:01:41.810> used<00:01:41.840> one<00:01:42.470> day

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
being Norway it can only be used one day

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.680 
being Norway it can only be used one day
every<00:01:43.070> year<00:01:43.100> all<00:01:44.000> right<00:01:44.119> so<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.300> guess<00:01:44.420> this<00:01:44.540> is
