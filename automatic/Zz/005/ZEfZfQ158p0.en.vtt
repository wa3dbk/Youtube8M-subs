00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
straight into some of these stats the

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.150 
straight into some of these stats the

KSG is actually unlocked at level 34 so

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.890 
KSG is actually unlocked at level 34 so
it<00:00:40.309> takes<00:00:40.489> a<00:00:40.610> little<00:00:40.730> bit<00:00:40.910> to<00:00:41.030> unlock<00:00:41.300> it<00:00:41.330> but

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
it takes a little bit to unlock it but

that<00:00:50.570> apart<00:00:50.840> from<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.080> fact<00:00:51.110> that<00:00:51.379> it<00:00:51.530> does

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
that apart from the fact that it does

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.350 
that apart from the fact that it does
take<00:00:51.980> a<00:00:52.010> lot<00:00:52.220> longer<00:00:52.430> to<00:00:52.610> reload<00:00:52.970> than<00:00:53.210> the

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
take a lot longer to reload than the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.189 
take a lot longer to reload than the
other<00:00:53.860> semiautomatic<00:00:54.860> shotguns<00:00:55.489> it<00:00:56.199> actually

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
other semiautomatic shotguns it actually

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:58.780 
other semiautomatic shotguns it actually
does<00:00:57.379> a<00:00:57.410> lot<00:00:57.650> more<00:00:57.860> damage<00:00:58.129> because<00:00:58.610> of<00:00:58.730> the

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
does a lot more damage because of the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.090 
does a lot more damage because of the
fact<00:00:59.000> that<00:00:59.149> it<00:00:59.420> is<00:00:59.450> a<00:00:59.809> pump-action<00:01:00.320> shotgun

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.799 
fact that it is a pump-action shotgun
now<00:01:01.700> even<00:01:02.059> though<00:01:02.149> it<00:01:02.270> is<00:01:02.360> a<00:01:02.390> pump-action

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
now even though it is a pump-action

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.900 
now even though it is a pump-action
shotgun<00:01:03.500> it<00:01:03.649> doesn't<00:01:03.950> use<00:01:04.100> regular<00:01:04.610> buckshot

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
shotgun it doesn't use regular buckshot

shotgun it doesn't use regular buckshot
you<00:01:05.840> know<00:01:05.960> as<00:01:06.140> an<00:01:06.320> ammo<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:06.950> stuff<00:01:07.160> like<00:01:07.280> that

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
you know as an ammo and stuff like that

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.120 
you know as an ammo and stuff like that
it<00:01:07.850> actually<00:01:08.030> uses<00:01:08.360> a<00:01:08.750> slug<00:01:09.200> rounds<00:01:09.500> which<00:01:09.920> are

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
it actually uses a slug rounds which are

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.999 
it actually uses a slug rounds which are
basically<00:01:10.940> kind<00:01:11.600> of<00:01:11.750> like<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.050> huge<00:01:12.560> huge

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
basically kind of like a huge huge

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.770 
basically kind of like a huge huge
bullet<00:01:13.399> sort<00:01:13.850> of<00:01:13.940> about<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.180> size<00:01:14.509> of<00:01:14.660> a

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
bullet sort of about the size of a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.320 
bullet sort of about the size of a
baseball<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.830> so<00:01:16.340> if<00:01:16.580> that<00:01:16.610> thing<00:01:17.000> hits<00:01:17.149> you

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
baseball and so if that thing hits you

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.690 
baseball and so if that thing hits you
you're<00:01:17.450> pretty<00:01:17.600> much<00:01:17.720> dead<00:01:18.220> but<00:01:19.220> even<00:01:19.550> though

because<00:01:50.630> of<00:01:50.899> its<00:01:51.080> head<00:01:51.349> multiplier<00:01:51.890> which<00:01:52.099> is

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
because of its head multiplier which is

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.059 
because of its head multiplier which is
actually<00:01:52.399> 1.5<00:01:53.360> it's<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:53.690> only<00:01:54.110> shotgun<00:01:54.649> that

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
actually 1.5 it's the only shotgun that

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:56.859 
actually 1.5 it's the only shotgun that
actually<00:01:55.550> gets<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.849> head<00:01:56.060> multiplier<00:01:56.539> all<00:01:56.750> the

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
actually gets a head multiplier all the

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.400 
actually gets a head multiplier all the
other<00:01:56.989> shotguns<00:01:57.289> do<00:01:57.619> not<00:01:58.690> so<00:01:59.690> you<00:01:59.750> know<00:02:00.200> even

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
other shotguns do not so you know even

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.469 
other shotguns do not so you know even
at<00:02:00.649> its<00:02:00.800> max<00:02:01.069> range<00:02:01.340> this<00:02:01.610> is<00:02:01.759> actually<00:02:02.270> pretty

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
at its max range this is actually pretty

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.969 
at its max range this is actually pretty
insane<00:02:02.899> this<00:02:03.440> gun<00:02:03.709> has<00:02:03.739> a<00:02:04.030> 103<00:02:05.030> foot<00:02:05.979> range

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
insane this gun has a 103 foot range

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.969 
insane this gun has a 103 foot range
hoods<00:02:07.729> actually<00:02:08.270> double<00:02:08.810> almost<00:02:09.410> double<00:02:09.830> of

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
hoods actually double almost double of

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.040 
hoods actually double almost double of
what<00:02:10.280> all<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.880> other<00:02:10.910> shotguns<00:02:11.390> have<00:02:11.840> which

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
what all the other shotguns have which

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.050 
what all the other shotguns have which
is<00:02:12.200> pretty<00:02:12.410> insane<00:02:12.620> even<00:02:13.610> though<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:13.760> does

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
is pretty insane even though it does

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.000 
is pretty insane even though it does
have<00:02:14.270> this<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.720> know<00:02:14.840> pretty<00:02:15.170> long<00:02:15.470> range<00:02:15.770> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
have this you know pretty long range the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.920 
have this you know pretty long range the
aim<00:02:16.160> down<00:02:16.370> sight<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:17.120> know<00:02:17.239> accuracy<00:02:17.810> it's

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
aim down sight you know accuracy it's

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.809 
aim down sight you know accuracy it's
pretty<00:02:18.200> weird<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.370> going<00:02:19.520> to<00:02:19.580> see<00:02:19.670> in<00:02:19.760> a

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
pretty weird is it going to see in a

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.610 
pretty weird is it going to see in a
clip<00:02:20.030> right<00:02:20.209> now<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.420> was<00:02:20.690> shooting<00:02:21.140> from<00:02:21.560> a

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
clip right now I was shooting from a

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.160 
clip right now I was shooting from a
pretty<00:02:21.980> pretty<00:02:22.370> far<00:02:22.610> distance<00:02:22.849> and<00:02:23.330> as<00:02:24.050> you

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
pretty pretty far distance and as you

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.720 
pretty pretty far distance and as you
can<00:02:24.319> see<00:02:24.349> I<00:02:24.560> was<00:02:24.800> shooting<00:02:25.040> for<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.370> head<00:02:25.580> but

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
can see I was shooting for the head but

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.309 
can see I was shooting for the head but
I<00:02:25.760> did<00:02:26.000> not<00:02:26.150> hit<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.540> head<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:26.840> actually<00:02:27.170> took

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
I did not hit the head it actually took

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.290 
I did not hit the head it actually took
two<00:02:27.530> shots<00:02:27.800> because<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.730> bullet<00:02:28.910> kind<00:02:29.209> of

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
two shots because the bullet kind of

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.750 
two shots because the bullet kind of
strayed<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.840> little<00:02:30.140> bit<00:02:30.430> let's<00:02:31.430> take<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.640> look

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
strayed a little bit let's take a look

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.890 
strayed a little bit let's take a look
at<00:02:31.849> some<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.000> these<00:02:32.120> more<00:02:32.360> stats<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:33.050> has<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.650> 14

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
at some of these more stats it has a 14

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.390 
at some of these more stats it has a 14
starting<00:02:35.900> mo<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.470> then<00:02:36.560> if<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:36.770> put<00:02:36.950> extended

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
starting mo and then if you put extended

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.930 
starting mo and then if you put extended
clips<00:02:37.670> on<00:02:37.820> this<00:02:37.970> thing<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.270> actually

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
clips on this thing it actually

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.600 
clips on this thing it actually
as<00:02:39.030> 20<00:02:39.450> clips<00:02:39.660> per<00:02:39.900> round<00:02:40.110> it's<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:41.070> second

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
as 20 clips per round it's the second

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.740 
as 20 clips per round it's the second
most<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:42.690> all<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.230> shotguns<00:02:43.800> actually<00:02:44.750> taking

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
most of all the shotguns actually taking

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.830 
most of all the shotguns actually taking
a<00:02:45.810> look<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.230> rate<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.710> fire<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.250> actually<00:02:47.970> 75

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
a look the rate of fire is actually 75

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.510 
a look the rate of fire is actually 75
rounds<00:02:49.140> per<00:02:49.500> minute<00:02:49.650> which<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:50.040> actually<00:02:50.190> the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
rounds per minute which is actually the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.730 
rounds per minute which is actually the
slowest<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.090> all<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.360> shotguns<00:02:51.870> again

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
slowest of all the shotguns again

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.710 
slowest of all the shotguns again
because<00:02:53.070> it<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.340> pump-action<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.300> on<00:02:54.450> a

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
because it is a pump-action and on a

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.930 
because it is a pump-action and on a
semi-auto<00:02:55.710> or<00:02:55.920> full<00:02:56.160> auto<00:02:56.400> like<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.790> other

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
semi-auto or full auto like the other

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.320 
semi-auto or full auto like the other
shotguns<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.690> actually<00:02:57.960> has<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.110> very<00:02:58.440> slow

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
shotguns that actually has a very slow

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.140 
shotguns that actually has a very slow
reload<00:03:00.330> time<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.460> taking<00:03:02.460> a<00:03:02.610> look<00:03:02.640> more<00:03:02.820> of

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
reload time and taking a look more of

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.420 
reload time and taking a look more of
these<00:03:03.300> guys<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:03.930> actually<00:03:04.410> has<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.620> very<00:03:05.130> low

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
these guys it actually has a very low

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.280 
these guys it actually has a very low
hip<00:03:05.670> spread<00:03:05.970> again<00:03:06.270> because<00:03:06.570> it<00:03:06.690> has<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.870> one

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
hip spread again because it has that one

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.710 
hip spread again because it has that one
kind<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.710> bullet<00:03:08.100> thing<00:03:08.280> going<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:09.510> one

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
kind of bullet thing going that one

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.500 
kind of bullet thing going that one
giant<00:03:10.280> bullet<00:03:11.280> or<00:03:11.430> metal<00:03:11.820> it<00:03:12.000> actually<00:03:12.360> has<00:03:12.480> a

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
giant bullet or metal it actually has a

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.180 
giant bullet or metal it actually has a
very<00:03:12.900> very<00:03:13.140> low<00:03:13.350> hip<00:03:13.530> spread<00:03:13.770> which<00:03:13.950> also

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
very very low hip spread which also

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.830 
very very low hip spread which also
means<00:03:14.490> that<00:03:14.640> if<00:03:14.790> you're<00:03:14.940> not<00:03:15.090> directly<00:03:15.480> on<00:03:15.690> the

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
means that if you're not directly on the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.020 
means that if you're not directly on the
target<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.740> will<00:03:16.860> actually<00:03:17.040> miss<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.850> target

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
target you will actually miss the target

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.120 
target you will actually miss the target
that's<00:03:18.930> all<00:03:19.080> you<00:03:19.170> have<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.410> be<00:03:19.500> directly<00:03:19.920> on

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
that's all you have to be directly on

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.280 
that's all you have to be directly on
the<00:03:20.250> first<00:03:20.460> of<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.700> kill<00:03:20.940> there<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.810> no<00:03:22.020> loss

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
the first of the kill there is no loss

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.170 
the first of the kill there is no loss
in<00:03:22.320> speed<00:03:22.860> while<00:03:23.040> running<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:23.580> it<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.820> one

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
in speed while running so it is one

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.030 
in speed while running so it is one
hundred<00:03:24.300> percent<00:03:24.510> speed<00:03:25.230> while<00:03:25.440> running<00:03:25.710> and

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
hundred percent speed while running and

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.120 
hundred percent speed while running and
the<00:03:26.760> knife<00:03:27.030> speed<00:03:27.360> is<00:03:27.510> one<00:03:27.780> point<00:03:28.080> 32<00:03:28.560> seconds

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
the knife speed is one point 32 seconds

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.650 
the knife speed is one point 32 seconds
which<00:03:29.160> is<00:03:29.250> actually<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.880> worst<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.360> all<00:03:30.510> the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
which is actually the worst of all the

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.210 
which is actually the worst of all the
shotguns<00:03:31.110> but<00:03:31.200> still<00:03:31.590> better<00:03:31.740> than<00:03:31.890> any

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
shotguns but still better than any

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.760

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
if you were to have to reload the whole

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.240 
if you were to have to reload the whole
thing<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.080> take<00:03:43.230> about<00:03:43.320> five<00:03:43.709> seconds<00:03:44.130> to

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
thing to take about five seconds to

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.250 
thing to take about five seconds to
reload<00:03:44.489> which<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.940> slowest<00:03:45.330> which<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:46.050> you

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
reload which is the slowest which is you

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.020 
reload which is the slowest which is you
know<00:03:46.290> more<00:03:46.739> advice<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.310> reload<00:03:47.640> after<00:03:47.880> every

know more advice to reload after every
couple<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.600> shots<00:03:48.870> because<00:03:49.050> it's<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.320> lot

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
couple of shots because it's a lot

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.900 
couple of shots because it's a lot
quicker<00:03:49.680> than<00:03:49.950> having<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.340> reload<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.760> whole

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
quicker than having to reload the whole

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.820 
quicker than having to reload the whole
