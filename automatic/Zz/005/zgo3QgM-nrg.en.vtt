00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.550
 I warmly welcome you to one 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.009
 new video from euro pc 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.609
 my name is niklas and now i show 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.560
 the samsung netbook 9 in the 2014 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.760
 edition a chic slim notebook 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.750
 of samsung predominantly of aluminum 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.099
 made since we were already at the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.439
 first touch here a very 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.619
 high quality impression also for one 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.170
 notebook very narrow the whole with 14.9 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.450
 mm thick and the whole comes on 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.450
 weight of just 1 78 kilograms 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.989
 Let 's first look at that 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.500
 delivery 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.629
 this is under macbook 9 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.100
 others just out of the charging cable along with 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.309
 adapter as you know it then 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.949
 Here's a quick guide and 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.870
 still here this lan adapter since the lan 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.760
 connection of the small rates is us 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.989
 will see soon 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.510
 Here we see the right one 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.590
 page with two usb 3.0 ports and 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.150
 a mini displayport on the other 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.590
 On the other hand, we have the one side 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.990
 connection on the far right then an audio 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.350
 jack a usb 2.0 connection a hdmi 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.090
 connection and connections 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.310
 Do you see the keyboard this is 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.049
 Of course you can backlit 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.479
 also here then the intensity of 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.640
 lighting in the first even later 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.450
 regulate and also adjust after 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.880
 how many more seconds she should go out 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.790
 on the back we see here once 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.950
 one of the two speakers here 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.240
 on the right side on the left 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.960
 is then accordingly 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.250
 the second speaker and here still 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.740
 not a micro but a 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.560
 sd-card slot we still come to 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.049
 technology would be an intel core i7 4500 with 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.250
 18 you're max 3 gigahertz clocks 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:05.490
 of these 8 gb DDR3 memory then 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.970
 still an intel hd graphics 2400 so 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.970
 the rumored on the cpu 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:17.240
 graphics chip and a 256 gb ssd 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.430
 Samsung installed book 9 1 15 6 inches tall 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.960
 is full hd led display 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.660
 I will do the different ones now 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.740
 brightness levels continuously from the 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.570
 highest I started now 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.610
 Gradually down so he once a 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.500
 impression gets like the brightness like that 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.030
 is of course filmed does not come 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.460
 quite as over as in real life though 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.070
 Nevertheless, it gives an impression 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.250
 like in about brightness 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.720
 stages are unfortunately not anti-reflective we 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.180
 probably could have seen well 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.270
 the display thus ever a small 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.260
 Manko as I always find, of course 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.209
 getting used to and where to work 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.560
 one works a lot out there is one with 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.990
 a reflective display of course 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.970
 not helped but if you have the laptop 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.130
 mainly used at home 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.200
 At the work table then does the whole 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.330
 of course, not so much out here just 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.810
 in the picture to see the 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.500
 Settings of the samsung 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.910
 software 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.620
 who gives me general system 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.690
 optimization possibilities we 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.580
 can approach we see ever 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.800
 in the rider to the right of it you can 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.800
 reset internet explorer settings 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.190
 then we have the possibility here 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.780
 to regulate backlight and the 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.440
 lines monster team silent mode too 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.420
 activate 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.950
 here is the eco mode to stream 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.830
 save as the example of the cpu 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.620
 performance pushed back then 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.850
 USB Charger Whether via the USB port devices 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.430
 want to charge even if the laptop 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.410
 for example, then here is the 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.720
 different wireless moly comes 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.000
 disable bluetooth we want and 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.310
 also here a mobile access point 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.570
 can still set up the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.660
 to adjust the screens a bit 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.100
 set different colors for example 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.989
 depending on whether there are cards watching movie 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.440
 we want to choose this movie mode 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.220
 then a bit warmer from the light is too 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.230
 at the sound yet 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.450
 Settings can the 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.610
 microphone or adjust the microphone 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.170
 also settings for the camera and 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.900
 want to have the microphone active or 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.730
 Disable to make sure that us 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.780
 not someone secretly spied on the 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.209
 computer is hacked 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.780
 I personally really like the 11.9 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.790
 very well 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.700
 especially the processing has me 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.190
 convinced and 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.980
 Choice of materials is very high quality 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.810
 and also the performance was convincing 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.540
 the manufacturer is really here again 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.639
 up to date and offers everything 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.530
 what you need to work fast 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.850
 only criticism of me 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.800
 The mirroring little stumbled 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.610
 display but that is also common 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.530
 a matter of taste 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.669
 if you liked the video then 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.040
 I would be a thumbs up 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.840
 look forward and subscribe to our youtube 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.660
 if not already done so 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.190
 you always get the latest updates 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.190
 Thanks for watching it makes good
