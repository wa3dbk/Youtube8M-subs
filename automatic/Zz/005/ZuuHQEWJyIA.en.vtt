00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.930
 good to all guys we will decide three 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.610
 before the third force back to 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.460
 time that did not go up so well today has 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.080
 decided to upload the tutorial of the spear 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.030
 gun because the uncharted video has 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.710
 there were recording problems and for 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.659
 now he was fucking me and we're stuck 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.060
 no play 3 for now next week 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:21.880
 it will look if we are going to teach you to 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.229
 handle this weapon a bit I sure not 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.359
 I doubted if we're going to stick with what 

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:27.810
 basic draws all life with 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.810
 triangles 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.630
 we keep the typical well - being of those who 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.710
 you can save more than you can 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.719
 can save with the re saved 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:46.070
 and well be very different from the spear 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:50.510
 there are things that change the basic combo 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.920
 triangle triangle and here they like the 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.920
 triple triangle 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.090
 this how you can kill yourself in another way 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.649
 what is triangle triangle doing 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.649
 triangle and circle 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.740
 but spend up sharpened is not 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.000
 pretty sharp after more things 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.770
 that is to say of all life we ​​can use 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.540
 somersault with this weapon to dodge 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.090
 for the sides 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.260
 we have to find the X and in the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.720
 direction and we move to the opposite side 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.200
 then here with the circle let's shoot 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.200
 the fire 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.710
 well here unlike the cold münive 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.049
 there were differences for example here if 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.100
 you set fire the fire if there 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.680
 given the circle we recharged 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.530
 automatically is to say that circulate 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.229
 you expect to shoot again but if those 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.939
 recharge circles jce you will follow is done 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.810
 it would be like an infinite circle combo 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.810
 recharge and now what 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.200
 after 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.700
 Laguardia with r 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.289
 while we are the guards we can 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.469
 r making triangle 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.469
 here we have implicit attacks 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.469
 practically 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.030
 well and what else and then the fire 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.340
 they return the classic 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.630
 we keep the r sometimes triangles of 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.380
 ass 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.380
 of a load 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.830
 we give a bestial blow 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.790
 that what you have then that from the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.240
 moment will participate or if you want to know 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:32.460
 for example 40 and 55 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.800
 because in the quantum 41 45 or 40 45 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.010
 it will turn off some souls recharge more 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.030
 fast others not this is depends on the use 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.860
 usually about what to recharge more 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.810
 fast some besides another green 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.810
 normally all the same are all 5 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.850
 if we keep the circle wound 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.850
 we recharged directly 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.549
 and well not long ago this weapon that 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.990
 to be able to say that he does not have much 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.570
 variety of attacks has the same 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.910
 his soul is easy to learn I mean what 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:08.260
 I would consider easy to learn it 's easy 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.770
 to learn I say this weapon is easy 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.960
 to learn its use 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.130
 handle it is something else not the same 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.010
 learn from the controls that they know 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.870
 to handle them is to be more good for all 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.480
 the monsters to all fire we owed 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.270
 discover I remember myself once in cold 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.510
 münive I heard more people let's put a 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.830
 rat 2 plated with a gun that does not 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.680
 those that were supposed to go with the 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.079
 wrong attribute 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.910
 we have been a while to the silvery good 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.590
 assumes that the weak point is thunder 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.880
 we got it racing so good 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.820
 guys I hope this tutorial already 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.280
 has served we have thus the following 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.720
 next we like which ones we're going 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.720
 to have all the weapons and this time we're going 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.250
 to more tutorials followed so very 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.230
 Good guys, I hope I served you 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.720
 Any questions on twitter here below
