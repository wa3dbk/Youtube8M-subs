00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:05.850

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:16.039 

and<00:01:06.400> going<00:01:06.580> into<00:01:06.790> a<00:01:06.910> dc9<00:01:09.060> Overby

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.109 

so<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.619> try<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.920> take<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> swing<00:01:17.609> of<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.850> play<00:01:18.060> it

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
so I try to take the swing of it play it

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.310 
so I try to take the swing of it play it
like<00:01:18.329> that<00:01:19.609> there's<00:01:20.609> really<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.789> deal<00:01:21.060> with<00:01:21.240> a

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
like that there's really a deal with a

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.200 
like that there's really a deal with a
see<00:01:22.320> sharpen<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.829> base<00:01:25.189> up<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.429> ET<00:01:26.700> here<00:01:26.969> which

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
see sharpen the base up to ET here which

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.209 
see sharpen the base up to ET here which
is<00:01:27.360> derived<00:01:27.689> from<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.990> name<00:01:28.200> here<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.740> this

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:29.219 
is derived from that name here and this

00:01:29.219 --> 00:02:59.589 
is derived from that name here and this
song<00:01:29.429> sounds<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:29.939> this

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.110
