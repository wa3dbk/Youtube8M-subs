00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.729 
was eight pounds and I thought that was
quite<00:00:42.510> reasonable<00:00:43.110> because<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.500> really

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
quite reasonable because it's really

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.970 
quite reasonable because it's really
good<00:00:43.890> material<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.300> pretty<00:00:45.829> and<00:00:46.829> I

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
good material it's really pretty and I

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.450

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.309 
then I got my bed cover and this cost 13
pounds<00:02:07.799> no<00:02:08.099> twelve<00:02:08.520> pounds

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
pounds no twelve pounds

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.300 
pounds no twelve pounds
and<00:02:11.319> this<00:02:11.829> is<00:02:11.980> what<00:02:12.099> it<00:02:12.189> looks<00:02:12.370> like<00:02:14.310> it's

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
and this is what it looks like it's

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.720 
and this is what it looks like it's
basically<00:02:16.030> these<00:02:16.840> flowers<00:02:17.469> so<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.340> thought<00:02:18.609> it

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
basically these flowers so I thought it

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.470 
basically these flowers so I thought it
would<00:02:18.790> match<00:02:19.000> really<00:02:19.359> pretty<00:02:19.599> with<00:02:20.019> all<00:02:20.049> of<00:02:20.530> my

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
would match really pretty with all of my

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.390 
would match really pretty with all of my
other<00:02:22.480> things<00:02:22.810> this<00:02:23.200> flu<00:02:23.590> I'm<00:02:23.769> not<00:02:23.950> really<00:02:24.159> too
