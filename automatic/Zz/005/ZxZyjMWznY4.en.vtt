phantom skin or anything like that goes

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.700 
phantom skin or anything like that goes
on<00:01:40.259> very<00:01:40.500> easily<00:01:40.729> even<00:01:41.729> though<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:43.259> screen

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
on very easily even though the screen

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.440 
on very easily even though the screen
protector<00:01:44.159> seems<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> same<00:01:44.970> material

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
protector seems to be the same material

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.910 
protector seems to be the same material
it<00:01:45.509> goes<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.810> lot<00:01:45.990> easier<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.409> don't<00:01:46.619> know<00:01:46.710> why

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
it goes on a lot easier I don't know why

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.850 
it goes on a lot easier I don't know why
maybe<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.340> was<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:48.049> practice<00:01:49.049> or<00:01:49.229> what<00:01:49.500> but

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
maybe it was just practice or what but
