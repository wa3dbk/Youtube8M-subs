this<00:00:48.350> thing<00:00:48.620> piece<00:00:48.860> by<00:00:49.100> piece<00:00:49.130> we're<00:00:49.970> gonna

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
this thing piece by piece we're gonna

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.210 
this thing piece by piece we're gonna
look<00:00:50.239> at<00:00:50.329> everything<00:00:50.630> but<00:00:51.140> first<00:00:51.410> some<00:00:51.950> of<00:00:51.980> the

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
look at everything but first some of the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.030 
look at everything but first some of the
casual<00:00:52.940> observations<00:00:53.660> no<00:00:54.200> Clarence<00:00:54.620> Thomas

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
casual observations no Clarence Thomas

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.720 
casual observations no Clarence Thomas
no<00:00:55.280> Samuel<00:00:55.730> Alito<00:00:56.180> no<00:00:56.960> Scalia<00:00:57.440> not<00:00:58.160> unusual

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
no Samuel Alito no Scalia not unusual

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.340 
no Samuel Alito no Scalia not unusual
right<00:00:58.910> no<00:00:59.060> time<00:00:59.270> for<00:00:59.510> all<00:00:59.660> of<00:00:59.840> the<00:00:59.930> justices

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
right no time for all of the justices

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.930 
right no time for all of the justices
not<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.680> be<00:01:00.829> there<00:01:00.980> but<00:01:01.040> I<00:01:01.160> think<00:01:01.370> Scalia<00:01:01.700> had

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
not to be there but I think Scalia had

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.580 
not to be there but I think Scalia had
like<00:01:02.090> another<00:01:02.360> speech<00:01:02.780> he<00:01:02.989> was<00:01:03.110> doing<00:01:03.410> for

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
like another speech he was doing for

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.859 
like another speech he was doing for
money<00:01:03.770> that<00:01:04.040> night<00:01:04.189> well<00:01:05.000> yeah<00:01:05.420> although<00:01:05.689> he

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
money that night well yeah although he

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.870 
money that night well yeah although he
probably<00:01:05.960> decided<00:01:06.619> not<00:01:06.770> to<00:01:06.979> go<00:01:07.159> to<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:07.670> state

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
probably decided not to go to the state

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.789 
probably decided not to go to the state
of<00:01:07.909> union<00:01:08.180> well<00:01:08.570> before<00:01:08.990> he<00:01:09.200> scheduled<00:01:09.649> that

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
of union well before he scheduled that

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.560 
of union well before he scheduled that
appearance<00:01:10.219> I<00:01:10.399> mean<00:01:10.790> I<00:01:10.850> think<00:01:10.880> yet<00:01:11.360> not<00:01:11.509> all

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
appearance I mean I think yet not all

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.750 
appearance I mean I think yet not all
justices<00:01:12.170> go<00:01:12.350> but<00:01:12.620> it's<00:01:13.130> certainly<00:01:13.400> no

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
justices go but it's certainly no

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.580 
justices go but it's certainly no
coincidence<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:14.690> don't<00:01:14.840> think<00:01:14.930> that<00:01:15.200> every

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
coincidence I don't think that every

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.410 
coincidence I don't think that every
most<00:01:15.770> conservative<00:01:16.520> justices<00:01:17.090> aren't

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
most conservative justices aren't

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.760 
most conservative justices aren't
showing<00:01:17.570> up<00:01:17.750> I<00:01:17.930> would<00:01:18.200> have<00:01:18.290> liked<00:01:18.440> to<00:01:18.470> see

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
showing up I would have liked to see

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.680 
showing up I would have liked to see
Thomas<00:01:19.100> there<00:01:19.460> particularly<00:01:20.150> lowest<00:01:20.540> i

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
Thomas there particularly lowest i

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.730 
Thomas there particularly lowest i
really<00:01:20.960> would<00:01:21.080> have<00:01:21.140> liked<00:01:21.290> to<00:01:21.380> see<00:01:21.560> his

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
really would have liked to see his

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.370 
really would have liked to see his
reactions<00:01:22.250> yeah<00:01:22.850> if<00:01:23.090> uh<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:24.020> know<00:01:24.140> i<00:01:24.290> don't

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
reactions yeah if uh you know i don't

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.510 
reactions yeah if uh you know i don't
know<00:01:24.530> if<00:01:24.650> they<00:01:24.770> did<00:01:24.890> be<00:01:25.100> anything<00:01:25.310> like

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
know if they did be anything like

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.060 
know if they did be anything like
Alito's<00:01:25.970> but<00:01:26.299> right<00:01:26.690> now<00:01:26.869> probably<00:01:27.560> not<00:01:27.860> yet

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
Alito's but right now probably not yet

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.340 
Alito's but right now probably not yet
up<00:01:28.430> joe<00:01:28.940> biden<00:01:29.330> was<00:01:29.540> putting<00:01:29.840> on<00:01:29.900> a<00:01:29.960> hell<00:01:30.170> of<00:01:30.200> a
