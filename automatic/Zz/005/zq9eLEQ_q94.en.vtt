00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 moin moin welcome to 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.540
 the fall of the gloomy world that I am 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.150
 in the last two duels series against 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.240
 the kaust entboten and against kites 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.920
 I used it in advance of her 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.710
 cards I've decided and 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.970
 I start with the monsters myself 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.830
 I want you first the monster in front of me 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.689
 have 17 monsters in the whole day in it 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.400
 that 's a little bit more than usual 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.740
 but dark world would play for 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.740
 me here are all cards of 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.570
 essential importance in this way 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.719
 continue the quarter of the stacks 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.590
 the damerau that is 3 to 6 and is one 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.930
 touareg target then we have three 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.790
 measures of our capital of 6 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.070
 card looks pretty much every card 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.500
 Take the circle we need with it 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.059
 next year we drop off 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.649
 to the grave motto of the day since we have 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.480
 silver gold and beige which can in itself 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.719
 swiss schools with one hand 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.730
 throw and gold and silver are too 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.600
 Relatively useful since you have a virus day 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.689
 then you can go next 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.689
 of course three times dragon kitten 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.930
 the dark world our boss monster 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.030
 like to destroy my card on the field 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.030
 and just can not get killed 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.799
 then we have to stop smoking with the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.240
 The brief for revenge will be equal to 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.979
 then got as a small tech card 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.009
 I'm very good in it 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.020
 yes she is relatively slow very fast 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.759
 is destroyed is synonymous still seen 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.750
 with a black hole but if they are 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.900
 let's go then it is 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.790
 really great, so to speak second card 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.370
 strikers and shapes now I have 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.050
 say that the council has discovered one 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.580
 but also some benefits 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.110
 disadvantages of the first power he is 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.430
 Of course it is not a dark world 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.530
 monster speak and you the normal 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.770
 you can not get disturbed at all 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.320
 rausholen immediately and effectively through its 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.479
 you do not get to draw cards or 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.800
 can no cards on the way looking for what 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.360
 also not exactly of advantage but 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.369
 he is more increased our level 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.170
 itself and only in the finger monster what 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.530
 very good for the cover and by him 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.230
 you can see many of the airic very quickly 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.350
 raesfeld profis fetched silver 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.330
 or as already at karner three degrees almost 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.810
 in all to garden house world most of 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.810
 talk to them 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.780
 then I have more than 100 revenge in there as we 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.160
 much work on toll so 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.930
 he's just talking about it 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.900
 to summon it away if you have three 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.340
 monster pure you get mostly 312 there 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.739
 were mostly through the fed but card 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.959
 again banished 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.820
 as far as the monsters come that many 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.160
 cards because we have three shops 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.160
 with the gloomy world.de a map 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.870
 thinner superfilm stick then have 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.470
 we three times the gates of the dark world 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.850
 Absolute must be in this way then though 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.769
 Of course, once a card destruction 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.080
 our victory conditions as soon as the 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.670
 Most of the time you go to Cologne / Bonn then 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.100
 but of course , goblin is 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.989
 that makes our deck 130 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.549
 kartendeck offer us even more 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.989
 speed again and the stack 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.549
 Thousands in the points the opponent 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.230
 Heroes are usually not that bad 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.910
 the member is pretty fast 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.620
 Do not run out of points again 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.239
 I could have three, I would have three 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.230
 but I only play one-handed now 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.060
 had only one blackout 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.380
 after that, darkness could also harmonize 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.410
 very good way since we actually what 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.730
 to play with seductress and 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.150
 level because you can even add a 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.990
 then organize some coal combos 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.850
 but pack a run 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.860
 then have the drinks her black hole 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.690
 Rebirth and severe storm Karadzic 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.670
 Funeral is a super talent seeker 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.710
 because you can immediately from the deck to the 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.300
 videos cast the island world monster 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.110
 summon people then eat 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.890
 to cook the goods are 14 magic 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.380
 cards from me now to the finest 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.610
 then it will be great here great card too 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.530
 if you only have one on hand 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.630
 so you too capitalize 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.280
 as soon as you pull the first one fully 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.110
 you can usually grow with them 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.730
 go on so that you also in the 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.590
 other pure comes from disadvantage 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.210
 Not only does it have one of course great 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.580
 if you can have two or three species to 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.180
 The hood will definitely wet over 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:15.300
 card then we have once headed room 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.730
 moscow at the festival so then her 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.890
 we have the steering group at the 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.880
 guest sessions of more contagious 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:29.550
 training and a virus because of the 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:34.070
 krachs 730 card does not own and 2008 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:37.390
 recognized see a problem that is 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:41.430
 many monsters play the 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.180
 can not devalue it anymore 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.630
 the intended ones 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.430
 dark robot dragon and bandage 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.520
 then I have two of those on the 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.800
 hand to activate this card but you 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.070
 is 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.320
 Furthermore, I'm the problem 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.360
 I will activate a card at 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.090
 opponents can do that now is one 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:09.910
 relaxed urbanist storm politician 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.910
 card after you speak yet no 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.740
 which looks like problematic 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:22.310
 is called you have the map reasonable 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.680
 use it to set sick data so that 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.110
 I just want to and the guarantee 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.870
 have that can beat it concretely 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:34.300
 baykan destructions and at good I can 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:38.620
 that makes him it is then make a stop 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.780
 rusty an answer or not and 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.970
 besides , I do not like it when 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.220
 Opponent gives me my strategy when i am 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.840
 Use this card and several monsters 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.879
 I have virtually no handle 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.520
 strategy because he shows me which one 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:53.560
 I can now have a monster ball tour 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.180
 for example, needs and advice 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.009
 negotiate my use now 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:03.159
 so to say that I could tear it off 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:05.050
 the craftsman has to make it out of it 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:07.030
 She had two tickets then ordered 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.469
 simply you can with blue yes there must 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.090
 I love to pass me 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:15.400
 keep going 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:16.780
 as far as the first time in the Rhine we come 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.759
 at first thinks that comes too 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.099
 usually not but if you stop 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:23.050
 the possibility times for synchro or 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:24.550
 Access points still like to do that 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.650
 Let's go back to it 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:30.789
 senseless once tgh as lautenbach 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.530
 behind it 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.530
 then we have seven most of the time 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.449
 on the revenge and athletes antipathies 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.090
 Revenge we get well with the field clean 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:42.460
 map has backwoodsler this one 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.139
 Remembered in the net like Graf is also in 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.830
 Underworld long and is also in the 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:51.930
 world clean map then we have 48 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:54.430
 despite the dragon's stardust thing 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.919
 Here I have it in there as he too 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.780
 princess over 2000 country contact 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:04.889
 With that you can get the leading teams 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:11.610
 sacrifice too few monsters at the pace 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:11.610
 on the level and the others 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.040
 the only pirate is the new reason 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.130
 also a virus 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:24.220
 Target of the arts of the virus with the cases 

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.030
 had here can still come up and 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.699
 thank you 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.960
 then we had tiras and andrius 

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:33.340
 that is also a noble goal of the 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:41.229
 recently under that with 1 8 then have 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:43.479
 We used to be so far away for a extra so 

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:45.070
 it grows to the disappearance of the dark world 

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:47.830
 the next duel would be 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.270
 probably mid or late may then 

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.370
 come there is already very expensive 

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:54.760
 is to produce such a video then has to 

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:56.590
 I still effects next next 

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.449
 week some other loading lie 

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:01.240
 run a little differently than the four 

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:01.720
 prepare some dhabi times 

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.150
 curious; excited 

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.840
 there's a lot coming up to the next 

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.840
 time gysi
