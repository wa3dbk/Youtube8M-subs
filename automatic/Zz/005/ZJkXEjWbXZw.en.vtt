hi<00:00:06.180> everybody<00:00:06.600> in<00:00:06.870> this<00:00:06.930> video<00:00:07.920> we're<00:00:08.400> going

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:08.520 
hi everybody in this video we're going

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.700 
hi everybody in this video we're going
to<00:00:08.639> look<00:00:08.850> at<00:00:09.030> some<00:00:09.240> simple<00:00:09.809> exercises<00:00:10.110> that

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
to look at some simple exercises that

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.430 
to look at some simple exercises that
will<00:00:10.800> help<00:00:10.860> new<00:00:11.670> players<00:00:12.000> learn<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.630> spin<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
will help new players learn to spin the

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.710 
will help new players learn to spin the
ball<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.519> see<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.880> effective<00:00:15.360> spin<00:00:15.600> on

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:15.720 
ball and to see the effective spin on

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.170 
ball and to see the effective spin on
the<00:00:15.840> ball<00:00:16.040> to<00:00:17.040> start<00:00:17.310> with<00:00:17.550> with<00:00:18.029> this

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the ball to start with with this

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.210 
the ball to start with with this
particular<00:00:18.540> exercise<00:00:19.290> you<00:00:19.800> can<00:00:19.920> see<00:00:20.099> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
particular exercise you can see the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.909 
particular exercise you can see the
rackets<00:00:20.640> held<00:00:20.880> near<00:00:21.360> vertically<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.200> the

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:22.919 
rackets held near vertically and the

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.609 
rackets held near vertically and the
swing<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.550> as<00:00:23.939> near<00:00:24.419> to<00:00:24.570> horizontal<00:00:25.200> as<00:00:25.349> I<00:00:25.439> can

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
swing is as near to horizontal as I can

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.310 
swing is as near to horizontal as I can
make<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.450> resulting<00:00:27.450> in<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.630> ball<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:28.079> goes

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
make it resulting in a ball that goes

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.290 
make it resulting in a ball that goes
fast<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.700> flat<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.800> also<00:00:32.149> traveling<00:00:33.149> well

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
fast and flat and also traveling well

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.510 
fast and flat and also traveling well
off<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> end<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.750> table<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.649> we'll<00:00:35.370> just

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
off the end of the table and we'll just

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.830 
off the end of the table and we'll just
have<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.700> quick<00:00:35.730> look<00:00:36.030> at<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.300> now<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.629> slow

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
have a quick look at this now in slow

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.599 
have a quick look at this now in slow
motion<00:00:37.250> so<00:00:38.390> bat<00:00:39.390> fairly<00:00:39.899> vertical<00:00:40.379> swing<00:00:41.160> as

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:41.609 
motion so bat fairly vertical swing as

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:44.990 
motion so bat fairly vertical swing as
flat<00:00:42.149> as<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.600> make<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.019> and<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:44.280> ball<00:00:44.489> then

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
flat as I can make it and the ball then

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.470 
flat as I can make it and the ball then
traveling<00:00:45.480> very<00:00:45.719> very<00:00:45.960> fast<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:47.149> quite<00:00:48.149> flat

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
traveling very very fast and quite flat

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.060 
traveling very very fast and quite flat
just<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.989> little<00:00:49.230> bit<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.410> dipping<00:00:49.739> at<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.859> end

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
just a little bit of dipping at the end

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.520 
just a little bit of dipping at the end
from<00:00:50.280> gravity<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.960> possibly<00:00:51.960> just<00:00:52.199> from<00:00:52.350> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
from gravity and possibly just from a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.520 
from gravity and possibly just from a
little<00:00:53.160> bit<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.339> topspin<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.910> my<00:00:54.059> stroke<00:00:54.530> but

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
little bit of topspin on my stroke but

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.860 
little bit of topspin on my stroke but
the<00:00:55.859> idea<00:00:56.129> being<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.489> if<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.390> hit<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.719> ball

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the idea being that if you hit the ball

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.919 
the idea being that if you hit the ball
with<00:00:57.929> a<00:00:58.190> vertical<00:00:59.190> racquet<00:00:59.820> and<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.269> flat<00:01:00.570> swing

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
with a vertical racquet and a flat swing

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.560 
with a vertical racquet and a flat swing
you'll<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> lot<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.980> speed<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.449> it's

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
you'll get a lot of speed but it's

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.720 
you'll get a lot of speed but it's
difficult<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.260> bring<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> ball<00:01:04.710> down<00:01:04.739> onto

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
difficult to bring the ball down onto

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.850 
difficult to bring the ball down onto
the<00:01:05.820> table<00:01:06.030> unless<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> ball<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.440> very<00:01:07.620> very

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the table unless the ball is very very

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.370 
the table unless the ball is very very
high<00:01:08.160> and<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.700> actually<00:01:08.970> swing

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
high and you can actually swing

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.980 
high and you can actually swing
downwards<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.950> actually<00:01:11.280> directly<00:01:12.180> land<00:01:12.840> it

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
downwards to actually directly land it

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.380 
downwards to actually directly land it
onto<00:01:13.230> the<00:01:13.380> table<00:01:13.710> itself<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.850> again<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.120> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
onto the table itself so again just a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.750 
onto the table itself so again just a
demonstration<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.320> vertical<00:01:17.310> racquet<00:01:17.640> and

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
demonstration that vertical racquet and

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.200 
demonstration that vertical racquet and
a<00:01:17.820> flat<00:01:18.030> swing<00:01:18.240> gives<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.350> speed<00:01:19.830> no<00:01:20.610> spin<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
a flat swing gives you speed no spin and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.880 
a flat swing gives you speed no spin and
a<00:01:21.510> ball<00:01:21.690> that<00:01:21.840> goes<00:01:22.020> well<00:01:22.260> off<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.560> end<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
a ball that goes well off the end of the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.150 
a ball that goes well off the end of the
table<00:01:24.080> changing<00:01:25.080> now<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.500> second<00:01:25.860> step<00:01:26.010> of

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
table changing now to the second step of

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.940 
table changing now to the second step of
the<00:01:26.340> exercise<00:01:27.050> the<00:01:28.050> racquet<00:01:28.410> is<00:01:28.590> still

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
the exercise the racquet is still

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.040 
the exercise the racquet is still
vertical<00:01:29.160> or<00:01:29.580> is<00:01:29.820> near<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.180> vertical<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.870> can

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
vertical or is near to vertical as I can

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.920 
vertical or is near to vertical as I can
make<00:01:31.260> it<00:01:31.440> and<00:01:31.560> my<00:01:32.340> swing<00:01:32.640> now<00:01:32.820> becomes<00:01:33.270> near

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
make it and my swing now becomes near

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.260 
make it and my swing now becomes near
vertical<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.610> what<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.760> does<00:01:35.940> is<00:01:36.120> it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
vertical and what that does is it

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.480 
vertical and what that does is it
changes<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.930> flight<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.160> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
changes the flight and the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.400 
changes the flight and the
characteristics<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.510> ball<00:01:39.690> completely

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
characteristics of the ball completely

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.650 
characteristics of the ball completely
what<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.340> now<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.550> is<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.940> ball<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.360> goes

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
what we now have is a ball that goes

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.590 
what we now have is a ball that goes
very<00:01:43.470> much<00:01:43.590> upwards<00:01:44.340> off<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.640> racquet<00:01:45.000> with

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
very much upwards off the racquet with

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.510 
very much upwards off the racquet with
quite<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> lot<00:01:46.410> of<00:01:46.440> topspin<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:46.980> the<00:01:47.100> ball<00:01:47.190> and

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
quite a lot of topspin on the ball and

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.790 
quite a lot of topspin on the ball and
you<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.390> see<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.720> by<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.870> way<00:01:49.080> it<00:01:49.200> does<00:01:49.350> tend

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
you can see that by the way it does tend

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.890 
you can see that by the way it does tend
to<00:01:49.890> really<00:01:50.130> dip<00:01:50.580> down<00:01:50.880> sharply<00:01:51.270> at<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> end

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
to really dip down sharply at the end

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.280 
to really dip down sharply at the end
but<00:01:52.770> still<00:01:52.980> traveling<00:01:53.640> mostly<00:01:54.300> well<00:01:54.960> off<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
but still traveling mostly well off the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.440 
but still traveling mostly well off the
end<00:01:55.410> of<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.560> table<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.040> again<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.120> in<00:01:57.240> slow

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
end of the table and again just in slow

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.830 
end of the table and again just in slow
motion<00:01:57.690> you<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.440> see<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> vertical<00:01:58.920> racquet

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
motion you can see the vertical racquet

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.280 
motion you can see the vertical racquet
the<00:02:00.840> swing<00:02:01.430> mainly<00:02:02.430> upwards<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.990> racquet

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
the swing mainly upwards the racquet

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.770 
the swing mainly upwards the racquet
grips<00:02:04.620> on<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.100> ball<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:06.390> ball<00:02:06.420> then

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
grips on to the ball and the ball then

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.229 
grips on to the ball and the ball then
travels<00:02:07.200> sharply<00:02:07.710> up<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> lot<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.670> topspin

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
travels sharply up with a lot of topspin

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.240 
travels sharply up with a lot of topspin
going<00:02:10.170> very<00:02:10.379> high<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.769> the<00:02:10.890> air<00:02:11.069> before

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
going very high in the air before

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.390 
going very high in the air before
dipping<00:02:11.610> down

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
dipping down

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.550 
dipping down
now<00:02:13.400> obviously<00:02:13.849> this<00:02:14.120> particular<00:02:14.810> part<00:02:15.439> of

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
now obviously this particular part of

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.489 
now obviously this particular part of
the<00:02:15.709> exercise<00:02:16.219> requires<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.510> racket<00:02:17.989> with<00:02:18.230> a

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:18.499 
the exercise requires a racket with a

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.860 
the exercise requires a racket with a
fair<00:02:18.889> degree<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.249> group<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.329> if<00:02:20.420> you're<00:02:20.569> using

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
fair degree of group so if you're using

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.009 
fair degree of group so if you're using
a<00:02:21.139> cheap<00:02:21.650> ping-pong<00:02:22.310> paddle<00:02:22.760> that<00:02:23.239> has<00:02:23.420> not

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
a cheap ping-pong paddle that has not

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.259 
a cheap ping-pong paddle that has not
much<00:02:24.260> grip<00:02:24.530> at<00:02:24.650> all<00:02:24.799> you'll<00:02:25.459> probably<00:02:25.790> find

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
much grip at all you'll probably find

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.599 
much grip at all you'll probably find
that<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.599> racket<00:02:26.930> instead<00:02:27.349> of<00:02:27.499> gripping<00:02:28.370> the

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
that the racket instead of gripping the

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.550 
that the racket instead of gripping the
ball<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.000> throwing<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.389> ball<00:02:29.420> apply<00:02:29.900> the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
ball and throwing the ball apply the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.190 
ball and throwing the ball apply the
ball<00:02:30.799> tend<00:02:31.159> to<00:02:31.250> slide<00:02:31.639> off<00:02:31.879> and<00:02:32.120> not<00:02:32.629> spin<00:02:32.989> very

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
ball tend to slide off and not spin very

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.459 
ball tend to slide off and not spin very
much<00:02:33.439> at<00:02:33.620> all<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:35.030> yeah<00:02:35.239> depending<00:02:35.900> really

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:36.469 
much at all so yeah depending really

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.429 
much at all so yeah depending really
need<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.819> decent<00:02:37.819> amount<00:02:38.030> of<00:02:38.389> grip<00:02:38.659> this<00:02:39.260> to

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439 
need a decent amount of grip this to

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.339 
need a decent amount of grip this to
work<00:02:39.620> but<00:02:40.549> you<00:02:40.639> can<00:02:40.790> see<00:02:40.939> there<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.239> ball<00:02:41.419> not

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
work but you can see there the ball not

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.050 
work but you can see there the ball not
missing<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.769> table<00:02:43.129> by<00:02:43.249> that<00:02:43.489> much<00:02:43.730> but

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
missing the table by that much but

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.209 
missing the table by that much but
definitely<00:02:44.209> going<00:02:44.689> very<00:02:44.840> high<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.439> very<00:02:45.919> very

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:46.219 
definitely going very high and very very

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:51.220 
definitely going very high and very very
spinning<00:02:47.349> so<00:02:48.549> by<00:02:49.549> brushing<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.359> ball<00:02:50.959> here

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
spinning so by brushing the ball here

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.780 
spinning so by brushing the ball here
we're<00:02:51.590> not<00:02:51.769> really<00:02:52.040> making<00:02:52.310> solid<00:02:52.669> contact

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
we're not really making solid contact

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.229 
we're not really making solid contact
with<00:02:53.419> skimming<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.290> ball<00:02:54.590> we're<00:02:55.549> producing<00:02:56.120> a

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
with skimming the ball we're producing a

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.470 
with skimming the ball we're producing a
ball<00:02:56.419> with<00:02:56.569> not<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.900> lot<00:02:57.379> of<00:02:57.409> ball<00:02:57.709> speed<00:02:58.480> high

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
ball with not a lot of ball speed high

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.959 
ball with not a lot of ball speed high
amount<00:02:59.840> of<00:02:59.959> spin<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.530> in<00:03:01.519> this<00:03:01.699> particular

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:01.969 
amount of spin and in this particular

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.059 
amount of spin and in this particular
case<00:03:02.299> because<00:03:02.510> without<00:03:02.840> direction<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.739> swing

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
case because without direction of swing

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.580 
case because without direction of swing
going<00:03:04.609> very<00:03:04.939> very<00:03:05.030> high<00:03:05.540> before<00:03:06.199> dipping

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
going very very high before dipping

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.619 
going very very high before dipping
quickly<00:03:07.299> down<00:03:08.299> towards<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:09.169> floor<00:03:10.209> so<00:03:11.209> to

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
quickly down towards the floor so to

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.539 
quickly down towards the floor so to
change<00:03:11.900> things<00:03:12.169> a<00:03:12.260> little<00:03:12.469> bit<00:03:12.590> we'll<00:03:12.739> go<00:03:12.919> more

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
change things a little bit we'll go more

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.539 
change things a little bit we'll go more
or<00:03:13.669> less<00:03:13.790> in<00:03:13.969> between<00:03:14.389> those<00:03:14.689> two<00:03:14.959> extremes

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
or less in between those two extremes

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.159 
or less in between those two extremes
we're<00:03:16.549> going<00:03:16.759> to<00:03:16.879> keep<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.269> racket<00:03:17.629> quite

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.169 
we're going to keep the racket quite

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.319 
we're going to keep the racket quite
vertical<00:03:18.709> but<00:03:19.340> now<00:03:19.519> I'm<00:03:19.669> going<00:03:19.879> to<00:03:20.000> swing

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
vertical but now I'm going to swing

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.490 
vertical but now I'm going to swing
close<00:03:21.259> to<00:03:21.439> 45<00:03:21.769> degrees<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.989> as<00:03:23.989> you<00:03:24.349> would

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
close to 45 degrees and as you would

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.009 
close to 45 degrees and as you would
probably<00:03:24.799> expect<00:03:25.549> what<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.239> end<00:03:26.540> up<00:03:26.689> with<00:03:26.870> is

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
probably expect what you end up with is

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.219 
probably expect what you end up with is
a<00:03:27.049> ball<00:03:27.349> that's<00:03:27.620> somewhere<00:03:28.129> between<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:29.540> two

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:30.229 
a ball that's somewhere between the two

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:32.860 
a ball that's somewhere between the two
extremes<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:31.159> two<00:03:31.340> first<00:03:31.699> exercises<00:03:32.569> so<00:03:32.720> now

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
extremes the two first exercises so now

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.259 
extremes the two first exercises so now
we<00:03:32.930> get<00:03:33.109> a<00:03:33.169> ball<00:03:33.439> with<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.280> reasonable<00:03:35.030> amount

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
we get a ball with a reasonable amount

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.409 
we get a ball with a reasonable amount
of<00:03:35.449> forward<00:03:36.019> speed<00:03:36.579> but<00:03:37.579> also<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.970> reasonable

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
of forward speed but also a reasonable

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.800 
of forward speed but also a reasonable
amount<00:03:38.750> of<00:03:38.870> topspin<00:03:39.349> and<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:41.120> produces<00:03:41.629> also

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
amount of topspin and it produces also

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.140 
amount of topspin and it produces also
as<00:03:42.169> you<00:03:42.319> can<00:03:42.349> see<00:03:42.709> they're<00:03:42.949> a<00:03:43.159> much<00:03:43.790> lower

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
as you can see they're a much lower

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.800 
as you can see they're a much lower
trajectory<00:03:45.579> with<00:03:46.579> a<00:03:46.819> lot<00:03:47.180> of<00:03:47.299> dipping<00:03:47.509> at<00:03:47.780> the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
trajectory with a lot of dipping at the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.619 
trajectory with a lot of dipping at the
end<00:03:48.079> but<00:03:48.829> still<00:03:49.310> tending<00:03:49.939> to<00:03:50.060> go<00:03:50.180> off<00:03:50.359> the<00:03:50.509> end

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
end but still tending to go off the end

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.170 
end but still tending to go off the end
of<00:03:50.689> the<00:03:50.750> table<00:03:51.579> so<00:03:52.579> you<00:03:52.669> can<00:03:52.790> see<00:03:52.909> that<00:03:53.030> this

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
of the table so you can see that this

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.080 
of the table so you can see that this
trajectory<00:03:53.359> is<00:03:53.810> much<00:03:54.259> lower<00:03:54.590> but<00:03:55.519> because<00:03:55.909> the

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
trajectory is much lower but because the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.780 
trajectory is much lower but because the
ball<00:03:56.299> speed<00:03:56.750> is<00:03:56.930> also<00:03:57.319> higher<00:03:57.709> we're<00:03:58.549> still

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
ball speed is also higher we're still

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.020 
ball speed is also higher we're still
traveling<00:03:59.150> well<00:03:59.359> off<00:03:59.479> the<00:03:59.629> end<00:03:59.750> of<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.930> table

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
traveling well off the end of the table

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.749 
traveling well off the end of the table
so<00:04:02.030> we're<00:04:02.750> still<00:04:02.959> looking<00:04:03.109> to<00:04:03.560> get<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.549> ball

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:04.759 
so we're still looking to get that ball

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:07.990 
so we're still looking to get that ball
down<00:04:05.000> on<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.389> the<00:04:05.509> table<00:04:05.689> itself<00:04:06.169> and<00:04:06.909> using<00:04:07.909> a

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
down on to the table itself and using a

we're<00:04:12.319> getting<00:04:12.590> closer<00:04:12.889> we're<00:04:13.250> getting<00:04:13.489> a

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
we're getting closer we're getting a

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.240 
we're getting closer we're getting a

still<00:04:17.209> dipping<00:04:17.539> quite<00:04:17.750> quickly<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:18.409> we're

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
still dipping quite quickly and we're

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.849 
still dipping quite quickly and we're
getting<00:04:18.769> good<00:04:18.949> ball<00:04:19.219> speed

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
and in the last step what we're going to

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.119 
and in the last step what we're going to
do<00:04:43.509> is<00:04:43.659> to<00:04:43.780> get<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:44.020> ball<00:04:44.169> onto<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:44.680> table

do is to get the ball onto the table
we're<00:04:45.939> going<00:04:46.120> to<00:04:46.300> adjust<00:04:46.629> our<00:04:46.840> racket<00:04:47.199> to<00:04:47.379> it

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
we're going to adjust our racket to it

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.649 
we're going to adjust our racket to it
around<00:04:47.860> about<00:04:48.099> a<00:04:48.129> 45<00:04:48.699> degree<00:04:48.729> angle<00:04:49.060> as<00:04:49.479> well

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
40 to 45 degree mark and as you can

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.800 
40 to 45 degree mark and as you can
imagine<00:05:00.069> what<00:05:00.610> we<00:05:00.729> now<00:05:00.879> get<00:05:01.120> is<00:05:01.330> a<00:05:01.360> ball<00:05:01.599> that

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
imagine what we now get is a ball that

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.450 
imagine what we now get is a ball that
tends<00:05:02.500> to<00:05:02.710> travel<00:05:03.060> flat<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.740> horizontal<00:05:05.740> once

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
tends to travel flat and horizontal once

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.059 
tends to travel flat and horizontal once
it<00:05:06.580> hits<00:05:06.729> the<00:05:06.849> bat<00:05:07.090> dips<00:05:07.870> very<00:05:08.199> fast<00:05:08.560> onto<00:05:08.979> the

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:15.279 
of it inside the table itself so you can

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:19.189 
of it inside the table itself so you can
see<00:05:15.430> here<00:05:15.669> now<00:05:17.069> 45-degree<00:05:18.069> racket<00:05:18.430> angle

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:25.769 
roughly 45 degree swing the bat the ball
now<00:05:23.590> goes<00:05:23.830> very<00:05:24.099> flat<00:05:24.490> off<00:05:24.639> the<00:05:24.789> bat<00:05:24.969> dips<00:05:25.509> very

quickly land safely on the table with

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.320 
quickly land safely on the table with
good<00:05:28.659> forward<00:05:28.990> speed<00:05:29.469> as<00:05:29.620> well<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:30.330> what

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
good forward speed as well and what

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.019 
good forward speed as well and what
you're<00:05:31.479> getting<00:05:31.779> now<00:05:31.960> is<00:05:32.490> because<00:05:33.490> your<00:05:33.639> swing

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:34.029 
you're getting now is because your swing

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.869 
you're getting now is because your swing
is<00:05:34.060> forwards<00:05:34.810> and<00:05:34.960> upwards<00:05:35.110> and<00:05:35.550> your<00:05:36.550> racket

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:36.879 
is forwards and upwards and your racket

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.939 
is forwards and upwards and your racket
angle<00:05:37.330> is<00:05:37.509> forwards<00:05:38.080> and<00:05:38.169> upwards<00:05:38.319> you're

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
angle is forwards and upwards you're

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:43.170 
angle is forwards and upwards you're
getting<00:05:39.250> good<00:05:39.839> forward<00:05:40.839> speed<00:05:41.740> from<00:05:42.190> that<00:05:42.400> but

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
getting good forward speed from that but

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.029 
getting good forward speed from that but
the<00:05:43.330> spin<00:05:43.719> is<00:05:43.870> also<00:05:44.199> being<00:05:44.379> produced<00:05:44.770> but<00:05:44.979> the

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
the spin is also being produced but the

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.240 
the spin is also being produced but the
spin<00:05:45.430> is<00:05:45.580> taking<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.120> ball<00:05:46.270> more<00:05:46.539> forwards

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
spin is taking the ball more forwards

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.339 
spin is taking the ball more forwards
then<00:05:48.659> previously<00:05:49.659> where<00:05:49.839> the<00:05:49.960> spin<00:05:50.199> was

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349 
then previously where the spin was

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:51.689 
then previously where the spin was
taking<00:05:50.680> the<00:05:50.770> ball<00:05:50.919> tending<00:05:51.250> to<00:05:51.310> take<00:05:51.460> the<00:05:51.550> ball

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
taking the ball tending to take the ball

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.200 
taking the ball tending to take the ball
upwards<00:05:52.169> now<00:05:53.169> we're<00:05:53.440> really<00:05:54.000> producing<00:05:55.000> much

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
upwards now we're really producing much

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.950 
upwards now we're really producing much
more<00:05:55.509> forward<00:05:55.930> spin<00:05:57.300> it's<00:05:58.300> the<00:05:58.419> same<00:05:58.599> amount

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
more forward spin it's the same amount

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.540 
more forward spin it's the same amount
of<00:05:59.080> spin<00:05:59.259> but<00:05:59.440> the<00:05:59.529> direction<00:06:00.069> of<00:06:00.190> the<00:06:00.339> the

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
of spin but the direction of the the

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.390 
of spin but the direction of the the
swing<00:06:01.110> being<00:06:02.110> more<00:06:02.319> forwards<00:06:02.740> tends<00:06:03.039> to<00:06:03.219> make

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
swing being more forwards tends to make

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.189 
swing being more forwards tends to make
everything<00:06:03.909> go<00:06:04.210> a<00:06:04.240> little<00:06:04.479> bit<00:06:04.690> faster

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 
everything go a little bit faster

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.190 
everything go a little bit faster
towards<00:06:05.529> the<00:06:05.680> opponent
