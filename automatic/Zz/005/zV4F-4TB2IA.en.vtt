and<00:00:40.470> that's<00:00:41.470> the<00:00:41.800> second<00:00:42.550> layer<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:44.230> we're

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
and that's the second layer so we're

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.689 
and that's the second layer so we're
creating<00:00:45.640> a<00:00:46.379> rather<00:00:47.379> nice<00:00:47.710> foot<00:00:48.129> bed<00:00:48.370> there's

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
creating a rather nice foot bed there's

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.369 
creating a rather nice foot bed there's
a<00:00:49.949> contoured<00:00:50.949> insole<00:00:51.670> that<00:00:52.090> is<00:00:52.360> hammered<00:00:53.170> into

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
a contoured insole that is hammered into

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.100 
a contoured insole that is hammered into
the<00:00:53.559> last<00:00:53.970> to<00:00:54.970> follow<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.449> shape<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.900> arch

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
the last to follow the shape the arch

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.189 
the last to follow the shape the arch
there's<00:00:57.100> arch<00:00:57.460> support<00:00:58.000> there<00:00:58.660> and<00:00:59.050> then

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
there's arch support there and then

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.380 
there's arch support there and then
there's<00:00:59.410> arch<00:00:59.680> support<00:01:00.280> arch<00:01:00.580> support<00:01:01.059> in<00:01:01.239> the

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
there's arch support arch support in the

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.760 
there's arch support arch support in the
wooden<00:01:01.989> shank<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:02.820> then<00:01:03.820> there's<00:01:04.560> two<00:01:05.560> layers

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
wooden shank and then there's two layers

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.880 
wooden shank and then there's two layers
of<00:01:05.950> cork<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:07.750> between<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.290> insole<00:01:08.650> and<00:01:08.770> the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
of cork in between the insole and the

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.420 
of cork in between the insole and the
outsole<00:01:09.310> and<00:01:10.440> incidentally<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.619> lasts<00:01:12.160> have

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
outsole and incidentally the lasts have

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.920 
outsole and incidentally the lasts have
a<00:01:13.350> kind<00:01:14.350> of<00:01:14.530> longitude<00:01:15.490> a<00:01:15.670> lateral<00:01:16.479> curved

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
a kind of longitude a lateral curved

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.740 
a kind of longitude a lateral curved
shape<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.070> bottom<00:01:18.460> they're<00:01:19.060> not<00:01:19.270> flat

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
shape to the bottom they're not flat

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.109 
shape to the bottom they're not flat
there<00:01:20.200> because<00:01:20.530> your<00:01:20.680> feet<00:01:20.920> are<00:01:21.130> slightly

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
there because your feet are slightly

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.600 
there because your feet are slightly
curved<00:01:22.630> too<00:01:22.869> but<00:01:23.140> when<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:24.039> put<00:01:24.250> a<00:01:24.280> little<00:01:24.490> bit

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
curved too but when you put a little bit

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.520 
curved too but when you put a little bit
of<00:01:24.729> cork<00:01:25.000> in<00:01:25.119> here<00:01:25.360> what<00:01:25.509> happens<00:01:25.899> is<00:01:26.940> the<00:01:27.940> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
of cork in here what happens is the the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.070 
of cork in here what happens is the the
shoe<00:01:29.530> gets<00:01:30.060> kind<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.149> flattened<00:01:31.630> out<00:01:31.750> from

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
shoe gets kind of flattened out from

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.469 
shoe gets kind of flattened out from
walking<00:01:32.800> on<00:01:32.979> and<00:01:33.550> the<00:01:35.100> cork<00:01:36.100> gets<00:01:36.729> pushed<00:01:37.149> up

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
walking on and the cork gets pushed up

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.949 
walking on and the cork gets pushed up
into<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:40.200> metatarsal<00:01:41.200> arch<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:43.270> forward

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959 
into the metatarsal arch of the forward

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:45.419 
into the metatarsal arch of the forward
arch<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.410> it<00:01:44.500> kind<00:01:44.740> of<00:01:44.770> gives<00:01:44.979> this<00:01:45.160> nice

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
arch and it kind of gives this nice

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.580 
arch and it kind of gives this nice
little<00:01:45.759> support<00:01:46.509> just<00:01:46.810> behind<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.229> ball<00:01:47.410> the

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
little support just behind the ball the

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.980 
little support just behind the ball the
foot<00:01:47.890> that's<00:01:48.610> very<00:01:48.910> comforting<00:01:50.069> kind<00:01:51.069> of<00:01:51.190> a

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
foot that's very comforting kind of a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.870 
foot that's very comforting kind of a
kind<00:01:52.990> of<00:01:53.050> like<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.640> built<00:01:54.640> in<00:01:56.520> shape<00:01:57.520> that's

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
kind of like a built in shape that's

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.120 
kind of like a built in shape that's
just<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.450> right<00:01:58.630> shape<00:01:58.959> and<00:02:00.270> all<00:02:01.270> right<00:02:01.450> well

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.690 

now<00:02:06.130> we're<00:02:06.459> going<00:02:06.970> to<00:02:07.060> be<00:02:07.179> going<00:02:07.330> on<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.929> the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.790 
now we're going to be going on to the
next<00:02:09.700> step<00:02:10.119> which<00:02:10.750> will<00:02:12.360> be<00:02:13.360> gluing<00:02:13.810> on<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
next step which will be gluing on the

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.610 
next step which will be gluing on the
outsole<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:17.400> trimming<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:19.230> which<00:02:20.230> will<00:02:20.470> be

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
outsole and trimming it which will be

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.479 
outsole and trimming it which will be
very<00:02:20.920> exciting<00:02:21.900> because<00:02:22.900> we'll<00:02:23.410> be<00:02:23.560> getting
