00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.079
 went the second week of fees what are your 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.789
 impressions 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.189
 it was two really difficult 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.169
 weeks but it was they who brought us the form 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.269
 so everything is great who is better for you 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.009
 play more or train more 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.320
 I think both 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.750
 train hard it is very useful 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.150
 Well, playing is never boring like that 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.280
 what am i for both options what can you 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.800
 say about the system that gives the team 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.720
 Coaching is now well, I think all great at 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.860
 I sometimes have questions about 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.170
 specific episodes 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.350
 how we play but in general no problems 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.350
 it happens 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.509
 who helps you with coaching transfer 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.580
 indications above all paul valentine 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.560
 there would be no help without the guys 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.299
 hard to understand what they say on the ice and so 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.369
 everything is good how do you think we will 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.900
 play against pirates today 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.310
 there will be a difficult match we will 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.140
 confront a good team 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.649
 but we need to play our hockey and 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.649
 then everything will turn out 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.110
 on 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.820
 can we play fast after 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.979
 serious loads we will try 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.020
 act as fast as we can 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.840
 up the team is a little tired but we 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.609
 give everything completely 40 always joking 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.609
