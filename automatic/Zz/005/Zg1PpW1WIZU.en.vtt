playing rush and we were playing like
five<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.040> four<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.720> were<00:01:54.869> running<00:01:55.399> for

five on four so you were running for
there<00:01:56.700> were<00:01:56.820> times<00:01:57.060> where<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.390> would<00:01:57.479> be

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
there were times where we would be

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.530 
there were times where we would be
running<00:01:58.020> across<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.560> map<00:01:58.740> 34<00:01:59.369> minutes<00:01:59.640> trying

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
to find somebody we're just spinning

around<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.670> circles<00:02:02.700> wasting<00:02:03.479> time<00:02:03.659> flying<00:02:04.079> in

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
around in circles wasting time flying in

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.469 
around in circles wasting time flying in
jets<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.009> let<00:02:05.490> me<00:02:05.549> talk<00:02:05.729> about<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.000> Jets<00:02:06.270> real

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479

jets and let me talk about the Jets real
quick<00:02:06.719> I've<00:02:07.560> figured<00:02:07.890> out<00:02:08.099> what<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.340> Jets<00:02:08.610> are

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849

quick I've figured out what the Jets are
the<00:02:09.090> Jets<00:02:09.360> seemed<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.750> be<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.959> most<00:02:10.080> useless

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the Jets seemed to be the most useless

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.530 
the Jets seemed to be the most useless
part<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.009> game<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.610> might<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.270> hating

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
part of this game I might be hating

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.680 
part of this game I might be hating
right<00:02:12.690> now<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.959> might<00:02:13.080> not<00:02:13.200> have<00:02:13.349> played

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
right now it might not have played

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.020 
right now it might not have played
who<00:02:14.080> can<00:02:14.230> use<00:02:14.350> them<00:02:14.500> useful<00:02:14.710> yet<00:02:15.190> but<00:02:15.760> people

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
who can use them useful yet but people

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.670 
who can use them useful yet but people
always<00:02:16.180> jump<00:02:16.300> into<00:02:16.750> jets<00:02:17.020> fly<00:02:17.290> them<00:02:17.500> around

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
always jump into jets fly them around

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.620 
always jump into jets fly them around
and<00:02:18.010> just<00:02:18.370> disappear<00:02:18.850> that's<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.360> that's<00:02:19.480> the
