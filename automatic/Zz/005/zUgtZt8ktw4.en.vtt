00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.310
 I think we were clearly inferior 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.849
 today in many if I even all 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.699
 prosecute 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.859
 We wanted to play before the game 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.230
 try to make the field narrow with it 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.519
 the little slippery players and the 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.449
 small fast players do not let us through 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.180
 slide your fingers 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.800
 So that's my opinion 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.320
 actually almost never a second of 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.180
 succeeded and then it is natural 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.559
 hard and then if they lead 1 0 and 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.059
 try to run a bit 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.030
 But I also believed only one 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.140
 possibility in the first half then 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.960
 Unfortunately, a performance is not enough 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.920
 here at a table leader also only 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.439
 to take something with you 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.949
 Bitter defeat tough on the 

00:00:54.439 --> 00:01:00.100
 Ground landed today and is back 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.570
 very disappointed well, I mean 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.070
 fourth team very very fast 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.330
 switches and the individual has him 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.009
 played in the cards of course so 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.960
 to retire a bit by doing so 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.520
 we could of course have one then 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.890
 little bit overweight but got 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.570
 without much benefit 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.130
 and of course that's what she is 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.170
 they hoped they would be ahead 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.759
 come fast counter we have it 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.180
 failed to stop them 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.050
 and are clearly deserving today 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.110
 loser from the place 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.790
 yes certainly in with shortly after the game 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.320
 Of course, that's a bit like 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.229
 dissolution phenomena at the end 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.600
 we got one after the 2 0 was for me 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.710
 handstand precedes everything again 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.210
 still trying everything on a map 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.430
 he again set two offensive 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.960
 brought the end to be arrived so 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.740
 a stupid counter to the third gate and 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.840
 then yes 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.960
 then it is difficult and I think then 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.799
 the promoters are very clever again 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.150
 let the ball run 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.470
 I mean we have to have to 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.670
 Try it Now here to say we 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.200
 if i have the last team 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.549
 even if it does not lose now if 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.670
 it is now no consolation or any 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.430
 should be excuse today was really from 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.740
 number one to eleven 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.280
 bad and subject to the times you have to 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.140
 clearly stating and more there 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.539
 English moment not to say so we 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.890
 have to get up and go home 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.930
 spectators offer what we offer now 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.940
 really with your back to the wall 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.950
 but that's what we're up to 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.270
 us too so bent that is 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.080
 that this is so, then we need to 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.080
 can handle the pressure
