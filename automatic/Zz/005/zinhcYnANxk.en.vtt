do that it's again one coin for each

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.499 
do that it's again one coin for each
type<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.829> shell<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.369> hundred<00:02:02.729> for<00:02:03.390> each

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
type of shell so it's a hundred for each

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.600 
type of shell so it's a hundred for each
stack<00:02:03.869> here<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:04.740> what<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.280> do<00:02:05.460> is

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
stack here but what it's going to do is

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.270 
stack here but what it's going to do is
convert<00:02:05.939> them<00:02:06.119> into<00:02:06.329> pearls<00:02:06.979> so<00:02:07.979> I'm<00:02:08.099> going<00:02:08.250> to

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
do it for all for my stacks here

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.660 
do it for all for my stacks here
and<00:02:12.630> then<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.960> can<00:02:13.110> sell<00:02:13.470> these<00:02:13.770> pearls<00:02:14.370> for

into pearls in black pearls you can go

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.790 
into pearls in black pearls you can go
ahead<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.670> sell<00:02:27.060> them<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.990> armorer<00:02:28.470> if

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
ahead and sell them to the armorer if

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.920 
ahead and sell them to the armorer if
you'd<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.550> if<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.970> look<00:02:30.150> at<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.420> top<00:02:30.660> right

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
you'd like if you look at the top right

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.110 
you'd like if you look at the top right
corner<00:02:30.960> there<00:02:31.500> lists<00:02:31.860> how<00:02:31.950> much<00:02:32.130> gold<00:02:32.490> he<00:02:32.820> has

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
corner there lists how much gold he has

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.590 
corner there lists how much gold he has
that<00:02:33.450> he<00:02:33.660> can<00:02:33.900> buy<00:02:34.590> from<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:35.910> can<00:02:36.360> if

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
that he can buy from you so you can if

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.940 
that he can buy from you so you can if
you're<00:02:36.690> early<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.140> game<00:02:37.320> go<00:02:37.530> ahead<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:37.860> do

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
you're early in the game go ahead and do

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.310 
you're early in the game go ahead and do
it<00:02:38.100> here<00:02:38.520> but<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.180> problem<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:39.690> once<00:02:40.140> you've

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
it here but the problem is once you've

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.490 
it here but the problem is once you've
depleted<00:02:40.800> his<00:02:41.010> entire<00:02:41.490> coin<00:02:42.330> supply<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:43.200> takes

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
depleted his entire coin supply it takes

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.950 
depleted his entire coin supply it takes
him<00:02:43.650> five<00:02:43.980> days<00:02:44.310> before<00:02:44.910> he<00:02:45.270> gets<00:02:45.510> more<00:02:45.750> money

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
him five days before he gets more money

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.710 
him five days before he gets more money
so<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.320> can<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:47.550> theory<00:02:47.820> come<00:02:48.120> back<00:02:48.270> five<00:02:48.480> days

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
so you can in theory come back five days

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.540 
so you can in theory come back five days
later<00:02:49.020> meditate<00:02:49.590> for<00:02:49.770> five<00:02:49.950> days<00:02:50.190> if<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.520> like

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
later meditate for five days if you like

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.050 
later meditate for five days if you like
and<00:02:51.030> he<00:02:51.450> has<00:02:51.630> more<00:02:51.870> money<00:02:52.140> instead<00:02:53.130> what<00:02:53.880> I'm

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
and he has more money instead what I'm

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.240 
and he has more money instead what I'm
going<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.300> do<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.630> go<00:02:54.870> over<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.650> loan<00:02:55.860> shark

which is with that green custom Waypoint

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.770 
which is with that green custom Waypoint
