don't<00:00:03.120> let<00:00:03.419> this<00:00:03.600> be<00:00:03.899> you

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.359 

when<00:00:17.990> two<00:00:18.200> vehicles<00:00:18.650> on<00:00:18.800> a<00:00:18.830> road<00:00:19.130> are

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
when two vehicles on a road are

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.280 
when two vehicles on a road are
simultaneously<00:00:20.090> approaching<00:00:20.720> a<00:00:20.810> stop<00:00:21.050> sign

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
simultaneously approaching a stop sign

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.230 
simultaneously approaching a stop sign
at<00:00:21.529> a<00:00:21.560> right<00:00:21.800> angle<00:00:21.980> of<00:00:22.340> each<00:00:22.430> other<00:00:22.640> the

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
at a right angle of each other the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.319 
at a right angle of each other the
vehicle<00:00:23.599> on<00:00:23.750> the<00:00:23.779> Left<00:00:24.169> must<00:00:24.650> yield<00:00:25.279> or<00:00:25.610> give

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:26.329 
vehicle on the Left must yield or give

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.659 
vehicle on the Left must yield or give
way<00:00:26.570> for<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:26.930> vehicle<00:00:27.289> on<00:00:27.439> the<00:00:27.590> right<00:00:27.740> this<00:00:28.490> is

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:28.669 
way for the vehicle on the right this is

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:30.280 
way for the vehicle on the right this is
very<00:00:29.000> similar<00:00:29.360> to<00:00:29.480> what<00:00:29.720> happens<00:00:30.020> on<00:00:30.110> the

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.290 
very similar to what happens on the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.139 
very similar to what happens on the
water<00:00:30.470> but<00:00:31.070> there<00:00:31.220> are<00:00:31.309> many<00:00:31.520> more<00:00:31.730> things<00:00:32.000> to

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
water but there are many more things to

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.090 
water but there are many more things to
keep<00:00:32.329> into<00:00:32.540> consideration<00:00:32.739> let's<00:00:33.739> talk<00:00:33.950> about

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
keep into consideration let's talk about

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.250 
keep into consideration let's talk about
that<00:00:34.340> for<00:00:34.550> a<00:00:34.579> little<00:00:34.640> bit

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
that for a little bit

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.840 
that for a little bit
Tim<00:00:36.260> can<00:00:36.469> you<00:00:36.530> show<00:00:36.890> us<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:37.070> correct<00:00:37.610> way<00:00:37.790> to

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
Tim can you show us the correct way to

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.360 
Tim can you show us the correct way to
cross<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:38.270> path<00:00:38.809> of<00:00:39.140> another<00:00:39.590> boat<00:00:39.860> when<00:00:40.160> both

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
cross the path of another boat when both

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.580 
cross the path of another boat when both
boats<00:00:40.640> are<00:00:40.850> powered<00:00:41.239> yeah<00:00:41.629> absolutely

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
boats are powered yeah absolutely

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.200 
boats are powered yeah absolutely
first<00:00:43.219> though<00:00:43.399> it's<00:00:43.550> important<00:00:43.940> to<00:00:44.030> note<00:00:44.180> that

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
first though it's important to note that

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.750 
first though it's important to note that
if<00:00:44.480> one<00:00:44.780> boat<00:00:45.079> is<00:00:45.320> not<00:00:45.620> powered<00:00:46.160> then<00:00:46.550> the

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
if one boat is not powered then the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.700 
if one boat is not powered then the
powered<00:00:47.210> boat<00:00:47.449> would<00:00:47.690> normally<00:00:48.140> give<00:00:48.410> way<00:00:48.649> to

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
powered boat would normally give way to

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.399 
powered boat would normally give way to
the<00:00:49.010> non<00:00:49.280> powered<00:00:49.850> boat<00:00:50.149> however<00:00:51.050> if<00:00:51.350> both

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
the non powered boat however if both

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.649 
the non powered boat however if both
boats<00:00:52.070> are<00:00:52.309> powered<00:00:52.699> then<00:00:53.149> we<00:00:53.329> use<00:00:53.510> the

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
boats are powered then we use the

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.139 
boats are powered then we use the
principles<00:00:54.199> of<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.679> give<00:00:54.890> way<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:55.850> stand

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
principles of the give way and the stand

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.110 
principles of the give way and the stand
on<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:57.230> correct<00:00:57.620> way<00:00:57.769> to<00:00:57.800> boat<00:00:58.190> on<00:00:58.370> course<00:00:58.789> is

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
on the correct way to boat on course is

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.180 
on the correct way to boat on course is
for<00:00:59.480> a<00:00:59.510> vessel<00:00:59.870> to<00:00:59.989> give<00:01:00.260> way<00:01:00.530> if<00:01:00.769> another

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
for a vessel to give way if another

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.759 
for a vessel to give way if another
vessel<00:01:01.670> approaches<00:01:02.239> under<00:01:02.449> starboard<00:01:03.170> or

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
vessel approaches under starboard or

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.730 
vessel approaches under starboard or
right<00:01:04.190> side<00:01:04.550> a<00:01:04.909> vessel<00:01:05.870> must<00:01:06.050> never<00:01:06.409> cross

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
right side a vessel must never cross

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.310 
right side a vessel must never cross
ahead<00:01:07.280> of<00:01:07.370> another<00:01:07.610> vessel<00:01:08.150> approaching<00:01:08.840> to

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
ahead of another vessel approaching to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.830 
ahead of another vessel approaching to
starboard<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.180> crossing<00:01:11.180> past<00:01:11.390> with<00:01:11.570> another

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
starboard and crossing past with another

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.510 
starboard and crossing past with another
boat<00:01:12.050> is<00:01:12.170> just<00:01:12.470> like<00:01:12.650> when<00:01:13.130> you're<00:01:13.280> driving

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
boat is just like when you're driving

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.790 
boat is just like when you're driving
just<00:01:13.909> like<00:01:14.060> you'd<00:01:14.240> yield<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:14.870> car<00:01:15.409> on<00:01:15.650> your

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
just like you'd yield to a car on your

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.039 
just like you'd yield to a car on your
right<00:01:16.010> at<00:01:16.220> a<00:01:16.250> stop<00:01:16.550> sign<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:17.420> same<00:01:17.659> applies<00:01:18.020> to

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
right at a stop sign the same applies to

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.569 
right at a stop sign the same applies to
power<00:01:18.530> boats<00:01:18.770> when<00:01:19.009> you're<00:01:19.130> on<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.430> water

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
power boats when you're on the water

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.639 
power boats when you're on the water
okay<00:01:20.420> well<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:20.719> want<00:01:20.869> to<00:01:20.930> make<00:01:21.049> sure<00:01:21.229> I<00:01:21.259> get<00:01:21.469> this

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
okay well I want to make sure I get this

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.090 
okay well I want to make sure I get this
right<00:01:21.950> then<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:22.579> if<00:01:22.670> I'm<00:01:22.880> approaching<00:01:23.180> a<00:01:23.570> boat

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
right then so if I'm approaching a boat

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.149 
right then so if I'm approaching a boat
who's<00:01:25.100> on<00:01:25.250> my<00:01:25.280> right<00:01:25.930> then<00:01:26.930> I<00:01:27.320> would<00:01:27.770> be<00:01:27.920> the

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
who's on my right then I would be the

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.459 
who's on my right then I would be the
give<00:01:28.610> way<00:01:28.850> vessel<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:29.570> they<00:01:29.780> would<00:01:30.020> be<00:01:30.200> the

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
give way vessel and they would be the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.279 
give way vessel and they would be the
stand<00:01:31.280> on<00:01:31.399> vessels<00:01:31.850> i<00:01:32.000> right<00:01:32.210> foot<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.259> that

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
stand on vessels i right foot so that

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.620 
stand on vessels i right foot so that
would<00:01:33.619> mean<00:01:33.829> I<00:01:34.100> would<00:01:34.130> need<00:01:34.579> to<00:01:34.820> yield<00:01:35.119> or<00:01:35.360> give

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
would mean I would need to yield or give

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.779 
would mean I would need to yield or give
way<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.899> that<00:01:36.259> vessel<00:01:36.740> allow<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.399> continue

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
way to that vessel allow it to continue

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.569 
way to that vessel allow it to continue
forward<00:01:38.180> then<00:01:38.869> I<00:01:38.899> should<00:01:39.200> change<00:01:39.439> course<00:01:39.799> take

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
forward then I should change course take

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.760 
forward then I should change course take
right<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.270> go<00:01:41.360> behind<00:01:41.570> let's<00:01:42.140> say<00:01:42.320> we<00:01:42.530> pass

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
right and go behind let's say we pass

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.370 
right and go behind let's say we pass
behind<00:01:43.670> yep<00:01:44.240> that's<00:01:44.539> exactly<00:01:44.659> right<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.109> now

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
behind yep that's exactly right and now

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.840 
behind yep that's exactly right and now
we<00:01:45.439> actually<00:01:45.890> get<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:46.039> go<00:01:46.219> out<00:01:46.399> on<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.640> water

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
we actually get to go out on the water

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.639 
we actually get to go out on the water
in<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.479> boats<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:47.899> show<00:01:48.020> everybody<00:01:48.259> how<00:01:48.500> it's

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
in the boats and show everybody how it's

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.700 
in the boats and show everybody how it's
done<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:49.280> part<00:01:49.520> I'm<00:01:49.609> waiting<00:01:49.909> for<00:01:49.939> let's<00:01:50.359> go

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710

like direction here is not get in your

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:48.490 
like direction here is not get in your
way
