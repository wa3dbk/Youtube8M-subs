00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.280
 2 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.300
 Today I can formally have a cell phone to the phone after all, on the way back 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.659
 lands 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:12.679
 Mega pixel camera 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.679
 and this is exactly what you can test some times 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.310
 this often hung on my slider 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.619
 can i do your initial 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.710
 Turned right 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.779
 the cameras start 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.140
 like that and I'm going to paint again 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.649
 a bit more 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.840
 you can indeed look at the options 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.609
 and although I have series image night here 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:39.460
 discouraged 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.309
 Image size the duty self-timer effect setting gv 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.190
 Band crossover matching image quality shutter Toronto 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.660
 Location and the default setting he can 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.060
 Reset attitude Mennig and thinkers and how 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.270
 some person for um um um with 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.990
 I just want to stop now 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.840
 Take the standard photo and then compensate for the sandbox 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.000
 around 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.030
 Everything is possible here as there are plenty 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.140
 Setting options in any case 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.640
 and around 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.210
 not hurt. No, take a picture and really do with the foals 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.910
 two more pixels 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.710
 Sound to strike e10 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.070
 because she is only satisfied with the lighting 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.150
 Outlines in normal fast 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.610
 not so 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.280
 otherwise the praying can be eavesdropped 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.490
 You can not say anything about Miss but you bled heavily and readers of course 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.620
 also 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.510
 very little light of light due to unusual lighting conditions 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.510
 Chamber flourishes rather to a color cast percent 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.180
 yes you have to say and try it but the measure was nice 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.610
 Quality percent you can actually years 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.800
 Dagmar Reich does not complain anymore 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.340
 so now 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.840
 I give it a boost 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.019
 Video footage Rome 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.279
 and not even barley a stylus options 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:14.749
 around 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.499
 that is the thesis of the price from the same 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.489
 the duty per woman in night mode 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.499
 Band frequencies like the eu commission 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:25.479
 video quality 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.539
 the dough Royston Drenthe the 5 um of course 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.809
 very handy if i say i want to be whole more feared 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.209
 so do not put on so big because should see in time 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.589
 now percent is over now the maximum size is reached 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.329
 Create recording time limit 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.920
 good goes smooching the same direction i can say i just want to son too 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.919
 four seconds have to take care of video 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.909
 then stopped him justified 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.769
 yes do recording Cut guys from the Arc I can indeed choose percent 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.319
 Effect settings 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.499
 Storage location and here too I can return to the default setting 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:09.499
 choose 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.059
 Turn, I would now have no, we do 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:21.149
 too clumsy light on 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.469
 and now highest finally 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.329
 happy to customers 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.039
 that offers the countries 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:36.039
 in me directly to that it means 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.879
 I have my mistake 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.879
 I still look around 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.069
 that their meetings be 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.929
 Kimmig did 

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:52.559
 Torsten Wewer 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:56.469
 that without any cars actually of a quality in our place times like that 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.169
 Projects and the Short Film also that has just as slight blue cast underline 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.819
 I really think it's here now 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.819
 will lie on the lighting 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:12.549
 I am well aware of the ceremony and Commander then I told myself 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.109
 maybe diminished professional video camera that is clear though 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:20.249
 I think the weapon was always not from his cell phone camera 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:24.559
 good s 

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:24.829
 Has
