over the mall universe line and this

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.170 
over the mall universe line and this

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.350 

this<00:03:55.540> one<00:03:55.840> has<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.290> counterpart<00:03:57.220> that<00:03:57.940> comes<00:03:58.180> in

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
this one has a counterpart that comes in

the Secret Wars 2-pack with Magneto

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.050 
the Secret Wars 2-pack with Magneto
and<00:04:01.170> I<00:04:02.250> think<00:04:03.250> that's<00:04:03.459> why<00:04:03.579> this<00:04:03.640> one<00:04:03.880> keeps

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
and I think that's why this one keeps

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.339 
and I think that's why this one keeps
coming<00:04:04.390> out<00:04:04.480> because<00:04:04.660> I<00:04:04.840> made<00:04:05.019> so<00:04:05.170> much<00:04:05.290> of

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
coming out because I made so much of

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.180 
coming out because I made so much of
those<00:04:06.510> but<00:04:07.510> this<00:04:07.750> one<00:04:07.959> has<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.500> blue<00:04:08.680> tint<00:04:09.069> if

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
those but this one has the blue tint if

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.350 
those but this one has the blue tint if
you<00:04:09.310> can<00:04:09.459> tell<00:04:09.700> I<00:04:09.910> don't<00:04:10.030> know<00:04:10.090> if<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:10.209> can

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
you can tell I don't know if you can

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.990 
you can tell I don't know if you can
tell<00:04:10.540> on<00:04:10.569> the<00:04:10.810> figure<00:04:11.190> but<00:04:12.190> it<00:04:12.340> has<00:04:12.489> like<00:04:12.730> a

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
tell on the figure but it has like a

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.379 
tell on the figure but it has like a
matte<00:04:13.690> finish<00:04:13.989> on<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.739> body<00:04:15.000> with<00:04:16.000> these<00:04:16.150> blue

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
matte finish on the body with these blue

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.469 
matte finish on the body with these blue
hues<00:04:16.750> very<00:04:17.049> similar<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.560> a<00:04:17.620> phantom<00:04:18.039> had<00:04:18.190> it

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
hues very similar to a phantom had it

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.490 
hues very similar to a phantom had it
and<00:04:19.479> I<00:04:19.630> think<00:04:19.690> that's<00:04:19.900> what<00:04:20.079> they<00:04:20.169> were<00:04:20.229> going

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
and I think that's what they were going

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.409 
and I think that's what they were going
for<00:04:20.739> a<00:04:21.010> lot<00:04:21.489> of<00:04:21.549> people<00:04:21.789> told<00:04:21.880> me<00:04:21.970> these<00:04:22.150> legs

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
for a lot of people told me these legs

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.390 
for a lot of people told me these legs

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
not really gonna mess with it too much

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.980

from one of the old figures and wave one
but<00:05:56.909> you<00:05:57.900> can<00:05:58.020> always<00:05:58.139> get<00:05:58.379> the<00:05:58.500> clear<00:05:58.740> ones

but you can always get the clear ones
online<00:05:59.340> they<00:06:00.120> look<00:06:00.300> a<00:06:00.389> lot<00:06:00.539> nicer<00:06:01.759> look<00:06:02.759> at

online they look a lot nicer look at
this<00:06:02.939> legs<00:06:03.240> on<00:06:03.419> my<00:06:03.569> stuff<00:06:03.810> already<00:06:04.110> look<00:06:04.259> at

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 
this legs on my stuff already look at

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:09.810 
this legs on my stuff already look at
that<00:06:05.210> butt

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.850 

there<00:06:10.420> is

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
there is

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.070 
there is
come<00:06:12.219> back<00:06:12.430> over<00:06:12.699> the<00:06:12.939> road

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
come back over the road

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.290 
come back over the road
comparison<00:06:16.069> you<00:06:16.160> can<00:06:16.310> see<00:06:16.490> what<00:06:17.000> it<00:06:17.120> looks

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
comparison you can see what it looks

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.200 
comparison you can see what it looks
like<00:06:17.389> next<00:06:17.780> to<00:06:17.960> the<00:06:18.139> spider-man<00:06:19.009> venom<00:06:19.220> and

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
like next to the spider-man venom and

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.040 
like next to the spider-man venom and
what<00:06:20.449> it<00:06:20.569> looks<00:06:20.750> like<00:06:20.960> next<00:06:21.259> city<00:06:21.620> carnage

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
what it looks like next city carnage

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.409 
what it looks like next city carnage
so<00:06:24.050> the<00:06:24.500> carnage<00:06:24.860> is<00:06:25.039> not<00:06:25.490> all<00:06:25.940> those<00:06:26.120> same

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
so the carnage is not all those same

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:29.140 
so the carnage is not all those same
size<00:06:26.659> not<00:06:27.169> the<00:06:27.349> same<00:06:27.530> body<00:06:27.800> or<00:06:28.669> the<00:06:28.940> same

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
size not the same body or the same

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.600 
size not the same body or the same
movement<00:06:29.569> or<00:06:29.659> articulation<00:06:30.229> but<00:06:30.620> they<00:06:31.430> are

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
movement or articulation but they are

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.800 
movement or articulation but they are
all<00:06:32.030> side-by-side<00:06:32.750> car<00:06:33.319> venom<00:06:33.830> should<00:06:34.069> be<00:06:34.280> a

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
all side-by-side car venom should be a

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.869 
all side-by-side car venom should be a
lot<00:06:35.810> bigger<00:06:36.080> there<00:06:36.860> is<00:06:37.039> a<00:06:37.069> venom<00:06:37.520> that<00:06:37.610> comes

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:37.879 
lot bigger there is a venom that comes

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:41.520 
lot bigger there is a venom that comes
with<00:06:38.120> a<00:06:38.150> 2<00:06:38.389> pack<00:06:38.659> with<00:06:38.990> a<00:06:39.530> docking<00:06:40.400> marine<00:06:40.819> son

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
with a 2 pack with a docking marine son

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.089 
with a 2 pack with a docking marine son
but<00:06:42.530> that's<00:06:43.310> a<00:06:43.610> smaller<00:06:44.419> size<00:06:44.780> venom<00:06:45.169> and<00:06:45.409> then

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:46.099 
but that's a smaller size venom and then

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:47.589 
but that's a smaller size venom and then
there's<00:06:46.310> the<00:06:46.490> stretch<00:06:46.759> of<00:06:46.940> strike<00:06:47.210> which<00:06:47.419> is<00:06:47.449> a

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599 
there's the stretch of strike which is a

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:50.649 
there's the stretch of strike which is a
lot<00:06:47.870> bigger<00:06:48.050> which<00:06:48.440> is<00:06:48.620> very<00:06:49.150> close<00:06:50.150> to<00:06:50.180> size

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:50.659 
lot bigger which is very close to size

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:53.499 
lot bigger which is very close to size
into<00:06:51.409> these<00:06:52.370> figures<00:06:52.789> which<00:06:53.000> is<00:06:53.180> like<00:06:53.330> the

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:53.509 
into these figures which is like the

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:55.990 
into these figures which is like the
Rhino<00:06:53.750> so<00:06:54.319> it's<00:06:54.740> got<00:06:54.889> the<00:06:55.009> big<00:06:55.190> body<00:06:55.430> so<00:06:55.759> I'll

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 
Rhino so it's got the big body so I'll

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.309 
Rhino so it's got the big body so I'll
review<00:06:56.630> Rhino<00:06:56.900> probably<00:06:57.349> another<00:06:58.039> time<00:06:58.340> but

00:06:59.309 --> 00:06:59.319 
review Rhino probably another time but

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:01.960

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:04.159 
your carnage in your venom that is the

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:05.920 
your carnage in your venom that is the
symbiotes<00:07:04.699> that<00:07:04.909> exists<00:07:05.419> out<00:07:05.539> there<00:07:05.750> right
