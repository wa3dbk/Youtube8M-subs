00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.250
 Let's go to the theme for today. 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.989
 you've probably heard some man 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.640
 with a voice so fine but so thin that 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.199
 looks like a woman's voice 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.640
 It's not about those guys that I 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.649
 I came to speak here today I came to speak of 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.530
 people who have actually developed a 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.330
 technique to have the tone similar to the 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.369
 of a woman and I believe this is 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.890
 a video that 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.380
 circulated a lot on the internet is the video of 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.110
 bell on the holder was a freshman from the 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.240
 thailand gotti teles or what is the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.950
 her lip talent thailand her so 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.200
 that reached the stage was already conquering 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.050
 the jurors theoretically only one more 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.340
 woman singing the cute music and with 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.340
 the soft cute voice 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:59.020
 Who sent over 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:02.680
 Yes, that is 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.680
 along with her 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.550
 everything exactly this part of the 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.710
 music 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.300
 the dell that in fact a man 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.160
 transsexual 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.160
 he was just trying to find a central pair 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:30.870
 I had before a dowry tea 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.660
 I always walk right to you back to 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.920
 lake 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.920
 the old 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.580
 for sure a video that scared a lot 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.830
 and catches many people by surprise 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.750
 first because she does not look like a man 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.490
 already starts so it's more bizarre than 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.110
 all according to the fact that everyone was 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.030
 convinced that she was a woman who was 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.490
 There singing, nothing much, nothing much. 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.560
 singing it cute it starts or they 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.390
 she starts singing in a low voice with 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.730
 Everyone's voice is scary and 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.770
 That makes it funny, bizarre. 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.720
 plus a bizarre also very admirable 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.700
 to get this technique is 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.750
 very difficult, let's talk about the 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.940
 the second video I want to show you 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.280
 today before explaining how they 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.910
 can do this technique is the nic 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.910
 Peter 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:28.489
 it's common 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.510
 Nick developed a vocal control in the 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.790
 your voice from the head of your falsetto too 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.130
 that he was able to touch and 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.560
 and articulate this resonance that is is 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.880
 that vocal socket that the voice was 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.880
 identical to a woman's voice 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.010
 and now I'll explain to you with 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.600
 that this is possible as it is possible 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.520
 man has a woman's voice he was already born 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.800
 so it's technical how do you 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.750
 sing so if you 're little man 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.340
 interested party if it is not only for 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.140
 curiosity even the first thing that 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.210
 You have to put in mind here that 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.130
 type of feat is possible for 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.110
 men but not for women you go 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.300
 understand the vocal extension of the 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.550
 woman or the notes that she can 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.440
 singing starts from the most serious 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.480
 she gets and goes even more acutely 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.240
 comfortable way it can extend 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.920
 even grandmas head or it is as if all 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.690
 women can sing a serious 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.850
 proportional to her voice and went to a 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.950
 that is comfortable for her up to a 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.050
 little more besides but nothing more or 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.060
 woman can not forge voice 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.980
 Severe already a man he has his reach 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.750
 vocals if on their most serious note until 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.270
 note that he can and he 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.250
 You can go beyond voice by jano ie 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.990
 falsetto the domain in your voice of 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.060
 head so that your voice is 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.070
 more acute to the point of reaching the 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.290
 A woman's vocal exactly the secret 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.900
 is there when man begins to dominate 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.180
 your head voice and start posting this 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.100
 head voice begins at falsetto cards 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.410
 and gives that voice feature 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.000
 the female begins to put more pressure and 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.910
 that's what his voice does not look like 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.950
 voice thin false voice voice forged in 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.170
 top natural voice you can see in the video 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.700
 bell and nic video when you or 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.680
 You swear they're not singing. 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.600
 with the falsetto the invitation head and yes that 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.190
 their natural voice precisely because of this 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.930
 because they mastered the technique so well 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.370
 also dominated this control of 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.680
 resonance they achieved in 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.110
 post and force theirs to appear 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.150
 a female team and then all the magic 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.000
 the whole attraction begins then summarizing 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.620
 everything is possible, yes a man with training 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.960
 knowing his voice with this to 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.850
 resonance meeting your grandmother 's head 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.460
 amplifying your voice, or with a 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.230
 Hard and hard work, he can. 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.360
 forge your voice to sound a tone of 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.060
 woman that woman if she does not have the voice 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.560
 serious she can not get her voice anymore 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.690
 to appear a team of one man because 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.850
 does not have serious falsetto for the woman but 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.380
 has sharp falsetto for man and so 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.480
 that this is also easier for 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.790
 men get if the bell and in the case 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.350
 they also dominated the technique 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.150
 that come and agree, it gets better 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.740
 That a lot of women singing this is 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.449
 nowadays nike has a channel on youtube 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.400
 where it can diverse 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.930
 covers with many versions have many 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.789
 versions of him also making the voice 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.680
 his male voice and the female voice 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:17.270
 those who have doubts to speak do not 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.249
 She is a woman who looks like a man is 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.749
 Enchanting pretending to omit I'll

 2016 river wheel 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.820
 In the case of Thai the bell the father said 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.650
 it is a mixture of the two 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.170
 nowadays he is more successful as 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.990
