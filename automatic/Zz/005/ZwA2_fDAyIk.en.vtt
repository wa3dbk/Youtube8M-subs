 meter that arrives lay then you hit 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.090
 October produces a more expensive one 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.410
 Espressos to go with Eek and his eye 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.420

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.649
 because now you can accept tab them 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.940
 you have to accept it and you have to 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:55.500
 further death there and yes you know it is 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.140
 it's crazy to say but sometimes 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.690
 some people meant to be and like this 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.520

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.100

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.740
 also then against FC Utrecht 2 times 9 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.049
 weeks of rehabilitation followed that state 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.880
 now waiting again but first one 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.380
 operation 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.180
 guarantee of success in the sense that the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.930
 boy would definitely know that your foot 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.780
 sits well 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.880

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.210

 thought the chance that will happen again 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.510
 decision to operate anyway 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.130
