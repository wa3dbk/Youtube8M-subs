00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.360 

well<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:10.140> guess<00:04:10.500> I'll<00:04:10.680> just<00:04:10.709> have<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:11.189> take

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
well I guess I'll just have to take

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.869 
well I guess I'll just have to take
along<00:04:13.310> no<00:04:14.310> choice

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
along no choice

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.890 
along no choice
I<00:04:14.909> used<00:04:15.510> my<00:04:15.659> potion<00:04:16.079> go<00:04:17.070> like<00:04:17.310> me<00:04:17.549> who<00:04:18.509> knows<00:04:18.720> if

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
I used my potion go like me who knows if

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.039 
I used my potion go like me who knows if
I<00:04:18.989> could<00:04:19.169> make<00:04:19.320> it<00:04:19.440> back<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:19.769> cosmos<00:04:20.160> all<00:04:20.370> alone

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
I could make it back to cosmos all alone

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.420 
I could make it back to cosmos all alone
but<00:04:22.049> as<00:04:22.169> long<00:04:22.380> as<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:22.650> have<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.889> friend<00:04:23.160> along

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
but as long as I have a friend along

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.350 
but as long as I have a friend along
I'll<00:04:23.759> be<00:04:24.449> okay<00:04:24.780> right

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
I'll be okay right

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.920

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.480 

so<00:04:42.000> no<00:04:42.569> matter<00:04:42.870> how<00:04:43.110> hard<00:04:43.440> we<00:04:43.590> fight<00:04:43.620> we<00:04:44.190> can't

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
so no matter how hard we fight we can't

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.460 
so no matter how hard we fight we can't
win<00:04:47.449> getting<00:04:48.449> these<00:04:48.569> crystals<00:04:49.020> sure<00:04:49.259> is<00:04:49.440> a

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
win getting these crystals sure is a

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.270 
win getting these crystals sure is a
pain<00:04:49.830> I<00:04:50.099> wish<00:04:50.699> they'd<00:04:50.910> just<00:04:50.940> show<00:04:51.300> up<00:04:51.479> already

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
pain I wish they'd just show up already

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.650 
pain I wish they'd just show up already
then<00:04:53.280> we<00:04:53.490> might<00:04:53.699> have<00:04:53.849> had<00:04:54.000> a<00:04:54.060> chance<00:04:54.360> at

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
then we might have had a chance at

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.089 
then we might have had a chance at
actually<00:04:54.810> ending<00:04:55.590> things<00:04:55.860> this<00:04:56.069> time<00:04:56.370> around

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
actually ending things this time around

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.089 
actually ending things this time around
don't<00:04:59.099> dwell<00:04:59.310> on<00:04:59.460> it<00:05:00.169> when<00:05:01.169> you<00:05:01.349> wake<00:05:01.590> you
