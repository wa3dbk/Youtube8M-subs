00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
cloud services on android right now

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.999 
cloud services on android right now
maybe<00:04:14.419> not<00:04:14.599> long<00:04:14.780> before<00:04:14.930> Google<00:04:15.560> Drive<00:04:15.769> tech

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.009

so if you turn the device then you get a

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.750 
so if you turn the device then you get a
multiple<00:04:20.150> view<00:04:20.389> you<00:04:20.599> so<00:04:20.779> you<00:04:20.840> can<00:04:21.219> on<00:04:22.219> one<00:04:22.460> side

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760

Murray and on the other side look at

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.320 
Murray and on the other side look at
your<00:04:32.610> SD<00:04:33.610> card<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:35.070> it<00:04:36.070> makes<00:04:36.250> life<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.150> whole

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
your SD card and it makes life a whole

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.460 
your SD card and it makes life a whole
lot<00:04:37.390> easier<00:04:37.860> when<00:04:38.860> transferring<00:04:39.670> files

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
lot easier when transferring files

that's<00:04:56.050> one<00:04:56.290> thing<00:04:56.320> that<00:04:56.560> root<00:04:57.310> explorer

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
that's one thing that root explorer

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.380 
that's one thing that root explorer
maybe<00:04:58.120> FX<00:04:58.630> don't<00:04:59.620> have<00:04:59.890> going<00:05:00.580> for<00:05:00.940> them<00:05:00.970> as

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
maybe FX don't have going for them as

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.450 
maybe FX don't have going for them as
much<00:05:01.930> as<00:05:02.200> solid<00:05:02.680> explorer<00:05:03.100> does<00:05:03.990> another<00:05:04.990> app

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
much as solid explorer does another app

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.890 
much as solid explorer does another app
that<00:05:06.460> I<00:05:06.490> like<00:05:06.850> to<00:05:07.030> have<00:05:07.270> on<00:05:08.230> hand<00:05:08.290> is<00:05:09.900> for

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
Diagnostics is system panel now we just

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.700 
Diagnostics is system panel now we just
saw<00:05:21.160> you<00:05:21.430> know<00:05:21.600> the<00:05:22.600> properties<00:05:22.960> of<00:05:23.080> what<00:05:23.560> was

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
saw you know the properties of what was

panel<00:05:26.740> gets<00:05:27.490> a<00:05:27.670> little<00:05:27.820> deeper<00:05:28.270> and<00:05:28.540> lets<00:05:29.440> you

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
panel gets a little deeper and lets you

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.860 
panel gets a little deeper and lets you
know<00:05:30.420> processors<00:05:32.760> what<00:05:33.760> your<00:05:33.910> cpu<00:05:34.270> activity

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
know processors what your cpu activity

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.550 
know processors what your cpu activity
is<00:05:35.110> as<00:05:35.830> you<00:05:36.490> can<00:05:36.670> see<00:05:36.970> it's<00:05:37.510> a<00:05:37.840> green<00:05:38.230> which

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
is as you can see it's a green which

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.650 
is as you can see it's a green which
means<00:05:38.590> that<00:05:39.220> on<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.910> first<00:05:40.060> court<00:05:40.420> and<00:05:40.540> then

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
means that on the first court and then

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.810
