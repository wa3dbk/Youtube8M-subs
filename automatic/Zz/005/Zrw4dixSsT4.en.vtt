 professional today's question 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.659
 we are sent by natalia castillo de espaÃ±a ' 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.339
 and it says well andrea i'm a makeup artist i made 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:43.780
 several courses and I do makeup 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:46.699
 the weekends a year ago 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.250
 this happened to me a few days ago 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.199
 They recommended a new client very 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.620
 excited I got ready to make up the 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.320
 but this person did not like my job 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.870
 I felt very frustrated because it's the 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.510
 first time that happens to me and especially 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.119
 I feel very embarrassed because this new 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.539
 client came by recommendation of a 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.640
 from my oldest clients good to 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:12.979
 natalia I'm sure that you mark very 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.929
 well in fact it tells me is that since 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.140
 a year they are making up and that 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:22.150
 recommend new clients and that's why 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.250
 I do not think you fail to make up 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.090
 I'm almost sure that you fail in two 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.980
 techniques and this happens to new 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.450
 make-up artists usually us 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.060
 It has happened to all of us when 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.730
 we started to make up and these techniques 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.310
 they are just about listening and 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.650
 observe makeup artists many times 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.350
 we go ahead and when we see a 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.140
 client we design quickly in our 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.330
 mind the ideal look and to demonstrate that 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.610
 We are professionals, we launch ourselves 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.940
 Make up without first making a small 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.979
 analysis of this client in question by 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.479
 that although makeup is very good and you 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.360
 feel confident about what you're doing 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.600
 or what is to be done is very 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.570
 important that you listen to your client that 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.300
 you observe that you ask him exactly 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.520
 what does makeup intend with how 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.730
 Make up habitually what you want 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.970
 convey what points of your face you want 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.760
 highlight asking does not take away 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.459
 professionalism just the opposite for 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.530
 that your client feels more confident and 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.660
 you will see that you really care about 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.170
