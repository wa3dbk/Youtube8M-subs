in your area to go ahead and and get
your<00:00:49.469> soil<00:00:49.770> tested<00:00:50.309> already<00:00:50.460> okay<00:00:51.270> there's

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
your soil tested already okay there's

your soil tested already okay there's
there's<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.860> lot<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.219> things<00:00:53.370> that

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
there's going to be a lot of things that

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.220 
there's going to be a lot of things that
you<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.940> do<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.360> approach<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.899> improve

you can do to the approach to improve

you can do to the approach to improve
the<00:00:55.410> soil<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.399> they're<00:00:56.550> going<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.820> hard<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the soil but they're going to be hard to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.500 
the soil but they're going to be hard to
do<00:00:57.480> after<00:00:58.379> something<00:00:58.620> happens<00:00:58.969> if<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.149> find

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
do after something happens if you find

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.709 
do after something happens if you find
out<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:00.960> example<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:02.399> know<00:01:02.550> your<00:01:03.390> soil

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
out for example that you know your soil

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.050 
out for example that you know your soil
just<00:01:04.080> needs<00:01:04.379> lime<00:01:04.739> really<00:01:05.100> bad<00:01:05.280> after

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
just needs lime really bad after

just needs lime really bad after
something<00:01:06.299> happens<00:01:06.450> there<00:01:06.960> isn't<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> lot<00:01:07.409> you

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
something happens there isn't a lot you

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.280 
something happens there isn't a lot you
can<00:01:07.830> do<00:01:08.040> set<00:01:08.430> perhaps<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.479> know<00:01:09.600> maybe<00:01:09.840> gut<00:01:10.140> an

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
shape the experience factor but also

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.050 
shape the experience factor but also
consider<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.590> time<00:01:46.890> involved<00:01:47.280> development

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
consider the time involved development

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.300 
consider the time involved development
time<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.420> what<00:01:48.570> i<00:01:48.600> call<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.079> take<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.250> example

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
time is what i call it take for example

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.330 
time is what i call it take for example
these<00:01:50.700> trees<00:01:51.090> right<00:01:51.329> here<00:01:51.360> okay<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:53.040> one

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
these trees right here okay you have one

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.600 
these trees right here okay you have one
free<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:54.450> been<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.930> ground<00:01:55.280> six<00:01:56.280> seven

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
free it's been in the ground six seven

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.789 
free it's been in the ground six seven
years<00:01:56.640> at<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.149> point<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.659> now<00:01:58.350> look<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.649> this

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
years at this point and now look at this

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.039 
years at this point and now look at this
smaller<00:01:59.130> tree<00:01:59.430> right<00:01:59.640> alongside<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.420> okay

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
smaller tree right alongside of it okay

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.749 
smaller tree right alongside of it okay
and<00:02:01.320> these<00:02:01.860> are<00:02:01.920> different<00:02:02.219> varieties<00:02:02.729> of

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
and these are different varieties of

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.969 
and these are different varieties of
trees<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.420> such<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.960> as<00:02:04.110> well<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
trees and such like that as well but the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.399 
trees and such like that as well but the
point<00:02:05.280> still<00:02:05.579> kind<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.390> drives<00:02:06.630> at<00:02:06.869> home<00:02:07.079> here

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
point still kind of drives at home here

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.010 
point still kind of drives at home here
while<00:02:07.560> I'm<00:02:07.649> standing<00:02:07.950> here<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:09.690> know<00:02:09.810> this

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
while I'm standing here is you know this

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.229 
while I'm standing here is you know this
this<00:02:10.770> tree<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.310> background<00:02:11.520> will<00:02:12.030> produce

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
this tree in the background will produce

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.030 
this tree in the background will produce
a<00:02:12.599> lot

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
a lot

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.309 
a lot
more<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:13.459> year<00:02:13.489> and<00:02:13.969> this<00:02:14.780> one<00:02:14.959> might<00:02:15.170> not

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
more this year and this one might not

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.839 
more this year and this one might not
even<00:02:15.469> produce<00:02:15.739> at<00:02:16.040> all<00:02:16.159> this<00:02:16.340> year<00:02:16.400> this<00:02:16.790> is

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
even produce at all this year this is

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.280 
even produce at all this year this is
one's<00:02:17.180> only<00:02:17.420> been<00:02:17.599> in<00:02:17.719> the<00:02:17.810> ground<00:02:17.959> about<00:02:18.170> a

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
one's only been in the ground about a

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.920 
one's only been in the ground about a
year<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.680> half<00:02:18.709> okay<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:20.359> there<00:02:20.659> is<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.780> lot

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
year and a half okay so there is a lot

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.839 
year and a half okay so there is a lot
of<00:02:21.079> development<00:02:21.799> time<00:02:22.040> needed<00:02:22.310> for<00:02:22.459> things

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
of development time needed for things

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.449 
of development time needed for things
like<00:02:22.969> pawns<00:02:23.439> okay<00:02:24.439> it<00:02:24.709> takes<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:25.040> couple<00:02:25.129> years

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
your fruit trees in there might be three

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.460 
your fruit trees in there might be three
to<00:02:35.269> five<00:02:35.450> years<00:02:35.689> before<00:02:36.049> you<00:02:36.140> really<00:02:36.439> start

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
to five years before you really start

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.490 
to five years before you really start
seeing<00:02:36.920> any<00:02:37.129> decent<00:02:37.549> production<00:02:38.260> soil<00:02:39.260> you

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
seeing any decent production soil you

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.199 
seeing any decent production soil you
can<00:02:39.530> do<00:02:39.799> a<00:02:39.829> lot<00:02:40.069> with<00:02:40.129> in<00:02:40.489> a<00:02:40.549> short<00:02:40.790> period<00:02:40.849> of

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
can do a lot with in a short period of

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.599 
can do a lot with in a short period of
time<00:02:41.269> however<00:02:41.799> some<00:02:42.799> of<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.010> stuff<00:02:43.250> like<00:02:43.459> if

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
time however some of the stuff like if

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:44.979 
time however some of the stuff like if
you<00:02:43.730> need<00:02:43.879> the<00:02:44.030> lime<00:02:44.299> or<00:02:44.599> if<00:02:44.659> you<00:02:44.750> need<00:02:44.900> to

change<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:46.159> acidity<00:02:46.609> of<00:02:46.700> your<00:02:47.299> soil<00:02:47.629> being<00:02:47.900> a

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
change the acidity of your soil being a

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.259 
change the acidity of your soil being a
you<00:02:48.530> add<00:02:48.769> sulfur<00:02:49.340> or<00:02:49.370> something<00:02:49.790> like<00:02:49.909> that<00:02:49.970> as

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
you add sulfur or something like that as

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.539 
you add sulfur or something like that as
well<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.659> that<00:02:51.169> does<00:02:51.470> take<00:02:51.739> some<00:02:51.950> time<00:02:52.310> to

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
well to that does take some time to

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.490 
well to that does take some time to
really<00:02:52.760> get<00:02:53.000> that<00:02:53.180> worked<00:02:53.450> into<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.900> soil<00:02:54.169> to

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
really get that worked into the soil to

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.159 
really get that worked into the soil to
to<00:02:55.430> change<00:02:55.700> some<00:02:55.939> of<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.150> stuff<00:02:56.419> and<00:02:56.689> of

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
to change some of that stuff and of

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.020 
to change some of that stuff and of
course<00:02:57.439> you<00:02:57.590> can't<00:02:57.829> just<00:02:58.069> go<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.430> throw<00:02:58.790> a

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
course you can't just go and throw a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.420 
course you can't just go and throw a
whole<00:02:59.569> bunch<00:02:59.780> of<00:02:59.989> you<00:03:00.799> know<00:03:00.829> chicken<00:03:01.310> manure

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
whole bunch of you know chicken manure

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.819 
whole bunch of you know chicken manure
or<00:03:01.760> something<00:03:02.120> like<00:03:02.269> that<00:03:02.329> on<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.409> soil<00:03:03.650> and

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
or something like that on the soil and

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.649 
or something like that on the soil and
start<00:03:04.099> growing<00:03:04.459> in<00:03:04.579> it<00:03:04.700> immediately<00:03:05.060> because

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
start growing in it immediately because

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.809 
start growing in it immediately because
it<00:03:05.840> will<00:03:05.930> burn<00:03:06.109> your<00:03:06.319> plants<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:07.400> again<00:03:07.669> this

know four or five pounds of carrots

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.600 
know four or five pounds of carrots
seeds<00:05:11.750> would<00:05:11.990> be<00:05:12.200> a<00:05:12.440> tremendous<00:05:12.950> amount<00:05:13.520> of

seeds would be a tremendous amount of

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.040 
seeds would be a tremendous amount of
carrot<00:05:13.910> so<00:05:14.060> again<00:05:14.210> it's<00:05:14.360> going<00:05:14.420> to<00:05:14.540> depend<00:05:14.690> on

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
carrot so again it's going to depend on

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.500 
carrot so again it's going to depend on
the<00:05:15.200> size<00:05:15.950> of<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.340> seed<00:05:16.580> and<00:05:16.610> such<00:05:16.940> as<00:05:17.120> well<00:05:17.300> to

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
the size of the seed and such as well to

for next year because think about it how
are<00:05:54.410> you<00:05:54.620> going<00:05:54.710> to<00:05:55.160> multiply<00:05:55.700> your<00:05:55.940> garden

are you going to multiply your garden
area<00:05:56.570> okay<00:05:57.350> if<00:05:57.560> you<00:05:57.770> only<00:05:57.950> have<00:05:58.220> a<00:05:58.250> little<00:05:58.490> bit

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
area okay if you only have a little bit

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.270 
area okay if you only have a little bit
of<00:05:58.700> seed<00:05:58.970> to<00:05:59.120> begin<00:05:59.390> with<00:05:59.600> your<00:06:00.290> first<00:06:00.650> your

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
of seed to begin with your first your

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.550 
of seed to begin with your first your
first<00:06:01.550> efforts<00:06:02.030> efforts<00:06:02.720> are<00:06:02.990> essentially

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
first efforts efforts are essentially

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.380 
first efforts efforts are essentially
going<00:06:03.710> to<00:06:03.800> be<00:06:03.920> to<00:06:04.160> produce<00:06:04.370> more<00:06:04.790> seed<00:06:05.060> first

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
going to be to produce more seed first

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.320 
going to be to produce more seed first

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
and foremost so you might have a very

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.080 
and foremost so you might have a very

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
small harvest that first year just

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.730 
small harvest that first year just
because<00:06:11.360> you're<00:06:11.510> trying<00:06:11.690> to<00:06:11.930> multiply<00:06:12.530> your
