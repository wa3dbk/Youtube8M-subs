an eleven fifty which is a kind of

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.050 
an eleven fifty which is a kind of
straight<00:00:26.730> eyed<00:00:27.380> Scud<00:00:28.380> nymph<00:00:28.980> type<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.880> powder

hook<00:00:31.189> it's<00:00:32.189> got<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> reverse<00:00:33.180> bend<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.350> it

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
hook it's got a reverse bend in it so it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.540 
hook it's got a reverse bend in it so it
makes<00:00:34.470> hooking<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.010> fish<00:00:35.220> a<00:00:35.310> little<00:00:35.340> bit

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
makes hooking the fish a little bit

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.950 
makes hooking the fish a little bit
easier<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.030> think<00:00:36.149> especially<00:00:36.539> when<00:00:36.899> you're

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
easier I think especially when you're

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.240 
easier I think especially when you're
fishing<00:00:37.199> under<00:00:37.530> cronic<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.129> we

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
fishing under cronic like we

fishing under cronic like we
traditionally<00:00:38.670> are<00:00:38.940> fishing<00:00:39.660> these<00:00:39.780> patterns

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640

the thread is going to go trim off our
tag<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.280> as<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.400> said<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.660> ice<00:01:07.230> cream

pattern<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.010> believe<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> key<00:01:08.940> to<00:01:08.970> success<00:01:09.600> for

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
pattern I believe the key to success for

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.690 
pattern I believe the key to success for
a<00:01:09.900> lot<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.110> these<00:01:10.290> mich<00:01:10.560> patterns<00:01:10.980> is<00:01:11.100> for<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
a lot of these mich patterns is for the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.900 
a lot of these mich patterns is for the
body<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.150> be<00:01:12.300> sparse<00:01:13.190> so<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.310> next<00:01:14.550> step<00:01:14.730> in

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
body to be sparse so the next step in

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.330 
body to be sparse so the next step in
this<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.450> we're<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> tie<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
this one is that we're going to tie in a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.870 
this one is that we're going to tie in a
very<00:01:17.970> small<00:01:18.420> clump<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.110> probably<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
very small clump this is probably a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.790 
very small clump this is probably a
quarter<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> size<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> normal<00:01:22.170> strand

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
quarter of the size of the normal strand

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.480 
quarter of the size of the normal strand
of<00:01:23.010> zeon<00:01:24.440> so<00:01:25.440> we've<00:01:25.680> got<00:01:25.860> about<00:01:25.980> about<00:01:26.460> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
of zeon so we've got about about a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.030 
of zeon so we've got about about a
quarter<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.300> particular<00:01:28.050> color<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.680> called

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
quarter this particular color is called

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.270 
quarter this particular color is called
olive<00:01:29.820> brown<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:31.200> we'll<00:01:31.350> even<00:01:31.590> up<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:31.920> ends

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
olive brown so we'll even up the ends

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.630 
olive brown so we'll even up the ends
with<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.580> scissors<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:34.040> like<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.190> moisten<00:01:35.460> it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
with the scissors I like to moisten it

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.180 
with the scissors I like to moisten it
with<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.060> little<00:01:36.180> bit<00:01:36.330> of<00:01:36.480> saliva<00:01:37.010> to<00:01:38.010> kind

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
with just a little bit of saliva to kind

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.640 
with just a little bit of saliva to kind
of<00:01:38.280> get<00:01:38.430> those<00:01:38.580> fibers<00:01:39.180> all<00:01:39.420> together<00:01:39.720> again

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
of get those fibers all together again

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.560 
of get those fibers all together again
we're<00:01:40.950> gonna<00:01:41.010> tie<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.550> with<00:01:41.760> as<00:01:41.910> little<00:01:42.180> wraps

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
we're gonna tie in with as little wraps

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.140 
we're gonna tie in with as little wraps
as<00:01:42.840> possible<00:01:43.440> so<00:01:43.590> maybe<00:01:43.800> just<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.340> wrapper<00:01:44.940> to

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
as possible so maybe just a wrapper to

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.200 
as possible so maybe just a wrapper to
to<00:01:45.420> lock<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.810> into<00:01:45.960> place<00:01:46.760> don't<00:01:47.760> need<00:01:48.000> very

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
to lock it into place don't need very

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.240 
to lock it into place don't need very
much<00:01:48.480> as<00:01:48.690> far<00:01:48.930> as<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.200> tails<00:01:49.440> go<00:01:49.770> it's<00:01:49.950> just

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
much as far as the tails go it's just

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.090 
much as far as the tails go it's just
kind<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.580> a<00:01:50.730> ornamental<00:01:51.450> thing<00:01:51.690> I<00:01:52.530> found<00:01:52.950> that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
kind of a ornamental thing I found that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.320 
kind of a ornamental thing I found that
it<00:01:53.370> tends<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.700> be<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.910> little<00:01:53.970> bit<00:01:54.180> more

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
it tends to be a little bit more

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.450 
it tends to be a little bit more
successful<00:01:54.780> if<00:01:55.050> it<00:01:55.140> has<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.620> tail<00:01:55.830> on<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.100> than

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
successful if it has the tail on it than

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.110 
successful if it has the tail on it than
if<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.730> doesn't<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:58.320> next<00:01:58.710> step<00:01:59.220> will<00:01:59.700> be<00:01:59.730> to

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
if it doesn't the next step will be to

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.820 
if it doesn't the next step will be to
tie<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:01.220> silver<00:02:02.220> wire<00:02:03.170> some<00:02:04.170> grassy<00:02:04.620> size

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
tie in silver wire some grassy size

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.010 
tie in silver wire some grassy size
silver<00:02:05.310> wire<00:02:05.490> I'm<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.420> cut<00:02:06.600> off<00:02:06.720> about

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
silver wire I'm going to cut off about

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.889 
silver wire I'm going to cut off about
two-and-a-half<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.770> three<00:02:07.980> inches<00:02:08.750> one<00:02:09.750> thing

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
two-and-a-half to three inches one thing

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.630 
two-and-a-half to three inches one thing
I<00:02:09.989> like<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.259> do<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.530> help<00:02:10.679> even<00:02:11.160> out<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.430> body

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
I like to do to help even out the body

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.230 
I like to do to help even out the body
on<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.030> particular<00:02:12.540> pattern

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
on this particular pattern

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.350 
on this particular pattern
is<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.840> tie<00:02:14.140> in<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.500> silver<00:02:15.070> wire<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.210> it

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
is to tie in the silver wire so that it

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.540 
is to tie in the silver wire so that it
goes<00:02:16.510> along<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.170> entire<00:02:17.470> top<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.370> hook

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
goes along the entire top of the hook

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.840 
goes along the entire top of the hook
shank<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.620> I'll<00:02:20.890> just<00:02:21.070> make<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.250> few<00:02:21.460> wraps<00:02:21.610> to

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
shank so I'll just make a few wraps to

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.750 
shank so I'll just make a few wraps to
kind<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.090> control<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.780> wire<00:02:23.080> itself<00:02:23.760> then

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
kind of control the wire itself then

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.300 
kind of control the wire itself then
after<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.450> we're<00:02:25.750> going<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.080> tie<00:02:26.320> in<00:02:26.590> Mitch

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
after that we're going to tie in Mitch

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.930 
after that we're going to tie in Mitch

color but the burgundy does a good job
of<00:03:02.740> kind<00:03:02.920> of<00:03:03.070> leaving<00:03:03.400> just<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.670> little<00:03:04.030> bit<00:03:04.150> of

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
that color behind without going

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.920 
that color behind without going
overboard<00:03:06.010> so<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:06.940> kind<00:03:07.270> of<00:03:07.330> fold<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.690> wire

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
overboard so I kind of fold that wire

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.560 
overboard so I kind of fold that wire
down<00:03:08.230> again<00:03:08.770> tie<00:03:09.100> in<00:03:09.310> with<00:03:09.700> as<00:03:09.850> few<00:03:10.120> thread

down again tie in with as few thread

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.960 
down again tie in with as few thread
wraps<00:03:10.840> as<00:03:11.110> possible<00:03:11.650> so<00:03:12.490> we<00:03:12.610> have<00:03:12.790> the

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
wraps as possible so we have the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.480 
wraps as possible so we have the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
even again trying not to build up very

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.010 
even again trying not to build up very
much<00:03:20.410> bulk<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.520> use<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:21.910> top<00:03:22.210> thread<00:03:22.540> on<00:03:22.780> this

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
much bulk and use a top thread on this

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.290 
much bulk and use a top thread on this
pattern<00:03:23.410> too<00:03:23.730> some<00:03:24.730> people<00:03:24.760> find<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.150> it

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
pattern too some people find that it

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.540 
pattern too some people find that it
builds<00:03:25.540> up<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.690> little<00:03:25.840> bit<00:03:25.990> less<00:03:26.830> bulk<00:03:27.130> but<00:03:27.370> I

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
builds up a little bit less bulk but I

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.860 
builds up a little bit less bulk but I
don't<00:03:27.820> think<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.060> makes<00:03:28.180> too<00:03:28.450> much<00:03:28.600> of<00:03:28.780> a

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
don't think it makes too much of a

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.870 
don't think it makes too much of a
difference<00:03:29.230> just<00:03:29.470> within<00:03:30.100> reason<00:03:30.580> you<00:03:30.790> know

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880

you want you want to keep the body slim

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.740 
you want you want to keep the body slim
we're<00:03:33.250> going<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.430> take<00:03:33.550> that<00:03:33.760> that<00:03:34.090> burgundy

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
we're going to take that that burgundy

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.690 
we're going to take that that burgundy
mid<00:03:34.990> body<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.710> we're<00:03:35.860> gonna<00:03:35.950> wrap<00:03:36.610> forward

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
mid body and we're gonna wrap forward

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.320 
mid body and we're gonna wrap forward
nice<00:03:39.700> even<00:03:40.120> wraps<00:03:40.330> one<00:03:41.140> next<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.650> last<00:03:42.330> all

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
nice even wraps one next to the last all

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.030 
nice even wraps one next to the last all
the<00:03:43.390> way<00:03:43.720> up<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.990> hook<00:03:44.140> shank<00:03:44.380> over<00:03:44.770> the<00:03:44.860> top

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
the way up the hook shank over the top

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.690 
the way up the hook shank over the top
of<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.250> coated<00:03:45.550> wire<00:03:45.730> thread<00:03:46.180> coated<00:03:46.480> wire

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.059 

this<00:03:51.450> pattern<00:03:51.840> also<00:03:52.140> works<00:03:52.560> really<00:03:52.680> well

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
this pattern also works really well

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.220 
this pattern also works really well
again<00:03:53.400> in<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.640> high<00:03:53.760> lakes<00:03:54.060> here<00:03:54.300> in<00:03:54.420> Oregon

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.390 

especially<00:03:58.230> when<00:03:58.410> you're<00:03:58.530> seeing<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:59.040> Apple

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
especially when you're seeing the Apple

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.210 
especially when you're seeing the Apple
bugs<00:03:59.700> buzzing<00:04:00.060> around<00:04:00.739> you<00:04:01.739> will<00:04:01.980> get

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
bugs buzzing around you will get

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.430 
bugs buzzing around you will get
preferential<00:04:02.730> sometimes<00:04:03.420> you<00:04:03.989> might<00:04:04.140> end<00:04:04.349> up

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
preferential sometimes you might end up

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.140 
preferential sometimes you might end up
fishing<00:04:04.800> this<00:04:04.950> one<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.220> little<00:04:05.519> bit<00:04:05.640> higher<00:04:05.879> in

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
fishing this one a little bit higher in

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.930 
fishing this one a little bit higher in
the<00:04:06.269> water<00:04:06.420> cone<00:04:07.190> under<00:04:08.190> an<00:04:08.280> indicator<00:04:08.700> is

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
the water cone under an indicator is

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.089 
the water cone under an indicator is
great<00:04:09.209> this<00:04:09.450> one<00:04:09.660> also<00:04:09.900> can<00:04:10.319> be<00:04:10.470> stripped<00:04:10.890> out

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
great this one also can be stripped out

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.680 
great this one also can be stripped out
of<00:04:11.250> deeper<00:04:11.610> water<00:04:11.849> and<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.090> lot<00:04:12.209> of<00:04:12.269> times<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
of deeper water and a lot of times the

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.449 
of deeper water and a lot of times the
fish<00:04:12.930> will<00:04:13.140> follow<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:13.680> clear<00:04:13.950> run<00:04:14.099> up<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.370> the

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
fish will follow it clear run up to the

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.400 
fish will follow it clear run up to the
surface<00:04:14.700> just<00:04:15.330> like<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.660> natural<00:04:15.840> would<00:04:16.260> be

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
surface just like the natural would be

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.199 
surface just like the natural would be
getting<00:04:17.040> buoyed<00:04:17.340> up<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.639> the<00:04:17.760> top<00:04:17.940> by<00:04:18.150> the

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
getting buoyed up to the top by the

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.479 
getting buoyed up to the top by the
gases<00:04:18.450> trapped<00:04:18.930> inside<00:04:19.139> of<00:04:19.440> their<00:04:19.530> skin<00:04:19.859> so<00:04:20.430> we

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
gases trapped inside of their skin so we

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.870 
gases trapped inside of their skin so we
can<00:04:20.609> advance<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:21.150> burgandy<00:04:22.010> Mitch<00:04:23.010> body<00:04:23.310> I'm

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
can advance the burgandy Mitch body I'm

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.170 
can advance the burgandy Mitch body I'm
going<00:04:24.030> to<00:04:24.090> take<00:04:24.180> our<00:04:24.360> silver<00:04:24.870> wrap<00:04:25.620> of<00:04:26.610> wire

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
going to take our silver wrap of wire

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.620 
going to take our silver wrap of wire
we're<00:04:27.870> gonna<00:04:27.960> counter<00:04:28.500> rib<00:04:28.820> over<00:04:29.820> the<00:04:30.240> top<00:04:30.419> of

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
we're gonna counter rib over the top of

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.980 
we're gonna counter rib over the top of
it<00:04:30.919> this<00:04:31.919> is<00:04:32.250> kind<00:04:32.550> of<00:04:32.639> imitating<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.270> gases

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
it this is kind of imitating the gases

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.810 
it this is kind of imitating the gases
like<00:04:34.139> I<00:04:34.229> was<00:04:34.350> just<00:04:34.500> talking<00:04:34.830> about<00:04:34.919> of<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.610> of

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
like I was just talking about of the of

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.850 
like I was just talking about of the of
the<00:04:36.090> natural<00:04:36.570> at<00:04:36.720> as<00:04:36.930> it's<00:04:37.169> carted<00:04:37.560> up<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.770> the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
the natural at as it's carted up to the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.990 
the natural at as it's carted up to the
surface<00:04:38.180> in<00:04:39.180> its<00:04:39.389> hatching<00:04:39.780> process<00:04:41.000> again

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
surface in its hatching process again

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.650 
surface in its hatching process again
keeping<00:04:42.450> this<00:04:42.600> you<00:04:42.990> know<00:04:43.080> even<00:04:43.500> as<00:04:43.590> possible

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
keeping this you know even as possible

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.520 
keeping this you know even as possible
want<00:04:45.660> very<00:04:45.960> little<00:04:46.050> buildup<00:04:48.229> I'll<00:04:49.229> get<00:04:49.380> that

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
want very little buildup I'll get that

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.790 
want very little buildup I'll get that
wire<00:04:49.740> nice<00:04:49.979> and<00:04:50.190> smooth<00:04:50.430> down<00:04:51.020> so<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.139> final

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
wire nice and smooth down so the final

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.360 
wire nice and smooth down so the final
steps<00:04:53.190> are<00:04:53.639> going<00:04:54.000> to<00:04:54.120> be<00:04:56.750> here<00:04:57.750> it<00:04:57.840> is<00:04:57.900> is<00:04:58.860> it's

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
steps are going to be here it is is it's

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.390 
steps are going to be here it is is it's
a<00:04:59.460> cream-colored<00:04:59.789> Z<00:05:00.600> lawn<00:05:00.950> like<00:05:01.950> this<00:05:02.190> one<00:05:02.370> a

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
a cream-colored Z lawn like this one a

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.830 
a cream-colored Z lawn like this one a
little<00:05:02.580> bit<00:05:02.729> better<00:05:02.970> than<00:05:03.270> white<00:05:03.510> you<00:05:03.720> could

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
little bit better than white you could

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.480 
little bit better than white you could
also<00:05:04.050> use<00:05:04.440> material<00:05:05.010> like<00:05:05.160> Swiss<00:05:05.580> straw<00:05:05.910> or

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
also use material like Swiss straw or

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.600 
also use material like Swiss straw or
you<00:05:08.490> know<00:05:09.380> zing<00:05:10.380> wing<00:05:10.650> or<00:05:11.010> clear<00:05:11.340> wing

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
you know zing wing or clear wing

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.370 
you know zing wing or clear wing
medallion<00:05:12.180> sheeting<00:05:12.539> whatever<00:05:12.840> you<00:05:12.990> want<00:05:13.200> to

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
medallion sheeting whatever you want to

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.800 
medallion sheeting whatever you want to
I<00:05:13.740> like<00:05:13.830> a<00:05:14.070> little<00:05:14.370> bit<00:05:14.639> of<00:05:14.820> an<00:05:14.940> off<00:05:15.120> color<00:05:15.450> off

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
I like a little bit of an off color off

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.010 
I like a little bit of an off color off
of<00:05:16.050> white<00:05:16.260> just<00:05:16.620> a<00:05:16.740> little<00:05:16.979> less<00:05:17.160> bright

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
of white just a little less bright

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.879 
of white just a little less bright
sometimes<00:05:19.020> that<00:05:19.229> that<00:05:19.530> makes<00:05:19.740> a<00:05:19.860> difference

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
sometimes that that makes a difference

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.909 
sometimes that that makes a difference
so<00:05:20.880> again<00:05:21.120> we're<00:05:21.300> using<00:05:21.330> probably<00:05:22.289> a<00:05:22.320> quarter

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
so again we're using probably a quarter

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.340 
so again we're using probably a quarter
of<00:05:23.130> what<00:05:23.310> a<00:05:23.340> normal<00:05:23.639> Z<00:05:24.270> Wan<00:05:24.450> strand<00:05:24.930> would<00:05:25.139> be

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
of what a normal Z Wan strand would be

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.670 
of what a normal Z Wan strand would be
we're<00:05:26.340> going<00:05:26.430> to<00:05:26.490> tie<00:05:26.669> that<00:05:26.700> on<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.240> underside

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
we're going to tie that on the underside

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.270 
we're going to tie that on the underside
so<00:05:28.680> towards<00:05:29.160> the<00:05:29.340> hook<00:05:29.580> point<00:05:30.919> again<00:05:31.919> we<00:05:32.039> want

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
so towards the hook point again we want

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.370 
so towards the hook point again we want
to<00:05:32.370> tie<00:05:32.580> that<00:05:32.610> in<00:05:33.000> there<00:05:33.150> this<00:05:33.389> few<00:05:33.690> wraps<00:05:34.080> as

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
to tie that in there this few wraps as

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.779 
to tie that in there this few wraps as
possible<00:05:34.979> if<00:05:35.039> you<00:05:35.099> can<00:05:37.250> trap<00:05:38.250> it<00:05:38.280> with<00:05:38.550> kind<00:05:38.729> of

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
possible if you can trap it with kind of

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:43.659 
possible if you can trap it with kind of
a<00:05:38.849> loose<00:05:39.030> wrap<00:05:39.300> there<00:05:40.070> this<00:05:41.070> material<00:05:41.639> then<00:05:41.820> is

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
a loose wrap there this material then is

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.810 
a loose wrap there this material then is
in<00:05:44.669> place<00:05:45.030> with<00:05:45.330> a<00:05:45.360> thread<00:05:46.340> don't<00:05:47.340> want<00:05:47.580> much

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
in place with a thread don't want much

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.629 
in place with a thread don't want much
we<00:05:48.090> want<00:05:48.300> kind<00:05:48.510> of<00:05:48.570> the<00:05:48.690> illusion<00:05:49.050> of<00:05:49.440> a<00:05:50.099> wig

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
we want kind of the illusion of a wig

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.029 
we want kind of the illusion of a wig
wing<00:05:51.120> segment<00:05:51.690> sticking<00:05:52.080> out<00:05:52.229> so<00:05:52.530> we'll<00:05:52.770> kind

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
wing segment sticking out so we'll kind

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:56.659 
wing segment sticking out so we'll kind
of<00:05:53.190> just<00:05:54.200> trim<00:05:55.200> that<00:05:55.380> relatively<00:05:56.099> short<00:05:56.460> right

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
of just trim that relatively short right

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.780 
of just trim that relatively short right
there<00:05:57.200> got<00:05:58.200> a<00:05:58.229> nice<00:05:58.440> little<00:05:58.650> outline

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
there got a nice little outline

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.030 
there got a nice little outline
again<00:06:01.150> you<00:06:01.540> know<00:06:01.630> I'm<00:06:01.810> a<00:06:01.840> big<00:06:02.110> fan<00:06:02.350> of<00:06:02.380> dubbing

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
again you know I'm a big fan of dubbing

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.480 
again you know I'm a big fan of dubbing
versus<00:06:03.640> peacock<00:06:04.390> herl<00:06:04.660> in<00:06:04.930> general<00:06:05.410> I<00:06:05.620> find

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
versus peacock herl in general I find

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.880 
versus peacock herl in general I find
that<00:06:06.640> it's<00:06:06.820> just<00:06:07.180> tends<00:06:07.600> to<00:06:07.720> hold<00:06:08.500> up<00:06:08.710> better

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
that it's just tends to hold up better

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.730 
that it's just tends to hold up better
after<00:06:09.820> repeated<00:06:10.270> fish<00:06:10.510> same<00:06:11.230> thing<00:06:11.440> with<00:06:11.590> the
