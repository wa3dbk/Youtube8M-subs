00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.139
 Procedure well zone tea 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.099
 I want to talk about what to do to study better this time 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.119
 I think 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.020
 I would like to learn how well I think I have everyone 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.010
 Filer in a short time 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:29.320
 The do's just it still is so wholesaler think that thought to Fu it 's such a wish raised is 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:33.130
 Often they say not to study a long time and still results not unloaded does not rise 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.390
 The say why the capacity of the p guy on many Te is stomach 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:40.010
 In such a short time, it seems that I don't study so much and I'm improving my grades 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:44.719
 When the say so and built Ah this person shop 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.160
 I think I'm thinking I'm old, but in fact I know Kunitaka to some extent 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:53.000
 If it drops 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:54.199
 It is absolutely impossible for anyone to study . This time, I will introduce three actions to study well. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.030
 I would like 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.329
 First of all, it's important to do what you need to do to win 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.129
 I will 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.700
 I'm want to think that you say what should be such a selfish do in order to pass 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.780
 This is the purpose of your study. 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.960
 Then let's do what we need to do to achieve this goal 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.320
 Thing is do a thing Tteyuu let ceased say not done in 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:25.479
 For example, if you want to be a macho man of muscle morimori 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:30.430
 This and focus example should do if you and I want to be a Fu say there car biceps 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:34.479
 This is important Toka I'll do'm I doing Toka gonna do dumbbell this is 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:40.060
 How much, for example, you can't become green tea when you sit down 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.340
 In short, if you have a purpose for something like this, you will be able to achieve that purpose 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.759
 Let's go 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.750
 What is however one place I'm a thing Tteyuu 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:53.450
 It sounds natural but there are many people who are not doing the exam 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:02:00.330
 To not enter mathematics have aspiring why humanities shifting University Datte like a sound are struggling in mathematics 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:05.400
 The subjects covered in English, national language, and society are those who want to receive a literary private university for the purpose of passing body 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:11.730
 I do not need one to know that do not fit mathematics without but it is okay do it prison When was 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:13.410
 Even though I am doing a lot 8 the first step to study well 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.410
 If you say something 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:21.150
 I will not do what I do without doing what I need to do 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.140
 This is important. I understand that I should do it. 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.860
 That's a story 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:31.190
 As the second method, it is important to study this center 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:37.360
 Chestnut and English word test coral 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.360
 This is an English word like this 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.850
 Correct answer crazy 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.220
 Properly found Tane Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey was found Les Natick 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.290
 I understand that I understand 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:59.740
 And say what kind of thing or at the center opens in it I was memorization center 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.040
 The plan will be absolute power will be absolute power 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:07.450
 Even though I've read, for example, the British second long sentence 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.470
 It does not become a child that might be made but it is do subtle me well or what happened to the force 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.210
 I may not 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.300
 However, I memorize it and read English long sentences, for example 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:19.400
 I remembered that there was a word I did not understand 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.570
 If it shakes like a wind, it will progress to the state that it is light from the state that it does not understand 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.600
 That's why 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:29.660
 I will grow exactly as I learned 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:31.230
 On the other hand, I think that it will be said that the study of exercise-centered after being opposed to the orthographically- centered 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.540
 Exercise-based study 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:41.909
 That's what I did, but I don't know if I can do it. 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:45.510
 It's Tteyuu exercise was remembered So is the technology Tteyuu was used in the following that you have to remember even now 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:51.220
 The editors don't have that much power as long as they don't blow up 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:56.250
 Certainly the practice is important but if you do it in the memory center as the first step 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:04:00.240
 Let's move on to the exercises when I think it's already gone 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:04.200
 And you're the third one and don't cheat as the third one 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:09.000
 This is important. It means that you can not get an affair 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:15.810
 Well what kind of celebrities say that cheating is like culture but 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.269
 The reference game to students Toka high school junior high school students is common do what I do word book payment book and tree 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.030
 Ne 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:25.840
 I 'll split a little different key but often change the reporter rigid 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:31.659
 I often Colo Colo changed Rutte thing an affair word book 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.409
 So who is the one who is pleased with this ? It is only the publisher, but the publisher is unprofitable, so it makes money 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:36.260
 but 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:41.660
 Of course student 64 that Iga publishes publisher Iga 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:45.200
 Reference book Nde no sense to study how much it is is not it so Tara Kicha' 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:52.340
 First of all, it's important to put in a decisive decision 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:56.249
 I bought an issue collection, and if I bought that issue collection, the issue collection on which page every question is sure to answer 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:05:02.069
 To revenue for the first time following problems from the state Tteyuu put out 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:04.320
 Which words even when I remember to ensure 3 it was introduced directly below the word book which page 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:07.770
 Word book frog I is large from 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.800
 It is the land I'd say because I passed the myself Kyoto University 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:16.500
 I because it is the word a little printing required in order to pass brothers 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:21.360
 Field called another English word if there is a word book Kinsatsu Purafumaji form and past questions for the land is ok 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:24.340
 It's right also English law for the time being one book seems roughly also other subjects 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:30.940
 I will never do my cheating 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:34.300
 As it is important, please carry out 1 volume by all means by all means, and study 8 well this time by saying yes 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:38.199
 Talked about what to do to do 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:44.330
 Do not do what you need to do first 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:49.009
 It means that this preparation is necessary and, as the second , study of the memory center of gravity surely 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:51.889
 It is important to give a result It is more like a practice prism when doing this Yasumiya 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:56.509
 I mean but I do not cheat 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:59.810
 If I bought one, I went to squeeze the bone marrow completely. 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:03.229
 Let's try to hit other reference books for the first time 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.320
 This time more than this video Thank you for watching 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:09.900
 That's-well 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:14.759
 I talked about other videos, but if it was a class in this school, I would not like Tomishima 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:18.960
 There are people who do things like going to work inside the class at school 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:24.449
 So I think it's so good that I think it is good 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:26.729
 It 's not a wise way If you want to work within a math class, for now 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:29.889
 You keep on top of the math notebook desk 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:33.249
 Take English words into that note at 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:36.819
 The Tarou club is standing and watching it sizzlingly 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:40.389
 Such a technique to pretend listening to a fixed amount of classes 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:45.490
 I think Fu that the kana to some extent important thing for Tteyuu craftiness 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:49.880
 Well, the teacher of the school is also a job as a teacher, so it is a human being who is eating rice 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:53.330
 I can not pay my heart if I find an inside job , so I'm accelerating to some extent 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:58.850
 It seems like it is important to use a woven cloth that is not smart 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:07:01.610
 8 It will be the last time, but the most pleasant thing for me 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:05.270
 Things are the reaction of the audience, is n't it? 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.260
 If you comment on the comment section below because anything good or bad is fine 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.900
