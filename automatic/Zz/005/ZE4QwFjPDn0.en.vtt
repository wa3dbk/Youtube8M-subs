00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.970
 welcome all subscribers to the channel here 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.340
 Fant with you you are rude today from me 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.700
 find out all available at the moment 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.769
 information on German friday she is 10 for 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.990
 Help say that this car was for 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.320
 models on and announced at the same time 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.660
 and E25 but for some reason first came out e 25 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.000
 ten years already a very long time no and not 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.250
 naturally, the players are waiting and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.140
 want this car to appear but to 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.330
 Unfortunately, our developers for some reason 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.669
 not yet decided to enter this 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.440
 car by the way is very sad because 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.510
 really this car was firstly 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.670
 historically secondly the developers because 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.680
 model or and announced and thirdly 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.079
 she would just fit smartly into our 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.969
 the game but in the light of recent events it became 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.129
 it is clear why the developers so far 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.200
 refuses this car the whole thing 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.660
 that our e-10 has a unique system 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.430
 hydraulic suspension which can 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.350
 was to regulate the position of leading 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.449
 Rollers or lower them down or 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.399
 raises to reduce visibility 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.989
 Tank naturally in our game such 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.090
 it is simply unrealistic to implement a feature 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.400
 so the developers are so far just 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.680
 put off and 10 most likely when she 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.659
 this feature will not end up 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.479
 it turns out that we will see a simple buckle 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.700
 roughly level 4 without any 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.759
 unique feature but nonetheless it 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.560
 the car will still be very similar to the e25 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.299
 And precisely because of this very many 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.689
 like to start I want to give 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.570
 a little attention to the history of creation and 10 a 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.759
 then already and tth all branches a circle given 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.310
 the car was planned as a light tank 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.320
 and within 10 tons but so 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.900
 It happened that large tank construction 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.479
 firms like daimler grits bmm and not 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.430
 were able to submit a project and 10 delivered 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.560
 creation took such a company as a shred 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.509
 Upstairs ambala birds which until this not 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.460
 made a single tank in the end 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.799
 it turned out that the project is a bit gone 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.259
 from the concept of light tank and turned 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.180
 very similar self-propelled hedger but with 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.250
 with its unique changes and 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.200
 improvements and unfortunately even this 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.030
 project and it turned out very interesting 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.130
 quite unique from him anyway 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.350
 refused precisely because of the fact that the lung 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.240
 the tank failed another self-propelled gun 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.270
 it was not necessary and in addition to that 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.340
 moment already existed panda ligiyu 38 d 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.890
 which was based on the Czech 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.980
 tanks 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.470
 TV 38 for which the car was much simpler and 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.360
 much cheaper to produce than 10 k 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.459
 Fortunately, our developers were able to 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.230
 pass by this project 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.390
 however this game is in the game 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.430
 Sooner or later it will appear therefore 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.470
 be aware let's consider her tth 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.350
 I'll say right away that this car can 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.540
 either fit level 4 or level 5 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.910
 there is already decided by the developers but personally I 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.310
 I think that the best place for and 10 is 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.590
 It is the fourth level and not because of 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.810
 the fact that there is a bad booking or else 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.300
 something namely because of the fact that the gun 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.540
 we are exactly the same as Fedor in the top 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.730
 75 millimeters cap 39 then for 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.800
 level five rather weak but 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.540
 on the fourth is just perfect but if 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.640
 touch the speakers then the machine is here 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.280
 wins in all fronts because we 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.459
 It turns out at 16 tons of their weight the engine 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.380
 either 350 horsepower or 400 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.570
 as in the case gives just 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.890
 smartest performance dynamics on 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.110
 wake up to maximum speed 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.420
 reaches about 70 kilometers per hour 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.110
 that is, and 10 will just fly by 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.970
 bones 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.010
 Well, in addition to all this machine 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.660
 small enough because of what is on it 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.640
 it will be possible to stand in the bushes and not 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.860
 glow clear that the class 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.750
 signed such a thing as booking 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.970
 no peculiar but still have 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.220
 our 10 still have something to be proud of and 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.920
 Tobago I item reaches 60 millimeters 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.530
 while there will be a good degree of slope and 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.239
 why vld can still tank someone 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.459
 but all other details do not exceed 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.110
 20 millimeter bar so it's all the same 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.180
 you should not hope for booking 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.640
 In addition, I will say that as a trainer for 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.440
 your crew and 10 site will not be able to 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.360
 precisely because it consists here of everything 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.850
 just out of three people on this major 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.840
 tactical and technical characteristics and 10 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.220
 is ending 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.200
 so I would like to say that 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.750
 be sure to like the video 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.970
 feature you want vidosik go 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.310
 thank you all for watching hope you 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.630
 it was interesting and with you was hamish not 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.549
