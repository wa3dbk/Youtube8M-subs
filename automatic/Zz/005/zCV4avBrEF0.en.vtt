opinion we're putting in a legit amount

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.550 
opinion we're putting in a legit amount
of<00:00:29.429> effort<00:00:29.550> yeah<00:00:30.000> um<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.960> turned<00:00:31.349> out<00:00:31.500> that

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
of effort yeah um it turned out that

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.700 
of effort yeah um it turned out that
that<00:00:31.859> was<00:00:32.189> an<00:00:32.369> injustice<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.239> sauce<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.079> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that was an injustice the sauce and and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.280 
that was an injustice the sauce and and
slowly<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.610> layers<00:00:35.910> have<00:00:36.270> been<00:00:36.510> peeled<00:00:36.899> back

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
slowly the layers have been peeled back

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.060 
slowly the layers have been peeled back
yeah<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:39.450> find<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.260> incredibly

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
yeah and I just find it incredibly

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.369 
yeah and I just find it incredibly
despicable<00:00:41.850> now<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.239> think<00:00:42.629> part<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.200> thing

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
despicable now I think part of the thing

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.220 
despicable now I think part of the thing
the<00:00:43.950> biggest<00:00:44.129> factor<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:45.149> makes<00:00:45.420> me<00:00:45.660> hate<00:00:46.020> it

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the biggest factor that makes me hate it

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.479 
the biggest factor that makes me hate it
is<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.800> volume<00:00:47.219> okay<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:48.629> feels<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:49.489> every

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
is the volume okay it feels like every

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.389 
is the volume okay it feels like every
single<00:00:51.059> bigger<00:00:51.600> youtuber<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.530> publishing<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
single bigger youtuber is publishing a

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.889 
single bigger youtuber is publishing a
book<00:00:53.430> yeah<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.360> me<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.690> doesn't

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
book yeah and that to me just doesn't

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.799 
book yeah and that to me just doesn't
equate<00:00:55.399> quality<00:00:56.399> with<00:00:56.579> quantity<00:00:57.210> okay<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
equate quality with quantity okay the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.740 
equate quality with quantity okay the
balance<00:00:58.289> seems<00:00:58.620> off<00:00:59.000> sounding<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.030> all<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
balance seems off sounding like all the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.630 
balance seems off sounding like all the
way<00:01:00.899> up<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.079> they<00:01:01.410> can't<00:01:01.770> possibly<00:01:02.039> be<00:01:02.609> that

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
way up like they can't possibly be that

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.539 
way up like they can't possibly be that
many<00:01:03.170> books<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.470> need<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.040> published

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
many books that need to be published

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.200 
many books that need to be published
from<00:01:05.790> bigger<00:01:06.000> youtubers<00:01:06.270> yeah<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.500> are<00:01:07.680> also

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
from bigger youtubers yeah that are also

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.390 
from bigger youtubers yeah that are also
not<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:10.020> money<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.799> think<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.100> just

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
not for just money do you think I just

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.609 
not for just money do you think I just
think<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.729> as<00:01:11.790> celebrity<00:01:12.450> which<00:01:13.170> referees

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
think of it as celebrity which referees

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.899 
think of it as celebrity which referees
are<00:01:13.710> lots<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.010> cases<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.430> mean<00:01:14.580> there<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:14.790> some

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
are lots of cases I mean there are some

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.940 
are lots of cases I mean there are some
exceptions<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.630> think<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.140> Anna<00:01:16.710> hearts

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
exceptions that I think like Anna hearts

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.980 
exceptions that I think like Anna hearts
book<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.549> looks<00:01:17.880> exactly<00:01:18.030> yeah<00:01:18.659> that's<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
book it looks exactly yeah that's the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.270 
book it looks exactly yeah that's the
thing<00:01:19.020> there<00:01:19.320> are<00:01:19.409> definitely<00:01:19.770> exceptions

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
thing there are definitely exceptions

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.429 
thing there are definitely exceptions
yeah<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> think<00:01:21.060> they<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.240> him<00:01:21.540> with<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
yeah but I think they get him with the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.100 
yeah but I think they get him with the
volume<00:01:22.950> yeah<00:01:23.220> its<00:01:23.400> sheer<00:01:23.610> volume<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.689> think

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
volume yeah its sheer volume and I think

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.109 
volume yeah its sheer volume and I think

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
will say we'll say it nicely a suti to

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.780 
will say we'll say it nicely a suti to
think<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.810> your<00:02:04.380> life<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.829> already<00:02:05.340> so

worthy<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.570> I'm<00:02:06.689> not<00:02:06.840> saying<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.079> these

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229

worthy and I'm not saying that these
people<00:02:07.380> have<00:02:07.680> not<00:02:07.860> accomplished<00:02:08.399> things

people have not accomplished things

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.430 
people have not accomplished things
because<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.119> think<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.599> everybody<00:02:10.110> has

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
because I think that everybody has

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.240 
because I think that everybody has
accomplished<00:02:10.979> 12<00:02:11.430> year<00:02:11.640> olds<00:02:11.849> yeah

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
accomplished 12 year olds yeah

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.670 
accomplished 12 year olds yeah
seen<00:02:12.490> 30<00:02:13.000> 40<00:02:13.480> like<00:02:13.750> any<00:02:13.960> age<00:02:14.230> who<00:02:14.260> have

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680

accomplished interesting and powerful

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.210 
accomplished interesting and powerful
things<00:02:16.810> but<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.260> think<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.770> something<00:02:18.100> is

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
things but I think that something is

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.610 
things but I think that something is
taken<00:02:18.520> away<00:02:18.610> from<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:19.090> it's<00:02:19.270> already<00:02:19.870> at<00:02:20.140> 25

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
taken away from it it's already at 25

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.220 
taken away from it it's already at 25
you<00:02:20.860> think<00:02:21.130> oh<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.180> publishable<00:02:22.780> yeah<00:02:23.200> i

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
also just depends what the tone of it is

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.540 
also just depends what the tone of it is
I<00:02:25.420> was<00:02:26.110> like<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.320> again<00:02:27.070> it<00:02:27.190> comes<00:02:27.310> back<00:02:27.430> to

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
celebrating that right what they're

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.900

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
celebrating is like this it's very

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.640 
celebrating is like this it's very
traditional<00:04:17.720> way<00:04:17.870> of<00:04:17.900> talking<00:04:18.410> about

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650
