00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
My main goal right now is the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If you are aiming for the Olympics, then obviously you have to compete at the World Championships every year...

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
...and I believe these World Championships will serve as great preparation for the Olympics.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Trying hard to give mistake-free performances every year will prepare me for the Olympics.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The desire to compete in Rio de Janeiro and win gold in the team event is a strong source of motivation for me right now.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
If I can, then I would like to carry on, but first we'll have to see after Rio.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.500
If I can keep myself relatively free of injuries every year...

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.500
...then perhaps a path will open up for me to compete (in Tokyo as well).

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Japan had the big earthquake in 2011, and recovering from that earthquake...

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
...is one of the major themes surrounding Tokyo 2020.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I think the Olympics will be a good opportunity to bring strength to the people of the Tohoku Region...

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
...and also to show everyone around the world that Japan is doing fine again.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I think that these are messages we have to convey through the power of sport.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Lots of different sports will be taking place in Japan at the same time...

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
...so we cannot expect that gymnastics alone will attract all the popularity.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000
That said, if we achieve good results, then I believe gymnastics too can become a very popular sport in Japan.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It is a pretty difficult sport to understand, but if we can show it to the public in a simple way...

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
...then I think they will be able to take to it quite easily.
