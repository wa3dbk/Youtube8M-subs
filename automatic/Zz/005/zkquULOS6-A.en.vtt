what's up everybody den I was raising 35
here<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.120> engine<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.780> came<00:00:12.930> out<00:00:13.139> of

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:13.289 
here this is the engine that came out of

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.409 
here this is the engine that came out of
my<00:00:13.519> vehicle<00:00:14.519> er<00:00:14.879> over<00:00:15.540> there<00:00:15.950> it<00:00:16.950> is<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.419> single

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:18.419 
my vehicle er over there it is a single

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
motor two and a half later I think I

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.580 
motor two and a half later I think I
already<00:00:24.930> said<00:00:25.199> that

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
already said that

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.210 
already said that
EJ<00:00:25.920> 251<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.810> have<00:00:27.810> removed<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.619> timing<00:00:29.189> gear

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
EJ 251 I have removed the timing gear

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.849 
EJ 251 I have removed the timing gear
and<00:00:29.699> all<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.660> stuff<00:00:30.900> but<00:00:31.080> basically<00:00:31.529> this

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
and all that stuff but basically this

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.770 
and all that stuff but basically this
video<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.489> going<00:00:32.699> to<00:00:32.820> be<00:00:32.940> probably<00:00:33.449> you<00:00:33.510> can

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
video is going to be probably you can

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.460 
video is going to be probably you can
tell<00:00:33.960> by<00:00:34.170> what<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.500> says<00:00:34.760> a<00:00:35.760> how-to<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.960> how<00:00:37.410> to

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
tell by what it says a how-to of how to

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.970 
tell by what it says a how-to of how to
change

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
change

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.070 
change
I<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.670> dropped<00:00:38.790> marinche<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.299> how<00:00:39.720> to<00:00:39.780> change

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
I just dropped marinche of how to change

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.939 
I just dropped marinche of how to change
a<00:00:40.350> camshaft<00:00:40.920> position<00:00:41.339> sensor<00:00:42.830> you<00:00:43.830> can

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
a camshaft position sensor you can

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:45.410 
a camshaft position sensor you can
probably<00:00:44.100> tell<00:00:44.339> that<00:00:44.400> this<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.790> a<00:00:44.820> junkyard

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
probably tell that this is a junkyard

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.350 
probably tell that this is a junkyard
motor<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:46.710> original<00:00:47.519> motor<00:00:47.670> spawn<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> bearing

motor the original motor spawn a bearing
and<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.019> could<00:00:49.140> afford<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:50.720> junkyard

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
and all I could afford was a junkyard

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.509 
and all I could afford was a junkyard
motor<00:00:52.260> from<00:00:52.650> Canada<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.449> so<00:00:54.799> anyways<00:00:55.799> the

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
motor from Canada a so anyways the

camshaft position sensor is right here

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:04.969 
camshaft position sensor is right here
this<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.189> driver's<00:00:59.790> side<00:01:00.119> of<00:01:00.799> the<00:01:03.049> yeah<00:01:04.049> of

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
this is the driver's side of the yeah of

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.789 
this is the driver's side of the yeah of
the<00:01:05.040> motor<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:06.810> only<00:01:07.170> camshaft<00:01:07.650> position

the motor the only camshaft position
sensor<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.580> right<00:01:09.000> here<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:10.049> camshaft<00:01:10.500> is

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
sensor is right here the camshaft is

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.709 
sensor is right here the camshaft is
inside<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.490> cylinder<00:01:11.700> head<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.179> opens<00:01:12.509> and

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
inside the cylinder head it opens and

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:15.010 
inside the cylinder head it opens and
closes<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.200> valves<00:01:13.560> if<00:01:13.859> you<00:01:14.579> did<00:01:14.759> not<00:01:14.909> know

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
closes the valves if you did not know

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.810 
closes the valves if you did not know
but<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.259> car<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.590> throwing<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.340> camshaft

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
but if your car is throwing a camshaft

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.599 
but if your car is throwing a camshaft
position<00:01:17.969> sensor<00:01:18.570> code<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:20.009> an<00:01:20.250> EJ

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:20.609 
position sensor code and you have an EJ

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:23.630 
position sensor code and you have an EJ
251<00:01:21.299> motor<00:01:21.630> which<00:01:22.109> is<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:23.070> two<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.520> half

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
251 motor which is a two and a half

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.709 
251 motor which is a two and a half
later<00:01:23.880> single<00:01:24.149> cam<00:01:24.450> Subaru<00:01:24.810> motor<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:26.719> you

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
later single cam Subaru motor then you

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:29.569 
later single cam Subaru motor then you
probably<00:01:28.320> need<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.649> replace<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.189> guy<00:01:29.369> right

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
probably need to replace this guy right

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.450 
probably need to replace this guy right
here<00:01:29.689> let<00:01:30.689> me<00:01:30.840> connect<00:01:31.469> this<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
here let me connect this so that it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.450 
here let me connect this so that it
actually<00:01:32.640> looks<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.780> part<00:01:33.990> no<00:01:34.649> it<00:01:34.679> goes<00:01:35.100> this

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
actually looks the part no it goes this

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.219 
actually looks the part no it goes this
way<00:01:37.490> there<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.579> go<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.659> will<00:01:39.869> be<00:01:40.020> right<00:01:40.200> here

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
way there we go so it will be right here

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.620 
way there we go so it will be right here
you'll<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.679> looking<00:01:41.130> at<00:01:41.249> it<00:01:41.369> from<00:01:41.549> here<00:01:41.850> your

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
you'll be looking at it from here your

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.029 
you'll be looking at it from here your
spark<00:01:42.929> plugs<00:01:43.140> come<00:01:43.380> down<00:01:43.560> here<00:01:43.770> I'm<00:01:43.859> in<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
spark plugs come down here I'm in the

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.770 
spark plugs come down here I'm in the
process<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.549> disassembling<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.420> engine

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
process of disassembling this engine

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.480 
process of disassembling this engine
into<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.619> engine<00:01:46.890> stand<00:01:47.960> excuse<00:01:48.960> me<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.490> yeah

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
into the engine stand excuse me and yeah

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.840 
into the engine stand excuse me and yeah
so<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.819> is<00:01:50.880> how<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:52.429> take<00:01:53.429> this<00:01:53.609> off<00:01:53.819> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
so this is how to take this off and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.179 
so this is how to take this off and
reapply<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:57.259> alright<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.859> area

reapply it alright so this is the area

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.819 
reapply it alright so this is the area
of<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.429> engine<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.999> question<00:02:00.389> um<00:02:00.829> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
of the engine in question um the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.279 
of the engine in question um the
camshaft<00:02:02.609> position<00:02:03.090> sensor<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.869> right<00:02:04.049> here

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
camshaft position sensor is right here

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:05.629

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
this in front of me so I had another

this in front of me so I had another
video<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.459> this<00:02:41.790> up<00:02:42.950> quite<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.010> few<00:02:44.190> years<00:02:44.430> ago

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
video of this up quite a few years ago

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.570 
video of this up quite a few years ago
probably<00:02:45.000> two<00:02:45.299> or<00:02:45.330> three<00:02:45.450> years<00:02:45.599> ago<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.580> the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
probably two or three years ago and the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.670 
probably two or three years ago and the
engine<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.150> had<00:02:48.420> which<00:02:49.049> is<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.349> same<00:02:49.530> as

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
engine that I had which is the same as

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.589 
engine that I had which is the same as
this<00:02:49.799> one<00:02:49.860> didn't<00:02:50.849> have<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.150> little<00:02:51.330> bracket

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
this one didn't have this little bracket

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.710 
this one didn't have this little bracket
that<00:02:51.870> I'm<00:02:51.989> about<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.349> show<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:53.480> still<00:02:54.480> have

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
that I'm about to show you I still have

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.660 
that I'm about to show you I still have
the<00:02:54.870> heads<00:02:55.110> from<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.829> engine<00:02:56.190> but<00:02:56.370> they<00:02:56.459> are

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
the heads from that engine but they are

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.509 
the heads from that engine but they are
completely<00:02:57.030> stripped<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.750> therefore<00:02:58.530> you

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
completely stripped and therefore you

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.020 
completely stripped and therefore you
know<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.700> can't<00:03:00.030> really<00:03:00.150> see<00:03:00.450> anything<00:03:00.860> and

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
know you can't really see anything and

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.539 
know you can't really see anything and
it's<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:03.329> cast<00:03:03.569> in<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:04.680> will<00:03:05.069> find<00:03:05.370> it

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
it's just cast in I will find it

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.210 
it's just cast in I will find it
sometime<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.450> do<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.930> follow-up<00:03:07.319> video<00:03:07.560> but

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
sometime and do a follow-up video but

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.160 
sometime and do a follow-up video but
anyways<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:09.180> go<00:03:09.329> to<00:03:09.390> take<00:03:09.599> this<00:03:09.750> out<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.079> you

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
anyways you go to take this out and you

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.949 
anyways you go to take this out and you
can't<00:03:10.739> because<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.120> valve<00:03:12.329> cover<00:03:12.569> is<00:03:12.660> in<00:03:12.900> the

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
can't because the valve cover is in the

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.740 
can't because the valve cover is in the
way<00:03:13.110> in<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:14.010> previous<00:03:14.459> video<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:15.000> showed

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
way in the previous video I showed

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.400 
way in the previous video I showed
taking<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.560> valve<00:03:16.739> cover<00:03:17.010> off<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:18.410> removing

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
taking the valve cover off and removing

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.289 
taking the valve cover off and removing
it<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:20.340> way<00:03:20.519> because<00:03:20.670> if<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.030> take<00:03:21.180> the

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
it this way because if you take the

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.930 
it this way because if you take the
valve<00:03:21.480> cover<00:03:21.720> off<00:03:21.810> then<00:03:22.739> it's<00:03:23.310> no<00:03:23.519> longer<00:03:23.819> in

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
valve cover off then it's no longer in

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.449 
valve cover off then it's no longer in
the<00:03:24.030> way<00:03:24.170> but<00:03:25.170> anyways<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.769> was<00:03:25.799> right<00:03:26.190> for

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
the way but anyways that was right for

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.050 
the way but anyways that was right for
my<00:03:27.120> engine<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.799> had<00:03:29.280> some<00:03:29.489> guy<00:03:29.609> said<00:03:29.880> that<00:03:30.030> I

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
my engine I had some guy said that I

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.879 
my engine I had some guy said that I
broke<00:03:30.329> his<00:03:30.569> valve<00:03:31.139> cover<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:32.400> did<00:03:33.299> not<00:03:33.889> because

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
broke his valve cover I did not because

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.440 
broke his valve cover I did not because
he's<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.340> one<00:03:35.459> who<00:03:35.609> did<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:35.790> he's<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.239> one<00:03:36.329> who

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
he's the one who did it he's the one who

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.550 
he's the one who did it he's the one who
followed<00:03:36.810> my<00:03:36.959> instructions

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
the bolt out set it aside to where you

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.650 
the bolt out set it aside to where you
will<00:04:04.139> not<00:04:04.319> lose<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:05.150> you<00:04:06.150> make<00:04:06.450> sure<00:04:06.630> that

will not lose it and you make sure that

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.420 
will not lose it and you make sure that
this<00:04:06.959> is<00:04:07.139> pulled<00:04:07.380> out<00:04:07.530> because<00:04:08.069> it<00:04:08.190> needs<00:04:08.340> to

this is pulled out because it needs to

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.550 
this is pulled out because it needs to
clear<00:04:08.730> this<00:04:08.880> plastic<00:04:09.419> and<00:04:09.540> then<00:04:10.230> you're<00:04:10.440> going

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
clear this plastic and then you're going

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.509 
clear this plastic and then you're going
to<00:04:10.650> wiggle<00:04:10.859> wiggle<00:04:11.190> wiggle<00:04:11.459> wiggle

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.479 

and<00:04:17.609> boom<00:04:18.299> there's<00:04:18.720> your<00:04:18.870> price<00:04:19.099> so<00:04:20.099> you<00:04:20.220> can

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
and boom there's your price so you can

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.950 
and boom there's your price so you can
take<00:04:20.699> the<00:04:21.299> camshaft<00:04:21.900> position<00:04:22.289> sensor<00:04:22.620> out<00:04:22.800> of

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
take the camshaft position sensor out of

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.760 
take the camshaft position sensor out of
the<00:04:25.310> bracket<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.720> then<00:04:27.720> let's<00:04:28.319> pretend<00:04:28.620> this

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
the bracket and then let's pretend this

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.620 
the bracket and then let's pretend this
is<00:04:28.949> a<00:04:28.979> new<00:04:29.190> one

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
is a new one

that you just used to take it off thread

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:54.589 
that you just used to take it off thread
it<00:04:44.910> in<00:04:46.520> if<00:04:47.520> I<00:04:47.729> can<00:04:47.759> find<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.539> hole<00:04:48.720> ladies<00:04:49.680> oh<00:04:53.599> I

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
it in if I can find the hole ladies oh I

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.899 
it in if I can find the hole ladies oh I
was<00:04:54.990> way<00:04:55.169> off<00:04:55.430> there<00:04:56.430> we<00:04:56.550> go

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
I think yep there we go run it down as

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.460 
I think yep there we go run it down as
far<00:05:05.370> as<00:05:05.490> you<00:05:05.580> can<00:05:05.759> with<00:05:05.940> your<00:05:06.000> fingers<00:05:06.419> just<00:05:07.289> to

far as you can with your fingers just to

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.409 
far as you can with your fingers just to
be<00:05:07.650> extra<00:05:08.250> special<00:05:08.370> sure<00:05:08.849> that<00:05:09.120> it's<00:05:09.240> not

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
be extra special sure that it's not

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.300 
be extra special sure that it's not
cross<00:05:09.659> threaded<00:05:10.020> put<00:05:10.949> your<00:05:11.159> wrench<00:05:11.759> on<00:05:12.030> it<00:05:12.210> and

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
cross threaded put your wrench on it and

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.879 
cross threaded put your wrench on it and
tighten<00:05:14.310> it<00:05:14.370> down<00:05:14.569> this<00:05:15.569> is<00:05:15.630> an<00:05:15.930> aluminum<00:05:16.229> head

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
tighten it down this is an aluminum head

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.330 
tighten it down this is an aluminum head
so<00:05:17.849> do<00:05:18.090> not<00:05:18.210> torque<00:05:18.720> it<00:05:18.870> down<00:05:19.050> very<00:05:19.349> high<00:05:19.650> or

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
so do not torque it down very high or

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.209 
so do not torque it down very high or
very<00:05:20.669> tight<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:21.360> you<00:05:22.139> also<00:05:22.349> do<00:05:22.710> not<00:05:22.740> need<00:05:23.099> to

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 
very tight and you also do not need to

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:24.860 
very tight and you also do not need to
use<00:05:23.370> a<00:05:23.400> wrench<00:05:23.699> for<00:05:23.940> this<00:05:24.120> this<00:05:24.330> is<00:05:24.509> just<00:05:24.719> what

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
use a wrench for this this is just what

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.129 
use a wrench for this this is just what
I<00:05:24.900> have<00:05:25.349> available<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.729> me<00:05:26.849> and<00:05:27.030> then<00:05:27.719> also<00:05:27.930> I

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
I have available to me and then also I

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.550 
I have available to me and then also I
just<00:05:28.349> noticed<00:05:28.860> that<00:05:28.949> the<00:05:29.190> foam<00:05:29.430> went<00:05:29.789> inside

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
just noticed that the foam went inside

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.990 
just noticed that the foam went inside
so<00:05:31.560> make<00:05:31.800> sure<00:05:31.830> that<00:05:32.009> doesn't<00:05:32.520> happen<00:05:32.669> to<00:05:32.909> you

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
so make sure that doesn't happen to you

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.670 
so make sure that doesn't happen to you
because<00:05:33.360> if<00:05:33.900> you<00:05:34.050> do<00:05:34.199> that<00:05:34.349> you're<00:05:34.530> going<00:05:34.620> to

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
because if you do that you're going to

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.100 
because if you do that you're going to
have<00:05:34.830> a<00:05:34.860> bad<00:05:35.070> time<00:05:35.099> but<00:05:35.580> this<00:05:36.479> engine<00:05:36.840> is<00:05:36.990> not

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
have a bad time but this engine is not

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.800 
have a bad time but this engine is not
going<00:05:37.259> to<00:05:37.320> run<00:05:37.500> any<00:05:37.620> time<00:05:37.889> soon<00:05:38.130> so<00:05:38.570> I'm<00:05:39.570> just

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
going to run any time soon so I'm just

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.439 
going to run any time soon so I'm just
going<00:05:39.930> to<00:05:40.020> keep<00:05:40.199> going<00:05:40.949> on<00:05:41.159> going<00:05:41.580> on<00:05:44.449> keeping

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
going to keep going on going on keeping

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.649 
going to keep going on going on keeping
on<00:05:45.599> keeping<00:05:45.930> on<00:05:46.229> that<00:05:46.830> was<00:05:46.979> the<00:05:47.130> wrong<00:05:47.659> idiom

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
on keeping on that was the wrong idiom

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:52.040 
on keeping on that was the wrong idiom
or<00:05:49.280> whatever<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:50.370> hell<00:05:50.490> it's<00:05:50.669> called<00:05:50.729> so<00:05:51.240> you

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
or whatever the hell it's called so you

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.990 
or whatever the hell it's called so you
put<00:05:52.259> this<00:05:52.380> guy<00:05:52.590> back<00:05:52.620> and<00:05:55.460> you<00:05:56.460> tighten<00:05:56.759> it

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
put this guy back and you tighten it

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.870 
put this guy back and you tighten it
right<00:05:57.150> back<00:05:57.449> down<00:06:00.050> and<00:06:02.270> then<00:06:03.270> finish<00:06:03.840> the<00:06:04.020> job

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
right back down and then finish the job

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.909 
right back down and then finish the job
by<00:06:05.880> reconnecting<00:06:07.099> the<00:06:08.099> sensor<00:06:08.639> and<00:06:09.020> boom<00:06:10.020> you

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
by reconnecting the sensor and boom you

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:12.529 
by reconnecting the sensor and boom you
just<00:06:10.949> change<00:06:11.460> your<00:06:11.580> camshaft<00:06:12.360> position

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
just change your camshaft position

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.680 
just change your camshaft position
sensor<00:06:13.169> now<00:06:13.919> if<00:06:14.159> you<00:06:14.340> have<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:15.090> other<00:06:15.120> type<00:06:15.659> of

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
sensor now if you have the other type of

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.330 
sensor now if you have the other type of
engine<00:06:16.229> or<00:06:16.380> the<00:06:16.409> other<00:06:16.590> type<00:06:16.800> of<00:06:16.860> cylinder

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
engine or the other type of cylinder

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.680 
engine or the other type of cylinder
head<00:06:17.490> I<00:06:17.520> think<00:06:17.849> there's<00:06:18.000> two<00:06:18.210> different<00:06:18.360> types

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
head I think there's two different types

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.029 
head I think there's two different types
of<00:06:18.870> cylinder<00:06:19.229> heads<00:06:19.349> that<00:06:19.500> came<00:06:19.710> on<00:06:19.889> these

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 
of cylinder heads that came on these

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:22.279 
of cylinder heads that came on these
engines<00:06:20.460> if<00:06:20.699> you<00:06:21.509> have<00:06:21.690> the<00:06:21.810> other<00:06:21.930> type<00:06:22.259> of

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
engines if you have the other type of

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:25.969 
engines if you have the other type of
cylinder<00:06:22.800> head<00:06:23.780> then<00:06:24.780> you<00:06:25.259> will<00:06:25.500> need<00:06:25.740> to

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
cylinder head then you will need to

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.909 
cylinder head then you will need to
remove<00:06:26.279> the<00:06:27.120> valve<00:06:27.360> cover<00:06:27.659> and<00:06:27.900> if<00:06:28.529> you<00:06:28.710> need

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
remove the valve cover and if you need

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.020 
remove the valve cover and if you need
to<00:06:28.949> do<00:06:29.250> that

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030
