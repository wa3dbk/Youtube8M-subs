00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
getting a broken product most likely

that was going to be filled with bugs

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.690 
that was going to be filled with bugs
and<00:00:49.710> there<00:00:49.860> was<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> chance<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.309> wasn't<00:00:50.610> gonna

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700

and there was a chance that wasn't gonna
work<00:00:50.789> all<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> time<00:00:51.270> because<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.289> the

developed i personally have always
thought<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.129> PTU<00:00:59.460> was<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> silly<00:01:00.449> silly

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.570 
thought that the PTU was a silly silly
thing<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:02.070> CAG<00:01:02.870> released<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.170> PTU

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
thing and that CAG released the PTU

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.090 
thing and that CAG released the PTU
purely<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.820> make<00:01:06.060> whiners<00:01:06.900> happy<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.710> people

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
of the point of this kind of development

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.380 
of the point of this kind of development
for<00:01:15.420> them<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> middle<00:01:16.950> ground

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
for them to have to have a middle ground

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.380 
for them to have to have a middle ground
another<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.900> wall<00:01:19.549> to<00:01:20.549> breakdown<00:01:21.060> bugs

another like wall to breakdown bugs

another like wall to breakdown bugs
before<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:22.020> push<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.590> live<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.400> seem<00:01:24.240> so

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
before they push it to live just seem so

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.530 
before they push it to live just seem so
redundant<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.409> ridiculous<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.189> me<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:27.270> i

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
redundant and ridiculous to me and i

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.090 
redundant and ridiculous to me and i
think<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.990> main<00:01:28.320> reason<00:01:28.350> i<00:01:28.680> was<00:01:28.799> spurred<00:01:29.009> on

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
think the main reason i was spurred on

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.560 
think the main reason i was spurred on
by<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.310> conversation<00:01:29.939> was<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.210> news<00:01:30.360> that

similar<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.930> what<00:01:37.079> they<00:01:37.170> did<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.500> arena

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799

PTU<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.549> way<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.540> they<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.020> push<00:01:43.229> it

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
PTU in the way so they have to push it

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.039 
PTU in the way so they have to push it
to<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.530> PT<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.070> buy<00:01:44.520> back<00:01:44.850> your<00:01:44.880> number<00:01:45.420> so

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
to the PT you buy back your number so

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.240 
to the PT you buy back your number so
what<00:01:46.229> does<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.350> mean<00:01:46.590> when<00:01:46.770> they<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.040> push

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
what does that mean when they go to push

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.969 
what does that mean when they go to push
it<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.520> live<00:01:47.790> do<00:01:48.509> we<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.110> push<00:01:49.710> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
it to live do we have to have it push to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.030 
it to live do we have to have it push to
live<00:01:50.159> my<00:01:50.399> backer<00:01:50.640> number<00:01:51.030> again<00:01:53.360> again<00:01:54.360> twice

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.830 
live my backer number again again twice
that<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.280> seems<00:01:56.490> utterly<00:01:56.880> ridiculous<00:01:57.659> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
that just seems utterly ridiculous and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.959 
that just seems utterly ridiculous and
utterly<00:01:58.110> unnecessary<00:01:58.619> because<00:01:59.579> there's<00:01:59.909> a

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
utterly unnecessary because there's a

because it was in the PTU first but does
that<00:03:52.269> mean<00:03:52.420> that<00:03:52.570> the<00:03:52.810> PTU<00:03:53.140> is<00:03:53.320> necessary<00:03:53.799> that

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
that mean that the PTU is necessary that

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.729 
that mean that the PTU is necessary that
it's<00:03:54.100> beneficial<00:03:54.489> i<00:03:54.820> personally<00:03:55.690> don't<00:03:56.440> see

it's beneficial i personally don't see
the<00:03:56.920> benefit<00:03:57.340> but<00:03:57.940> once<00:03:58.120> again<00:03:58.269> if<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.570> is

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
the benefit but once again if it is

of the PTU because there is no doubt in
my<00:04:59.190> mind<00:04:59.460> that<00:04:59.820> when<00:05:00.389> it<00:05:00.479> goes<00:05:00.630> into<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:00.930> PT

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
my mind that when it goes into the PT

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.200 
my mind that when it goes into the PT
you<00:05:01.380> no<00:05:01.680> matter<00:05:01.860> how<00:05:02.070> small<00:05:02.490> they<00:05:02.729> push<00:05:02.940> in<00:05:03.090> the

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
you no matter how small they push in the

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.420 
you no matter how small they push in the
waves<00:05:03.479> of<00:05:03.840> players<00:05:04.110> people<00:05:05.070> are<00:05:05.160> going<00:05:05.250> to<00:05:05.340> be

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
waves of players people are going to be

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.890 
waves of players people are going to be
breaking<00:05:05.880> it<00:05:06.000> and<00:05:06.210> that's<00:05:06.419> probably<00:05:06.690> going<00:05:06.840> to

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
breaking it and that's probably going to

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.140 
breaking it and that's probably going to
delay<00:05:07.229> the<00:05:07.560> following<00:05:07.860> wave<00:05:08.340> in<00:05:08.699> the<00:05:08.820> next

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
delay the following wave in the next

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.420 
delay the following wave in the next

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
wave I mean it's I can just imagine it

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.850 
wave I mean it's I can just imagine it
being<00:05:11.520> a<00:05:11.669> broken<00:05:12.030> mess<00:05:12.240> as<00:05:12.539> much<00:05:12.900> as<00:05:13.080> cige<00:05:13.560> as

that<00:05:16.500> they've<00:05:16.650> been<00:05:16.680> polishing<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.460> hell<00:05:17.639> out

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
that they've been polishing the hell out

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.040 
that they've been polishing the hell out
of<00:05:17.789> this<00:05:17.970> thing<00:05:18.210> and<00:05:18.449> they've<00:05:18.600> been<00:05:18.720> making

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
of this thing and they've been making

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.719 
of this thing and they've been making
all<00:05:19.289> these<00:05:19.410> huge<00:05:19.650> changes<00:05:20.070> and<00:05:20.250> tweaks<00:05:20.370> and

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
all these huge changes and tweaks and

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.279 
all these huge changes and tweaks and
trying<00:05:20.940> to<00:05:21.060> get<00:05:21.180> it<00:05:21.300> ready<00:05:21.510> so<00:05:21.810> that's<00:05:21.990> the

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
trying to get it ready so that's the

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.760 
trying to get it ready so that's the

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.760 
best alpha launch possible I feel that
we<00:05:26.160> as<00:05:26.430> players<00:05:26.729> will<00:05:27.630> find<00:05:27.900> ways<00:05:28.110> to<00:05:28.320> break<00:05:28.560> it

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
we as players will find ways to break it

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.230 
we as players will find ways to break it
because<00:05:29.039> that's<00:05:29.130> what<00:05:29.310> we<00:05:29.550> do<00:05:29.820> and<00:05:30.060> that<00:05:30.210> is

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
because that's what we do and that is

and<00:06:16.860> if<00:06:16.949> things<00:06:17.099> go<00:06:17.430> nearly<00:06:18.060> flawlessly<00:06:18.750> you

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
and if things go nearly flawlessly you

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.570 
and if things go nearly flawlessly you
know<00:06:19.530> hopefully<00:06:19.710> we'll<00:06:19.979> see<00:06:20.010> it<00:06:20.190> pushed<00:06:20.430> out

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
know hopefully we'll see it pushed out

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.450 
know hopefully we'll see it pushed out
of<00:06:20.610> the<00:06:20.760> PTU<00:06:21.090> much<00:06:21.630> more<00:06:21.930> rapidly<00:06:22.440> maybe<00:06:23.310> it'll

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
of the PTU much more rapidly maybe it'll

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.250 
of the PTU much more rapidly maybe it'll
be<00:06:23.610> a<00:06:23.699> week<00:06:23.940> or<00:06:24.210> so<00:06:24.570> and<00:06:24.780> I<00:06:24.870> think<00:06:24.900> that'd<00:06:25.139> be

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
be a week or so and I think that'd be

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.290 
be a week or so and I think that'd be
fantastic<00:06:25.440> to<00:06:25.979> see<00:06:26.070> the<00:06:26.250> FPS<00:06:26.550> module<00:06:26.970> get<00:06:27.180> out

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
fantastic to see the FPS module get out

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.990 
fantastic to see the FPS module get out
of<00:06:27.419> the<00:06:27.479> PTU<00:06:27.780> past<00:06:28.229> that<00:06:28.500> wall<00:06:28.710> and<00:06:28.949> into<00:06:29.610> live

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
of the PTU past that wall and into live

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.969 
of the PTU past that wall and into live

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 
where however the hell they're going to

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.529 
where however the hell they're going to
decide<00:06:32.160> to<00:06:32.460> launch<00:06:32.610> that<00:06:32.880> I<00:06:33.120> haven't<00:06:33.300> really

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 
decide to launch that I haven't really

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:35.250 
decide to launch that I haven't really
heard<00:06:33.630> anything<00:06:33.720> directly<00:06:34.229> on<00:06:34.530> that

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
heard anything directly on that

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.470 
heard anything directly on that
it<00:06:36.070> would<00:06:36.190> make<00:06:36.340> sense<00:06:36.370> that<00:06:36.760> they<00:06:37.000> would<00:06:37.030> once

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
it would make sense that they would once

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.570 
it would make sense that they would once
again<00:06:37.630> use<00:06:38.050> the<00:06:38.290> backer<00:06:38.680> numbers<00:06:39.130> and<00:06:39.340> sort<00:06:39.520> of

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
again use the backer numbers and sort of

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.220 
again use the backer numbers and sort of
reset<00:06:39.940> everything<00:06:40.180> and<00:06:40.510> then<00:06:40.600> start<00:06:40.960> rira

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
reset everything and then start rira

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.440 
reset everything and then start rira
leasing<00:06:41.560> it<00:06:41.680> to<00:06:41.710> backers<00:06:41.980> but<00:06:42.970> maybe<00:06:43.240> the

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.450 
leasing it to backers but maybe the

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.760 
leasing it to backers but maybe the
confidence<00:06:43.930> will<00:06:44.050> be<00:06:44.080> there<00:06:44.410> that<00:06:44.620> they'll

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
confidence will be there that they'll

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.310 
confidence will be there that they'll
just<00:06:44.920> throw<00:06:45.070> it<00:06:45.250> out<00:06:45.310> into<00:06:45.490> the<00:06:45.580> wild<00:06:46.000> and

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
just throw it out into the wild and

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.080 
just throw it out into the wild and
everything<00:06:47.320> will<00:06:47.440> crash<00:06:47.620> and<00:06:47.800> burn<00:06:47.950> and<00:06:48.250> then

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
everything will crash and burn and then

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.340 
everything will crash and burn and then
all<00:06:49.240> the<00:06:49.270> people<00:06:49.570> who<00:06:49.660> like<00:06:49.810> to<00:06:49.840> whine<00:06:50.140> will
