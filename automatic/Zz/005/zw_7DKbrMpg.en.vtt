00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 now the sesi is our pilot will pass 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:13.139
 some little secrets for you to make a 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:16.020
 perfect beacon no chance pound of garlic 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.330
 My god, this is Priscilla the tourist with 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.430
 10 years of qualification and skill and 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.100
 zero to park when I go 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.250
 put in the vacancy I try and then start to 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:32.599
 Your start to get nervous I give up. 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.599
 I do not want to suffer far. 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.200
 and looks like the pool car and sensor 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.150
 de rÃ© but bebi warns of the lakes 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.830
 I look who arrives is being the choice 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.830
 Nothing like that at my will. 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.750
 It's a little help that was then from Friday 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.750
 are in favor 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.909
 so empty you first have to 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.309
 understand a principle I'll show you a 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.649
 thing that comes here you know in what 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.320
 position the car should be parallel as 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.100
 they put themselves on the side of the 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.520
 other 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.070
 gently forward the rear axle is 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.030
 a fixed point on the shaft that slides the shaft 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.530
 front right 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.700
 so it is easier to park aft 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.140
 really because you already point a point 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.450
 fixed to where you want it to go 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.700
 when you have the headlight 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.220
 parallel here with the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.420
 car front bumper who you 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.060
 have to be with your rearview 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.060
 seeing this car headlight from behind 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.440
 This is the time to serve the whole steering wheel. 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.060
 in the opposite direction 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.970
 at the time you make it to the front 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.649
 slide and you will fit the car into the 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.319
 vacancy 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.659
 let's go the retrovision with the rear view mirror 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.609
 a little bit ahead 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.590
 everyone cares about those who help 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:55.119
 directly what I showed you 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.560
 Left rear view is one thing 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.310
 awesome nobody looks at the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.479
 mirror is only the rain to appear and that already 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.960
 come the line 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.210
 the bumpers stay in parallel to the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.179
 device as well not have done're coming 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.479
 the right lighthouse in case of tradition already 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.479
 wise 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:24.050
 the woman is sure to fit 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:26.210
 that the sesa people and when the vacancy 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.940
 shopping belly all one of the 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:33.320
 the other due to the radius of 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:36.260
 turning right is how much space the car 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.540
 need to be able to maneuver harry 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.910
 always need a smaller space 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.070
 The time you see the half 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.290
 This car is here and this one to 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.040
 here may be saturn the car goes 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.040
 fit into a good 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.250
 the rear bumper 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.400
 Red car 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.319
 you have to get as close as possible 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.650
 this end on the side of my car with 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.920
 that pleasure, the good performance can 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.769
 You can get behind but do find 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.620
 everything everything everything everything everything everything everything goes 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:13.540
 hitting me seems to help me 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.540
 I've never done it in my life. 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.129
 after this little hand of the session you need 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.489
 do not want to see another tire a 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.489
 guide
