00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.919 
ridges that added length of the to the
jacket<00:00:24.739> and<00:00:24.980> then<00:00:25.699> according<00:00:26.269> to<00:00:26.390> her<00:00:26.509> pattern

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:26.929 
jacket and then according to her pattern

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.859 
jacket and then according to her pattern
you<00:00:27.080> were<00:00:27.199> to<00:00:27.380> knit<00:00:27.619> three<00:00:27.949> ridges<00:00:28.490> and<00:00:28.750> if<00:00:29.750> we

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
you were to knit three ridges and if we

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.870 
you were to knit three ridges and if we
were<00:00:29.929> to<00:00:29.990> count<00:00:30.380> that<00:00:30.650> we<00:00:31.310> would<00:00:31.490> be<00:00:31.640> counting

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
were to count that we would be counting

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.979 
were to count that we would be counting
like<00:00:32.419> so<00:00:33.970> easiest<00:00:34.970> place<00:00:35.150> to<00:00:35.180> count<00:00:35.570> it<00:00:35.720> from

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
like so easiest place to count it from

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.189 
like so easiest place to count it from
is<00:00:36.260> that<00:00:36.320> picked<00:00:37.250> up<00:00:37.460> area<00:00:37.879> so<00:00:38.510> here's<00:00:38.900> one

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
is that picked up area so here's one

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.520 
is that picked up area so here's one
Ridge<00:00:39.470> to<00:00:40.010> Ridge<00:00:40.059> three<00:00:41.059> ridges<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:41.809> then<00:00:42.350> we

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
Ridge to Ridge three ridges and then we

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.619 
Ridge to Ridge three ridges and then we
were<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:42.739> stop<00:00:43.039> and<00:00:43.309> put<00:00:43.520> in<00:00:43.640> buttonholes<00:00:44.270> and

were to stop and put in buttonholes and

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.500 
were to stop and put in buttonholes and
then<00:00:45.379> knit<00:00:45.620> three<00:00:45.649> ridges<00:00:46.550> more<00:00:46.789> and<00:00:47.059> bind<00:00:47.300> off

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
then knit three ridges more and bind off

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.110 
then knit three ridges more and bind off
now<00:00:48.260> I<00:00:48.289> didn't<00:00:48.739> put<00:00:49.039> buttonholes<00:00:49.550> in<00:00:49.760> because

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
to angle it up to the camera yet because

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.500 
to angle it up to the camera yet because
right<00:04:02.650> now<00:04:03.160> I<00:04:03.190> want<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:03.850> prepare<00:04:04.239> for<00:04:04.480> a

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
right now I want to prepare for a

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.560 
right now I want to prepare for a
buttonhole<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:06.060> experimented<00:04:07.060> with<00:04:07.300> this

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
buttonhole I experimented with this

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.479 
buttonhole I experimented with this
already<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.260> decided<00:04:08.650> that<00:04:08.770> one<00:04:09.160> stitch

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
already and I decided that one stitch

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.100 
already and I decided that one stitch
wasn't<00:04:09.880> enough<00:04:10.120> for<00:04:10.270> the<00:04:10.360> buttons<00:04:10.660> I<00:04:10.780> want<00:04:10.989> to

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
wasn't enough for the buttons I want to

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
the routine of knitting two stitches

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.250 
the routine of knitting two stitches
individually<00:06:03.390> two<00:06:04.390> together<00:06:04.870> through<00:06:05.140> the

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
individually two together through the

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.590 
individually two together through the
back<00:06:05.290> loops<00:06:05.830> and<00:06:06.190> I'm<00:06:07.090> back<00:06:07.360> to<00:06:07.600> joining<00:06:07.960> and

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
back loops and I'm back to joining and

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.420 
back loops and I'm back to joining and
I've<00:06:10.600> bridged<00:06:10.930> the<00:06:11.170> gap<00:06:11.200> that<00:06:11.620> I<00:06:11.680> created<00:06:12.100> by

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
I've bridged the gap that I created by

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.850 
I've bridged the gap that I created by
making<00:06:12.760> a<00:06:12.880> hole<00:06:13.060> and<00:06:13.780> that's<00:06:14.260> going<00:06:14.530> to<00:06:14.620> be<00:06:14.740> my

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
making a hole and that's going to be my

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.210 
making a hole and that's going to be my
buttonhole<00:06:15.570> right<00:06:16.570> here<00:06:16.930> so<00:06:17.530> I<00:06:17.560> have<00:06:17.800> an<00:06:17.920> edge

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
buttonhole right here so I have an edge

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.520 
buttonhole right here so I have an edge
and<00:06:18.610> the<00:06:19.180> buttonhole<00:06:19.630> is<00:06:19.660> just<00:06:20.020> sneaking

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
and the buttonhole is just sneaking

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.190 
and the buttonhole is just sneaking
hiding<00:06:21.010> right<00:06:21.160> inside<00:06:21.550> here<00:06:21.580> and<00:06:22.120> I<00:06:22.960> think

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
hiding right inside here and I think

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.350 
hiding right inside here and I think
that<00:06:23.320> will<00:06:23.410> look<00:06:23.530> sweet<00:06:23.800> for<00:06:23.980> this<00:06:24.100> jacket<00:06:24.370> so

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
that will look sweet for this jacket so

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.820 
that will look sweet for this jacket so
I'm<00:06:25.510> going<00:06:25.720> to<00:06:25.810> keep<00:06:25.960> going<00:06:26.260> on<00:06:26.410> this<00:06:26.620> will

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
I'm going to keep going on this will
