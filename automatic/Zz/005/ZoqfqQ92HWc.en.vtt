00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
ground right in there I cut off a branch

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.440 
ground right in there I cut off a branch
that<00:00:48.280> I<00:00:48.670> don't<00:00:48.820> know<00:00:48.880> if<00:00:49.000> they<00:00:49.120> do<00:00:49.180> this

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
normally naturally or what but the

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.270 
normally naturally or what but the
branches<00:00:53.140> are<00:00:53.290> all<00:00:53.410> criss<00:00:53.650> crossed<00:00:53.950> up<00:00:54.130> in

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
branches are all criss crossed up in

actually<00:00:56.950> last<00:00:57.400> year<00:00:57.910> I<00:00:57.940> think<00:00:58.030> and<00:00:59.100> I<00:01:01.110> trimmed

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
actually last year I think and I trimmed

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.870 
actually last year I think and I trimmed
one<00:01:02.260> off<00:01:02.440> on<00:01:02.470> the<00:01:02.740> back<00:01:02.890> side<00:01:03.160> and<00:01:03.430> it<00:01:03.550> actually

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
one off on the back side and it actually

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.749 
one off on the back side and it actually
fell<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:05.170> actually<00:01:05.470> took<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:05.650> bunch<00:01:05.890> of<00:01:06.009> the

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
fell it actually took a bunch of the

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:12.740 
fell it actually took a bunch of the
foliage<00:01:07.090> off<00:01:07.299> from<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.689> from<00:01:08.140> this<00:01:08.320> side<00:01:08.500> so

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.539 

it's<00:01:13.750> starting<00:01:14.439> to<00:01:14.530> grow<00:01:14.650> back<00:01:14.680> I<00:01:14.890> guess<00:01:15.280> fill

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
it's starting to grow back I guess fill

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.190 
it's starting to grow back I guess fill
fill<00:01:15.939> in<00:01:16.119> I<00:01:16.329> guess<00:01:16.509> would<00:01:16.600> be<00:01:16.659> a<00:01:16.750> better<00:01:16.960> word

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
fill in I guess would be a better word

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.700 
fill in I guess would be a better word
it's<00:01:17.409> still<00:01:17.650> not<00:01:17.800> filled<00:01:18.100> in<00:01:18.190> like<00:01:18.370> it<00:01:18.520> was<00:01:18.700> but

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
it's still not filled in like it was but

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.540 
it's still not filled in like it was but
my<00:01:20.710> neighbor<00:01:20.920> said<00:01:21.040> we<00:01:21.340> need<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:23.250> say<00:01:24.250> it<00:01:24.370> was<00:01:24.520> a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
my neighbor said we need to say it was a

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.280 
my neighbor said we need to say it was a
Bob<00:01:24.880> Marley<00:01:25.150> tree<00:01:25.600> because<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:25.930> looked<00:01:26.110> like

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
Bob Marley tree because it looked like

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.600 
Bob Marley tree because it looked like
you<00:01:26.650> could<00:01:26.800> put<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:26.980> joint<00:01:27.280> right<00:01:27.430> in<00:01:27.550> the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
you could put a joint right in the

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.640 
you could put a joint right in the
middle<00:01:27.760> of<00:01:27.909> it<00:01:28.030> a<00:01:28.180> big<00:01:28.480> humongous<00:01:28.930> joint<00:01:29.440> and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
middle of it a big humongous joint and

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.810 
middle of it a big humongous joint and
it<00:01:29.740> would<00:01:29.860> look<00:01:29.950> like<00:01:30.010> Bob<00:01:30.370> Marley

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
it would look like Bob Marley

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.700 
it would look like Bob Marley
so<00:01:31.470> anyway<00:01:33.210> thought<00:01:34.210> into<00:01:34.540> all<00:01:34.600> that<00:01:34.870> so<00:01:35.260> and<00:01:35.590> I

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
so anyway thought into all that so and I

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.260 
so anyway thought into all that so and I
know<00:01:35.770> he's<00:01:36.100> not<00:01:36.250> either<00:01:36.490> he<00:01:36.670> was<00:01:36.729> just<00:01:36.909> joking

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
know he's not either he was just joking

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.670
