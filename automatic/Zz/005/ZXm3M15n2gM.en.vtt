00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580

worried that my clutch is slipping again
but<00:04:09.380> realistically<00:04:09.950> is<00:04:10.160> probably<00:04:10.370> just<00:04:10.550> more

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
but realistically is probably just more

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.430 
but realistically is probably just more
to<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:10.850> fabric<00:04:11.180> more<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:11.930> do<00:04:12.050> with<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.260> fact

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
to the fabric more to do with the fact

to the fabric more to do with the fact
that<00:04:12.530> my<00:04:12.710> wrist<00:04:13.220> is<00:04:13.510> so<00:04:14.510> found<00:04:14.840> up<00:04:15.110> that<00:04:15.320> I

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
that my wrist is so found up that I

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.080 
that my wrist is so found up that I
can't<00:04:15.620> twist<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:16.010> throttle<00:04:16.160> as<00:04:16.489> quickly<00:04:16.730> as<00:04:16.970> I

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
can't twist the throttle as quickly as I

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.710 
can't twist the throttle as quickly as I
normally<00:04:17.239> do<00:04:17.920> some<00:04:18.920> more<00:04:19.040> realistic<00:04:19.250> answer

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
normally do some more realistic answer

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.470 
normally do some more realistic answer
anyways<00:04:20.720> I<00:04:20.750> need<00:04:21.140> a<00:04:21.170> topic<00:04:21.940> because<00:04:22.940> even<00:04:23.270> I

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
anyways I need a topic because even I

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.790 
anyways I need a topic because even I
don't<00:04:23.540> like<00:04:23.960> my<00:04:24.140> videos<00:04:24.440> when<00:04:24.560> there's<00:04:24.710> no

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
topic unless I'm going to really

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.060 
topic unless I'm going to really
talkative<00:04:26.780> mood<00:04:27.050> which<00:04:27.320> I<00:04:27.440> seem<00:04:27.680> to<00:04:27.710> be<00:04:27.830> right

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
talkative mood which I seem to be right

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.600 
talkative mood which I seem to be right

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
now and then sometimes all like I'll

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.220 
now and then sometimes all like I'll
