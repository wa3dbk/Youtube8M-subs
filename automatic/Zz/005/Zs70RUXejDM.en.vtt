they would let us know if there's
anything<00:00:21.820> to<00:00:22.210> be<00:00:22.240> informed<00:00:22.900> to<00:00:23.079> the<00:00:23.199> press<00:00:23.439> and

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
all that but unfortunately we were told

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.200 
all that but unfortunately we were told
with<00:00:29.050> the<00:00:29.079> rest<00:00:29.409> of<00:00:29.589> the<00:00:29.679> world<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:33.210> that

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
with the rest of the world so that

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.270 
with the rest of the world so that
should<00:00:34.450> not<00:00:34.480> have<00:00:34.720> happened<00:00:34.930> I<00:00:35.320> think<00:00:35.590> you

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
should not have happened I think you

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.060 
should not have happened I think you
know<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:37.540> of<00:00:37.690> respect<00:00:37.990> to<00:00:38.230> us<00:00:38.500> they<00:00:39.040> should

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
know out of respect to us they should

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.960 
know out of respect to us they should
have<00:00:39.370> been<00:00:39.520> bombed<00:00:39.850> as<00:00:40.000> first<00:00:40.620> about<00:00:41.620> the

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
have been bombed as first about the

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.420 
have been bombed as first about the
decision<00:00:42.970> that<00:00:43.000> they<00:00:43.270> have<00:00:43.450> made

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
decision that they have made

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.560 
decision that they have made
that's<00:00:45.430> not<00:00:45.640> many<00:00:45.970> other<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.850> I<00:00:48.880> think<00:00:49.150> they

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
that's not many other so I think they

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.050 
that's not many other so I think they
could<00:00:49.750> have<00:00:49.840> called<00:00:50.080> us<00:00:50.350> in<00:00:51.070> earlier<00:00:51.700> and

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
could have called us in earlier and

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.850 
could have called us in earlier and
explained<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:52.930> us<00:00:52.960> what<00:00:53.290> was<00:00:53.410> going<00:00:53.500> to<00:00:53.710> happen

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860
