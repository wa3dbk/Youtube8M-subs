and I think a few of these were like BFF
lips<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.520> well<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:36.630> probably<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
lips as well and it's probably the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.150 
lips as well and it's probably the
reason<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.380> picked<00:00:37.590> some<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.860> them<00:00:37.980> I've

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160

back<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.960> top<00:00:45.960> five<00:00:46.170> saves<00:00:46.410> all<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> way

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
back in this top five saves all the way

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.990 
back in this top five saves all the way
but<00:00:46.860> anyway<00:00:47.219> let's<00:00:47.430> jump<00:00:47.640> straight<00:00:47.730> into<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
but anyway let's jump straight into the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.819 
but anyway let's jump straight into the
top<00:00:48.149> five<00:00:48.360> saves<00:00:53.690> so<00:00:54.690> number<00:00:54.960> five<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.620> have

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
top five saves so number five we have

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.189 
top five saves so number five we have
Weibo<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> 222<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> reason<00:00:57.870> i<00:00:57.930> picked<00:00:58.079> this

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
Weibo a 222 and the reason i picked this

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.049 
Weibo a 222 and the reason i picked this
clip<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.590> because<00:00:59.160> i<00:00:59.190> know<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.670> tricky<00:00:59.910> as<00:01:00.030> a

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
clip is because i know it's tricky as a

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.700 
clip is because i know it's tricky as a
goalie<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.690> exactly<00:01:01.050> what<00:01:01.260> he<00:01:01.379> does<00:01:01.680> right

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
goalie to do exactly what he does right

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.260 
goalie to do exactly what he does right
here<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.430> they<00:01:02.579> go<00:01:02.670> ahead<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:02.969> down<00:01:03.120> outside

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
here so they go ahead it down outside

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.759 
here so they go ahead it down outside
the<00:01:03.510> box<00:01:03.719> they<00:01:04.110> take<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.320> shot<00:01:04.559> guess

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the box they take the shot guess

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.039 
the box they take the shot guess
deflection<00:01:05.369> pushed<00:01:05.670> over<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> crossbar<00:01:06.240> like

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
deflection pushed over the crossbar like

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.600 
deflection pushed over the crossbar like
I<00:01:07.170> said<00:01:07.229> deflections<00:01:07.860> as<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> goalie<00:01:08.220> isn't

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
I said deflections as a goalie isn't

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.830 
I said deflections as a goalie isn't
easy<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:14.130> number<00:01:14.430> four<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:14.909> fifa<00:01:15.210> keeper

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
