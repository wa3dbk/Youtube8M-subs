version<00:01:37.310> of<00:01:37.400> what<00:01:37.520> it's<00:01:37.640> supposed<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.940> look

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
version of what it's supposed to look

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.719 
version of what it's supposed to look
like<00:01:38.200> possibly<00:01:39.200> I'm<00:01:39.710> hoping<00:01:40.100> that<00:01:40.250> they<00:01:40.370> make

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
like possibly I'm hoping that they make

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.160 
like possibly I'm hoping that they make
it<00:01:40.850> look<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:41.060> little<00:01:41.210> bit<00:01:41.450> better

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
it look a little bit better

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.050 
it look a little bit better
I<00:01:42.200> was<00:01:42.890> hoping<00:01:43.160> for<00:01:43.220> a<00:01:43.340> better<00:01:43.430> fps<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:43.940> this

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
I was hoping for a better fps and this

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.730 
I was hoping for a better fps and this
it<00:01:44.210> seems<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.690> be<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:44.840> little<00:01:45.170> bit<00:01:45.410> longer<00:01:47.740> but

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
it seems to be a little bit longer but

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.140 
it seems to be a little bit longer but
yeah<00:01:48.890> right<00:01:49.100> now<00:01:49.220> we're<00:01:49.370> getting<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:49.700> solid<00:01:50.000> 30

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
yeah right now we're getting a solid 30

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.990 
yeah right now we're getting a solid 30
31<00:01:50.540> FPS<00:01:51.020> this<00:01:51.650> is<00:01:51.920> with<00:01:52.250> fraps<00:01:52.520> running<00:01:52.850> in<00:01:52.940> the

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
to these textures so again as you can

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.309 
to these textures so again as you can
see<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:28.790> definitely<00:03:28.970> feels<00:03:29.390> like<00:03:29.569> it's<00:03:29.840> it's

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319
