I prefer the GSB exact heavy they're

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.399 
I prefer the GSB exact heavy they're
better<00:01:32.479> ballistically<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:33.770> accuracy

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.870 

the<00:01:37.920> striker<00:01:38.610> Springs<00:01:40.070> this<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.430> striker

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the striker Springs this is the striker

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.820 
the striker Springs this is the striker
with<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.509> ugly<00:01:43.229> oil<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.420> I<00:01:45.420> take<00:01:46.080> it<00:01:46.259> out<00:01:46.440> I

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
with the ugly oil on it I take it out I

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.560 
with the ugly oil on it I take it out I
polish<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.000> striker<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:49.250> also<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.280> put

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
polish the striker and also I put

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.749 
polish the striker and also I put
silicon<00:01:51.570> oil<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.200> now<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.250> much<00:01:53.549> better

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
silicon oil and now it's much better

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.840 
silicon oil and now it's much better
polishing<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.030> spring<00:01:57.600> hammer<00:01:58.850> also

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
polishing the spring hammer also

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.219 
polishing the spring hammer also
creating<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.570> pin<00:02:01.280> for<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.430> spring<00:02:02.700> hammer

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
creating this pin for the spring hammer

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.080 
creating this pin for the spring hammer
because<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:05.369> spring<00:02:06.180> was<00:02:06.570> twisting<00:02:08.090> under

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
because the spring was twisting under

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.740 
because the spring was twisting under
the<00:02:09.270> pressure

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
the pressure

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.110 
the pressure
so<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.560> pin<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:10.979> not<00:02:11.190> allowing<00:02:11.730> for<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
so this pin is not allowing for the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.590 
so this pin is not allowing for the
spring<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.630> be<00:02:12.780> twisted<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:14.430> made<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.910> from

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
spring to be twisted and I made it from

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.180 
spring to be twisted and I made it from
one<00:02:16.290> bolt<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:17.160> can<00:02:17.190> see<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.819> pictures

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:31.850 

again<00:02:24.190> cheap<00:02:24.670> solution<00:02:25.090> but<00:02:25.660> very<00:02:25.930> effective

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.090 

okay<00:02:32.850> next<00:02:33.180> one<00:02:33.450> is<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:36.270> pinger<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.710> pinger

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
okay next one is the pinger the pinger

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
okay next one is the pinger the pinger
is<00:02:38.280> not<00:02:38.640> allowing<00:02:39.240> for<00:02:40.020> this<00:02:40.640> sound<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:42.000> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
is not allowing for this sound of the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.400 
is not allowing for this sound of the
ping<00:02:42.510> in<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.410> cylinder<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:45.480> be<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:46.020> annoying

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
ping in the cylinder to be so annoying

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.170 
ping in the cylinder to be so annoying
and<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.700> finger<00:02:48.120> should<00:02:49.080> be<00:02:49.790> very<00:02:50.790> tight

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
and the finger should be very tight

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.960 
and the finger should be very tight
inside<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.740> cylinder<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.620> I<00:02:55.970> find

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
inside of the cylinder so I find

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.380 
inside of the cylinder so I find
solution<00:02:57.960> from<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.380> medicine<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.820> box

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
solution from the medicine this is box

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.820 
solution from the medicine this is box
for<00:03:01.100> medicine<00:03:02.100> pills<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.820> I<00:03:03.570> bought<00:03:04.350> it<00:03:04.560> I

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
for medicine pills and I bought it I

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.530 
for medicine pills and I bought it I
trow<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.640> pills<00:03:05.910> out<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:07.080> use<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.220> box<00:03:08.540> so

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
trow the pills out and I use the box so

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.770 
trow the pills out and I use the box so
it's<00:03:09.959> working<00:03:10.470> well<00:03:10.820> these<00:03:11.820> are<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.300> screw

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
it's working well these are the screw

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
regulator for me it was 95 par this is

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.510 
regulator for me it was 95 par this is
after<00:04:30.070> I<00:04:30.100> adjust<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:31.090> springs<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:32.280> also<00:04:33.280> the

it just to win more space it's a just a

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.720 
it just to win more space it's a just a
little<00:05:32.690> bit<00:05:33.110> but<00:05:33.560> is<00:05:34.400> something<00:05:36.070> you<00:05:37.070> can<00:05:37.340> see

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
little bit but is something you can see

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.560

the washers how dirty they was there was
with<00:05:42.350> thick<00:05:42.710> grease<00:05:43.660> and<00:05:44.660> I<00:05:44.840> take<00:05:45.140> it<00:05:45.290> out<00:05:45.440> I

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
with thick grease and I take it out I

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:51.060 
with thick grease and I take it out I
clean<00:05:46.730> it<00:05:46.760> up<00:05:47.030> and<00:05:47.590> I<00:05:48.590> put<00:05:48.920> a<00:05:49.280> very<00:05:49.790> very<00:05:50.150> tiny

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
clean it up and I put a very very tiny

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.920 
clean it up and I put a very very tiny
silicon<00:05:52.070> oil<00:05:52.280> I<00:05:53.090> polish<00:05:54.080> everything<00:05:55.930> polished

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
silicon oil I polish everything polished

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.660 
silicon oil I polish everything polished
once<00:05:57.500> and<00:05:58.630> again<00:05:59.630> and<00:05:59.840> again<00:06:00.110> until<00:06:00.350> I<00:06:00.670> had

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.670 
once and again and again until I had

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:11.500 
once and again and again until I had
this<00:06:02.270> results

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:18.370 

you

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.020 

with<00:06:19.380> this<00:06:19.620> bolt<00:06:19.980> I<00:06:20.520> take<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:21.420> regulator<00:06:22.200> out

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
with this bolt I take the regulator out

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.390 
with this bolt I take the regulator out
some<00:06:24.030> some<00:06:24.510> time<00:06:24.750> the<00:06:25.110> regulator<00:06:25.710> is<00:06:25.980> really

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
some some time the regulator is really

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.390 
some some time the regulator is really
stuck<00:06:26.790> in<00:06:27.060> the<00:06:27.390> cylinder<00:06:28.110> so<00:06:28.740> you<00:06:28.800> need<00:06:29.220> this

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
stuck in the cylinder so you need this

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.850 
stuck in the cylinder so you need this
