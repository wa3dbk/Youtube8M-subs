on so let's get this bad boy into the

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.180 
on so let's get this bad boy into the
case<00:02:06.550> and<00:02:07.019> here<00:02:08.019> we<00:02:08.170> go<00:02:08.380> we<00:02:08.740> are<00:02:08.830> going<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.039> put

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
case and here we go we are going to put

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.190 
case and here we go we are going to put
it<00:02:09.280> in<00:02:09.399> this<00:02:09.670> side<00:02:09.910> first<00:02:10.210> because<00:02:10.390> as<00:02:10.720> you<00:02:10.899> can

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
it in this side first because as you can

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.160 
it in this side first because as you can
see<00:02:11.290> those<00:02:12.099> two<00:02:12.550> taps<00:02:12.849> hold<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.270> in<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.569> then

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
see those two taps hold it in and then

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.670 
see those two taps hold it in and then
simply<00:02:15.010> what<00:02:15.250> we<00:02:15.370> do<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.819> we<00:02:16.390> just<00:02:16.569> snapped<00:02:17.410> two

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
simply what we do is we just snapped two

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.430 
simply what we do is we just snapped two
sides<00:02:17.950> in<00:02:18.190> easy<00:02:18.610> as<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.180> guy's<00:02:19.420> this<00:02:19.720> ipad

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
sides in easy as that guy's this ipad

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.729 
sides in easy as that guy's this ipad
case<00:02:20.709> cannot<00:02:21.190> go<00:02:21.580> on<00:02:21.849> any<00:02:22.239> easier<00:02:22.959> I<00:02:23.140> mean<00:02:23.590> this

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
case cannot go on any easier I mean this

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.839 
case cannot go on any easier I mean this
is<00:02:23.800> idiot<00:02:24.430> proof<00:02:25.500> really<00:02:26.500> really<00:02:26.830> simple<00:02:27.129> iPad

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
is idiot proof really really simple iPad

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.650 
is idiot proof really really simple iPad
insertion<00:02:28.750> here<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.830> as<00:02:30.069> you<00:02:30.519> can<00:02:30.700> see<00:02:30.940> okay

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
insertion here so as you can see okay

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.520 
insertion here so as you can see okay
we've<00:02:31.840> got<00:02:32.019> our<00:02:32.140> iPad<00:02:32.530> on<00:02:32.769> we<00:02:33.400> close<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:34.530> we

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
we've got our iPad on we close it we

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.920 
we've got our iPad on we close it we
have<00:02:35.680> our<00:02:35.830> iPad<00:02:36.250> off<00:02:36.720> open<00:02:37.720> on<00:02:38.069> clothes<00:02:39.069> off<00:02:39.310> on

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
have our iPad off open on clothes off on

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.770 
have our iPad off open on clothes off on
off<00:02:40.930> ok<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.340> auto<00:02:42.549> on/off<00:02:42.910> works<00:02:43.420> really

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
off ok so the auto on/off works really

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.770 
off ok so the auto on/off works really
well<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:45.160> does<00:02:45.430> not<00:02:45.549> have<00:02:45.819> any<00:02:46.060> type<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.360> latch

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
well it does not have any type of latch

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.600 
well it does not have any type of latch
here<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:47.380> that's<00:02:47.590> one<00:02:47.799> of<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:47.980> negatives<00:02:48.190> for

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
here so that's one of the negatives for

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.420 
here so that's one of the negatives for
me<00:02:48.760> is<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.930> doesn't<00:02:50.290> really<00:02:50.500> close<00:02:50.980> so

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
me is is that it doesn't really close so

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.250 
me is is that it doesn't really close so
if<00:02:51.730> I'm<00:02:51.910> carrying<00:02:52.299> it<00:02:52.390> around<00:02:52.420> if<00:02:52.900> I'm<00:02:53.019> on<00:02:53.140> the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
if I'm carrying it around if I'm on the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.229 
if I'm carrying it around if I'm on the
train<00:02:53.500> or<00:02:53.680> whatever<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:54.160> don't<00:02:54.910> have<00:02:55.060> this

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
train or whatever I don't have this

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.509 
train or whatever I don't have this
closure<00:02:55.660> here<00:02:56.200> so<00:02:56.470> i'm<00:02:56.680> not<00:02:56.860> sure<00:02:57.099> why<00:02:57.310> they

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
closure here so i'm not sure why they

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.970 
closure here so i'm not sure why they
didn't<00:02:58.450> put<00:02:58.599> the<00:02:58.720> closure<00:02:58.989> on<00:02:59.290> i<00:02:59.530> really<00:02:59.829> like

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.410 
have the 3g model so you've got a nice
opening<00:03:53.019> for<00:03:53.350> your<00:03:54.130> 3g<00:03:54.639> strip<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:55.269> your

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
opening for your 3g strip and your

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
opening for your 3g strip and your
secondary<00:03:55.840> microphone<00:03:56.340> now<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.849> big<00:03:58.290> kind<00:03:59.290> of

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
secondary microphone now the big kind of

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.099 
secondary microphone now the big kind of
benefit<00:03:59.829> of<00:03:59.920> this<00:04:00.040> case<00:04:00.280> is<00:04:00.519> this<00:04:01.180> kicker<00:04:01.630> here

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
benefit of this case is this kicker here

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.690 
benefit of this case is this kicker here
it's<00:04:02.230> kind<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.560> a<00:04:02.650> kickstand<00:04:03.190> kind<00:04:03.519> of<00:04:03.579> like

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
it's kind of a kickstand kind of like

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.400 
it's kind of a kickstand kind of like
your<00:04:03.849> bicycle<00:04:04.329> and<00:04:04.510> it<00:04:04.870> has<00:04:05.019> two<00:04:05.230> different

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
your bicycle and it has two different

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.129 
your bicycle and it has two different
positions<00:04:06.040> it<00:04:06.549> has<00:04:06.730> one<00:04:07.180> little<00:04:07.660> one<00:04:07.810> here

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
positions it has one little one here

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.620 
positions it has one little one here
okay<00:04:08.500> that'll<00:04:08.769> be<00:04:08.889> for<00:04:09.250> typing<00:04:09.760> okay<00:04:10.359> and<00:04:10.569> if

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
okay that'll be for typing okay and if

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.390 
okay that'll be for typing okay and if
you're<00:04:10.840> not<00:04:10.959> using<00:04:11.200> typing<00:04:11.739> it<00:04:11.919> kind<00:04:12.190> of<00:04:12.250> goes

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
you're not using typing it kind of goes

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.479 
you're not using typing it kind of goes
in<00:04:12.669> and<00:04:12.849> the<00:04:13.840> big<00:04:14.079> one<00:04:14.319> here<00:04:14.650> will<00:04:14.919> be<00:04:15.099> for

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
in and the big one here will be for

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.159 
in and the big one here will be for
viewing<00:04:15.880> now<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:16.329> big<00:04:16.539> ones<00:04:16.750> a<00:04:16.840> little<00:04:17.049> bit

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
viewing now the big ones a little bit

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.719 
viewing now the big ones a little bit
harder<00:04:17.560> to<00:04:17.590> get<00:04:17.859> out<00:04:18.039> so<00:04:18.220> you<00:04:18.310> kind<00:04:18.489> of<00:04:18.549> gotta

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
harder to get out so you kind of gotta

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.520 
harder to get out so you kind of gotta
shove<00:04:19.419> your<00:04:19.570> finger<00:04:19.870> in<00:04:19.959> there<00:04:20.109> get<00:04:20.320> it<00:04:20.440> out

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
shove your finger in there get it out

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.120 
shove your finger in there get it out
there<00:04:20.739> so<00:04:21.250> then<00:04:21.489> what<00:04:21.669> you<00:04:21.789> do<00:04:21.909> is<00:04:21.940> you<00:04:22.150> simply

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
there so then what you do is you simply

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.110 
there so then what you do is you simply
flip<00:04:24.130> it<00:04:24.250> over

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
flip it over

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.200 
flip it over
and<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:25.840> have<00:04:26.110> your<00:04:26.470> ridges<00:04:26.949> here<00:04:27.160> now<00:04:27.760> what's

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
and you have your ridges here now what's

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.780 
and you have your ridges here now what's
odd<00:04:28.479> here<00:04:28.960> is<00:04:29.110> as<00:04:29.350> as<00:04:29.560> you<00:04:29.740> can<00:04:30.070> see<00:04:30.310> the

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
odd here is as as you can see the

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.330 
odd here is as as you can see the
viewing<00:04:31.300> angle<00:04:31.840> uses<00:04:32.229> this<00:04:32.410> first<00:04:32.740> rich<00:04:33.040> here

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
viewing angle uses this first rich here

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.480 
viewing angle uses this first rich here
the<00:04:33.820> typing<00:04:34.389> angle<00:04:34.570> uses<00:04:35.199> this<00:04:35.380> one<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:35.949> this

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
the typing angle uses this one and this

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.280 
the typing angle uses this one and this
third<00:04:36.880> Ridge<00:04:37.240> I<00:04:37.479> think<00:04:37.720> is<00:04:37.840> just<00:04:38.020> here<00:04:38.260> for

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
third Ridge I think is just here for

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.620 
third Ridge I think is just here for
aesthetics<00:04:39.010> because<00:04:39.370> none<00:04:40.060> of<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.270> stands

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
aesthetics because none of the stands

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.900 
aesthetics because none of the stands
use<00:04:40.750> that<00:04:40.990> one<00:04:41.169> so<00:04:41.860> when<00:04:42.250> you<00:04:42.340> have<00:04:42.520> it<00:04:42.639> in<00:04:42.760> this

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
use that one so when you have it in this

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.780 
use that one so when you have it in this
angle<00:04:43.360> here<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:44.620> will<00:04:44.710> have<00:04:44.860> a<00:04:44.889> perfect<00:04:45.400> angle

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
angle here it will have a perfect angle

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.960 
angle here it will have a perfect angle
for<00:04:45.820> viewing<00:04:46.389> and<00:04:47.040> now<00:04:48.040> when<00:04:48.220> you<00:04:48.310> put<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.699> big

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
for viewing and now when you put the big

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.420 
for viewing and now when you put the big
kick<00:04:49.270> stand<00:04:49.540> in<00:04:49.840> ok<00:04:50.320> snap<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:50.800> in<00:04:50.949> right<00:04:51.250> there

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
kick stand in ok snap it in right there

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.460 
kick stand in ok snap it in right there
like<00:04:51.610> that<00:04:51.790> and<00:04:52.060> you<00:04:52.690> take<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:52.930> little<00:04:53.229> one

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
like that and you take the little one

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.830 
like that and you take the little one
out<00:04:53.620> ok<00:04:54.520> it<00:04:54.699> is<00:04:54.910> going<00:04:55.090> to<00:04:55.150> be<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.540> perfect

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
out ok it is going to be the perfect

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.529 
out ok it is going to be the perfect
angle<00:04:56.229> for<00:04:56.470> typing<00:04:57.100> okay<00:04:58.000> as<00:04:58.150> you<00:04:58.330> can<00:04:58.360> see

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
angle for typing okay as you can see

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.080 
angle for typing okay as you can see
this<00:04:58.840> angle<00:04:59.229> here<00:04:59.500> there<00:05:00.400> is<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.760> angle

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
this angle here there is the angle

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.670 
this angle here there is the angle
perfect<00:05:02.050> perfect<00:05:02.320> angle<00:05:02.949> for<00:05:02.979> typing<00:05:03.600> ok

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
perfect perfect angle for typing ok

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.820 
perfect perfect angle for typing ok
again<00:05:05.680> as<00:05:05.889> you<00:05:06.610> can<00:05:06.760> see<00:05:07.050> this<00:05:08.050> one<00:05:08.320> is<00:05:08.500> in<00:05:08.680> the

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
again as you can see this one is in the

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.590 
again as you can see this one is in the
second<00:05:09.310> Ridge<00:05:09.520> let's<00:05:09.850> see<00:05:10.000> if<00:05:10.090> I<00:05:10.180> can<00:05:10.330> get<00:05:10.449> it

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
second Ridge let's see if I can get it

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.659 
second Ridge let's see if I can get it
in<00:05:10.720> there<00:05:10.900> so<00:05:11.229> the<00:05:11.440> Lighting's<00:05:11.860> not<00:05:11.979> getting

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
in there so the Lighting's not getting

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.610 
in there so the Lighting's not getting
in<00:05:12.760> there<00:05:12.880> is<00:05:13.060> in<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.600> second<00:05:13.990> rich<00:05:14.110> this

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
in there is in the second rich this

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.100 
in there is in the second rich this
third<00:05:14.979> ridge<00:05:15.250> is<00:05:15.490> not<00:05:15.669> used<00:05:16.000> so<00:05:16.330> I<00:05:16.690> think<00:05:16.870> it's

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
third ridge is not used so I think it's

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.659 
third ridge is not used so I think it's
just<00:05:17.229> there<00:05:17.530> for<00:05:17.560> aesthetics<00:05:18.190> just<00:05:18.430> to<00:05:18.520> make

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
just there for aesthetics just to make

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.370 
just there for aesthetics just to make
everything<00:05:18.850> look<00:05:19.360> even<00:05:20.039> ok<00:05:21.039> guys<00:05:21.220> so<00:05:22.139> on<00:05:23.139> the

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
everything look even ok guys so on the

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.740 
everything look even ok guys so on the
kickstands<00:05:24.070> decent<00:05:25.060> I've<00:05:25.210> been<00:05:25.360> using<00:05:25.570> this

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
kickstands decent I've been using this

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.860 
kickstands decent I've been using this
for<00:05:25.810> a<00:05:26.020> couple<00:05:26.169> of<00:05:26.350> weeks<00:05:26.410> now<00:05:26.740> it<00:05:27.669> does<00:05:28.030> feel<00:05:28.600> a

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
for a couple of weeks now it does feel a

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.440 
for a couple of weeks now it does feel a
little<00:05:29.070> plasticky<00:05:30.070> and<00:05:30.310> I<00:05:30.910> hope<00:05:31.120> that<00:05:31.330> that's

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
little plasticky and I hope that that's

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.940 
little plasticky and I hope that that's
not<00:05:31.690> going<00:05:31.750> to<00:05:31.900> be<00:05:31.930> an<00:05:32.080> issue<00:05:32.260> down<00:05:32.590> the<00:05:32.740> road

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
not going to be an issue down the road

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.750 
not going to be an issue down the road
but<00:05:33.789> it<00:05:34.510> seems<00:05:34.810> to<00:05:34.990> do<00:05:35.139> the<00:05:35.169> job<00:05:35.560> so<00:05:35.979> on<00:05:36.250> the

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
but it seems to do the job so on the

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.540 
but it seems to do the job so on the
bottom<00:05:36.940> here<00:05:37.330> it<00:05:37.539> has<00:05:37.690> that<00:05:38.370> polycarbonate<00:05:39.370> on

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
bottom here it has that polycarbonate on

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.940 
bottom here it has that polycarbonate on
the<00:05:39.700> inside<00:05:40.060> so<00:05:40.870> that's<00:05:41.289> not<00:05:41.560> going<00:05:41.710> to<00:05:41.800> be<00:05:41.830> an
