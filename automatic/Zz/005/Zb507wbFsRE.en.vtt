00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
last year I ran a short program I think

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.120 
last year I ran a short program I think
other<00:01:29.969> than<00:01:30.090> buddy<00:01:30.390> was<00:01:30.659> here<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> was<00:01:31.289> the<00:01:31.770> one

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
other than buddy was here I was the one

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.010 
other than buddy was here I was the one
that<00:01:32.340> did<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.549> least<00:01:32.789> amount<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.179> mileage<00:01:33.600> and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
that did the least amount of mileage and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.139 
that did the least amount of mileage and
we<00:01:34.229> finished<00:01:34.649> in<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> top<00:01:35.490> half<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> field

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
we finished in the top half of the field

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.419 
we finished in the top half of the field
didn't<00:01:36.630> put<00:01:36.749> a<00:01:36.780> scratch<00:01:37.109> on<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.469> car<00:01:37.499> so<00:01:38.159> I

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
didn't put a scratch on the car so I

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.249 
didn't put a scratch on the car so I
guess<00:01:38.969> getting<00:01:39.210> through<00:01:39.539> your<00:01:39.570> first<00:01:39.929> Indy

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
guess getting through your first Indy

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.289 
guess getting through your first Indy
500<00:01:40.530> that's<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.310> main<00:01:41.549> thing<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.939> got<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.119> do

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
500 that's the main thing you got to do

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.919 
500 that's the main thing you got to do
you<00:01:42.479> got<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.659> finish<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.170> race<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.280> think<00:01:44.579> I

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
you got to finish the race and I think I

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.120 
you got to finish the race and I think I
can't<00:01:45.929> remember<00:01:46.259> who<00:01:46.350> told<00:01:46.619> me<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.950> think

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
can't remember who told me but I think

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.980 
can't remember who told me but I think
there<00:01:47.219> was<00:01:47.249> a<00:01:47.340> start<00:01:47.819> about<00:01:48.030> sixty<00:01:48.539> percent<00:01:48.659> of

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
there was a start about sixty percent of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.809 
there was a start about sixty percent of
rookies<00:01:49.319> don't<00:01:49.679> finish<00:01:50.009> their<00:01:50.280> first<00:01:50.520> Indy

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
rookies don't finish their first Indy

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.969 
rookies don't finish their first Indy
500<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.569> I<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.780> see<00:01:51.990> why<00:01:52.229> there's<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.829> many

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
500 and I can see why there's so many

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.709 
500 and I can see why there's so many
little<00:01:53.249> details<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.149> catch<00:01:54.390> her<00:01:54.600> out

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
little details that can catch her out

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.419 
little details that can catch her out
with<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.929> marbles<00:01:55.499> coming<00:01:55.890> into<00:01:56.069> the<00:01:56.159> pits

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
and locking up the rears and whatever it

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:01.340 
and locking up the rears and whatever it
may<00:01:59.039> be<00:01:59.119> you<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.329> saw<00:02:00.539> an<00:02:00.719> edge<00:02:00.869> there<00:02:00.899> for
