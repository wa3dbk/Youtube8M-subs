trying to heal my skin I went home to
the<00:03:17.209> US<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:17.989> did<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.470> week<00:03:18.890> of<00:03:19.100> banana<00:03:19.580> island

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
this for any weight loss at all so I

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.670 
this for any weight loss at all so I
don't<00:03:32.540> even<00:03:32.630> know<00:03:32.840> how<00:03:33.019> much<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:33.350> weigh<00:03:33.500> right

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.420 
yeah I don't recommend it for weight
loss<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:39.110> just<00:03:39.350> recommend<00:03:39.799> it<00:03:39.920> for<00:03:39.950> healing

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
loss I just recommend it for healing

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.610 
loss I just recommend it for healing
your<00:03:40.670> body<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:41.269> giving<00:03:41.630> yourself<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:42.350> break

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
your body and giving yourself a break

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.490 
your body and giving yourself a break
and<00:03:42.890> also<00:03:43.040> it's<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.180> mental<00:03:44.630> challenge<00:03:44.900> as<00:03:45.260> well

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
and also it's a mental challenge as well

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.340 
and also it's a mental challenge as well
because<00:03:46.010> usually<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:46.880> lot<00:03:47.510> of<00:03:47.630> things<00:03:47.810> creep<00:03:48.140> up

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
because usually a lot of things creep up

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.460 
because usually a lot of things creep up
maybe<00:03:48.709> some<00:03:48.829> emotional<00:03:49.670> things<00:03:49.970> or<00:03:50.660> things
