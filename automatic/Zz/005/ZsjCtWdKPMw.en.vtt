00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:12.049
 I started very well and it's a little worse now how do you 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:13.779
 can qualify this beginning of season 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.339
 but before these two games of 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.269
 the player is qualified as satisfactory 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.419
 we have three games in a row in brest on 3 and 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.880
 evans so 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.630
 I would say that the whole is still good better relationship wins support 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.960
 it will still be satisfactory I think you have to win absolutely support all 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.930
 the three points 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.880
 the analysis of malik couturier is rather just the beginning of the fiscal years 2008 2009 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.110
 sco and satisfying 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.490
 two wins two draws and two losses in six league games 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.150
 today in what others are diving into this beginning of the season 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.160
 he put rince on the first day of the championship 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.130
 Angevins make a strong impression 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.770
 it imposes itself with the way three buses 5 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.770
 the goals are signed aurillac who achieves the double and m 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.550
 of this first day angers takes the first place ahead 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.620
 the following week for his first outing in December 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.100
 the sco goes to the island of beauty to face bastia 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.810
 the scoist returns the point of the draw despite several clear opportunities 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.730
 a win and a draw in two games 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.730
 the beginnings they are rather promising for the sco 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.060
 his beginnings are even more encouraging than during the third day 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.960
 Help your friend 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.010
 one of his black beasts 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.470
 entrance and captain 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.470
 paves the way for his teammates 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.080
 it is then imitated by the ball but you have to rent wheat final score 3 0 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.760
 seven points six goals scored and only one conceded in three games 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.830
 everything seems perfectly launched 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.400
 only strasbourg does better with three wins in as many games 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.320
 after a good start in the league it is inevitably expected that the 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.320
 sco landed in clermont for the 4th day of league 2 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:17.470
 the design is perfect 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.650
 the achievement but just as much it's 1-0 for angers 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:24.529
 and it's not over for the diaz angevins will still make talk about 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:25.189
 him 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:29.549
 he offers brunel this little happiness pass the captain angevin not ask 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.289
 the opportunity to double the stake 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:36.669
 this advantage of two goals will not be enough Auvergnats come back just before the 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.819
 half-time on this misjudgment of padovani until then 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:40.979
 impeccable 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.429
 but the turning point of the match was then this imaginary penalty whistled 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:45.819
 by the arbitrator 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.179
 the penalty and transform 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.739
 final score 2 everywhere before the reception of brest we still know 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.739
 a good operation for the club president bernard 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:58.930
 and unfortunately for the proteges of jean-louis garcia 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.790
 the reception of the Bretons will coincide with the beginning of a bad series 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.579
 the angels bows 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.879
 busan home after being led 2 0 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.879
 paul alo'o effoulou will reduce the score 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.659
 mid-second period 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.659
 seco recording its first setback of the season 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.029
 two weeks later as we told you yesterday angers and will be defeated 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:20.709
 with valves 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.799
 the first six days angers finds himself ninth year away 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.769
 jean-louis garcia the Angevin technician greece a first balance sheet 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.709
 today at our good start to the season had allowed us to have a 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.149
 little bit of 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:35.059
 margin compared to 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:39.259
 compared to other teams so we ended up 2 wins 2 draws 2 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.909
 losses 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.430
 it's still the beginning of the season the mean more I would say 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:48.649
 the coming of Nimes and the opportunity to revive us completely 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:52.839
 remember it's precisely Friday, September 19 at 9 pm at the stadium 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:53.819
 Jean-Bouin 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.309
 by then you can find scoliosis tomorrow we will do the 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:01.039
 point on the preparation danger before the match against Nimes I also know 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:07.539
 every Tuesday on Wednesday and Thursday at 20:40 and 22:40 2010 and an hour and ten 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:08.529
 every day 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:11.430
 at 8:10 am 12:40 pm and 3 pm 10
