which is tucked behind right right back
there<00:00:42.170> what's<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.860> when<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.100> did<00:00:44.460> my

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
there what's going on is when I did my

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.540 
there what's going on is when I did my
very<00:00:45.180> first<00:00:45.680> set<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.800> connection<00:00:47.280> when<00:00:47.520> I

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
very first set of connection when I

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.760 
very first set of connection when I
connected<00:00:48.030> everything<00:00:48.270> initially<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.620> my

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
connected everything initially that my

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.110 
connected everything initially that my
very<00:00:50.010> first<00:00:50.309> power<00:00:50.579> up<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.090> was<00:00:51.270> able<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.629> get<00:00:51.780> XM

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
very first power up I was able to get XM

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.479 
very first power up I was able to get XM
with<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.360> preview<00:00:54.690> channel<00:00:55.050> immediately<00:00:55.489> but

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
with the preview channel immediately but

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.979 
with the preview channel immediately but
then<00:00:56.670> when<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> turn<00:00:57.120> things<00:00:57.390> off<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.809> turned

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
then when I turn things off and turned

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.770 
then when I turn things off and turned
it<00:00:58.140> back<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.640> XM<00:00:59.640> went<00:00:59.879> away<00:00:59.969> was<00:01:00.480> no<00:01:00.629> longer

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
it back on XM went away was no longer

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.369 
it back on XM went away was no longer
recognized<00:01:01.410> as<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> source<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:03.199> I've<00:01:04.199> also

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
recognized as a source and I've also

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.090 
recognized as a source and I've also
noticed<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.990> tuner<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.710> head<00:01:07.950> unit

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
noticed that the tuner the the head unit

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.539 
noticed that the tuner the the head unit
is<00:01:08.369> behaving<00:01:08.760> strangely<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:11.340> when<00:01:11.520> I

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
is behaving strangely and so when I

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.980 
is behaving strangely and so when I
press<00:01:11.939> source<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.990> see<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.530> going

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
press source you can see that it's going

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:27.340 
press source you can see that it's going
only<00:01:15.990> from<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:17.130> radio<00:01:18.320> to<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:23.060> USB<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:26.270> and

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
only from the radio to the USB and and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.810 
only from the radio to the USB and and
then<00:01:28.350> when<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:30.110> try<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.140> go<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.409> XM<00:01:31.920> at<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.729> know

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
then when I try to go to XM at you know

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.600 
then when I try to go to XM at you know
it<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.000> skips<00:01:33.299> right<00:01:33.420> over<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.220> I've<00:01:35.220> checked

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
it just skips right over it I've checked

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.310 
it just skips right over it I've checked
my<00:01:35.790> connections<00:01:36.360> I've<00:01:36.540> rewired<00:01:36.930> my

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.300 
out and just I'm not going to belabor
this<00:02:47.069> but<00:02:47.900> there<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.049> is<00:02:49.139> so<00:02:49.500> its<00:02:49.709> connections

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
this but there it is so its connections

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.379 
this but there it is so its connections
are<00:02:50.519> good<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:51.169> little<00:02:52.169> shot<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:53.389> dip

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
are good a little shot of the dip

00:02:54.389 --> 00:03:02.240 
are good a little shot of the dip
switches<00:02:54.569> there<00:02:58.909> the<00:02:59.909> so<00:03:00.799> aside<00:03:01.799> from<00:03:01.859> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
switches there the so aside from the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.009 
switches there the so aside from the
frustration<00:03:02.849> that<00:03:02.879> I'm<00:03:03.060> having<00:03:03.209> with<00:03:03.389> the<00:03:03.599> XM

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
frustration that I'm having with the XM

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.140 
frustration that I'm having with the XM
which<00:03:04.319> is<00:03:04.650> just<00:03:04.919> not<00:03:05.069> even<00:03:05.400> showing<00:03:05.909> up

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
which is just not even showing up

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.920 
which is just not even showing up
anymore<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:08.519> head<00:03:08.760> unit<00:03:08.939> controls<00:03:09.480> behave

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
anymore the head unit controls behave

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.099 
anymore the head unit controls behave
erratically<00:03:10.620> some<00:03:11.129> of<00:03:11.250> them<00:03:11.370> work<00:03:12.109> sometimes

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
erratically some of them work sometimes

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.920 
erratically some of them work sometimes
and<00:03:13.260> some<00:03:13.470> of<00:03:13.590> them<00:03:13.709> don't<00:03:13.909> and<00:03:14.909> it's<00:03:15.510> it's

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
and some of them don't and it's it's

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.960 
and some of them don't and it's it's
variable<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:16.859> it's<00:03:17.220> letting<00:03:17.459> me<00:03:17.669> switch

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
variable so it's letting me switch

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.129 
variable so it's letting me switch
between<00:03:18.930> sources<00:03:20.599> sometimes<00:03:21.599> when<00:03:21.810> i<00:03:21.840> try<00:03:22.109> to

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
between sources sometimes when i try to

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.990 
between sources sometimes when i try to
switch<00:03:22.500> between<00:03:22.680> bands<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.459> won't<00:03:23.609> let<00:03:23.790> me

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
switch between bands that won't let me

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.879 
switch between bands that won't let me
see<00:03:24.209> it's<00:03:24.389> not<00:03:24.629> letting<00:03:24.870> me<00:03:24.989> do<00:03:25.199> it<00:03:25.349> then<00:03:25.590> now

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
see it's not letting me do it then now

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.330 
see it's not letting me do it then now
it<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.329> the<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.750> beep<00:03:27.989> changes<00:03:28.739> sounds<00:03:29.190> it'll

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
it is the the beep changes sounds it'll

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.759 
it is the the beep changes sounds it'll
be<00:03:29.549> a<00:03:29.879> higher<00:03:30.209> pitch<00:03:30.540> when<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:30.989> accepts<00:03:31.680> the

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
be a higher pitch when it accepts the

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.860 
be a higher pitch when it accepts the
command<00:03:32.159> and<00:03:32.400> it'll<00:03:32.669> be<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:32.819> lower<00:03:33.150> pitch<00:03:33.479> when

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
command and it'll be a lower pitch when

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.250 
command and it'll be a lower pitch when
it<00:03:34.019> just<00:03:34.590> ignores<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.220> but<00:03:35.750> there<00:03:36.750> we<00:03:36.840> go<00:03:36.959> see

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
it just ignores it but there we go see

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.640 
it just ignores it but there we go see
now<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.190> follows<00:03:38.549> it<00:03:39.139> follows<00:03:40.139> the<00:03:40.290> command

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
now it follows it follows the command

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.020 
now it follows it follows the command
follows<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.669> command<00:03:42.590> but<00:03:43.590> when<00:03:43.769> i<00:03:43.819> see<00:03:44.819> if<00:03:44.909> i

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
follows the command but when i see if i

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.939 
follows the command but when i see if i
can<00:03:45.209> get<00:03:45.389> it<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.889> bear<00:03:46.889> it<00:03:47.040> ignored<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.430> one

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:48.949 
can get it to bear it ignored that one

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:58.309 
can get it to bear it ignored that one
follow<00:03:49.949> that<00:03:50.280> one<00:03:53.989> so<00:03:55.489> another<00:03:56.489> example<00:03:57.319> when

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
follow that one so another example when

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.830 
follow that one so another example when
i<00:03:58.349> try<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.680> go<00:03:58.919> into<00:03:59.159> the<00:03:59.489> function<00:03:59.970> menu<00:04:00.389> here

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
i try to go into the function menu here

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.159 
i try to go into the function menu here
it<00:04:01.470> just<00:04:01.560> ignores<00:04:02.099> me<00:04:02.340> completely<00:04:02.900> when<00:04:03.900> i<00:04:03.930> try

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
it just ignores me completely when i try

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.490 
it just ignores me completely when i try
to<00:04:04.199> go<00:04:04.409> into<00:04:04.560> setup<00:04:05.810> it'll<00:04:06.810> let<00:04:06.989> me<00:04:07.139> go<00:04:07.260> into

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
to go into setup it'll let me go into

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.499 
to go into setup it'll let me go into
setup<00:04:07.739> occasionally<00:04:08.729> but<00:04:09.000> then<00:04:09.209> when<00:04:09.389> I'm

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:09.509 
setup occasionally but then when I'm

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:11.449 
setup occasionally but then when I'm
start<00:04:09.870> switching<00:04:10.169> through<00:04:10.530> it'll<00:04:10.949> jump<00:04:11.220> back

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
start switching through it'll jump back

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.119 
start switching through it'll jump back
out<00:04:11.699> and<00:04:12.060> back<00:04:12.540> out<00:04:12.720> of<00:04:12.930> that<00:04:13.079> setup<00:04:13.409> menu<00:04:13.919> and

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
out and back out of that setup menu and

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.420 
out and back out of that setup menu and
then<00:04:14.220> go<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:15.650> whatever<00:04:16.650> source<00:04:16.979> I<00:04:17.130> happen

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
then go to the whatever source I happen

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.949 
then go to the whatever source I happen
to<00:04:17.459> be<00:04:17.609> on<00:04:17.729> before<00:04:18.090> I<00:04:18.120> went<00:04:18.299> into<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.659> setup

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
to be on before I went into the setup

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.949 
to be on before I went into the setup
mode<00:04:19.169> so<00:04:19.620> let's<00:04:19.919> try<00:04:20.099> that<00:04:20.280> again<00:04:20.690> so<00:04:21.690> it's

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
mode so let's try that again so it's

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.570 
mode so let's try that again so it's
it's<00:04:22.380> letting<00:04:22.650> me<00:04:22.830> do<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.190> and<00:04:23.310> then<00:04:23.400> when<00:04:23.550> I

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
it's letting me do it and then when I

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.470 
it's letting me do it and then when I
start<00:04:23.940> moving<00:04:24.570> down

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
start moving down

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.990 
start moving down
I<00:04:25.510> want<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:25.870> let's<00:04:26.800> never<00:04:27.070> let<00:04:27.310> me<00:04:27.430> get<00:04:27.580> this<00:04:27.700> up

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
I want to let's never let me get this up

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.500 
I want to let's never let me get this up
see<00:04:28.480> it<00:04:28.630> just<00:04:28.840> jumped<00:04:29.110> right<00:04:29.140> out<00:04:29.550> so<00:04:30.550> that's

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
see it just jumped right out so that's

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.860 
see it just jumped right out so that's
weird<00:04:35.160> it's<00:04:36.160> sometimes<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.330> lets<00:04:37.510> me<00:04:37.600> go<00:04:37.810> to

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
weird it's sometimes it lets me go to

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.070 
weird it's sometimes it lets me go to
preset<00:04:38.380> sometimes<00:04:38.980> it<00:04:39.160> doesn't<00:04:40.080> it's

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080

ignoring me trying to get back into
function<00:04:44.310> it's<00:04:45.310> just<00:04:45.550> letting<00:04:45.850> me<00:04:46.000> flail<00:04:46.810> here

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
function it's just letting me flail here

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.910 
function it's just letting me flail here
this<00:04:49.360> is<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.630> most<00:04:49.810> i've<00:04:50.050> ever<00:04:50.080> seen<00:04:50.560> of<00:04:50.590> the

volume works and then sometimes it

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:44.850 
volume works and then sometimes it
doesn't<00:05:37.900> and<00:05:38.910> then<00:05:40.200> when<00:05:41.200> i<00:05:41.230> try<00:05:41.530> to<00:05:43.740> going<00:05:44.740> up

think you get the idea clearly there are

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.300 
think you get the idea clearly there are
some<00:05:52.900> issues<00:05:53.050> here<00:05:53.260> i<00:05:53.560> don't<00:05:53.680> know<00:05:53.980> if<00:05:54.160> i'm

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
some issues here i don't know if i'm

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.210 
some issues here i don't know if i'm

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
dealing with a bad head unit which would

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.340 
dealing with a bad head unit which would
be<00:05:57.400> the<00:05:57.670> second<00:05:58.120> bad<00:05:58.330> head<00:05:58.600> unit<00:05:58.870> in<00:05:59.050> a<00:05:59.080> row

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
be the second bad head unit in a row

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.350 
be the second bad head unit in a row
i've<00:05:59.590> gotten<00:05:59.890> from<00:06:00.040> alpine<00:06:00.430> from<00:06:00.850> crutchfield

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
if it's a bad XM tuner unit I this again

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.000 
if it's a bad XM tuner unit I this again
it<00:06:06.220> would<00:06:06.340> be<00:06:06.610> two<00:06:07.480> lemons<00:06:08.170> in<00:06:08.350> a<00:06:08.440> row<00:06:08.650> because

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
it would be two lemons in a row because

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.190 
it would be two lemons in a row because
they've<00:06:09.160> sent<00:06:09.430> me<00:06:09.550> a<00:06:09.580> new<00:06:10.000> one<00:06:10.390> of<00:06:10.510> those<00:06:10.720> as

they've sent me a new one of those as
well<00:06:12.120> more<00:06:13.120> likely<00:06:13.330> there<00:06:13.660> is<00:06:13.690> some<00:06:14.050> issue

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
well more likely there is some issue

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.110 
well more likely there is some issue
