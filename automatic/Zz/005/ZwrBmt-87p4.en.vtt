00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.050
 good in this video we will see the most 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.050
 basic information on the source of light in 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.570
 sell both in render blend and in 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.000
 sell game engine 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.099
 in this first part we are going to see 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.619
 concepts applicable to all types 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.770
 of light then we will specify according to types 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.960
 of light we start from this file lights 01 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.880
 blend point that you have linked in the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.369
 comments it's about a scene 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.609
 simple in that we have a floor on it 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.680
 that 25 balls are placed with the material 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.320
 by default of blender and we have 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.140
 two lights one associated with the camera 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.839
 call light bulb type camera and other 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.210
 simply call light located at 10 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.370
 units on the origin centered on 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.250
 the balls and with the orientation by 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.140
 defect this light is of punctual type in 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.329
 first place if in the out line the 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.340
 click on the camera icon to 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.010
 side of the camera light this is deactivated 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.440
 and in the window we see only the effect of 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.140
 the spot light if we also turn off the 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.239
 another light by clicking on the icon we see all 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.550
 the black scene except for the dark gray 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.650
 of the background if we perform rendering with efe 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.720
 12 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.610
 we see the obvious that without lights in 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.070
 principle we do not see the objects though 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.650
 let's see the sky to get a 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.920
 natural lighting outdoors 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:25.970
 we can go to the world tab and 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.030
 activate the environment lighting section 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.100
 lighting environment with the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.100
 default parameters pulse 12 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.640
 we can see the scene with a 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.130
 quite natural lighting although not 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.230
 there is no active light has been obtained 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.600
 by global lighting methods that do not 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.729
 they work in the game engine I close the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.490
 window and this feature is active 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.930
 so that I do not interfere with the lights 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.860
 I do the rendering again 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.860
 black scene again 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.579
 if we launch the link engine p 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.079
 To our surprise, everything is seen as if 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.079
 we would not have turned off the lights 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.130
 in the window or outline er I go back to 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.569
 make visible in point light to turn off 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.810
 the light of the camera on the motor 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:19.660
 games we select them and in their tab 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.660
 of data we put energy to 0 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.700
 if now we launch the game engine we see 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.570
 the image with the look it has on the 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.250
 3d window view important except for the 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.500
 fact that I can not turn off the lights 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.210
 using the down diner icon it seems 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.240
 that the 3d bio window shows the scene 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.250
 as you will see in gaming this always 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.200
 that we are in textured mode and with 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.170
 our rendering configuration of 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.530
 link engine in gls we remind you where 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.390
 is the engine change 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.430
 blender game 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.170
 I'm going to the rendering tab of the 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:00.010
 Properties window in the settings panel 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.739
 and here is gls d 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.930
 there is another detail that does not do by default 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.489
 the window 3d view the discard of 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.860
 polygons with their backs to the observer is 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.799
 the game engine tries to save the 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.720
 back polygons do not paint them in 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.819
 the side panel of properties key n 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.769
 I go to the display section and to 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.019
 avoid unpleasant surprise I can 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.329
 activate here so I'm on notice and 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.930
 I can correct the mesh close the panel 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.970
 n key I selected the spot light and I 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.230
 I go to the properties tab we're going to 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.840
 see properties common to the 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.930
 different sources of light here I can 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.030
 change the type of light point light in a 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.060
 point that emits in all directions 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.819
 sanz light from parallel rays or very source 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.109
 distant as the sun spot spotlight that is 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.400
 as a spot light but with a 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.359
 emission direction and an angle 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.670
 limited in a uniform light that usually 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.739
 use of filling area a light with 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.900
 surface that as we see is not seen in the 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.389
 game engine I leave it at the end in light 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.639
 punctual to see how light emits 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.230
 punctual with her selected I'm going to 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.940
 the 3d view window with the cursor 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.670
 up pulse 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.770
 zy drag 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.050
 as I can see the light emits in all 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.690
 directions and when approaching the ground I see 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.090
 over the balls that light up the side 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.100
 that looks towards her escape to leave her 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.500
 in place again among the 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.930
 general parameters of light to part 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.960
 type are the color of light that 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.080
 you can change by clicking here your energy 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.669
 the amount of light it emits when there is 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.110
 many lights you have to be careful of 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.690
 that the scene is not saturated or burned 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.790
 for example if I upload it to 10 dragging 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.550
 with the mouse over it starts to appear 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.040
 This saturation effect I leave to 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.890
 final in 2 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.890
 for cases where there is a lot of light in 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.849
 an area can put a negative light 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:52.009
 clicking here to subtract the lighting 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.229
 It is also convenient to organize 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.059
 objects and lights by layers by 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.309
 defect a light illuminates the objects of 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:00.229
 all activated layers I put a 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:02.990
 link to the video that will introduce the 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.819
 layers in blender however if I pulse in 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.159
 disney air only 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.469
 this light will affect only the objects of 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:11.330
 This layer can prevent calculations 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:13.819
 unnecessary 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.500
 these options allow us to light 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:18.259
 contribute only to some of the 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.840
 terms if you click a specular this 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.930
 light will not produce reflections 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.479
 specular 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.320
 in the end I leave it active if I pulse in 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.660
 diffuse 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.910
 this light will not contribute to the term 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.889
 diffuse in this case you see only the 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.780
 highlight specular I leave it with the 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.490
 default options that contributes to 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.350
 the two terms 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.690
 those values ​​allow us to govern the 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.880
 reach of light the law of fall with the 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.660
 distance and maximum distance 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.130
 defect the law of fall is inverse 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.090
 with the square of the distance that what 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.310
 more natural 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.560
 distance represents the distance to 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:57.070
 that the intensity is half of the total 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.570
 if this style is disabled or the 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.969
 distance that you cancel if you are 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.309
 active 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:04.649
 in the preview part above 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:06.490
 we have an idea of how it illuminates a 

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:08.289
 surface light 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.210
 these nation parameters with the 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:14.380
 distance do not appear in the lights of 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:17.560
 type m nissan that do not stick with the 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:21.690
 I leave it in point I continue in the 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.690
 next part of the video thank you
