00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.970 

but<00:02:41.570> wires<00:02:42.570> are<00:02:42.810> going<00:02:43.080> crazy<00:02:43.290> get<00:02:43.800> out<00:02:43.950> of

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
but wires are going crazy get out of

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.950 
but wires are going crazy get out of
there<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.640> can<00:02:44.820> replay<00:02:45.150> levels<00:02:45.390> will<00:02:45.720> usually

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
there you can replay levels will usually

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.630 
there you can replay levels will usually
so<00:02:46.380> if<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.530> got<00:02:46.680> one<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:46.980> those<00:02:47.070> specific

FL yeah um these routes that I do it got
our<00:02:59.580> way<00:02:59.730> right<00:03:00.210> now<00:03:00.450> I'm<00:03:00.630> not<00:03:00.810> doing<00:03:01.110> a

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
our way right now I'm not doing a

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.680 
our way right now I'm not doing a
speedrun<00:03:01.440> right<00:03:01.860> now<00:03:02.040> but<00:03:02.370> if<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.180> follow<00:03:03.510> the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
speedrun right now but if you follow the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.660 
speedrun right now but if you follow the
same<00:03:03.870> route<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.290> taking<00:03:04.710> and<00:03:05.010> did<00:03:05.580> it

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
same route on taking and did it

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.270 
same route on taking and did it
perfectly<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.840> shouldn't<00:03:07.320> be<00:03:07.890> good<00:03:08.070> enough

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
for a speedrun cutoff time and I try to

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.740 
for a speedrun cutoff time and I try to
do<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.780> for<00:03:16.140> each<00:03:16.170> piece<00:03:17.070> Lola<00:03:17.550> to<00:03:17.690> try<00:03:18.690> to

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
do that for each piece Lola to try to

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.170 
do that for each piece Lola to try to
use<00:03:18.960> the<00:03:19.110> best<00:03:19.320> route<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:19.920> go<00:03:20.220> ahead<00:03:20.310> everybody

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.920 

yeah<00:03:26.340> speedruns<00:03:27.340> like<00:03:27.519> part<00:03:27.790> they<00:03:28.329> have<00:03:28.780> that

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
yeah speedruns like part they have that

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.690 
yeah speedruns like part they have that
guy's<00:03:29.549> speed<00:03:30.549> routes<00:03:30.790> are<00:03:31.090> on<00:03:32.430> because<00:03:33.430> things

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
guy's speed routes are on because things

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.020 
guy's speed routes are on because things
do<00:03:33.909> turn<00:03:34.120> red<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:34.659> you<00:03:35.260> don't<00:03:35.439> die<00:03:35.620> as<00:03:35.829> easily
