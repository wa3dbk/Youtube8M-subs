00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.210
 hello how about friends this time 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.879
 let's learn to play the song of 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.980
 the caifanes the cell that explodes is 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.660
 a very simple song one of the 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.070
 first songs that I learned and not 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.440
 you will spend a lot of work 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.450
 learn it too good let's start 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.330
 by the introduction we are going to place the 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.520
 index and ring fingers on the frets 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.750
 517 first and second rope 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.440
 respectively and we're going to touch the 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.440
 Following way 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.460
 how is this after we play 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.810
 you can do for your own you do it with 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.490
 the fingers 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:48.740
 the right hand twice on the 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:54.490
 French that you indicate after you travel 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.490
 the frets down for the same 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:05.150
 then go through a fret the index finger 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:08.710
 and enter the middle finger to get to 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.710
 the second for third fret 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.500
 and 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.260
 and then I just upload the index to 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.760
 second fret 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.760
 and here I do a hammer 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.440
 stump second first second and without 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.530
 press of your rope placed the finger 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.530
 medium on the third third fret 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.530
 and ended up playing the hesse chord and 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.560
 minor is the first part of the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.829
 introduction then came back with what 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.829
 same 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.790
 for me 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.790
 i 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.600
 here are some harmonics but you can 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.600
 do it with the ropes 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.649
 pressing the top chords then 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.649
 complete is like this 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
 i 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.959
 ah 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.850
 ok and there starts the first part of the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.830
 song where the first kiss came verse 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.300
 after the introduction we are going to 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.090
 follow a progression that we are going to 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.090
 repeat a lot throughout the song 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.230
 in fact the whole song is 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.540
 practically that progression that is what 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.170
 what are we going to do, let's play later 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.170
 of introduction 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.950
 let's touch F sharp minor sun 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.920
 Sun 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.920
 the greatest 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.620
 I'm older and we're going to touch the figure another 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.620
 time in this way 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.920
 and we're going to finish and now we're going to create 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.370
 after the last figure without putting a 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.750
 family sign and what follows is touching 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.140
 the same progression 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.730
 ok sc twice for the song after 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.760
 comes an intermediate part where 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.270
 let's touch the same progression 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.760
 to finish 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.190
 in most times to the figure we are going to 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.570
 enter the major chords 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.570
 in this way 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:36.949
 Y 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.639
 is all there is to do in this 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.379
 song is really very simple 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.449
 Now what happens is that you want to repeat 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:48.129
 that same progression and in the end you're going to 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.129
 have to touch the figure again 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.570
 well there's the song I hope you 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.270
