sight<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.860> fact<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.640> game<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
sight of the fact that the game is a

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.180 
sight of the fact that the game is a
race<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:47.340> do<00:00:48.079> want<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.200> get<00:00:49.440> your<00:00:49.649> checkers

to do this that we're not going to go

into in this video series by taking a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.190 
into in this video series by taking a
pip<00:01:06.750> count<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:08.369> other<00:01:08.909> things<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.600> want

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
pip count and other things but you want

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.399 
pip count and other things but you want
to<00:01:10.290> at<00:01:10.530> least<00:01:10.770> develop<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.580> sense<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.409> who

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
to at least develop a sense for who

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.399 
to at least develop a sense for who
might<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:14.010> ahead<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.360> race<00:01:15.600> around<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
might be ahead in the race around the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.340 
might be ahead in the race around the
board<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.070> good<00:01:17.820> backgammon<00:01:18.390> players<00:01:18.960> will

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
board and good backgammon players will

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.010 
board and good backgammon players will
do<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.860> but<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.880> mentioned<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.689> good

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
do that but we mentioned that good

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.530 
do that but we mentioned that good
backgammon<00:01:22.560> players<00:01:23.159> know<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> game<00:01:24.240> is

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
backgammon players know that the game is

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.620 
backgammon players know that the game is
more<00:01:25.049> than<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.530> race<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.880> they<00:01:27.180> want<00:01:27.479> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
more than a race and that they want to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.630 
more than a race and that they want to
develop<00:01:28.170> some<00:01:28.439> strategies<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:30.140> try<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.640> take

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
develop some strategies to try to take

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.170 
develop some strategies to try to take
key<00:01:33.060> points<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.100> one<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.369> things<00:01:35.729> that

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
key points and one of the things that

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.950 
key points and one of the things that
you<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:37.220> to<00:01:40.189> realize<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.790> no<00:01:42.270> one's<00:01:42.570> going

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you do is to realize that no one's going

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.740 
you do is to realize that no one's going
to<00:01:43.110> repeal<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.159> laws<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.700> chance<00:01:45.000> from<00:01:45.509> you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
to repeal the laws of chance from you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.410 
to repeal the laws of chance from you
that<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.770> make<00:01:47.310> them<00:01:47.520> work<00:01:47.759> for<00:01:47.790> you

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
that you have to make them work for you

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.260 
that you have to make them work for you
and<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:51.530> good<00:01:52.530> backgammon<00:01:53.070> players<00:01:53.670> will

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
and and so good backgammon players will

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.899 
and and so good backgammon players will
often<00:01:54.810> move<00:01:55.439> checkers<00:01:56.570> into<00:01:57.570> place<00:01:58.520> in<00:01:59.520> order

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
often move checkers into place in order

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.899 
often move checkers into place in order
to<00:02:00.119> build<00:02:00.329> key<00:02:00.780> points<00:02:01.439> they<00:02:02.250> see<00:02:02.310> their

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
to build key points they see their

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.630 
to build key points they see their
checkers<00:02:03.479> not<00:02:03.840> as<00:02:04.079> liabilities<00:02:05.009> but<00:02:05.340> as

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
checkers not as liabilities but as

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.730 
checkers not as liabilities but as
assets<00:02:06.360> what<00:02:06.689> would<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.990> be<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.350> see<00:02:07.380> your

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
assets what would it be to see your

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.639 
assets what would it be to see your
checkers<00:02:08.220> as<00:02:08.399> liabilities<00:02:09.179> well<00:02:09.899> remember<00:02:10.470> it

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
checkers as liabilities well remember it

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.860 
checkers as liabilities well remember it
takes<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.250> certain<00:02:11.670> amount<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.180> numbers

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
takes a certain amount of numbers

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.199 
takes a certain amount of numbers
on<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.080> dice<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.709> take<00:02:13.950> your<00:02:14.190> checkers<00:02:14.640> around

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
on the dice to take your checkers around

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.289 
on the dice to take your checkers around
the<00:02:15.780> board<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.560> take<00:02:16.799> them<00:02:17.040> off<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.700> if<00:02:18.150> you

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
the board and take them off and if you

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.720 
the board and take them off and if you
see<00:02:18.540> them<00:02:18.750> as<00:02:18.870> liabilities<00:02:19.709> then<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.459> see

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
see them as liabilities then you see

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.500 
see them as liabilities then you see
each<00:02:20.970> checker<00:02:21.510> as<00:02:23.060> something<00:02:24.060> that's<00:02:24.209> going

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
each checker as something that's going

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.860 
each checker as something that's going
to<00:02:24.629> eat<00:02:24.900> up<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.440> many<00:02:25.590> dice<00:02:26.010> rolls<00:02:26.750> getting<00:02:27.750> it

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
to eat up so many dice rolls getting it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.979 
to eat up so many dice rolls getting it
off<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.349> board<00:02:28.680> but<00:02:29.280> that's<00:02:29.549> not<00:02:29.940> how<00:02:30.360> good

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
off the board but that's not how good

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.770 
off the board but that's not how good
backgammon<00:02:31.590> players<00:02:32.190> look<00:02:33.060> at<00:02:33.209> their<00:02:33.420> playing

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
backgammon players look at their playing

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.649 
backgammon players look at their playing
pieces<00:02:34.319> they<00:02:35.099> look<00:02:35.400> at<00:02:35.489> their<00:02:35.700> playing<00:02:36.000> pieces

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
pieces they look at their playing pieces

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.589 
pieces they look at their playing pieces
as<00:02:36.840> assets<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:38.220> can<00:02:38.459> provide<00:02:39.000> them<00:02:39.299> safe

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
as assets that can provide them safe

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.039 
as assets that can provide them safe
places<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.470> land<00:02:40.709> if<00:02:41.159> they<00:02:41.340> make<00:02:41.610> points<00:02:42.239> that

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
places to land if they make points that

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.400 
places to land if they make points that
can<00:02:43.379> block<00:02:43.950> their<00:02:44.280> opponents<00:02:45.000> point<00:02:45.329> that<00:02:46.140> can

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
can block their opponents point that can

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.330 
can block their opponents point that can
be<00:02:46.650> placed<00:02:47.099> in<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.579> position<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:49.340> threatens

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
be placed in a position that threatens

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.699 
be placed in a position that threatens
their<00:02:50.609> opponent's<00:02:51.269> movement<00:02:51.930> because<00:02:52.410> they

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
their opponent's movement because they

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.000 
their opponent's movement because they
might<00:02:52.950> threaten<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.609> hit<00:02:53.849> their<00:02:54.030> opponent<00:02:54.660> and

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
might threaten to hit their opponent and

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.099 
might threaten to hit their opponent and
so<00:02:56.010> good<00:02:56.310> backgammon<00:02:56.790> players<00:02:57.299> are<00:02:57.720> going<00:02:57.930> to

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
so good backgammon players are going to

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.970 
so good backgammon players are going to
try<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.650> make<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.310> odds<00:02:59.459> work<00:02:59.940> for<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.980> work

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
try to make the odds work for you work

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.520 
try to make the odds work for you work
for<00:03:02.459> them<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:04.079> ways<00:03:05.239> that<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:07.200> work

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
for them in in ways that that that work

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.210 
for them in in ways that that that work
and<00:03:08.030> they<00:03:09.030> will<00:03:09.209> try<00:03:09.659> to<00:03:10.430> leave<00:03:11.430> checkers<00:03:12.150> in

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
and they will try to leave checkers in

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.399 
and they will try to leave checkers in
areas<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.640> give<00:03:14.940> them<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.269> most<00:03:15.450> chance<00:03:15.930> to

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
areas that give them the most chance to

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.080 
areas that give them the most chance to
make<00:03:16.620> points<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.310> we'll<00:03:17.459> say<00:03:17.669> a<00:03:17.700> little<00:03:17.819> bit

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
make points and we'll say a little bit

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.479 
make points and we'll say a little bit
more<00:03:18.329> about<00:03:18.569> this<00:03:18.810> when<00:03:19.049> we<00:03:19.500> talk<00:03:19.919> about<00:03:19.950> a

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
more about this when we talk about a

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.140 
more about this when we talk about a
running<00:03:21.030> game<00:03:21.889> so<00:03:22.889> good<00:03:23.130> backhand<00:03:23.400> players

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
running game so good backhand players

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.870 
running game so good backhand players
see<00:03:24.540> their<00:03:24.750> checkers<00:03:25.349> as<00:03:25.620> assets<00:03:26.220> not<00:03:26.609> as

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
see their checkers as assets not as

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.479 
see their checkers as assets not as
liabilities<00:03:27.780> they're<00:03:28.410> aware<00:03:28.889> of<00:03:29.129> the<00:03:29.280> race

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
liabilities they're aware of the race

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.909 
liabilities they're aware of the race
but<00:03:29.819> they<00:03:30.000> realize<00:03:30.389> the<00:03:30.720> game<00:03:30.900> is<00:03:31.200> more<00:03:31.530> than<00:03:31.769> a

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
but they realize the game is more than a

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:35.270 
but they realize the game is more than a
race<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.660> there's<00:03:33.660> another<00:03:34.139> thing<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:35.010> kind

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
rest of this video series good backhand

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.559 
rest of this video series good backhand
players<00:03:42.930> have<00:03:43.560> an<00:03:44.150> overall<00:03:45.889> goal<00:03:46.889> or<00:03:47.569> strategy

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
players have an overall goal or strategy

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.970 
players have an overall goal or strategy
that<00:03:49.079> they<00:03:49.290> are<00:03:49.470> trying<00:03:49.949> to<00:03:50.269> accomplish

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
that they are trying to accomplish

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.449 
that they are trying to accomplish
depending<00:03:52.980> on<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.370> dice<00:03:53.639> rolls<00:03:54.150> they<00:03:54.599> get<00:03:54.930> and

depending on the dice rolls they get and

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.890 
depending on the dice rolls they get and
so<00:03:56.459> they're<00:03:56.790> not<00:03:57.000> just<00:03:57.060> making<00:03:57.959> moves<00:03:58.730> as

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
so they're not just making moves as
