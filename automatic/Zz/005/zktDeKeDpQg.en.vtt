00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:05.600 
what's up YouTube so I want to do

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.049 
what's up YouTube so I want to do
another<00:00:05.870> follow-up<00:00:06.200> video<00:00:06.500> from<00:00:07.430> when<00:00:07.880> we

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 
another follow-up video from when we

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.509 
another follow-up video from when we
inserted<00:00:08.630> the<00:00:09.349> door<00:00:09.530> panel<00:00:09.860> back<00:00:09.889> on<00:00:10.220> the<00:00:10.309> car

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
inserted the door panel back on the car

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.209 
inserted the door panel back on the car
with<00:00:10.849> the<00:00:11.059> resin<00:00:11.660> and<00:00:11.750> hardener<00:00:12.019> curing<00:00:12.950> and

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
with the resin and hardener curing and

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:14.709 
with the resin and hardener curing and
this<00:00:13.759> is<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.059> next<00:00:14.299> step<00:00:14.419> in<00:00:14.599> the

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
this is the next step in the

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:15.369 
this is the next step in the
fiberglassing

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
fiberglassing

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.300 
fiberglassing
process<00:00:16.250> so<00:00:16.760> what<00:00:17.480> you're<00:00:17.570> going<00:00:17.660> to<00:00:17.720> do<00:00:17.900> is

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
process so what you're going to do is

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.890 
process so what you're going to do is
simply<00:00:19.310> take<00:00:19.850> the<00:00:20.000> door<00:00:20.150> panel<00:00:20.450> back<00:00:20.480> off<00:00:21.310> and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
simply take the door panel back off and

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.890 
simply take the door panel back off and
pull<00:00:23.900> all<00:00:24.050> your<00:00:24.230> tape<00:00:24.410> around<00:00:25.400> the<00:00:25.520> edges<00:00:25.900> pop

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
pull all your tape around the edges pop

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.440 
pull all your tape around the edges pop
the<00:00:27.050> mold<00:00:27.230> off<00:00:27.470> take<00:00:28.220> all<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:28.550> tape<00:00:28.790> off<00:00:29.060> the

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
the mold off take all the tape off the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.750 
the mold off take all the tape off the
back<00:00:29.600> side<00:00:29.840> of<00:00:29.870> the<00:00:29.960> mold<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:30.380> here<00:00:31.310> you<00:00:31.520> have

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
back side of the mold and here you have

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.959 
back side of the mold and here you have
your<00:00:32.090> final<00:00:32.629> mold<00:00:32.960> came<00:00:33.710> out<00:00:33.860> really<00:00:34.760> nice

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
your final mold came out really nice

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.889 
your final mold came out really nice
it's<00:00:35.420> uh<00:00:35.539> it's<00:00:36.109> good<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:36.410> hard<00:00:36.649> I<00:00:37.149> mean<00:00:38.149> it's

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
it's uh it's good and hard I mean it's

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.950 
it's uh it's good and hard I mean it's
pretty<00:00:39.230> stout<00:00:40.390> obviously<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:41.510> edges<00:00:41.780> aren't

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
pretty stout obviously the edges aren't

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.040 
pretty stout obviously the edges aren't
that's<00:00:42.739> like<00:00:43.010> at<00:00:43.329> you<00:00:44.329> know<00:00:44.480> maybe<00:00:44.719> a<00:00:44.809> layer

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
that's like at you know maybe a layer

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.720 
that's like at you know maybe a layer
and<00:00:45.289> then<00:00:45.620> this<00:00:45.739> is<00:00:45.890> probably<00:00:46.249> three<00:00:46.550> layers

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
and then this is probably three layers

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.559 
and then this is probably three layers
but<00:00:47.800> so<00:00:48.800> as<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:49.489> can<00:00:49.579> see<00:00:49.640> you<00:00:50.239> can<00:00:50.359> look<00:00:50.420> at

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:50.569 
but so as you can see you can look at

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:52.149 
but so as you can see you can look at
the<00:00:50.659> door<00:00:50.809> itself<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:51.469> see<00:00:51.589> the<00:00:51.710> curvature<00:00:51.949> of

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
the door itself and see the curvature of

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.410 
the door itself and see the curvature of
the<00:00:52.339> door<00:00:52.519> it<00:00:53.239> fits<00:00:54.190> perfectly

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
the door it fits perfectly

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.149 
the door it fits perfectly
so<00:00:56.420> at<00:00:56.749> this<00:00:56.929> step<00:00:57.260> what<00:00:57.739> you're<00:00:57.859> gonna<00:00:57.949> want

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
so at this step what you're gonna want

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.299 
so at this step what you're gonna want
to<00:00:58.219> do<00:00:58.339> is<00:00:58.609> again<00:00:59.390> taken<00:01:00.260> take<00:01:00.739> your<00:01:00.920> take<00:01:01.280> a

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
to do is again taken take your take a

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.240 
to do is again taken take your take a
sharpie<00:01:02.109> outline<00:01:03.109> exactly<00:01:03.679> where<00:01:03.859> you<00:01:04.040> want

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
sharpie outline exactly where you want

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.890 
sharpie outline exactly where you want
your<00:01:04.400> final<00:01:04.760> cut<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.089> be<00:01:05.239> where<00:01:05.479> you<00:01:05.600> want<00:01:05.630> this

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
your final cut to be where you want this

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.800 
your final cut to be where you want this
mold<00:01:06.110> to<00:01:06.229> stop<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.860> then<00:01:07.670> cut<00:01:08.149> that<00:01:08.180> edge<00:01:08.540> and

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
mold to stop and then cut that edge and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.149 
mold to stop and then cut that edge and
what<00:01:08.960> I'm<00:01:09.049> gonna<00:01:09.140> do<00:01:09.290> here<00:01:09.619> instead<00:01:09.860> of

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
what I'm gonna do here instead of

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.490 
what I'm gonna do here instead of
following<00:01:10.490> this<00:01:10.579> line<00:01:10.850> I'm<00:01:11.299> going<00:01:11.899> to<00:01:12.049> go

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
following this line I'm going to go

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.530 
following this line I'm going to go
upwards<00:01:12.979> to<00:01:13.340> follow<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.850> contour<00:01:14.270> of<00:01:14.299> this

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
upwards to follow the contour of this

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.469 
upwards to follow the contour of this
this<00:01:15.170> piece<00:01:15.860> of<00:01:16.070> interior<00:01:16.939> leather<00:01:17.180> on<00:01:17.390> my

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
this piece of interior leather on my

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.050 
this piece of interior leather on my
door<00:01:17.659> I'm<00:01:18.409> gonna<00:01:18.530> go<00:01:18.710> up<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:19.219> little<00:01:19.490> bit<00:01:19.759> and

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
door I'm gonna go up a little bit and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.819 
door I'm gonna go up a little bit and
then<00:01:20.659> come<00:01:20.930> across<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:22.090> again<00:01:23.090> this<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.380> you

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
then come across and again this the you

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.289 
then come across and again this the you
know<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.130> first<00:01:25.310> line<00:01:25.549> you<00:01:25.700> make<00:01:25.850> is<00:01:26.000> only<00:01:26.119> to

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
know this first line you make is only to

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:27.399 
know this first line you make is only to
give<00:01:26.420> you<00:01:26.509> an<00:01:26.600> idea<00:01:26.659> of<00:01:27.049> where<00:01:27.229> it's<00:01:27.350> you

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
give you an idea of where it's you

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.170 
give you an idea of where it's you
fiberglass<00:01:27.920> over<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:28.789> always<00:01:29.000> want<00:01:29.149> to

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
fiberglass over you always want to

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.420 
fiberglass over you always want to
fiberglass<00:01:29.600> pastor<00:01:30.100> pastor<00:01:31.100> Martin<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:33.430> then

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
fiberglass pastor pastor Martin so then

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.149 
fiberglass pastor pastor Martin so then
the<00:01:34.909> next<00:01:35.149> step<00:01:35.329> is<00:01:35.359> to<00:01:35.840> once<00:01:36.229> you<00:01:36.320> mark<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.680> do

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
the next step is to once you mark it do

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.039 
the next step is to once you mark it do
your<00:01:37.250> final<00:01:37.430> mark<00:01:37.759> cut<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:38.509> with<00:01:38.630> an<00:01:38.689> aerosol

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
your final mark cut it with an aerosol

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.690 
your final mark cut it with an aerosol
or<00:01:39.109> jigsaw<00:01:39.740> or<00:01:39.770> whatever<00:01:40.159> tools<00:01:40.520> you<00:01:40.670> have

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
or jigsaw or whatever tools you have

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.389 
or jigsaw or whatever tools you have
available<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:41.329> cut<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:41.810> then<00:01:42.560> I<00:01:43.009> always<00:01:43.280> like

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
available to cut and then I always like

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.980 
available to cut and then I always like
to<00:01:43.579> take<00:01:43.700> some<00:01:43.880> like<00:01:44.000> 80<00:01:44.149> grit<00:01:44.329> sandpaper<00:01:44.570> and

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
to take some like 80 grit sandpaper and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.679 
to take some like 80 grit sandpaper and
really<00:01:45.340> sand<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.460> edges<00:01:46.609> down<00:01:46.909> after<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.450> cut

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
really sand the edges down after I cut

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.310 
really sand the edges down after I cut
it<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:48.020> get<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.679> real<00:01:48.859> smooth<00:01:49.189> and<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.840> then

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
it to get it real smooth and and then

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.410 
it to get it real smooth and and then
you<00:01:51.530> know<00:01:51.619> don't<00:01:52.250> stand<00:01:52.460> too<00:01:52.670> much<00:01:52.729> or<00:01:53.060> cut<00:01:53.240> too

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
you know don't stand too much or cut too

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.760 
you know don't stand too much or cut too
much<00:01:53.450> give<00:01:53.869> yourself<00:01:54.259> a<00:01:54.289> little<00:01:54.380> leeway<00:01:54.560> to

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
much give yourself a little leeway to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.029 
much give yourself a little leeway to
cut<00:01:55.070> more<00:01:55.250> or<00:01:55.579> sand<00:01:56.299> more<00:01:56.509> if<00:01:57.140> that's<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.859> case

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
cut more or sand more if that's the case
