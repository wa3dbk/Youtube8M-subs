00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.840

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.730
 and goodbye 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:15.650
 the color is not hate without wanting to put

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.909

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.320
 there is another for example 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.260
 This will be the carbon look so 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.350
 size that in strongly 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.850
 the trails are nicer all 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.850
 More bad news and you 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.619
 well it is much more the technique of goku in 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.319
 where is the writing would disappear for 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.600
 have my side to hit me this does not 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.310
 they let go of that is here in that good 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.509
 let's see is that I do not want me 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.170
 chase the dragon so it does not load 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.970
 the drive box but well what more and you 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.730
 dan and the four more traces now we're going 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.650
 to burn the emerald and while 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.870
 we are going to look for others this one is that it seems 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.950
 of the rest one but has not released anything 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.950
 let's hit him 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.620
 Well, we kill the two of us 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.620
 to espanyol 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.660
 it now so we can drop the coast 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.200
 minister vale dragon are not here 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.569
 not worth 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.569
 now there is the one of three emeralds 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:47.680
 has given us let's try the rector's 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:50.579
 do not break things is normal and I know 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.579
 It makes me weird to see you 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.630
 here of emerald there is of all the 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.319
 lapis lazuli we are going to hit him as you see 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.939
 it releases more than one for each pearl 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.939
 but sometimes they let go of us 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.909
 I'm sorry but I'm interested 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.530
 there is the lapis lazuli this can be 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:21.659
 throw 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.659
 we can not launch it but well let's 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.230
 and Spain and we are going to break this one here 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:33.360
 because I like Spanish 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.360
 by not hesitating if he had not hesitated 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.580
 it cost us 6 of reston it's fine is 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.700
 that's cool because it lets you loose more than one 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:47.360
 is cool we will see if we find 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.420
 others there 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.110
 ballack diamond fast you know very 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.110
 little of this one 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.459
 I also got the perfect diamond pearl 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.420
 let's go to see how this is going 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.280
 we are burning 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.920
 the dragon to see if it does not give us much 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.290
 for ass please 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.280
 here are four together a good time 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.250
 looking for the diamonds 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.579
 I will be better 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.789
 do not put yourself in the middle is gone 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.949
 you want to leave the dragon so I like 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.770
 help me if strong I do not know why you 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.139
 they want to hit the dragon now 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.370
 your thought to give by saco by here 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.880
 taking 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.560
 but of course there is another april 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.290
 navy blue on the diamond 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.840
 I want to know how many days to keep 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.860
 Spain 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.860
 it was clear 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:48.429
 let's get vision potion 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:52.599
 nightly and there were a lot of diamonds 

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:54.750
 juntitos and many of them go behind 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:58.009
 from the Dragon 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:01.800
 to you to your 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:05.009
 times that monkeys to hit the dragon 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.199
 and this endorsement is off, it's worth excusing 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.750
 because if they are doing works and 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.389
 then there will be some more cuts in 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.159
 the video but that's this is a vessel 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.600
 it is very very cool not yet seen the one of 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:20.160
 iron 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:22.290
 and there is also a diamond encounter 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.730
 on Saturdays three diamonds we are going to 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.370
 try the charcoal and let's find one 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.870
 of iron if it does not come out we can put 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.020
 us in the problem that's why 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.020
 but if we find it then it is more 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.570
 see you diamond rest here there are a few 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.480
 the diamond ones are still cool with light 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.760
 de andrÃ©s already mandates 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.910
 for whom nothing of iron in a view 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.910
 of 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.389
 Maybe it is like the diamond 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.350
 I thought I had not seen any and 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.580
 it turns out that there are like 45 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.439
 here 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.509
 and then it's not what we have here for 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:56.509
 farm en ador is infinite 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.200
 and not 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.030
 I do not see 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.160
 none of iron I do not see any 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.670
 different, better said 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.010
 but here emerald diamonds do not but 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.360
 iron that is what interests me and 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.620
 right now 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.260
 the iron track 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.260
 for them as I can not find it I'm going to 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:24.720
 I will be out here is very similar to 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.720
 of gold but very similar 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.470
 no no 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:38.440
 I also wanted to let go had 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.479
 so much carbon is worth only 5 of 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.479
 coal and let's see how much we give the 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:45.610
 iron gives us 4 iron is pretty 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:48.699
 Pimp say as I say or it can 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.199
 get a lot of little things I like 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:52.510
 very much the truth because we can come 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:54.820
 here to with followers simply 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.340
 killing bugs but hey this is the 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.810
 model you see the brothers that I'm going to 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.810
 put this title the minor centers 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:07.180
 you have the inscriptions for 1.6 points 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:10.840
 4 is installed with forge and so on 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.639
 always and nobody is the heap this has 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.120
 already been until another 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:15.120
 bye
