00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
breaker it clicks I'll show you when I

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.180 
breaker it clicks I'll show you when I
tear<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.149> apart<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:52.050> anyways<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.890> an<00:00:53.010> odd

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
tear it apart but anyways it's in an odd

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.310 
tear it apart but anyways it's in an odd
position<00:00:53.520> if<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.660> one<00:00:54.930> here<00:00:55.170> I'll

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
position if you see this one here I'll

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.090 
position if you see this one here I'll
pull<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.649> one<00:00:55.800> up<00:00:56.449> what<00:00:57.449> they<00:00:57.600> do<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:58.260> they

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
pull this one up what they do is they

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.240 
pull this one up what they do is they
invert<00:00:59.670> how<00:01:00.149> long<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.629> see<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.250> but

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
invert how long you can see that but

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.369 
invert how long you can see that but
they<00:01:02.430> invert<00:01:02.879> those<00:01:03.120> terminals<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.080> can't

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
they invert those terminals so you can't

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.570 
they invert those terminals so you can't
just<00:01:04.619> pull<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.970> breaker<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.689> and

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
just pull a breaker out of one and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.100 
just pull a breaker out of one and
moving<00:01:08.580> across<00:01:08.850> they<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.570> don't<00:01:09.810> want<00:01:09.990> you

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
moving across they just don't want you

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.039 
moving across they just don't want you
to<00:01:10.170> do<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.970> don't<00:01:11.970> ask<00:01:12.210> me<00:01:12.420> why<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.900> just

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
to do that don't ask me why it's just

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:13.910 
to do that don't ask me why it's just
the<00:01:13.170> way<00:01:13.290> they<00:01:13.470> are

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the way they are

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.050 
the way they are
so<00:01:14.549> they've<00:01:14.790> inverted<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.200> a

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
so they've inverted it so that it is a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.969 
so they've inverted it so that it is a
really<00:01:18.060> narrow<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:19.650> hard<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
really narrow that is not hard to

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.010 
really narrow that is not hard to
replace<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.850> got<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.509> your<00:01:21.689> fingers

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
replace you just got to get your fingers

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.590 
replace you just got to get your fingers
in<00:01:22.049> there<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.530> do<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.650> trick

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
in there and do the trick

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.690 
in there and do the trick
