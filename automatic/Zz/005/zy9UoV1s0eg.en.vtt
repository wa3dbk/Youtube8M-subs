white<00:00:57.809> black<00:00:58.020> ops<00:00:58.230> sucks<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:59.399> community<00:00:59.879> is

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
white black ops sucks the community is

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.580 
white black ops sucks the community is
probably<00:01:00.570> one<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.899> worst<00:01:00.989> communities

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
probably one of the worst communities

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.210 
probably one of the worst communities
ever<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:02.399> gaming<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.949> think<00:01:04.949> that's<00:01:05.070> one

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
ever for gaming and I think that's one

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.100 
ever for gaming and I think that's one
of<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> reasons<00:01:05.610> why<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.600> gank<00:01:06.840> so

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
frustrating he's just because the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.670 
frustrating he's just because the
community<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.750> was<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> trail<00:01:10.170> too<00:01:10.409> I'm
