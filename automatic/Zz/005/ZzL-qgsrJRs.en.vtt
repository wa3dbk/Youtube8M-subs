painting<00:00:55.289> table<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.710> tilted<00:00:56.100> forward<00:00:56.579> so

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
painting table is tilted forward so

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.880 
painting table is tilted forward so
gravity<00:00:57.600> pulls<00:00:57.960> these<00:00:58.140> new<00:00:58.320> colors<00:00:58.680> down

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
gravity pulls these new colors down

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:09.749 
gravity pulls these new colors down
through<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> underlying<00:00:59.670> wet<00:00:59.969> paint

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.060 

I'll<00:01:10.759> wipe<00:01:11.240> up<00:01:11.509> any<00:01:11.689> excess<00:01:11.840> paint<00:01:12.680> from<00:01:12.920> the

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
I'll wipe up any excess paint from the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.990 
I'll wipe up any excess paint from the
edges<00:01:14.049> then<00:01:15.049> quickly<00:01:15.560> I'll<00:01:16.220> dab<00:01:16.640> at<00:01:16.850> these

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
edges then quickly I'll dab at these

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.779 
edges then quickly I'll dab at these
still<00:01:17.329> wet<00:01:17.539> colors<00:01:17.930> with<00:01:18.110> a<00:01:18.140> tissue<00:01:18.789> lifting

some<00:01:20.030> of<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:20.240> paint<00:01:20.450> back<00:01:20.630> up<00:01:20.979> this<00:01:21.979> further

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
some of the paint back up this further

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.730 
some of the paint back up this further
distorts<00:01:23.090> their<00:01:23.180> uniformity<00:01:24.049> giving<00:01:24.590> them

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
distorts their uniformity giving them

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.120 
distorts their uniformity giving them
more<00:01:24.979> variance<00:01:25.640> of<00:01:25.820> values<00:01:26.890> once<00:01:27.890> these

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
more variance of values once these

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.609 
more variance of values once these
colors<00:01:28.490> have<00:01:28.700> stabilized<00:01:29.390> but<00:01:29.899> before<00:01:30.409> they

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
colors have stabilized but before they

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.770 
colors have stabilized but before they
have<00:01:30.740> completely<00:01:31.220> dried<00:01:31.520> I'll<00:01:32.210> tilt<00:01:32.600> the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
have completely dried I'll tilt the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.620 
have completely dried I'll tilt the
painting<00:01:33.140> back<00:01:33.409> into<00:01:33.770> its<00:01:33.890> normal<00:01:34.250> position

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
painting back into its normal position

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.419 
painting back into its normal position
you<00:01:35.630> can<00:01:35.810> see<00:01:35.840> that<00:01:36.229> I've<00:01:36.320> got<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.590> cloud<00:01:37.009> with

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
you can see that I've got a cloud with

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.289 
you can see that I've got a cloud with
very<00:01:37.850> hard<00:01:38.149> edges<00:01:39.280> so<00:01:40.280> while<00:01:40.459> the<00:01:40.610> sky<00:01:40.880> paints

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
very hard edges so while the sky paints

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.449 
very hard edges so while the sky paints
are<00:01:41.450> still<00:01:41.780> damp<00:01:42.080> I'll<00:01:42.380> begin<00:01:42.709> scrubbing<00:01:43.369> at

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
are still damp I'll begin scrubbing at

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.760 
are still damp I'll begin scrubbing at
them<00:01:43.640> with<00:01:43.819> a<00:01:43.850> stiff<00:01:44.270> bristled<00:01:44.720> brush<00:01:44.959> loaded

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
them with a stiff bristled brush loaded

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.429 
them with a stiff bristled brush loaded
with<00:01:46.069> water<00:01:46.360> since<00:01:47.360> these<00:01:47.600> colors<00:01:47.990> have<00:01:48.200> not

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
with water since these colors have not

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.559 
with water since these colors have not
fully<00:01:48.679> dried<00:01:49.130> yet<00:01:49.369> this<00:01:49.729> newly<00:01:50.149> introduced

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
fully dried yet this newly introduced

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.120 
fully dried yet this newly introduced
water<00:01:50.899> will<00:01:51.140> cause<00:01:51.319> what<00:01:51.770> I<00:01:51.799> call<00:01:52.189> flow<00:01:52.789> back<00:01:53.030> I

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
water will cause what I call flow back I

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.710 
water will cause what I call flow back I
want<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.310> clouds<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:55.849> be<00:01:55.970> distorted<00:01:56.569> and

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
want the clouds to be distorted and

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.410 
want the clouds to be distorted and

underlying damp paint can help create

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.440 
underlying damp paint can help create
some<00:02:02.030> great<00:02:02.479> cloud<00:02:02.810> edges<00:02:03.759> so<00:02:04.759> by<00:02:04.909> scrubbing

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
some great cloud edges so by scrubbing

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.080 
some great cloud edges so by scrubbing
on<00:02:05.569> damp<00:02:05.840> paper<00:02:06.140> I'll<00:02:06.950> get<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.280> combination<00:02:07.729> of

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
on damp paper I'll get a combination of

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.220 
on damp paper I'll get a combination of
scrubbed<00:02:08.479> edges<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.080> flow<00:02:09.440> back<00:02:09.470> edges<00:02:11.200> now<00:02:12.200> I

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
scrubbed edges and flow back edges now I

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.810 
scrubbed edges and flow back edges now I
don't<00:02:12.350> want<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.650> scrub<00:02:12.890> all<00:02:13.100> of<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.400> edges

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
don't want to scrub all of the edges

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.310 
don't want to scrub all of the edges
I'll<00:02:14.180> leave<00:02:14.510> some<00:02:14.750> hard

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
I'll leave some hard

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.640 
I'll leave some hard
I<00:02:15.350> want<00:02:15.950> variety<00:02:16.310> at<00:02:17.209> times<00:02:17.720> I'll<00:02:18.049> lift<00:02:18.410> some

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
I want variety at times I'll lift some

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.270 
I want variety at times I'll lift some
of<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.829> loosened<00:02:19.220> paint<00:02:19.459> with<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.820> tissue<00:02:21.040> as<00:02:22.040> I

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
of the loosened paint with a tissue as I

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.860 
of the loosened paint with a tissue as I
scrub<00:02:22.609> I'll<00:02:22.880> carry<00:02:23.120> some<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.569> lifted

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.729 
paint down into the white cloud area
this<00:02:26.359> will<00:02:26.600> help<00:02:26.900> give<00:02:27.109> the<00:02:27.230> cloud<00:02:27.440> some

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
this will help give the cloud some

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.680 
this will help give the cloud some
dimension<00:02:28.340> so<00:02:28.549> that<00:02:28.579> it's<00:02:28.819> not<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.090> flat<00:02:29.510> white
