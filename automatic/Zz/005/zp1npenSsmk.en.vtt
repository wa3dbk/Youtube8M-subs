with<00:01:01.559> heating<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:03.120> we'll<00:01:03.960> see<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
with heating and we'll see that in a

with heating and we'll see that in a
minute<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.979> our<00:01:05.100> first<00:01:05.400> day<00:01:05.760> with

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
minute this is our first day with

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.380 
minute this is our first day with
snowfall<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.890> are<00:01:08.100> under<00:01:08.520> our<00:01:08.670> first<00:01:09.000> snow

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390

been<00:02:54.989> able<00:02:55.109> to<00:02:55.349> keep<00:02:55.530> this<00:02:55.769> building<00:02:56.370> with

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
been able to keep this building with

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.860 
been able to keep this building with
very<00:02:57.030> little<00:02:57.419> heating<00:02:57.959> at<00:02:58.169> all<00:02:59.239> at<00:03:00.239> least<00:03:00.299> 20

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
very little heating at all at least 20

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.520 
very little heating at all at least 20

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
degrees above the ambient temperature

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.309 
degrees above the ambient temperature
it's<00:03:04.530> been<00:03:04.889> really<00:03:05.700> it's<00:03:06.359> really<00:03:06.599> warm<00:03:06.959> and

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
it's been really it's really warm and

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.780 
it's been really it's really warm and
comfortable<00:03:08.160> in<00:03:08.519> this<00:03:08.849> space<00:03:10.069> right<00:03:11.069> now<00:03:11.280> we

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
comfortable in this space right now we

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.870 
comfortable in this space right now we
are<00:03:11.819> setting<00:03:12.419> the<00:03:12.540> baseline<00:03:13.049> for<00:03:13.470> heating

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
are setting the baseline for heating

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.150 
are setting the baseline for heating
we're<00:03:14.880> using<00:03:15.150> an<00:03:15.450> oil<00:03:15.989> heater<00:03:18.230> that<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.530> at<00:03:19.829> its

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
we're using an oil heater that is at its

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.059 
we're using an oil heater that is at its
lowest<00:03:20.790> setting<00:03:21.120> usually<00:03:22.019> actually<00:03:22.709> right

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
lowest setting usually actually right

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.009 
lowest setting usually actually right
now<00:03:23.220> it's<00:03:23.459> at<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.639> middle<00:03:24.120> setting<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:24.569> 900

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
now it's at the middle setting and 900

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.150 
now it's at the middle setting and 900
watts<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.870> is

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
watts and it is

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.810 
watts and it is
change<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.610> space<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.810> we<00:03:31.320> know<00:03:31.560> what<00:03:32.010> kind<00:03:32.610> of

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
change the space so we know what kind of

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.570 
change the space so we know what kind of
energy<00:03:33.030> we<00:03:33.420> need<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:34.080> keep<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:34.680> space<00:03:35.250> and

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
energy we need to keep this space and

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.370 
energy we need to keep this space and
then<00:03:36.090> we<00:03:36.270> will<00:03:36.450> design<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.810> miniaturized

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
then we will design a miniaturized

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.060 
then we will design a miniaturized
renewable<00:03:38.130> system<00:03:38.520> to<00:03:38.700> fit<00:03:39.740> this<00:03:40.740> is<00:03:40.950> our

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
renewable system to fit this is our

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.940 
renewable system to fit this is our
boost<00:03:41.310> heater<00:03:41.900> when<00:03:42.900> we<00:03:42.930> wanted<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.350> be<00:03:43.590> on

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
boost heater when we wanted to be on

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.010 
boost heater when we wanted to be on
cold<00:03:44.340> days<00:03:44.550> to<00:03:44.730> spend<00:03:44.970> down<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.330> like<00:03:45.480> 17

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
cold days to spend down to like 17

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.470 
cold days to spend down to like 17
degrees<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:47.400> we've<00:03:47.580> had<00:03:47.610> an<00:03:48.030> internal

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
degrees so we've had an internal

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.840 
degrees so we've had an internal
temperature<00:03:48.630> that<00:03:49.140> was<00:03:49.290> about<00:03:49.470> 40<00:03:49.980> we<00:03:50.610> wanted

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
temperature that was about 40 we wanted

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.340 
temperature that was about 40 we wanted
to<00:03:50.880> see<00:03:51.120> how<00:03:51.270> quickly<00:03:51.570> we<00:03:51.810> could<00:03:51.990> get<00:03:52.200> it<00:03:52.320> back

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
to see how quickly we could get it back

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.860 
to see how quickly we could get it back
up<00:03:52.740> to<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.010> livable<00:03:53.550> temperature<00:03:54.030> about<00:03:54.270> 65

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
up to a livable temperature about 65

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.810 
up to a livable temperature about 65
degrees<00:03:55.260> which<00:03:55.620> we<00:03:55.830> which<00:03:56.310> is<00:03:56.340> our<00:03:56.580> target

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
degrees which we which is our target

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.410 
degrees which we which is our target
temperature<00:03:57.360> for<00:03:57.930> other<00:03:58.890> place<00:03:59.130> over<00:04:00.090> here<00:04:00.240> we

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
temperature for other place over here we

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.240 
temperature for other place over here we
have<00:04:00.570> our<00:04:00.600> telltale<00:04:01.200> bottle<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.650> water<00:04:01.800> should

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
have our telltale bottle of water should

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.160 
have our telltale bottle of water should
we<00:04:02.370> end<00:04:02.610> up<00:04:02.760> with<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.000> freeze<00:04:03.420> overnight<00:04:03.780> and

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
we end up with a freeze overnight and

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.450 
we end up with a freeze overnight and
then<00:04:05.300> it'll<00:04:06.300> drown<00:04:06.780> out<00:04:07.070> any<00:04:08.070> kind<00:04:08.370> of

then it'll drown out any kind of

then it'll drown out any kind of
temperature<00:04:08.910> died<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:10.670> that's<00:04:11.670> it<00:04:11.940> showing

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
temperature died and that's it showing

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.290 
temperature died and that's it showing
you<00:04:12.840> around<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.170> place<00:04:13.200> but<00:04:13.710> it<00:04:13.830> is<00:04:14.550> a<00:04:14.580> very

you around the place but it is a very

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
nice warm space but when you're

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.880 
nice warm space but when you're
