right now you're on this line follows

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.670 
right now you're on this line follows
white<00:00:55.860> line<00:00:56.100> out<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:58.170> keep<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.560> down

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
white line out and just keep going down

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.140 
white line out and just keep going down
here<00:00:59.100> follow<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.700> trail<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:04.880> turn<00:01:05.880> all<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
here follow this trail I turn all the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.030 
here follow this trail I turn all the
way<00:01:06.180> around<00:01:09.530> now<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.740> probably<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
way around now this is probably the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.160 
way around now this is probably the
really<00:01:11.490> hard<00:01:11.730> part<00:01:11.820> because<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.780> can't<00:01:13.020> mess

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
really hard part because you can't mess

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.310 
really hard part because you can't mess
up<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.500> here<00:01:13.680> you'll<00:01:13.890> fall<00:01:14.070> off<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.900> gotta

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
up on here you'll fall off so you gotta

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.840 
up on here you'll fall off so you gotta
gun<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.920> basically<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:19.250> go<00:01:20.250> all<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.580> way<00:01:20.610> over

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
gun it basically and go all the way over

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.260 
gun it basically and go all the way over
here<00:01:20.880> under<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.600> thing<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:23.040> you're<00:01:24.030> under

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
here under this thing and you're under

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.149 
here under this thing and you're under
the<00:01:24.479> main<00:01:24.960> place

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
I'll see I don't know how to do circles

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.599 
I'll see I don't know how to do circles
yet<00:01:32.380> I'm<00:01:32.679> still<00:01:32.799> trying<00:01:33.069> to<00:01:33.100> figure<00:01:33.189> that<00:01:33.460> out

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
yet I'm still trying to figure that out

yet I'm still trying to figure that out
I<00:01:34.229> don't<00:01:35.229> know<00:01:35.319> how<00:01:35.439> to<00:01:35.499> set<00:01:35.799> it<00:01:35.829> up<00:01:35.950> set<00:01:36.369> it<00:01:36.429> up

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
follow this over here and again this is

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.499 
follow this over here and again this is
not<00:01:53.319> patched<00:01:53.890> it's<00:01:54.640> April<00:01:55.240> sixteenth<00:01:55.890> 2011

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
not patched it's April sixteenth 2011

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.940 
not patched it's April sixteenth 2011
and<00:01:58.509> just<00:01:58.750> go<00:01:58.929> all<00:01:59.079> the<00:01:59.170> way<00:01:59.229> out<00:01:59.319> here<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.829> you

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
and just go all the way out here and you

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.109 
and just go all the way out here and you
can<00:02:03.099> basically<00:02:03.399> just<00:02:03.700> float<00:02:03.969> around

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
can basically just float around

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.479 
can basically just float around
everywhere<00:02:04.689> just<00:02:05.590> stay<00:02:05.860> next<00:02:06.069> to<00:02:06.189> it<00:02:06.340> so<00:02:06.429> you

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:06.489 
everywhere just stay next to it so you

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:07.919 
everywhere just stay next to it so you
know<00:02:06.640> so<00:02:06.819> it<00:02:06.909> doesn't<00:02:07.149> put<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:07.360> back<00:02:07.509> onto<00:02:07.750> the

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
know so it doesn't put you back onto the

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:14.039 
know so it doesn't put you back onto the
track<00:02:12.329> all<00:02:13.329> right<00:02:13.450> now<00:02:13.569> you<00:02:13.629> gotta<00:02:13.780> gun<00:02:14.019> it

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
track all right now you gotta gun it

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.470 
track all right now you gotta gun it
over<00:02:14.290> here<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:14.650> don't<00:02:14.680> fall<00:02:15.069> back<00:02:15.280> on<00:02:15.459> it

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:28.800 

all<00:02:19.480> right<00:02:19.599> again<00:02:19.840> stay<00:02:20.110> next<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.440> it

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.580
