00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.419
 very good guys that so good in this 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.089
 new goal let's talk a little 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.450
 about the new future top of range of 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.460
 samsung the samsung galaxy 5 that would come 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.960
 accompanied by another curved version that 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.939
 still we do not know exactly if 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.679
 will be the nou 5 expo will be the s6 plus in 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.539
 principle everything points that it will be 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.890
 second I said ls six ex plus 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.539
 but good as you are saying yet 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.949
 there is nothing confirmed and precisely 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.599
 well how do you know in this video all 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.999
 the rumors and everything that is predicted 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.119
 who is going to have these smartphones we are going to 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.119
 watch 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.860
 what would be the samsung galaxy nou 5 in 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.360
 principle everything points that like 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.489
 in the 6th they have given a new 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.860
 appearance 30 to s 5 have not replaced 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.680
 the materials and they have given him a wash 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.879
 full face your smartphone 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.190
 apparently in terms of the range and not 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.739
 they will do the same as soon as 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.920
 dimensions the phone would have high 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.619
 more or less between 152 and 22 millimeters a 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.050
 153 as 44 millimeters 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.490
 its length would be between 76 11 mm 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:18.119
 and 77 31 and its width would be hovering 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.950
 7 with 69 millimeters this I have not said 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.170
 but all this comes from some 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.820
 sources that are usually quite reliable 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.979
 they are still rumors, it may be that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.500
 something is not like that but they are sources 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.570
 well-known that usually not 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.610
 they tend to make mistakes when they say 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.229
 for example the m 9 will be such 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.540
 It forms as it is then 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.790
 present 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.590
 it's like they said with those 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.450
 specifications so good the most 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.920
 It is likely that this phone has 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.170
 the specifications that we are 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.090
 commenting in this video if we go to 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.060
 theme of the screen we would be between a 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.040
 screen 2k and 4k in principle will be 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.380
 a rough screen as it is 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.490
 I would book in the 4k for next year 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.260
 2016 with your new samsung galaxy s 7 la 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.940
 screen would continue with the same size what 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.150
 that in principle would reduce a little 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.320
 the edges but it would be 5.7 inches and 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.840
 as in all samsung phones 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.820
 it would be a screen super amoled all 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.730
 this would come coated with glass 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.990
 gorilla glass 4 and it is possible that by 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.030
 back also we find ourselves 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.980
 this type of crystal since as I 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.170
 I comment at the beginning it is very likely that 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.640
 give you this change of appearance in 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.360
 how much to the processor how will you know the 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.650
 samsung galaxy s 6 had a success 7,420 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.330
 which is a processor that was 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.400
 manufactured by samsung itself has not 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.080
 resorted to other brands and the truth that 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.180
 it's a processor that performed well 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.500
 well then good in this know 5 in 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.370
 principle will have a version 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.870
 slightly 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.069
 improved that are going to be a small 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.750
 improvements that would be the model 7.422 all 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.510
 this would be accompanied by four 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.150
 gigabytes of ram in terms of cameras 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.610
 would have a main camera of 16 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.730
 megapixels and the front one 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.349
 5 megapixel camera and good as 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.299
 you will know as I always tell you and many 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.459
 Sometimes I mention the topic of more 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.590
 megapixels do not imply having better 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.200
 camera or take better photos since 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.760
 include many other factors in 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.069
 to software as you will be intuiting 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.680
 would come with android lollipop is commented 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.780
 which will be with version 5.1 point 1 and 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.239
 will logically come with the layer of 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.220
 touchwiz personalization your battery 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.379
 It would be a battery of three million amps 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.840
 that like I said with the 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.790
 camera is simply a figure there 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.290
 that analyze the performance you have and 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.109
 that more milliamps will not involve 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.940
 more duration and basically this would be 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.519
 the general aspects that we can well 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.049
 stand out above the know 5 since 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.400
 well you will be intuiting that as for 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.109
 connectivity would be a phone 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.140
 fully equipped as it would have wifi 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.350
 bluetooth 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.000
 all kinds of connections 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.040
 a range top so good now 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.410
 we go to the curved terminal that will present 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.260
 parallel to number 5 that as commented to the 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.209
 principle in principle will be the s6 plus 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.190
 as physical appearance would be very 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.200
 similar to s 6 is the only thing that 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.690
 obviously being the plus version 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.459
 they would give it until they reach 57 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.110
 inches both the back then 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.300
 it would be glass front with the 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.040
 two curves and now we move on to the topics 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.630
 of the specifications of this terminal 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.580
 as sure many of you are thinking 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.050
 will be for the specifications very 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.480
 similar to those we have commented on 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.769
 the 95 and it 's like that you're not going to have many 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.660
 which are common for example I have in the 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.070
 screen I will not have because the 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.780
 rumors indicate that they will be the same 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.130
 screen but on the subject of 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.320
 all callers processors 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.430
 quite the attention since everything points 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.150
 I was going to have a processor 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.730
 snapdragon 808 this processor we have 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.560
 seen on lg 4 and how good 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.419
 Entrepreneurs of 6 cores that yields 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.730
 well but if for example what you stop in 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.830
 how much performance with the s6 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.240
 it is still notice that the g4 stays something 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.540
 back then the fact that 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.700
 implement this process 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.740
 in the new version of this 6 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.550
 it would be something strange since good at 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.960
 performance 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.900
 would be something below but that 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.550
 Nor would it be such that so 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.380
 would implement more run would have 4 gb of 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.330
 ram so good we would have to see 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.190
 how would it look with regard to camera 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.590
 exactly the same 5 megapixels for 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.690
 the front and 16 megapixels for the 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.400
 back in battery the same three thousand 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.590
 milliamps and something that is also 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.020
 rumored is in terms of the camera the 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.330
 photos would also take raw format that 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.860
 also something that we saw in c4 that for 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.200
 those who do not know what is the raw format 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.240
 As you know, the images are usually 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.010
 take in jpg because it will also allow us 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.690
 the option to take raw that is another 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.970
 format which has much more 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.190
 information that for example a jpg or a 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.350
 png and would be mostly focused on 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.510
 those people who are dedicated to the subject 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.070
 of professional photography then if 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.930
 we want to treat the images for example 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.880
 with photoshop you can try an image 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.710
 with in raw format to have more 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.510
 information then we would be better 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.040
 images good to conclude we have 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.660
 to talk about the price and date of 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.430
 departure in terms of price has not been 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.620
 said nothing but we assume that it will have 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.580
 it will continue its line of super prices 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.580
 to the tone 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:55.900
 around 700 800 euros the model 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:59.439
 basic the nou 5 and by around the 900 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.449
 euros ls 6 plus in terms of date of 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:03.099
 departure at first the logical thing was 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.289
 think that like other years I was going to 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:07.060
 go out in the phase ii face in the ifa 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.889
 of berlin but apparently the rumors 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.409
 they're saying that it's going so much to 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.780
 present how to go on sale before 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.310
 that it's Berlin's ifa so 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.530
 well we will be very aware of when 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.879
 this terminal is presented and good guys 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.409
 this would be big features what 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.599
 we know about these two new 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.190
 terminals by samsung I am 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:26.169
 a true lover of the notebook range 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.509
 I love the nautas I currently use 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:31.030
 a know 3 but good more than the range does not 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:32.530
 I love big phones and 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.780
 made the range notes that is a very range 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.060
 powerful and samsung has done well in 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.190
 this range did not in fact I liked 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.110
 acquire the s6 because as for 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.419
 aesthetic was very beautiful and a telephone 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.550
 very powerful but I did not finish 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.430
 convince the fact of the 5 inches and 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.569
 for that reason if you are this new range 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.809
 samsung does it in the most 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:54.669
 ls 6 surely end up acquiring that 

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:57.129
 phone another alternative that I have in 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:59.379
 I know if I still out but another 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:01.389
 pepinazo so good surely for 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:02.949
 change mobile I'll wait for you to be 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:05.289
 present on this new phone and I 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:06.550
 I'll decant between one of these two so 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:08.289
 nothing more guys these are the rumors 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.119
 which are known as substitutions are 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:12.099
 only rumors but they are rumors that 

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:13.449
 come from reliable sources and below 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:15.610
 comments I would love it if you guys 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:17.199
 it is your opinion about these 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.849
