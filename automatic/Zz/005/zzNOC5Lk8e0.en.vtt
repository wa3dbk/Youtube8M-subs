00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
smaller headstock and instead of having

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.640 
smaller headstock and instead of having
a<00:02:13.489> separate<00:02:14.180> tail<00:02:14.450> piece<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.960> bridge<00:02:15.230> we've

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
a separate tail piece and bridge we've

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.610 
a separate tail piece and bridge we've
changed<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.130> over<00:02:16.250> to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
changed it over to

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.280 
changed it over to
that<00:02:17.239> so<00:02:18.239> if<00:02:18.299> you<00:02:18.390> look<00:02:18.540> at<00:02:18.659> the<00:02:18.810> two<00:02:19.049> there's

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
that so if you look at the two there's

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.130 
that so if you look at the two there's
not<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.500> ton<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.920> difference<00:02:21.140> aesthetically

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
not a ton of difference aesthetically

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.479 
not a ton of difference aesthetically
between<00:02:22.650> them<00:02:22.799> but<00:02:22.920> you'll<00:02:23.040> notice<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.340> has

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
between them but you'll notice this has

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.940 
between them but you'll notice this has
a<00:02:23.549> little<00:02:23.610> bit<00:02:23.790> larger<00:02:24.239> peghead<00:02:24.739> that's<00:02:25.739> got

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
a little bit larger peghead that's got

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.830
