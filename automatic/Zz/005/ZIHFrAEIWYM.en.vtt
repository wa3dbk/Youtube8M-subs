it<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.090> play<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.329> think<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.380> gotta<00:01:58.560> move

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680

more cannon even and overall how the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.840 
more cannon even and overall how the
early<00:02:01.170> rate<00:02:01.469> gambits<00:02:01.860> performance<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.520> this

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
early rate gambits performance is this

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.270
