00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
makes cleaning up so much easier when

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.540 
makes cleaning up so much easier when
you're<00:02:12.090> using<00:02:12.330> black<00:02:12.840> stamping<00:02:13.350> polish<00:02:13.709> you

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
you're using black stamping polish you

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.880 
you're using black stamping polish you
could<00:02:14.819> use<00:02:15.030> liquid<00:02:15.270> latex<00:02:15.870> but<00:02:16.290> some<00:02:16.560> people

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
could use liquid latex but some people

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.699 
could use liquid latex but some people
do<00:02:17.100> have<00:02:17.130> latex<00:02:17.880> allergies<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:19.050> I'd<00:02:19.200> watch<00:02:19.500> out

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
do have latex allergies so I'd watch out

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.710 
do have latex allergies so I'd watch out
for<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.040> one<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.910> when<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.209> base<00:02:24.330> coat<00:02:24.600> is

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
for that one so when the base coat is

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.040 
for that one so when the base coat is
dry<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:25.380> dries<00:02:25.620> clear<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:27.569> all<00:02:27.900> I'm

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
dry it dries clear like this so all I'm

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.350
