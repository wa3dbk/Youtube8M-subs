00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
really really cool look really like it

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.830 
really really cool look really like it
is<00:03:31.890> great<00:03:32.310> candid<00:03:32.730> moment<00:03:33.030> captured<00:03:33.210> there

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
is great candid moment captured there

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.230 
is great candid moment captured there
the<00:03:34.620> next<00:03:34.980> one<00:03:35.190> there<00:03:35.940> were<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.030> whole<00:03:36.180> bunch

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
the next one there were a whole bunch

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.780 
the next one there were a whole bunch
from<00:03:36.690> this<00:03:36.870> series<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.470> airplanes<00:03:38.220> landing<00:03:38.640> so

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
from this series of airplanes landing so

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.460 
from this series of airplanes landing so
i'm<00:03:38.970> not<00:03:39.090> sure<00:03:39.330> where<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:39.750> because<00:03:39.900> i'm

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
i'm not sure where it is because i'm

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.990 
i'm not sure where it is because i'm
going<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.680> venture<00:03:40.860> say<00:03:41.160> it's<00:03:41.520> probably<00:03:41.760> not

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
going to venture say it's probably not

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.460 
going to venture say it's probably not
in<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.120> United<00:03:42.450> States<00:03:42.510> re<00:03:42.930> would<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.260> agree

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
in the United States re would you agree

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.110 
in the United States re would you agree
that<00:03:43.560> if<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:44.160> were<00:03:44.280> standing<00:03:44.490> in<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.820> United

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
that if you were standing in the United

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.970 
that if you were standing in the United
States<00:03:45.150> at<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.870> end<00:03:46.110> of<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.260> runway<00:03:46.410> taking

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
States at the end of a runway taking

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.530 
States at the end of a runway taking
pictures<00:03:47.310> they<00:03:47.490> would<00:03:47.610> probably<00:03:47.970> uh<00:03:48.210> sure<00:03:48.450> you

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
pictures they would probably uh sure you

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.190 
pictures they would probably uh sure you
out<00:03:48.690> there<00:03:48.900> pretty<00:03:49.080> quick<00:03:50.870> unless<00:03:51.870> you're<00:03:52.110> in

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
out there pretty quick unless you're in

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.320 
out there pretty quick unless you're in
Topeka<00:03:52.650> or<00:03:52.800> something<00:03:53.160> yeah<00:03:53.820> so<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:53.970> don't<00:03:54.240> know

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
Topeka or something yeah so I don't know

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.030 
Topeka or something yeah so I don't know
where<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.720> is<00:03:54.780> but<00:03:55.350> I<00:03:55.380> thought<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.710> was<00:03:55.800> it's

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
where this is but I thought it was it's

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.190 
where this is but I thought it was it's
just<00:03:56.250> unique<00:03:56.460> you<00:03:56.790> get<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.060> stuff<00:03:57.780> coming<00:03:58.080> off

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
just unique you get the stuff coming off

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.500 
just unique you get the stuff coming off
the<00:03:58.350> wings<00:03:58.700> it<00:03:59.700> looked<00:03:59.970> yeah<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.210> plane<00:04:00.390> is

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
the wings it looked yeah the plane is

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.790 
the wings it looked yeah the plane is
obviously<00:04:00.810> taking<00:04:01.200> off<00:04:01.350> because<00:04:01.590> if<00:04:01.680> they

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
obviously taking off because if they

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.350 
obviously taking off because if they
were<00:04:01.860> landing<00:04:02.310> this<00:04:02.400> would<00:04:02.550> be<00:04:02.640> a<00:04:02.670> pretty<00:04:03.000> bad

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
were landing this would be a pretty bad

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.800 
were landing this would be a pretty bad
place<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.290> land<00:04:05.040> at<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.280> end<00:04:05.460> of<00:04:05.520> the<00:04:05.610> runway

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
place to land at the end of the runway

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.470 
place to land at the end of the runway
but<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:06.870> like<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.110> composition<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:08.070> hope<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.240> I

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
but I like the composition I hope that I

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.150 
but I like the composition I hope that I
hope<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.900> it's<00:04:10.050> not<00:04:10.140> cropped<00:04:10.470> but<00:04:10.920> I<00:04:10.950> just

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
hope that it's not cropped but I just

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.320 
hope that it's not cropped but I just
thought<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.370> was<00:04:11.430> really<00:04:11.490> cool<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:12.120> can<00:04:12.240> see

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
thought it was really cool you can see

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.690 
thought it was really cool you can see
another<00:04:12.540> airplane<00:04:12.990> in<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.260> background<00:04:13.800> it's

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
another airplane in the background it's

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.960 
another airplane in the background it's
symmetrical<00:04:15.680> symmetrical<00:04:16.680> right

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
front-to-back side-to-side left to right

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.550 
front-to-back side-to-side left to right
up<00:04:19.920> and<00:04:20.160> down<00:04:20.250> really<00:04:21.090> like<00:04:21.390> it<00:04:21.600> so<00:04:22.260> that's<00:04:22.440> the

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
and I think we're going to go with a

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.080 
and I think we're going to go with a
theme<00:06:20.440> of<00:06:20.469> food<00:06:21.280> so<00:06:22.270> anything<00:06:22.770> food-related

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
theme of food so anything food-related

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.249 
theme of food so anything food-related
doesn't<00:06:25.090> have<00:06:25.210> to<00:06:25.360> be<00:06:25.479> food-related<00:06:25.690> I<00:06:26.139> mean

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 
doesn't have to be food-related I mean
