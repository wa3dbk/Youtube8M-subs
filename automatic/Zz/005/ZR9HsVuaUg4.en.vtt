family resilience but in other fields
people<00:02:07.079> study<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.740> resilience<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.310> our

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
people study the resilience of our

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.119 
people study the resilience of our

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
a disaster but when we study children

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.900 
a disaster but when we study children
were<00:02:15.760> interested<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.630> measuring<00:02:17.610> how<00:02:18.610> well

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
were interested in measuring how well

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.330 
were interested in measuring how well
they're<00:02:19.150> doing<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.660> life<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.290> what<00:02:20.680> kinds<00:02:21.160> of

they're doing in life and what kinds of
risks<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.390> protective<00:02:22.750> factors<00:02:23.170> are

risks and protective factors are

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.430 
risks and protective factors are
influencing<00:02:24.280> how<00:02:25.090> well<00:02:25.300> they're<00:02:25.480> doing<00:02:25.510> so

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
influencing how well they're doing so

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.220 
influencing how well they're doing so
how<00:02:27.069> do<00:02:27.130> we<00:02:27.280> define<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.970> well<00:02:28.330> we<00:02:29.020> have

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
how do we define that well we have

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.970 
how do we define that well we have
focused<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.770> lot<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.250> children<00:02:30.940> doing<00:02:31.930> okay<00:02:32.590> in

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
focused a lot on children doing okay in

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.280 
focused a lot on children doing okay in
what<00:02:33.459> we<00:02:33.580> call<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.940> developmental<00:02:34.570> tasks<00:02:35.140> of

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
what we call the developmental tasks of

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.830 
what we call the developmental tasks of
life<00:02:35.320> so<00:02:36.130> these<00:02:36.340> are<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.760> things<00:02:37.240> we<00:02:37.390> expect

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
life so these are the things we expect

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.479 
life so these are the things we expect
children<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.380> be<00:02:38.560> accomplishing<00:02:39.190> at

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.430 
different ages and in a very young child
that<00:02:42.459> might<00:02:42.790> be<00:02:43.000> something<00:02:43.300> like<00:02:43.690> forming<00:02:44.290> a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
that might be something like forming a

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.100 
that might be something like forming a
close<00:02:45.100> bond<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:45.820> attachment<00:02:46.540> with<00:02:46.720> their

on as children and people grow older

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.440 
on as children and people grow older
there<00:03:19.989> are<00:03:20.170> always<00:03:20.380> new<00:03:21.090> tasks<00:03:22.090> that<00:03:22.299> we

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
there are always new tasks that we

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.590 
there are always new tasks that we
expect<00:03:23.049> people<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:23.950> accomplish<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:25.000> we<00:03:25.269> think

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
expect people to accomplish and we think

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.110 
expect people to accomplish and we think
that's<00:03:25.840> a<00:03:26.079> very<00:03:26.110> important<00:03:26.920> set<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.850> criteria

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
that's a very important set of criteria

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.160 
that's a very important set of criteria
for<00:03:29.049> how<00:03:29.950> people<00:03:30.310> are<00:03:30.430> doing<00:03:30.790> but<00:03:31.450> we<00:03:31.780> can<00:03:31.959> also

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
for how people are doing but we can also

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.160 
for how people are doing but we can also
consider<00:03:32.860> how<00:03:33.220> they<00:03:33.400> feel<00:03:33.700> on<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.120> inside<00:03:34.170> are

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
consider how they feel on the inside are

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.910 
consider how they feel on the inside are
people<00:03:35.590> happy<00:03:36.130> do<00:03:36.850> they<00:03:37.030> have<00:03:37.500> symptoms<00:03:38.500> of

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
people happy do they have symptoms of

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.759 
people happy do they have symptoms of
mental<00:03:39.160> health<00:03:39.519> problems<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.600> suffering<00:03:41.260> so

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
mental health problems and suffering so

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.860 
mental health problems and suffering so
you<00:03:41.829> can<00:03:42.100> look<00:03:42.370> inside<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.180> person<00:03:43.540> as<00:03:43.660> well

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
you can look inside the person as well

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.430 
you can look inside the person as well
their<00:03:44.470> well-being<00:03:45.239> and<00:03:46.239> I<00:03:46.660> think<00:03:47.049> it's<00:03:47.230> really

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
their well-being and I think it's really

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.740 
their well-being and I think it's really
important<00:03:48.130> to<00:03:48.720> think<00:03:49.720> about<00:03:50.590> what<00:03:51.130> are<00:03:51.400> the

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
important to think about what are the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.259 
important to think about what are the
goals<00:03:52.750> if<00:03:53.380> when<00:03:54.100> we're<00:03:54.280> doing<00:03:54.430> interventions

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
goals if when we're doing interventions

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.810 
goals if when we're doing interventions
to<00:03:55.450> promote<00:03:55.660> resilience<00:03:56.260> we<00:03:56.890> really<00:03:57.280> need<00:03:57.519> to

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
to promote resilience we really need to

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.199 
to promote resilience we really need to
know<00:03:58.180> what<00:03:58.900> we're<00:03:59.079> trying<00:03:59.380> to<00:03:59.860> promote<00:04:00.610> in

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
know what we're trying to promote in

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.530 
know what we're trying to promote in
these<00:04:01.600> young<00:04:01.840> people<00:04:02.320> how<00:04:02.680> do<00:04:02.739> we<00:04:02.920> define

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
these young people how do we define

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.400 
not for our society how does a focus on
resilience<00:04:12.519> or<00:04:12.940> positive<00:04:13.570> outcomes<00:04:14.049> differ

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
resilience or positive outcomes differ

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.710 
resilience or positive outcomes differ
from<00:04:14.739> studies<00:04:15.100> that<00:04:15.310> focus<00:04:16.090> on<00:04:16.209> negative

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
from studies that focus on negative

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.860 
from studies that focus on negative
outcomes<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.919> kids<00:04:18.160> who<00:04:18.370> don't<00:04:18.519> succeed

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
outcomes and the kids who don't succeed

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.960 
outcomes and the kids who don't succeed
well<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:19.900> think<00:04:20.019> what<00:04:20.680> was<00:04:20.979> missing<00:04:21.549> for<00:04:21.760> many

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
well I think what was missing for many

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.450 
well I think what was missing for many
years<00:04:22.330> when<00:04:22.630> people<00:04:22.660> did<00:04:23.140> focus<00:04:23.680> on<00:04:23.860> risk<00:04:24.130> and

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
years when people did focus on risk and

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.640 
years when people did focus on risk and
problems<00:04:25.180> was<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.660> positive<00:04:25.840> side<00:04:26.380> of<00:04:26.530> the

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
problems was the positive side of the

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.279 
problems was the positive side of the
story<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:27.370> if<00:04:27.759> you<00:04:27.880> want<00:04:28.120> to<00:04:28.449> learn<00:04:28.660> about<00:04:28.870> the

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
story and if you want to learn about the

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.770 
story and if you want to learn about the
protective<00:04:29.830> processes<00:04:30.699> and<00:04:31.000> what<00:04:31.240> promotes

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
protective processes and what promotes

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.040 
protective processes and what promotes
good<00:04:32.380> outcome<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:33.370> development<00:04:33.970> even<00:04:34.840> though

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
good outcome and development even though

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.439 
good outcome and development even though
you're<00:04:35.289> in<00:04:35.410> a<00:04:35.530> risky<00:04:36.069> or<00:04:36.220> hazardous<00:04:36.759> situation

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
you're in a risky or hazardous situation

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.920 
you're in a risky or hazardous situation
you<00:04:37.960> have<00:04:38.229> to<00:04:38.530> study<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:40.150> young<00:04:40.389> people<00:04:40.750> who

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
you have to study the young people who

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.309 
you have to study the young people who
do<00:04:41.110> well<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:41.740> then<00:04:42.160> try<00:04:42.490> to<00:04:42.550> see<00:04:42.940> what<00:04:43.810> made

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
do well and then try to see what made

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.550 
do well and then try to see what made
that<00:04:44.560> possible<00:04:44.860> what<00:04:45.550> were<00:04:45.849> the<00:04:46.810> protective

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
that possible what were the protective

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.860 
that possible what were the protective
processes<00:04:48.370> in<00:04:48.520> their<00:04:48.669> life<00:04:48.940> what<00:04:49.360> enabled

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
processes in their life what enabled

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.710 
processes in their life what enabled
them<00:04:50.080> to<00:04:50.310> overcome<00:04:51.310> adversity<00:04:51.520> and<00:04:52.150> succeed

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
them to overcome adversity and succeed

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.439 
them to overcome adversity and succeed
and<00:04:53.020> then<00:04:53.710> what<00:04:54.190> we'd<00:04:54.340> like<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:54.759> do<00:04:54.940> is<00:04:55.210> make<00:04:55.419> it

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
and then what we'd like to do is make it

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.350 
and then what we'd like to do is make it
possible<00:04:56.139> for<00:04:56.199> other<00:04:56.530> children<00:04:56.910> where<00:04:57.910> this

possible for other children where this

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.879 
possible for other children where this
isn't<00:04:58.630> naturally<00:04:59.320> occurring<00:04:59.889> to<00:05:00.820> accomplish

isn't naturally occurring to accomplish

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.379 
isn't naturally occurring to accomplish

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
resilience in the same way we want to

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.140 
resilience in the same way we want to
promote<00:05:04.690> resilience<00:05:05.320> we<00:05:05.650> have<00:05:05.860> to<00:05:06.039> learn<00:05:06.280> how

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
promote resilience we have to learn how

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.779 
promote resilience we have to learn how
it<00:05:07.660> happens<00:05:08.259> what<00:05:08.710> are<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.979> ingredients<00:05:09.130> in

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
it happens what are the ingredients in

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.390 
it happens what are the ingredients in
resilience<00:05:10.180> for<00:05:11.110> children<00:05:11.620> who<00:05:11.800> grow<00:05:12.009> up<00:05:12.039> in

and the stress of unstable housing so

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.089
