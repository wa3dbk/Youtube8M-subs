00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.200
 Hi, Jakob here - 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.800
 - Here's your home party, Joltter! 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.600
 And I'm hyped! 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.440
 We are hyped! 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.340
 Yes! 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.080
 We just got our Hypervenom and are going to take them on. 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.340
 What are we waiting for? 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.280
 Wow! 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.180
 insane fit, I'm up and running! 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.980
 I'm completely up and running over how close and nice the pussy is - 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.180
 - The pussy is wide, it feels natural and strange. 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.780
 It is insane and quite unlike anything I've tried before - 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.380
 - and it's just out of the box - 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.760
 - Okay, fair enough, we have tried to walk around the office with them, but we haven't played with them yet - 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.840
 - We will! 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.200
 The pussy is amazing! 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.080
 The way it sneaks around your foot is amazing - 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.520
 - NikeSkin is soft and stretching well - 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.100
 - we use the same size and you really test NikeSkin's limits - 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.400
 - It gets almost easier because the material extends so much. 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.060
 The color has almost changed, I don't know if you can see the difference - 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.240
 - But it's pretty fun. 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.680
 It sits around your foot, even if you have a broad foot. 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.200
 It feels comfortable as it should - 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.880
 - as I wanted it to be. 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.520
 Very promising - 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:55.020
 - and I think the lesson feels like a mix of CTR360 Maestri and Vapor IX - 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.500
 - the length is a bit like Vapor IX - 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.160
 - and the width as a Maestri. 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.460
 Not excessively wide, but it fits your feet after all. 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.580
 If you have wide feet, you will not have problems with Hypervenom. 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.820
 Because of NikeSkin I love! 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.360
 It's the first time it's been used on a soccer boot, I'm pretty overwhelmed. 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.880
 I think it has the potential to change the way we think football boots - 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.060
 - Because it's really wild. 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.420
 We to see. 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.040
 When we have said that, it may well be this boot feels insane good - 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.320
 - but we have only been around in the office and you screamed "agility" - 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.340
 - but I have a little grief with the heel - 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.880
 - it is not very high and not very stiff - 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.300
 - so I don't get the feeling of stability and support - 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.060
 - and especially the top of the heel I do not like to enclose my foot especially well - 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.780
 - so I'm a little afraid you might slip a little in it, but I don't know how it performs on the track - 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.760
 - I'm not sure. 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:16.020
 I agree with the heel, now that we have said NikeSkin is so soft and flexible - 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.320
 - I think the heel is simply too soft and flexible. 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.280
 There is no lockdown effect in it at all. 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.920
 You can pretty much do with what you want - 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.360
 - It's something I'm not used to in a football boot and I'm a little scared of it. 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.620
 Maybe it helps with agility, we don't know yet, but we'll see. 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.260
 Another thing I noticed was the two-part sole - 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.440
 - I had high hopes - 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.480
 - But I hung around a little around the office and I didn't feel much about it - 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.080
 - it may change when the buds come into the ground - 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.640
 - but so far I have no difference marked from a Vapor sole. 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:13.120
 The sole I let you analyze, I'm a little more afraid of the edge between the sole and the top - 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.560
 - the glue does not feel like it will last long - 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:29.600
 - and I'm very afraid of it because I love to take a free kick - 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.160
 - and I have a bad habit of destroying my boots - 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.560
 - just around the area - 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.060
 - I don't know, maybe they used some super glue. 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.420
 Let's hope so, but when we say all this, it's a little problem - 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.300
 - Because I look so much to try it. 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:59.860
 Before we got test boots, I said that this boot has the potential to be the best boot I've ever tried - 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.540
 - I know, but we have to look with that heel - 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.500
 - Still the fit is insane! 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.900
 The wildest is that I haven't tried anything like this before! 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.220
 It's fun because I've played in many boots - 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.420
 - at least 100 couples and this is completely different. 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.440
 So you might say we look forward to notifying this boot - 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.760
 - which we both come to - 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.960
 - so we can cover all aspects of it. 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:43.920

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.080
 We are ready to come out and play in Hypervenom and become even more hyped! 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.720
 Exactly but is in there hyped? 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.960
 Write it in a comment below the picture! 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.360
 We are slipped guys! see ya. 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.280
 And this is just a size 40 - 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.380
 - What the ...? 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.040
 What happens! 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.620
 I have said I have wide feet. 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.560
 It's a monster foot there!
