00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
boat so it might be an alright day we'll

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:18.289

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
just keep fishing hard later on in the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.240 
just keep fishing hard later on in the
day<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.720> had<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> real<00:01:19.229> good<00:01:19.409> takedown<00:01:19.710> I

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
day we had a real good takedown I

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.910 
day we had a real good takedown I
thought<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.299> fish<00:01:21.540> was<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.900> for<00:01:22.140> sure<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.619> I

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
thought that fish was on for sure but I

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.219 
thought that fish was on for sure but I
jumped<00:01:23.790> up<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.240> tried<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.570> set<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> hook<00:01:25.020> into

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
jumped up and I tried to set a hook into

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.600 
jumped up and I tried to set a hook into
him<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.710> probably<00:01:25.979> shouldn't<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.400> done

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
him and I probably shouldn't have done

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.819 
him and I probably shouldn't have done
that<00:01:26.640> i<00:01:27.119> was<00:01:27.330> using<00:01:27.360> circle<00:01:28.049> hooks<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
that i was using circle hooks so I

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.190 
that i was using circle hooks so I
should<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.610> reeled<00:01:30.060> into<00:01:30.299> him<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.960> got<00:01:31.170> a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
should just reeled into him but I got a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.890 
should just reeled into him but I got a
little<00:01:31.380> bit<00:01:31.619> excited<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.310> one

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
little bit excited with that one

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.550 
little bit excited with that one
I<00:01:35.060> bought<00:01:36.060> five<00:01:36.330> hours<00:01:36.720> after<00:01:37.080> touching<00:01:37.320> our

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
I bought five hours after touching our

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.500 
I bought five hours after touching our
first<00:01:37.860> fish<00:01:38.160> we<00:01:38.460> looked<00:01:38.670> into<00:01:38.880> another<00:01:39.240> one

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
first fish we looked into another one

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.900 
first fish we looked into another one
and<00:01:40.080> half<00:01:40.470> way<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> boat<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.310> realized<00:01:41.730> it

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
and half way to the boat we realized it

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:55.610 
and half way to the boat we realized it
was<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> drum<00:01:53.660> got<00:01:54.660> another<00:01:54.900> tournament<00:01:55.290> coming
