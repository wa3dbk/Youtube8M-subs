right next question do steroids increase

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.279 
right next question do steroids increase
the<00:02:08.550> ability<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.030> your<00:02:09.209> CNS<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.899> other<00:02:10.020> words

the ability of your CNS in other words

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.380 
the ability of your CNS in other words
they<00:02:11.099> allow<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.819> as<00:02:11.940> much<00:02:12.180> more

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
they allow you to have as much more

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.380 
they allow you to have as much more
muscle<00:02:12.810> mass

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
muscle mass

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.090 
muscle mass
do<00:02:13.600> they<00:02:13.750> allow<00:02:13.870> your<00:02:14.260> muscles<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.770> have<00:02:14.980> an

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
do they allow your muscles to have an

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.400 
do they allow your muscles to have an

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
increased work capacity that's two

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.320 
increased work capacity that's two

are<00:02:22.450> people<00:02:22.630> on<00:02:22.900> gear<00:02:23.110> stronger<00:02:23.620> simply

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
are people on gear stronger simply

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.559 
are people on gear stronger simply
because<00:02:24.280> they<00:02:24.430> have<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:24.819> much<00:02:24.940> more<00:02:25.150> muscle<00:02:25.480> to

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
because they have so much more muscle to

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.900 
because they have so much more muscle to
work<00:02:25.600> with<00:02:26.160> it's<00:02:27.160> actually<00:02:27.520> all<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.880> above

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
work with it's actually all of the above

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.090 
work with it's actually all of the above
and<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.840> really<00:02:29.110> depends<00:02:29.470> on<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.650> drug<00:02:29.860> you

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
and it really depends on the drug you

before you run out of steam in a
marathon<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.890> that's<00:03:12.280> more<00:03:12.730> compounds<00:03:13.630> like

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
marathon and that's more compounds like

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.660 
marathon and that's more compounds like
Boldin<00:03:14.260> or<00:03:14.680> nandrolone<00:03:15.070> where's<00:03:15.550> there

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
Boldin or nandrolone where's there

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.009 
Boldin or nandrolone where's there
something<00:03:15.910> like<00:03:16.000> testosterone<00:03:16.690> is<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.840> nice

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
something like testosterone is a nice

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.620 
something like testosterone is a nice
middle<00:03:17.440> balance<00:03:17.890> between<00:03:18.070> all<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.430> those<00:03:18.700> so

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
middle balance between all of those so

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.979 
middle balance between all of those so
it<00:03:19.959> really<00:03:20.350> varies<00:03:21.510> so<00:03:22.510> when<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.810> make<00:03:22.959> a

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
it really varies so when you make a

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.020 
it really varies so when you make a
statement<00:03:23.320> like<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:24.280> really<00:03:24.489> varies<00:03:24.880> but

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
statement like that it really varies but

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.130 
statement like that it really varies but

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
it's something you need to be aware of

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.930 
it's something you need to be aware of
if<00:03:26.380> you<00:03:26.500> are<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.680> competitive<00:03:27.190> athlete<00:03:27.430> and

guys your own gear and say you natural
guys<00:03:31.930> are<00:03:32.110> choosing<00:03:32.440> not<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.799> yeah<00:03:33.519> they're

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
guys are choosing not to yeah they're

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.789 
guys are choosing not to yeah they're
gonna<00:03:33.790> be<00:03:34.000> able<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.239> structure<00:03:34.720> their<00:03:34.989> use<00:03:35.620> of

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
gonna be able to structure their use of

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.220 
gonna be able to structure their use of
their<00:03:35.920> drugs<00:03:36.220> for<00:03:36.600> things<00:03:37.600> like<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:37.840> stronger

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
their drugs for things like a stronger

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.610 
their drugs for things like a stronger
CNS<00:03:38.799> push<00:03:39.100> so<00:03:39.519> that<00:03:39.670> they<00:03:39.790> can<00:03:40.290> lift<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.470> little

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
CNS push so that they can lift a little

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.680 
CNS push so that they can lift a little
more<00:03:41.860> weight<00:03:42.100> and<00:03:42.310> get<00:03:42.430> more<00:03:42.760> total<00:03:43.360> nervous

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
more weight and get more total nervous

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.509 
more weight and get more total nervous
system<00:03:43.989> activation<00:03:44.290> out<00:03:44.769> of<00:03:44.890> a<00:03:44.980> single<00:03:45.190> lift

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
system activation out of a single lift

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.949 
system activation out of a single lift
at<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.790> same<00:03:45.970> body<00:03:46.180> weight<00:03:46.299> and<00:03:46.570> muscle<00:03:46.690> mass

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
at the same body weight and muscle mass

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.750 
at the same body weight and muscle mass
they<00:03:47.739> have<00:03:47.829> an<00:03:47.920> advantage<00:03:48.190> there<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:48.670> they're

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
they have an advantage there and they're

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.890 
they have an advantage there and they're
going<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:48.940> be<00:03:49.030> able<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.269> structure<00:03:49.510> stuff<00:03:49.810> to

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
going to be able to structure stuff to

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.750 
going to be able to structure stuff to
where<00:03:50.049> they<00:03:50.230> can<00:03:50.410> train<00:03:50.799> with<00:03:51.549> higher

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
where they can train with higher

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.150 
where they can train with higher
workloads<00:03:52.299> and<00:03:52.480> capacities<00:03:53.079> more<00:03:53.470> longer<00:03:53.920> and

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
workloads and capacities more longer and

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.430 
workloads and capacities more longer and
recover<00:03:54.579> faster<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.810> lot<00:03:56.049> of<00:03:56.170> them<00:03:56.260> do

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
recover faster so a lot of them do

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.170 
recover faster so a lot of them do
dramatically<00:03:57.070> enhance<00:03:57.370> that<00:03:57.790> work<00:03:58.030> capacity

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
dramatically enhance that work capacity

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.660 
dramatically enhance that work capacity
and<00:03:58.750> recovery<00:03:59.260> so<00:03:59.860> that<00:04:00.160> is<00:04:00.280> something<00:04:00.549> you

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
and recovery so that is something you

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.610 
and recovery so that is something you
need<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.880> be<00:04:00.970> aware<00:04:01.180> of<00:04:01.290> competing<00:04:02.290> against

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
need to be aware of competing against

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.170 
need to be aware of competing against
guys<00:04:02.769> you're<00:04:03.040> on<00:04:03.160> them<00:04:03.370> for<00:04:03.790> those<00:04:03.910> who<00:04:04.120> are
