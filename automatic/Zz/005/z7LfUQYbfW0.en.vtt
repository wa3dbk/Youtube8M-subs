very<00:01:19.320> big<00:01:19.380> difference<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:20.070> how<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.250> approach

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
very big difference to how you approach

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.789 
very big difference to how you approach
combat<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.509> also<00:01:21.659> each<00:01:21.930> craft<00:01:22.229> has<00:01:22.500> its<00:01:22.650> own

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
combat but also each craft has its own

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.710 
combat but also each craft has its own
weapons<00:01:23.250> which<00:01:23.880> vary<00:01:24.180> greatly<00:01:24.299> from

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
weapons which vary greatly from

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.840 
weapons which vary greatly from
devastating<00:01:25.350> lasers<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.189> homing<00:01:26.490> missiles

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
to simple guns and firewalls there's no

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.460

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.350 
upgrading of planes or switching weapons
so<00:01:32.040> often<00:01:32.369> you're<00:01:32.460> getting<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.850> high<00:01:33.030> score

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
so often you're getting you high score
