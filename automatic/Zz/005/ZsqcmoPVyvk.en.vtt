00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.900
 the story of the panettone that originates in a love story 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.329
 all began in the 15th century when the young milanetto member of the family 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:09.950
 and caring 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.049
 if the passion to operate still son of the baker called tonho that in turn 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:15.789
 I did not approve of dating 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.710
 to impress the baker the boy says he went from being a baker's assistant and 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.840
 after a few days of wonderful bread event work naturally have 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.659
 fed and as fruit 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:31.929
 of extreme delicacy and collapsed special without speaking in the form of bread 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.760
 the surface was shaped in the shape of a 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.600
 three days the young present or future father-in-law with the paulo 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.850
 the success of the pole was immediate and the new delicacy came to be known as 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.920
 size bakery bridge then the whole world and with the passage of time 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.030
 simply panettone 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.420
 from this day forward 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.280
 the bakery gave a lot of movement what made the family stay rich 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.820
 and today we are going to teach you how to make your roni jacket 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.350
 the baker Ricardo gives us the recipe of watering his mouth write down a pound and 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.750
 three hundred grams of raisins 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.790
 5 pounds of wheat flour 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.880
 nine hundred grams of sugar 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.790
 seventy grams of salt 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.250
 one hundred grams of biological yeast 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.979
 very few 650 grams of egg yolks approximately 45 agents 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.230
 50ml fast or brandy 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.820
 two and a half liters of ice water 50ml of panettone essence 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.670
 500 grams of noodles at all 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.439
 ten grams of dye 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.120
 and who has more 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.050
 first veto me 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.050
 abuse of wiretapping passes is prohibited 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.670
 approximately 50 ml x 1 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.260
 let's emerge her 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
 in the water 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.689
 but this immersion kate process leaves you about an hour here 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.710
 brings fruits and juices to hydrate 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.710
 in the water and in the world 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:15.239
 admits that until the closing 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.489
 on the table in grams of biological yeast 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.489
 Let's do a rest process. 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.309
 The traditional for me is everything 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.239
 350 grams of yolks 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.569
 the liter of water 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:49.199
 I'm not very jealous coming 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:51.429
 jutta hagemann and the water 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:54.679
 It is also important to remember that the water has to be 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.339
 our climate that has a hot climate 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:00.669
 and the yeast we are announcing is biological 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:03.769
 After we have done the rest process 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.329
 water yeast and the egg yolks we are going to make a process 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.429
 seal procel called because the number 2 the additional the tribute 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.229
 Let's call sarney. 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:32.459
 now we are going to make a third-party process 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.429
 as it will take 45 minutes for this fermentation process to win 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:39.759
 force in life 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:41.819
 people are showing scenes 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.009
 we want to provide 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:45.339
 the margarine the salt the sugar 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:48.929
 and another three kilos of wheat there next March collectors next week 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:54.769
 after the whole sponge process where the wheat was gathered 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.529
 the water buds and the yeast 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:59.529
 we will get the third process now 10 points 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.409
 the second sponge process now in the massagueira 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.459
 along with the other ingredients 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.489
 remembering that this group is augmentation undergoes a process of 15 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.489
 minutes of rest 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.189
 now we are in particular adds in the major centers 

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:25.499
 the sugar 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.809
 we also added margarine 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:32.809
 the uprising 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.800
 the second stage of wheat 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.430
 the dye 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.550
 in essence for panic 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.620
 but if you need you can access the freeway Dom Pedro 2º 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.599
 but if you need us it's just a little rice in the barradão 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.819
 the sector controls more points 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:14.339
 an alloy 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:17.240
 after approximately 10 minutes 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.240
 the marcela reaches the point of seeing someone who scores that I 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:25.830
 after we reach the théo point of the mass 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.169
 Now we will 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.659
 spread and wing 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:31.659
 will add the grape if the fruits 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.199
 we will add 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.199
 the fruit is some 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.039
 now taking the process 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:12.129
 the panetone each piece 550 grams 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.080
 now we begin the process of 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.360
 but bolinando and it until turning a ball 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:39.949
 laugh added 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:40.900
 the shapes 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.900
 for growth 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:49.879
 now the collector it goes with the fermentation process right where it goes 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:53.800
 grow and after this process we will be supporting israel 

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:57.339
 closing the jacket making process 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:02.099
 and now it's ready to bake 

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:20.349
 just enjoy and delight in this nonsense
