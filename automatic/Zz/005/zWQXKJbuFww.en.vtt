this was the light one so all the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.960 
this was the light one so all the
textures<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:13.950> sort<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.549> little<00:01:14.820> bit

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
redstone lapis I'm gold I think yep gold

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.410 
redstone lapis I'm gold I think yep gold
even<00:01:43.170> twinkles<00:01:43.860> how<00:01:44.430> cool<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.299> so

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
even twinkles how cool is that and so

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.179 
even twinkles how cool is that and so
does<00:01:45.570> diamond<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.170> diamond<00:01:46.649> looks<00:01:46.890> how<00:01:47.130> you

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
does diamond and diamond looks how you

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.859 
does diamond and diamond looks how you
would<00:01:47.460> expect<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.880> find<00:01:47.970> diamond<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.720> know

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
would expect to find diamond you know

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.560 
would expect to find diamond you know
sort<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.140> these<00:01:49.649> funny<00:01:49.950> jagged<00:01:50.850> points<00:01:51.299> and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
sort of rough cut diamond looks pretty

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.710 
sort of rough cut diamond looks pretty
awesome<00:01:53.729> after<00:01:54.090> say<00:01:54.210> he's<00:01:54.329> put<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> lot<00:01:54.570> of

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
effort a lot of work into these and same

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.030 
effort a lot of work into these and same
with<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.369> with<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> lava<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.390> very<00:02:00.570> dark

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
with that with the lava it's very dark

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.319 
with that with the lava it's very dark
but<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.159> sort<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.340> brightens<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:02.939> shimmers

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
but it's sort of brightens and shimmers

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
sorts of different ways I think that

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.710 
sorts of different ways I think that
looks<00:02:06.930> really<00:02:07.259> cool<00:02:08.179> all<00:02:09.179> right<00:02:09.330> well<00:02:09.509> we<00:02:09.690> got

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
looks really cool all right well we got

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.880 
looks really cool all right well we got

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
here don't actually know what this is

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.070

at<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.210> moment<00:04:41.240> what<00:04:42.240> are<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:42.480> textures<00:04:42.900> do

at the moment what are the textures do

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.880 
at the moment what are the textures do
we<00:04:43.170> not<00:04:43.560> necessarily<00:04:44.070> have<00:04:44.100> out<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:46.110> the

we not necessarily have out the the
early<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.730> eggs<00:04:47.880> are<00:04:48.090> now<00:04:48.210> sort<00:04:48.510> of<00:04:48.540> these

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
on here what we can do is we jump over

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.260 
on here what we can do is we jump over
to<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:17.010> server<00:05:17.250> and<00:05:17.400> have<00:05:17.550> a<00:05:17.580> look<00:05:17.820> around<00:05:17.940> in

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
to the server and have a look around in

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.870 
to the server and have a look around in
the<00:05:18.360> real<00:05:18.540> world<00:05:19.100> not<00:05:20.100> real<00:05:20.280> world<00:05:20.520> as<00:05:20.700> such

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
the real world not real world as such

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.430 
the real world not real world as such
but<00:05:21.060> you<00:05:21.150> know<00:05:21.270> things<00:05:21.660> that<00:05:21.900> we'd<00:05:22.020> use<00:05:22.230> it<00:05:22.380> in

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
but you know things that we'd use it in

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.350 
but you know things that we'd use it in
in<00:05:22.890> daily<00:05:23.160> environment<00:05:23.580> see<00:05:23.670> how<00:05:23.820> blocks<00:05:24.090> go

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
in daily environment see how blocks go

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.360 
in daily environment see how blocks go
together<00:05:24.540> and<00:05:25.020> stuff<00:05:25.410> like<00:05:25.530> that<00:05:25.590> so<00:05:25.740> we'll

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
together and stuff like that so we'll

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.450 
together and stuff like that so we'll
jump<00:05:26.550> over<00:05:26.820> to<00:05:27.500> too<00:05:28.500> much<00:05:28.620> minecraft<00:05:29.220> server

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
jump over to too much minecraft server

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.120 
jump over to too much minecraft server
and<00:05:29.850> we'll<00:05:30.270> take<00:05:30.450> a<00:05:30.480> look<00:05:30.660> from<00:05:30.750> there<00:05:30.990> and<00:05:31.980> as

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
and we'll take a look from there and as

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.480 
and we'll take a look from there and as
if<00:05:32.310> by<00:05:32.340> magic<00:05:32.640> here<00:05:33.240> we<00:05:33.360> are<00:05:33.450> so<00:05:33.810> this<00:05:34.770> is<00:05:35.010> a<00:05:35.040> bit

texture<00:05:48.690> pack<00:05:48.870> lends<00:05:49.140> itself<00:05:49.500> so<00:05:50.130> well<00:05:50.460> to

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
texture pack lends itself so well to

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.360 
texture pack lends itself so well to
that<00:05:50.880> the<00:05:51.480> columns<00:05:51.960> everything<00:05:52.710> about<00:05:53.010> this

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
that the columns everything about this

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.460 
that the columns everything about this
texture<00:05:53.730> pack<00:05:54.080> everything<00:05:55.080> about<00:05:55.350> this

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
texture pack everything about this

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.560 
texture pack everything about this
server<00:05:55.740> and<00:05:55.980> the<00:05:56.040> build<00:05:56.310> quality<00:05:56.610> on<00:05:57.000> it<00:05:57.120> was

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
server and the build quality on it was

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.630 
server and the build quality on it was
almost<00:05:57.780> like<00:05:58.140> it<00:05:58.320> was<00:05:58.350> built<00:05:58.650> using<00:05:58.800> dokucraft

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
almost like it was built using dokucraft

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.220 
almost like it was built using dokucraft
I'm<00:06:00.000> not<00:06:00.120> quite<00:06:00.270> sure<00:06:00.300> what<00:06:00.660> texture<00:06:00.900> pack<00:06:01.020> was

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
I'm not quite sure what texture pack was

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.720 
I'm not quite sure what texture pack was
used<00:06:01.470> while<00:06:01.650> building<00:06:01.860> it<00:06:02.100> whether<00:06:02.520> it<00:06:02.640> was

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
used while building it whether it was

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.450 
used while building it whether it was
default<00:06:03.150> or<00:06:03.240> what<00:06:03.420> but<00:06:03.660> it<00:06:04.170> just<00:06:04.440> it<00:06:04.620> goes<00:06:05.100> so

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
default or what but it just it goes so

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.890 
default or what but it just it goes so
well<00:06:05.490> it<00:06:05.850> lends<00:06:06.060> itself<00:06:06.360> brilliantly

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
well it lends itself brilliantly

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.570 
well it lends itself brilliantly
everything<00:06:07.410> from<00:06:07.620> the<00:06:07.860> ferris<00:06:08.160> wheel<00:06:08.190> just

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
everything from the ferris wheel just

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.630 
everything from the ferris wheel just
looks<00:06:08.820> almost<00:06:08.970> natural<00:06:09.600> there<00:06:09.840> the<00:06:10.550> what<00:06:11.550> they

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
looks almost natural there the what they

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
look brilliant the wall really really

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.510 
look brilliant the wall really really
goes<00:06:17.790> well<00:06:18.090> with<00:06:19.080> the<00:06:19.170> wood<00:06:19.350> and<00:06:19.500> contrast<00:06:20.040> and

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
goes well with the wood and contrast and

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.100 
goes well with the wood and contrast and
it's<00:06:20.640> all<00:06:21.090> it's<00:06:21.330> got<00:06:21.510> that<00:06:21.600> very<00:06:21.810> dark

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
it's all it's got that very dark

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.870 
it's all it's got that very dark
medieval<00:06:22.740> feel<00:06:23.070> to<00:06:23.310> it<00:06:23.340> even<00:06:23.580> though<00:06:23.640> this<00:06:23.730> is

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
medieval feel to it even though this is

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.910 
medieval feel to it even though this is
the<00:06:24.030> lighter<00:06:24.270> one<00:06:24.540> it's<00:06:25.080> still<00:06:25.380> it<00:06:25.680> still

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:25.920 
the lighter one it's still it still

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.790 
the lighter one it's still it still
feels<00:06:26.220> like<00:06:26.550> it<00:06:26.820> it<00:06:27.330> was<00:06:27.480> sort<00:06:28.290> of<00:06:28.320> built<00:06:28.620> that

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
feels like it it was sort of built that

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.400 
feels like it it was sort of built that
way<00:06:28.980> that<00:06:29.280> makes<00:06:29.460> sense<00:06:30.080> what<00:06:31.080> we're<00:06:31.230> gonna<00:06:31.320> do

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
way that makes sense what we're gonna do

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.450 
way that makes sense what we're gonna do
is<00:06:31.470> we're<00:06:31.590> gonna<00:06:31.650> go<00:06:31.830> check<00:06:31.980> out<00:06:32.160> the<00:06:32.190> nether

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
is we're gonna go check out the nether

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.580 
is we're gonna go check out the nether
in<00:06:32.610> a<00:06:32.670> minute<00:06:33.000> there<00:06:33.570> are<00:06:33.720> a<00:06:33.750> few<00:06:34.080> things<00:06:34.320> with

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
in a minute there are a few things with

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.900 
in a minute there are a few things with
the<00:06:34.740> nether<00:06:34.950> and<00:06:35.130> stuff<00:06:35.340> that<00:06:35.490> I'm<00:06:35.580> not<00:06:35.700> too

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
the nether and stuff that I'm not too

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.430 
the nether and stuff that I'm not too
keen<00:06:36.180> on<00:06:36.390> I<00:06:36.570> don't<00:06:36.750> like<00:06:36.870> the<00:06:36.990> glowstone

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
keen on I don't like the glowstone

especially

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
especially

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.909 
especially
and<00:06:38.979> the<00:06:39.909> gas<00:06:40.870> and<00:06:41.229> stuff<00:06:41.379> look<00:06:41.530> a<00:06:41.620> bit<00:06:41.800> odd

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 
and the gas and stuff look a bit odd

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:43.589 
and the gas and stuff look a bit odd
they<00:06:42.550> look<00:06:42.729> almost<00:06:42.879> like<00:06:43.120> they've<00:06:43.270> got<00:06:43.419> too

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 
they look almost like they've got too

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:45.959 
they look almost like they've got too
much<00:06:43.750> of<00:06:43.930> a<00:06:44.020> realistic<00:06:44.349> face<00:06:44.770> but<00:06:45.189> overall

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:45.969 
much of a realistic face but overall

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:47.580 
much of a realistic face but overall
it's<00:06:46.389> it's<00:06:46.810> definitely<00:06:47.169> one<00:06:47.289> of<00:06:47.319> the<00:06:47.439> better

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
it's it's definitely one of the better

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.649 
it's it's definitely one of the better
