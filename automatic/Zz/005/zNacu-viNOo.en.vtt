00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.160
 hello everyone I am right now 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.039
 as can be seen on a sailboat 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.410
 somewhere between australia and the 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.150
 tasmania in southern australia 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.020
 so today we have a nice day 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.950
 a beautiful day of sunshine a beautiful 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:33.510
 weather big waves 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:36.150
 no big wind the ideal weather for 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:44.430
 relax on the shutter after a few 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:47.100
 good days add garlic hagist 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.260
 nothing around us we put completely 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.649
 sunk about 100 km from the south coast 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:01.550
 is from Australia 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:08.000
 on the melbourne side and at 2500 meters 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.000
 water underfoot right now 2500 m 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.280
 I will go around the boat for 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:21.219
 introduce you a little bit the property 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.210
 outside for now it moves a little 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.210
 can not go too fast 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.050
 this is the perfect place to observe 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.960
 dolphins or steer good dolphin 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.970
 there is the appearance but 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.950
 usually they are there right in front of the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:46.740
 boat they jump swim along the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.230
 boat are happy rivals sail before 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.800
 and well inflated right now even though there is 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.800
 not a lot of wind 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:01.710
 the main sail acquired this is the 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.730
 lifeboat at chaos 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:14.590
 when we will not need but 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:16.420
 never know we have some instruments of 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.300
 edge on the outside so there is a sonar 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.020
 which therefore serve to know the depth 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.190
 of the troubled water has as we know that at 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.730
 over 2000 meters under our feet we 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:32.680
 turned it off and this is the most important 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:36.130
 is the gts is configured with which we 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.740
 give the road from point a to point b 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.430
 here it gives us the remaining distance 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.320
 the estimated time remaining the gap by 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.070
 relation to the road 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:50.650
 there we are three miles from the road 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.300
 that is to say about 600 m it's not 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.570
 it's not embarrassing it's you it's 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:00.830
 nothing at all 600 meters at sea 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:03.020
 here behind it is the steering wheel 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.760
 which serves us to drive the boat when 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.320
 we are in manual mode but here we are in 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.080
 automatic mode because we can not 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.730
 spend 24 hours on the wheel and 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.510
 that she autopilot is here 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.440
 that include you on the compass 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.590
 we give him an angle to follow and he 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.940
 follows and it's really practical that we 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.350
 sleep at night 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:31.020
 Finally, a little bit here 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.740
 so that's about three days ago 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.480
 we are at sea and we arrive at 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.790
 next port in 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.890
 2 tomorrow night tomorrow night maybe 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.970
 after tomorrow morning it depends on the weather 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.110
 it depends on the bench and 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.880
 so what do we do on the boat 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.320
 when you're at sea and not big 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.600
 thing in fact once the sails 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.830
 they are well configured relative 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.120
 in the wind e 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.670
 there is very little to do apart 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.270
 watched over the others 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.860
 boats them 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.520
 cargo ships especially there are a lot of 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.810
 cargos that revolves around australia 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.850
 monitored what other sailboats 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.600
 as well 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.800
 fishing boats also monitors 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.770
 story 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.470
 he all that can 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.260
 oil rigs everything 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:25.440
 can hinder the 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:26.760
 the passage of the boat from our boat and 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.320
 that's actually it's pretty much everything 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.370
 we have to do and so we spend our 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.080
 days must watch the sea to watch 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.880
 and look for a lighthouse on the horizon at 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.180
 look for little lights that we 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.790
 indicates the coast or another boat 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.050
 discreet on the water 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.900
 so that's why we are 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.130
 two aboard the boat and that that steve 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.840
 is not alone in fact most 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.250
 of time the skippers he likes to see 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.140
 at least one other person with them on 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.330
 the boat like that it helps to do 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.450
 especially night shifts have made 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.550
 periods of time where one of 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.630
 people who sleep and the other rest 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.900
 tickets are monitored 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.670
 and then we turn like that at night 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.300
 general it's six o'clock six o'clock 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.979
 teaser sleeps for our styles 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.500
 stay awake and then it's me 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.800
 who will watch the boat the steve to 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.800
 to sleep 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.270
 that's it but that's about all 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:21.740
 we have to do 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.110
 it's enough because it's 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.770
 really tired of being swayed 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:30.080
 constantly on the boat it's 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.460
 difficult to almost impossible to read 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.510
 or use the computer 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.280
 c 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.960
 very difficult to make food 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.070
 it's not always easy to eat 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.070
 when you have seasickness 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.240
 my case not much to do on the 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.790
 boat but we enjoy the sea ​​while 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.840
 simply 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:52.090
 especially when it's as beautiful as the name 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.090
 the benefit of the weather 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:00.969
 radios 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.830
 go 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.350
 eventually a little higher give the course 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.390
 horn in both directions and travel the 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.840
 recourse years to the edges but of 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.840
 macao
