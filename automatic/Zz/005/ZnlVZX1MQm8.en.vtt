and the thing that the reason I went
with<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.300> is<00:01:57.750> you're<00:01:57.990> not<00:01:58.110> catching<00:01:58.500> your

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
with this is you're not catching your

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.300 
with this is you're not catching your
your<00:02:00.090> feed<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.930> never<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.920> worry

recycling back through and dripping it

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.650 
recycling back through and dripping it
back<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.429> have<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> small<00:02:09.000> percentage

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.440 
back in and just have a small percentage
that<00:02:09.869> drains<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.470> that's<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.880> we're<00:02:12.239> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
that drains out that's it so we're the

I<00:02:33.780> think<00:02:34.780> it's<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.959> great<00:02:35.129> so<00:02:36.129> tell<00:02:36.370> us<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.580> bit<00:02:36.610> of

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
I think it's a great so tell us a bit of

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.400 
I think it's a great so tell us a bit of
how<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.239> works<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.599> see<00:02:37.750> that<00:02:37.900> you've<00:02:37.989> got<00:02:38.140> some

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
how it works I see that you've got some

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.920 
how it works I see that you've got some
lines<00:02:39.160> running<00:02:39.849> here<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.360> how<00:02:40.510> does<00:02:40.569> it<00:02:40.780> work

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
lines running here and how does it work

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.559 
lines running here and how does it work
well<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:41.890> have<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.400> nutrient<00:02:43.060> of<00:02:43.150> barrel<00:02:43.540> and

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
well you have a nutrient of barrel and

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.960 
well you have a nutrient of barrel and
your<00:02:44.200> ph<00:02:44.560> barrel<00:02:45.010> or<00:02:45.129> whatever<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.580> have<00:02:45.760> two

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
your ph barrel or whatever you have two

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.479 
your ph barrel or whatever you have two
pumps<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:47.019> they<00:02:47.260> even<00:02:47.530> put<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.890> mixture<00:02:48.099> in

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
pumps and they even put the mixture in

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.360 
pumps and they even put the mixture in
once<00:02:49.209> in<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.450> while<00:02:49.630> cuz<00:02:49.959> nice<00:02:50.410> big<00:02:50.680> barrels<00:02:51.130> and

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
once in a while cuz nice big barrels and

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.970 
once in a while cuz nice big barrels and
then<00:02:51.489> it<00:02:51.640> if<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.780> computer<00:02:53.260> turns<00:02:53.530> on<00:02:53.709> three

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
then it if the computer turns on three

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.250 
then it if the computer turns on three
times<00:02:54.190> a<00:02:54.400> day<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.760> drops<00:02:55.060> three<00:02:55.810> feedings

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
times a day and drops three feedings

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.840 
times a day and drops three feedings
into<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.709> top<00:02:56.980> two<00:02:57.250> of<00:02:57.519> each<00:02:57.640> morning

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
into the top two of each morning

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.730 
into the top two of each morning
basically<00:03:00.480> that's<00:03:00.630> pretty<00:03:00.960> much<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.170> fill

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
basically that's pretty much it fill

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.380 
basically that's pretty much it fill
your<00:03:01.830> barrels<00:03:02.220> in<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.640> couple<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.060> weeks<00:03:05.390> and

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
your barrels in a couple of weeks and

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.350 
your barrels in a couple of weeks and
that's<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:07.050> that's<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:08.040> so<00:03:08.700> what<00:03:09.000> about<00:03:09.090> the

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
that's it that's it so what about the

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.810 
that's it that's it so what about the
soil<00:03:09.660> then<00:03:09.930> what<00:03:10.230> is<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.470> actually<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.640> don't

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
soil then what is it actually you don't

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.670 
soil then what is it actually you don't
use<00:03:12.090> soil<00:03:12.330> it's<00:03:12.570> hydroponic<00:03:13.260> so<00:03:13.440> it's<00:03:13.590> a

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
use soil it's hydroponic so it's a

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.350 
use soil it's hydroponic so it's a
stereo<00:03:14.040> working<00:03:14.250> idiot<00:03:14.820> of<00:03:14.940> all<00:03:15.150> your

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
stereo working idiot of all your

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.150 
stereo working idiot of all your
nutrients<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.050> everything<00:03:16.380> comes<00:03:16.620> into<00:03:17.010> your

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
nutrients and everything comes into your

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.100 
nutrients and everything comes into your
drip<00:03:17.430> feed<00:03:17.670> building<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.360> all<00:03:18.660> you're<00:03:18.840> doing

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
drip feed building so all you're doing

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.130 
drip feed building so all you're doing
is<00:03:19.200> holding<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.650> roots<00:03:19.860> basically<00:03:21.080> this<00:03:22.080> is

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
is holding the roots basically this is

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.830 
is holding the roots basically this is
probably<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.400> least<00:03:23.700> amount<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.180> water<00:03:24.390> used

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
probably the least amount of water used

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.630 
probably the least amount of water used
to<00:03:24.990> grow<00:03:25.230> but<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.680> thing<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:25.920> makes<00:03:26.280> this

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
to grow but the thing that makes this

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.270 
to grow but the thing that makes this
really<00:03:27.300> makes<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.620> really<00:03:28.740> gonna<00:03:28.950> do

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
really makes it is you really gonna do

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.490 
really makes it is you really gonna do
things<00:03:29.550> locks<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.090> pesticides<00:03:30.630> or<00:03:30.810> any<00:03:31.350> of

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
things locks and pesticides or any of

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.800 
things locks and pesticides or any of
that<00:03:31.530> stuff<00:03:31.970> most<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.150> your<00:03:33.240> bestest<00:03:33.660> I

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
that stuff most of your bestest I

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:34.960 
that stuff most of your bestest I
promise<00:03:34.260> gone

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
promise gone

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.700 
promise gone
way<00:03:35.210> just<00:03:35.480> by<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.810> fact<00:03:36.110> that<00:03:36.320> you're<00:03:36.560> not

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710 
way just by the fact that you're not

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.920 
way just by the fact that you're not
growing<00:03:36.980> as<00:03:37.280> well<00:03:37.490> so<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.180> lose<00:03:38.450> your<00:03:38.630> soil
