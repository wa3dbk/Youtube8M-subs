00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
that pump so it wouldn't be the edge

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.030 
that pump so it wouldn't be the edge
where<00:01:51.910> it<00:01:52.060> would<00:01:52.180> be<00:01:52.210> sharp<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.979> I<00:01:54.220> drove<00:01:54.460> two

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
screw this down is going to put pressure

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.020 
screw this down is going to put pressure
right<00:02:23.290> here<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.709> push<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.160> pump<00:02:24.489> down<00:02:24.670> just

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.759 
down okay got a nice tight fit and it's
putting<00:02:39.160> a<00:02:39.310> little<00:02:39.430> pressure<00:02:39.549> on<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.769> will

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
putting a little pressure on that I will

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:49.960 
putting a little pressure on that I will
run<00:02:41.980> it
