will have all the commencement mod as
well<00:01:54.020> missions<00:01:55.780> here's<00:01:56.780> how<00:01:56.930> you<00:01:57.020> do<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.200> prefix

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
well missions here's how you do a prefix

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.960 
well missions here's how you do a prefix
your<00:01:59.060> prefix<00:01:59.510> you<00:01:59.810> soft<00:02:00.110> packs

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
your prefix you soft packs

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:11.260 
your prefix you soft packs
group<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:05.030> then<00:02:06.220> remain<00:02:07.220> test<00:02:08.110> prefix

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.090 

then<00:02:11.570> you<00:02:11.750> can<00:02:11.900> use<00:02:12.020> cause<00:02:12.290> so<00:02:12.620> I<00:02:12.680> went<00:02:12.830> for

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
then you can use cause so I went for

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.000 
then you can use cause so I went for
this<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:13.580> I'm<00:02:13.730> just<00:02:13.760> going<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.060> do

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
this so I'm just going to do

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
this so I'm just going to do
we'll<00:02:17.019> likely<00:02:18.019> call<00:02:18.470> here

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.090 

don't<00:02:24.660> need<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.930> do<00:02:25.080> any<00:02:25.410> cause<00:02:25.709> or<00:02:25.860> the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
don't need to do any cause or the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.970 
don't need to do any cause or the
brackets<00:02:26.790> or<00:02:27.060> anything<00:02:27.810> but<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.770> just<00:02:28.920> looks

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
brackets or anything but it just looks

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.080 
brackets or anything but it just looks
better<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:29.670> do<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.830> now<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.550> test<00:02:32.819> rank

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
better so do that and now the test rank

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.440 
better so do that and now the test rank
would<00:02:33.480> have<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:34.080> light<00:02:34.470> blue<00:02:34.680> prefix<00:02:35.450> and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
would have a light blue prefix and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.610 
would have a light blue prefix and
change<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.990> text<00:02:37.380> color<00:02:37.550> do<00:02:38.550> this<00:02:38.760> hex<00:02:39.620> group

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
change the text color do this hex group

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.190 
change the text color do this hex group
group<00:02:41.610> name<00:02:41.850> test<00:02:42.800> suffix<00:02:44.150> then<00:02:45.200> whatever
