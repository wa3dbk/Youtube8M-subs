numbers into percentages it's one of the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.999 
numbers into percentages it's one of the
little<00:01:04.850> treats<00:01:05.239> probably<00:01:05.690> do<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:06.590> hungry

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
one-handed the screen is a little

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.819 
one-handed the screen is a little
dispiriting<00:01:50.479> in<00:01:50.600> color<00:01:50.810> it's<00:01:51.079> a<00:01:51.200> little<00:01:51.229> grey

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
dispiriting in color it's a little grey

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.649 
dispiriting in color it's a little grey
and<00:01:52.159> because<00:01:52.369> it<00:01:52.460> doesn't<00:01:52.700> light<00:01:52.850> up<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.360> feels

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
and because it doesn't light up it feels

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.690 
and because it doesn't light up it feels
just<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:53.960> little<00:01:53.990> bit<00:01:54.259> like<00:01:55.040> looking<00:01:55.340> at<00:01:55.460> a<00:01:55.490> sort

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
just a little bit like looking at a sort

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.270 
just a little bit like looking at a sort
of<00:01:55.729> depressing<00:01:56.329> wall<00:01:56.509> in<00:01:56.689> a<00:01:56.750> hospital<00:01:57.280> because

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
of depressing wall in a hospital because

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.340 
of depressing wall in a hospital because
of<00:01:58.310> its<00:01:58.520> greyish<00:01:58.909> colour<00:01:59.210> which<00:01:59.689> in<00:01:59.990> its

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
of its greyish colour which in its

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.779 
of its greyish colour which in its
defense<00:02:00.649> they<00:02:00.860> all<00:02:01.009> are<00:02:01.219> it's<00:02:01.399> just<00:02:01.610> all<00:02:01.700> the

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
defense they all are it's just all the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.660 
defense they all are it's just all the
others<00:02:02.030> have<00:02:02.329> a<00:02:02.469> backlight<00:02:03.469> so<00:02:03.710> they<00:02:04.100> light<00:02:04.640> up

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
others have a backlight so they light up

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.730 
others have a backlight so they light up
to<00:02:04.939> a<00:02:05.000> nice<00:02:05.149> clean<00:02:05.360> white<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:06.289> Sony<00:02:06.469> doesn't

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
to a nice clean white the Sony doesn't

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.009 
to a nice clean white the Sony doesn't
although<00:02:07.159> I<00:02:07.430> think<00:02:07.820> if<00:02:07.969> you<00:02:08.179> want<00:02:08.810> you<00:02:08.899> could

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
although I think if you want you could

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.930 
although I think if you want you could
buy<00:02:09.170> a<00:02:09.200> separate<00:02:09.979> case<00:02:10.190> that<00:02:10.549> has<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.670> light<00:02:10.910> on

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
buy a separate case that has a light on

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.550 
buy a separate case that has a light on
so<00:02:11.299> if<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.480> choose<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.900> read<00:02:12.019> by<00:02:12.200> night<00:02:12.350> you

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
so if you choose to read by night you

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.840 
so if you choose to read by night you
don't<00:02:12.680> have<00:02:12.829> to<00:02:12.890> be<00:02:12.950> put<00:02:13.130> off<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.489> think

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
don't have to be put off I think

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.610 
don't have to be put off I think
probably<00:02:14.150> its<00:02:14.390> main<00:02:14.570> virtue<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:15.049> this<00:02:15.170> extreme

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
probably its main virtue is this extreme

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.380 
probably its main virtue is this extreme
lightness<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.280> fact<00:02:16.549> that<00:02:16.609> because<00:02:17.150> at

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
lightness and the fact that because at

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.910 
lightness and the fact that because at
the<00:02:17.510> end<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.780> reading<00:02:17.959> you<00:02:18.290> have<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.650> sort<00:02:18.890> of

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
the end of reading you have the sort of

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.250 
the end of reading you have the sort of
joy<00:02:19.190> of<00:02:19.489> shutting<00:02:20.299> it<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.810> does<00:02:21.049> feel<00:02:21.230> like

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
joy of shutting it it does feel like

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.720 
joy of shutting it it does feel like
you've<00:02:21.530> completed<00:02:21.890> an<00:02:22.100> action<00:02:22.400> which<00:02:22.549> I<00:02:22.670> never

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
you've completed an action which I never

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.120 
you've completed an action which I never
quite<00:02:23.120> feel<00:02:23.690> if<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:23.989> just<00:02:24.410> kind<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:24.739> put<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:24.920> down

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
quite feel if I just kind of put it down

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.670 
quite feel if I just kind of put it down
and<00:02:25.340> then<00:02:25.430> let<00:02:25.459> it<00:02:25.760> go<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.120> sleep<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:27.380> be<00:02:27.410> honest

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
and then let it go to sleep to be honest

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.410 
and then let it go to sleep to be honest
even<00:02:27.829> saying<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.489> I've<00:02:28.730> got<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:28.910> device<00:02:29.150> go<00:02:29.359> to

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
even saying that I've got a device go to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.390 
even saying that I've got a device go to
sleep<00:02:29.660> pains<00:02:29.959> me<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.799> is<00:02:30.950> just<00:02:31.130> too

Kobo now I am thoroughly ashamed to
admit<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.699> only<00:02:41.030> one<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:42.139> got<00:02:42.560> this<00:02:42.709> view

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:42.919 
admit that only one I got this view

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:43.570 
admit that only one I got this view
through

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
through

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.150 
through
to<00:02:43.640> review<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.270> my<00:02:44.840> partner<00:02:45.260> says<00:02:45.410> Oh<00:02:45.620> Kobo

to review and my partner says Oh Kobo

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.440 
to review and my partner says Oh Kobo
yes<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.490> course<00:02:46.670> it's<00:02:46.820> not<00:02:46.940> like<00:02:47.030> I'm<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.240> book

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
yes of course it's not like I'm a book

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.050 
yes of course it's not like I'm a book
that<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:47.840> realized<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.320> wasn't<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.980> book<00:02:52.060> but

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
that I realized it wasn't a book but

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.420 
that I realized it wasn't a book but
again<00:02:53.750> it's<00:02:54.020> incredibly<00:02:54.470> light<00:02:54.530> it's<00:02:55.040> easy<00:02:55.190> to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
again it's incredibly light it's easy to

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.010 
again it's incredibly light it's easy to
read<00:02:55.580> one-handed<00:02:56.150> it's<00:02:56.300> about<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.660> weight<00:02:56.840> of

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
read one-handed it's about the weight of

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.860 
read one-handed it's about the weight of
of<00:02:57.590> 1970s<00:02:58.460> paperback<00:02:58.940> not<00:02:59.240> a<00:02:59.270> mucky<00:02:59.540> one<00:02:59.690> a

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
of 1970s paperback not a mucky one a

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.460 
of 1970s paperback not a mucky one a
tiny<00:03:00.110> one

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
tiny one

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.110 
tiny one
I<00:03:00.500> think<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.010> downside<00:03:01.520> is<00:03:01.670> that<00:03:01.700> because<00:03:02.000> the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
I think the downside is that because the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.760 
I think the downside is that because the
screen<00:03:02.360> is<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:02.540> small<00:03:02.750> it's<00:03:03.410> alright<00:03:03.740> for

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
screen is so small it's alright for

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.590 
screen is so small it's alright for
regular<00:03:04.340> prose<00:03:04.580> it's<00:03:04.790> not<00:03:04.910> great<00:03:05.060> for<00:03:05.090> comics

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
regular prose it's not great for comics

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.020 
regular prose it's not great for comics
you<00:03:06.080> can<00:03:06.260> see<00:03:06.440> here<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.800> I<00:03:06.890> am<00:03:07.010> reading<00:03:07.220> The

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
you can see here that I am reading The

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.970 
you can see here that I am reading The
Walking<00:03:08.210> Dead<00:03:08.390> which<00:03:09.050> I<00:03:09.230> have<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.590> be<00:03:09.710> honest

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
Walking Dead which I have to be honest

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.410 
Walking Dead which I have to be honest
it<00:03:10.310> should<00:03:10.580> work<00:03:10.760> because<00:03:11.180> it's<00:03:11.330> a

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
it should work because it's a

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.890 
it should work because it's a
black-and-white<00:03:11.900> comic<00:03:12.490> but<00:03:13.490> it<00:03:14.450> probably

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
black-and-white comic but it probably

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.720 
black-and-white comic but it probably
the<00:03:15.260> pages<00:03:15.620> are<00:03:15.740> okay<00:03:16.010> when<00:03:16.130> it's<00:03:16.280> warm<00:03:16.400> panel

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
the pages are okay when it's warm panel

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.400 
the pages are okay when it's warm panel
when<00:03:16.850> it's<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.180> bunch<00:03:17.510> of<00:03:17.660> panels<00:03:17.870> it's

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
when it's a bunch of panels it's

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.140 
when it's a bunch of panels it's
probably<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:18.950> little<00:03:19.100> bit<00:03:19.280> too<00:03:19.400> small<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:20.000> read

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
probably a little bit too small to read

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.470

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
range of potential reading material I

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.640 
range of potential reading material I
can't<00:05:30.150> lie<00:05:30.360> to<00:05:30.389> you<00:05:30.570> I<00:05:30.660> have<00:05:30.870> set<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.139> pages<00:05:31.500> to

can't lie to you I have set the pages to
sepia<00:05:32.070> cuz<00:05:32.310> I<00:05:32.370> it's<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.580> little<00:05:32.820> bit<00:05:32.910> easier<00:05:33.000> on

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
sepia cuz I it's a little bit easier on

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.360 
sepia cuz I it's a little bit easier on
the<00:05:33.300> eyes<00:05:33.389> and<00:05:33.870> so<00:05:34.260> it<00:05:34.350> is<00:05:34.440> a<00:05:34.470> slightly<00:05:34.860> poncey

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
the eyes and so it is a slightly poncey

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.010 
the eyes and so it is a slightly poncey
color<00:05:35.610> and<00:05:35.940> there<00:05:36.030> were<00:05:36.090> lovely<00:05:36.240> edges<00:05:36.780> to<00:05:36.930> the

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
color and there were lovely edges to the

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.159 
color and there were lovely edges to the
page<00:05:37.199> its<00:05:37.590> maximum<00:05:38.580> pon<00:05:38.820> subdued<00:05:39.210> but<00:05:39.960> in<00:05:40.050> my

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
page its maximum pon subdued but in my

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.779 
page its maximum pon subdued but in my
defense<00:05:40.500> I<00:05:40.710> am<00:05:40.830> reading<00:05:41.130> John<00:05:41.370> McEnroe's

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
defense I am reading John McEnroe's

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.909 
defense I am reading John McEnroe's
autobiography<00:05:42.660> so<00:05:42.840> I<00:05:42.870> think<00:05:42.990> that<00:05:43.320> should

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
autobiography so I think that should

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.560 
autobiography so I think that should
slightly<00:05:44.310> counterbalance<00:05:45.060> some<00:05:45.360> of<00:05:45.479> the

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
slightly counterbalance some of the

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.810 
slightly counterbalance some of the
ponts<00:05:45.810> on<00:05:45.900> us<00:05:46.020> I'm<00:05:46.169> hoping<00:05:46.500> so<00:05:46.710> anyway<00:05:47.639> I'm

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
ponts on us I'm hoping so anyway I'm

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.219 
ponts on us I'm hoping so anyway I'm
very<00:05:47.880> fond<00:05:48.210> of<00:05:48.270> it<00:05:48.389> I<00:05:48.539> wouldn't<00:05:48.780> swap<00:05:48.900> it<00:05:51.110> if<00:05:52.110> I

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
very fond of it I wouldn't swap it if I

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.409

that's mine to begin with and it was

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.629 
that's mine to begin with and it was
present<00:06:01.050> so<00:06:01.349> if<00:06:01.410> we<00:06:01.530> particularly<00:06:01.979> thank<00:06:02.400> us

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
it over the remainder I think I am

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.080 
it over the remainder I think I am
probably<00:06:08.760> going<00:06:09.389> to<00:06:09.570> go<00:06:09.810> with<00:06:10.380> the<00:06:12.139> I<00:06:13.139> like<00:06:13.560> the

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
probably going to go with the I like the

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.700 
probably going to go with the I like the
rounded<00:06:15.090> edges<00:06:15.449> of<00:06:15.479> it<00:06:15.750> I<00:06:15.930> like<00:06:16.169> how<00:06:16.380> it<00:06:16.440> feels

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
rounded edges of it I like how it feels

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.740 
rounded edges of it I like how it feels
a<00:06:16.830> little<00:06:16.949> bit<00:06:17.159> like<00:06:17.310> a<00:06:17.340> toy<00:06:17.760> I<00:06:18.090> think<00:06:18.449> that

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
a little bit like a toy I think that

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.320 
a little bit like a toy I think that
reading<00:06:19.560> should<00:06:20.010> feel<00:06:20.280> like<00:06:20.460> fun<00:06:20.820> and<00:06:21.060> not

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
reading should feel like fun and not

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.629 
reading should feel like fun and not
work<00:06:21.510> even<00:06:21.930> when<00:06:22.020> you<00:06:22.110> do<00:06:22.229> it<00:06:22.320> for<00:06:22.440> work<00:06:22.639> and

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
work even when you do it for work and

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.820 
work even when you do it for work and
then<00:06:24.180> in<00:06:24.300> second<00:06:24.659> place<00:06:24.720> a<00:06:24.930> very<00:06:25.199> close<00:06:25.500> second

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
then in second place a very close second

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.279 
then in second place a very close second
place<00:06:25.979> is<00:06:26.520> the<00:06:26.849> Kindle<00:06:27.270> which<00:06:27.510> I<00:06:27.720> liked<00:06:27.960> very

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
place is the Kindle which I liked very

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:30.140 
place is the Kindle which I liked very
much<00:06:28.800> more<00:06:29.130> than<00:06:29.250> I<00:06:29.310> expected<00:06:29.340> too<00:06:29.849> it's<00:06:30.000> got<00:06:30.090> a
