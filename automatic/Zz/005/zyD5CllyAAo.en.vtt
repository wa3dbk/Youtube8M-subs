know why people want to really do this I
mean<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:23.970> guess<00:02:24.569> it's<00:02:24.780> impressive<00:02:25.379> but<00:02:25.640> you're

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
mean I guess it's impressive but you're

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.910 
mean I guess it's impressive but you're
not<00:02:26.819> gonna<00:02:27.299> get<00:02:27.569> these<00:02:27.720> gameplays<00:02:28.290> begins

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
not gonna get these gameplays begins

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.199 
not gonna get these gameplays begins
people<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.400> are<00:02:29.519> close<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.790> your<00:02:30.000> skill

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
people that are close to your skill

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.960 
people that are close to your skill
level<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:31.620> mean<00:02:31.920> that's<00:02:32.069> just<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.430> true<00:02:32.670> fact

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
level and I mean that's just a true fact

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.479 
level and I mean that's just a true fact
no<00:02:33.329> one<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.690> gonna<00:02:33.810> be<00:02:33.989> able<00:02:34.049> to<00:02:34.200> drop<00:02:34.410> 30<00:02:35.160> kills

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
no one is gonna be able to drop 30 kills

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.729 
no one is gonna be able to drop 30 kills
straight<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.150> mean<00:02:36.510> maybe<00:02:36.810> once<00:02:37.110> in<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.349> million

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
straight I mean maybe once in a million

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.380 
straight I mean maybe once in a million
they'll<00:02:38.040> be<00:02:38.130> able<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.310> drop<00:02:38.519> Pat<00:02:38.819> against

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
they'll be able to drop Pat against

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.589 
they'll be able to drop Pat against
people<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.720> equal<00:02:40.200> skill<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:42.209> pelham

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
people of equal skill and so the pelham

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.940 
people of equal skill and so the pelham
comes<00:02:42.810> down<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.230> skill<00:02:43.500> based<00:02:43.709> matchmaking

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
comes down to skill based matchmaking

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.240 
comes down to skill based matchmaking
and<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:45.239> don't<00:02:46.019> think<00:02:46.319> it's<00:02:46.470> necessarily<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.040> bad

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
and I don't think it's necessarily a bad

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.949 
and I don't think it's necessarily a bad
thing<00:02:47.310> but<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.970> needs<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.269> be<00:02:48.329> tweaked<00:02:48.720> in

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
thing but it needs to be tweaked in

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.600 
thing but it needs to be tweaked in
certain<00:02:49.260> ways<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.650> reverse<00:02:50.160> boosting

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
certain ways that reverse boosting

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.280 
certain ways that reverse boosting
shouldn't<00:02:50.879> be<00:02:50.940> possible<00:02:51.450> in<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.959> first<00:02:52.170> place

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
shouldn't be possible in the first place

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.990 
shouldn't be possible in the first place
no<00:02:52.650> one<00:02:52.739> should<00:02:52.890> be<00:02:53.010> able<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.220> reverse<00:02:53.579> Bruce

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
no one should be able to reverse Bruce

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.150 
no one should be able to reverse Bruce
their<00:02:54.269> way<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:55.079> facing<00:02:55.440> noobs<00:02:55.650> all<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.950> time

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
their way to facing noobs all the time

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.979 
their way to facing noobs all the time
and<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:57.150> remember<00:02:57.510> when<00:02:57.629> I<00:02:57.660> first<00:02:57.720> started

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
and I remember when I first started

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.500 
and I remember when I first started
playing<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:59.040> game<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.519> would<00:02:59.670> be<00:02:59.910> like<00:03:00.120> oh<00:03:00.299> my

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.150 
wow I'm just getting melted half the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
time so that's skill based matchmaking

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.059 
time so that's skill based matchmaking
for<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.850> they<00:03:09.359> have<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.660> tweak<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.079> so<00:03:10.350> it

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
for you they have to tweak it so it

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.660 
for you they have to tweak it so it
focuses<00:03:11.700> more<00:03:12.299> on<00:03:12.359> connection<00:03:13.290> but<00:03:14.130> also

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
focuses more on connection but also

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.180 
focuses more on connection but also
cannot<00:03:15.569> allow<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.170> reverse<00:03:16.530> boost<00:03:16.889> thing<00:03:17.099> if

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
cannot allow this reverse boost thing if

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.319 
cannot allow this reverse boost thing if
they're<00:03:17.310> going<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.489> keep<00:03:17.670> skill-based<00:03:18.090> match

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
they're going to keep skill-based match

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
point about reverse boosting I think

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.099 
point about reverse boosting I think
it's<00:03:29.579> really<00:03:29.819> ridiculous<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.780> these<00:03:30.959> people

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
it's really ridiculous that these people

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
impressive or enjoyable to watch because

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.050 
impressive or enjoyable to watch because
it's<00:03:49.750> really<00:03:50.019> just<00:03:50.170> shooting<00:03:51.159> people<00:03:51.519> that

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
it's really just shooting people that

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.149 
it's really just shooting people that
aren't<00:03:52.540> even<00:03:52.720> looking<00:03:52.840> at<00:03:53.049> you<00:03:53.110> or<00:03:53.650> don't<00:03:53.920> even

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
and it's never really impressive to

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.020 
and it's never really impressive to
watch<00:03:57.700> in<00:03:58.209> my<00:03:58.329> opinion<00:03:58.659> so<00:03:59.379> that's<00:04:00.370> why<00:04:00.700> I

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
watch in my opinion so that's why I

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.330 
watch in my opinion so that's why I
would<00:04:01.629> never<00:04:01.780> do<00:04:02.049> this<00:04:02.230> I<00:04:02.470> don't<00:04:02.890> even<00:04:02.980> find<00:04:03.220> it

would never do this I don't even find it
impressive<00:04:03.579> and<00:04:03.970> if<00:04:04.090> I<00:04:04.180> drop<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:04.720> DNA<00:04:05.590> bomb<00:04:05.799> it's

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
impressive and if I drop a DNA bomb it's

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.190 
impressive and if I drop a DNA bomb it's
because<00:04:06.489> i<00:04:06.519> actually<00:04:06.909> have<00:04:07.269> skill<00:04:07.599> and<00:04:07.780> I<00:04:07.810> when

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
that'll probably it's kind of unlikely

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.960 
that'll probably it's kind of unlikely
especially<00:04:41.740> with<00:04:42.190> skill<00:04:42.610> based<00:04:42.789> matchmaking

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
especially with skill based matchmaking

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.820 
especially with skill based matchmaking
I'm<00:04:43.630> always<00:04:43.810> matched<00:04:44.110> up<00:04:44.320> against<00:04:44.530> pretty

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
I'm always matched up against pretty

I'm always matched up against pretty
decent<00:04:45.370> players<00:04:45.700> and<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.750> think<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:47.050> highest

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
decent players and I think the highest

decent players and I think the highest

killstreak I've had in this game so far

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.510 
killstreak I've had in this game so far
I<00:04:49.150> think<00:04:49.210> I<00:04:49.450> got<00:04:49.599> one<00:04:50.160> relentless<00:04:51.160> which<00:04:51.340> is<00:04:51.490> a

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
I think I got one relentless which is a

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.659 
I think I got one relentless which is a
20<00:04:51.970> maybe<00:04:52.630> 2<00:04:52.900> i'm<00:04:53.050> not<00:04:53.200> sure<00:04:53.410> but<00:04:53.490> so<00:04:54.490> far

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
20 maybe 2 i'm not sure but so far

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.400 
20 maybe 2 i'm not sure but so far
that's<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:55.000> farthest<00:04:55.360> i've<00:04:55.479> got<00:04:55.720> do<00:04:56.169> I<00:04:56.260> see

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
that's the farthest i've got do I see

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.830 
that's the farthest i've got do I see
myself<00:04:56.440> ever<00:04:57.070> getting<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.400> DNA<00:04:57.550> bomb<00:04:57.910> maybe<00:04:58.599> I

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
myself ever getting a DNA bomb maybe I

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.659 
myself ever getting a DNA bomb maybe I
don't<00:04:59.110> know<00:04:59.289> I<00:04:59.530> don't<00:04:59.710> really<00:04:59.919> go<00:05:00.190> for<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.550> as

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
don't know I don't really go for it as

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.219 
don't know I don't really go for it as
you<00:05:00.849> know<00:05:00.970> I<00:05:01.000> usually<00:05:01.360> play<00:05:01.660> ranked<00:05:02.110> or

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
you know I usually play ranked or

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.320 
you know I usually play ranked or
free-for-all<00:05:02.919> and<00:05:03.070> both<00:05:03.639> those<00:05:03.910> are<00:05:04.120> really

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
free-for-all and both those are really

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.659 
free-for-all and both those are really
difficult<00:05:04.570> to<00:05:04.930> get<00:05:05.050> DNA<00:05:05.349> bombs<00:05:05.560> in<00:05:05.800> but<00:05:06.310> that's

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
difficult to get DNA bombs in but that's
