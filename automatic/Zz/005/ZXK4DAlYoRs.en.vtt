I'm really tired of shopping I mean

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.510 
I'm really tired of shopping I mean
looking<00:00:31.500> at<00:00:31.529> clothes<00:00:31.800> for<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> couple<00:00:32.430> hours

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
looking at clothes for a couple hours

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.760 
looking at clothes for a couple hours
made<00:00:32.850> my<00:00:32.969> eyes<00:00:33.210> hurt<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.440> sat<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.680> front

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
made my eyes hurt as if I sat in front

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.680 
made my eyes hurt as if I sat in front
of<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> computer<00:00:35.430> for<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.610> couple<00:00:35.670> hours<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.450> I
