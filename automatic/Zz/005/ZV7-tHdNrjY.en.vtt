ops<00:00:33.899> 2<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.710> know<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.950> generally<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.309> like<00:00:35.340> to

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
ops 2 you know that generally I like to

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.819 
ops 2 you know that generally I like to
have<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> straight-up<00:00:36.300> bomb<00:00:36.690> spot<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.500> bank

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
have a straight-up bomb spot and a bank

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.850 
have a straight-up bomb spot and a bank
shot<00:00:38.129> at<00:00:38.399> each<00:00:39.149> bomb<00:00:39.540> site<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.469> with<00:00:40.710> this

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
shot at each bomb site but with this

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.590 
shot at each bomb site but with this
particular<00:00:41.190> site<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.940> actually<00:00:42.270> creates<00:00:42.390> a

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
particular site it actually creates a

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.030 
particular site it actually creates a
challenge<00:00:42.989> because<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> bomb<00:00:43.710> site<00:00:43.920> is

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
challenge because the a bomb site is

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.229 
challenge because the a bomb site is
inside<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.489> abilities<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.940> didn't<00:00:45.120> get<00:00:45.180> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
inside of abilities I didn't get a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.360 
inside of abilities I didn't get a
little<00:00:45.390> bit<00:00:45.480> creative<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:45.960> these<00:00:46.140> spots<00:00:46.530> so

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
little bit creative with these spots so

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.529 
little bit creative with these spots so
as<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.489> see<00:00:47.700> there<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.059> push<00:00:48.239> yourself

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
as you see there you can push yourself

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.540 
as you see there you can push yourself
up<00:00:48.660> against<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.140> tree<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:50.280> want<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
up against that tree and you want to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.670 
up against that tree and you want to
line<00:00:50.789> your<00:00:50.969> throwing<00:00:51.239> knife<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:51.840> with<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
line your throwing knife up with the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.799 
line your throwing knife up with the
second<00:00:53.219> tree<00:00:53.579> branch<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.120> hanging<00:00:54.570> off

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
second tree branch that is hanging off

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.410 
second tree branch that is hanging off
the<00:00:55.050> edge<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.649> tree<00:00:55.860> there<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.210> want

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the edge of the tree there so you want

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.060 
the edge of the tree there so you want
the<00:00:57.539> top<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:58.050> your<00:00:58.230> throw<00:00:58.440> enough<00:00:58.710> just

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the top of your throw enough just

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.010 
the top of your throw enough just
touching<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> top<00:00:59.789> of<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.390> second<00:01:00.840> tree

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
touching the top of that second tree

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.439 
touching the top of that second tree
branch<00:01:01.289> line<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.430> up<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.270> you'll

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
branch line it up just like that you'll

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.479 
branch line it up just like that you'll
get<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.660> very<00:01:04.140> nice<00:01:04.439> killcam<00:01:04.949> as<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.250> see<00:01:05.460> here

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
get a very nice killcam as we see here

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.219 
get a very nice killcam as we see here
it's<00:01:06.119> going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.360> fly<00:01:06.600> right<00:01:06.960> through<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
it's going to fly right through the
