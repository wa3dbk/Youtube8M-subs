00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
this is a dollar store scarf for this

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
this is a dollar store scarf for this
one<00:02:12.129> you<00:02:12.519> will<00:02:12.640> need<00:02:12.879> four<00:02:13.330> four<00:02:14.110> of<00:02:14.260> these

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
one you will need four four of these

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.830 
one you will need four four of these
just<00:02:15.940> like<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.120> one<00:02:16.360> we<00:02:16.390> worked<00:02:16.690> on<00:02:18.840> because

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
just like the one we worked on because

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.160 
just like the one we worked on because
these<00:02:20.230> scarves<00:02:20.560> don't<00:02:20.769> have<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.920> front<00:02:21.220> or<00:02:21.370> back

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
these scarves don't have a front or back

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.210 
these scarves don't have a front or back
you<00:02:23.170> don't<00:02:23.349> have<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.560> worry<00:02:23.709> about<00:02:23.769> placing

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
you don't have to worry about placing

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.680 
you don't have to worry about placing
the<00:02:24.310> right<00:02:24.430> sides<00:02:24.700> together<00:02:24.879> but<00:02:25.300> we're<00:02:25.450> going

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
the right sides together but we're going

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.369 
the right sides together but we're going
to<00:02:25.840> sew<00:02:26.019> them

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
to sew them

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.089 
to sew them
so<00:02:26.800> using<00:02:27.129> these<00:02:27.400> papers<00:02:27.940> as<00:02:28.209> my<00:02:28.450> example<00:02:29.099> I'm

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
so using these papers as my example I'm

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.100 
so using these papers as my example I'm
going<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.519> place<00:02:31.090> one<00:02:31.120> on<00:02:31.480> top<00:02:31.629> of<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.959> other

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
going to place one on top of the other

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.390 
going to place one on top of the other
so<00:02:32.760> down<00:02:33.760> one<00:02:34.120> side<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.719> then<00:02:35.530> as<00:02:35.769> you<00:02:35.889> open<00:02:36.249> it

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
so down one side and then as you open it

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.789 
so down one side and then as you open it
you'll<00:02:37.180> see<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:37.840> have<00:02:38.019> a<00:02:38.230> piece<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.590> is

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
you'll see that you have a piece that is

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:39.270 
you'll see that you have a piece that is

did<00:02:39.450> repeat<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.660> with<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.560> other<00:02:41.800> two<00:02:42.100> scars

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
did repeat that with the other two scars

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.020 
did repeat that with the other two scars
sewing<00:02:42.970> down<00:02:43.120> one<00:02:43.420> side<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:48.700> you'll<00:02:48.850> take

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
sewing down one side and you'll take

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.850 
sewing down one side and you'll take
your<00:02:49.300> two<00:02:49.540> pieces<00:02:49.569> lining<00:02:50.380> up<00:02:50.500> your<00:02:50.530> side

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
your two pieces lining up your side

seams on top of each other and connect
them<00:02:57.010> together<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.940> when<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.150> open<00:02:58.450> it<00:02:58.510> up<00:02:59.670> you

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
them together so when you open it up you

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.380 
them together so when you open it up you
have<00:03:00.819> one<00:03:01.060> piece<00:03:01.360> that<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:02.890> all<00:03:03.130> connected<00:03:03.400> now

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
have one piece that is all connected now

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.630 
have one piece that is all connected now
to<00:03:04.450> get<00:03:04.750> this<00:03:04.930> bunchy<00:03:05.440> full<00:03:05.739> look<00:03:06.040> we're<00:03:06.400> going

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
to get this bunchy full look we're going

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.850 
to get this bunchy full look we're going
to<00:03:06.760> use<00:03:06.910> elastic<00:03:07.540> thread<00:03:07.810> you<00:03:08.290> simply<00:03:08.650> hand

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
to use elastic thread you simply hand

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.910 
to use elastic thread you simply hand
wind<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.400> onto<00:03:10.330> a<00:03:10.360> bobbin<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:10.989> place<00:03:11.050> it<00:03:11.709> in

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
wind it onto a bobbin and place it in

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.400 
wind it onto a bobbin and place it in
your<00:03:11.980> machine<00:03:12.459> using<00:03:12.940> regular<00:03:13.600> cotton<00:03:14.019> thread

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
your machine using regular cotton thread

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.250 
your machine using regular cotton thread
on<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.830> top<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.810> because<00:03:16.810> we've<00:03:16.959> connected

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
on the top and because we've connected

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.370 
on the top and because we've connected
four<00:03:17.830> scarfs<00:03:18.430> together<00:03:18.850> your<00:03:19.690> scarf<00:03:20.019> is<00:03:20.170> going

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
four scarfs together your scarf is going

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.350 
four scarfs together your scarf is going
to<00:03:20.500> be<00:03:20.620> extra<00:03:21.310> long<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:21.850> this<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.180> good

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
to be extra long and this is good

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.440 
to be extra long and this is good
because<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:23.050> elastic<00:03:23.500> thread<00:03:23.830> will<00:03:24.819> bunch<00:03:25.269> it

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
because the elastic thread will bunch it

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.180 
because the elastic thread will bunch it
up<00:03:25.600> so<00:03:25.780> that<00:03:25.930> it's<00:03:26.080> shorter<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.709> if<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:26.980> don't

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
up so that it's shorter and if you don't

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.040 
up so that it's shorter and if you don't
connect<00:03:27.489> four<00:03:27.730> together<00:03:27.850> if<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:28.600> just<00:03:28.810> try<00:03:28.989> it

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
connect four together if you just try it

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.900 
connect four together if you just try it
with<00:03:29.230> two<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.680> end<00:03:29.830> up<00:03:29.950> with<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.130> really<00:03:30.459> short

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
with two you end up with a really short

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.199 
with two you end up with a really short
scarf<00:03:31.830> so<00:03:32.830> what<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.040> did<00:03:33.840> with<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.019> scarf<00:03:35.319> is

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
scarf so what I did with the scarf is

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.530 
scarf so what I did with the scarf is
down<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.569> center<00:03:38.019> seam<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.530> ran<00:03:39.209> my<00:03:40.209> elastic

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
down the center seam I ran my elastic

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.880 
down the center seam I ran my elastic
thread<00:03:41.190> which<00:03:42.190> gave<00:03:42.430> me<00:03:42.580> this<00:03:42.880> long<00:03:43.150> side<00:03:43.890> then

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
thread which gave me this long side then

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.020 
thread which gave me this long side then
on<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.850> on<00:03:46.239> either<00:03:46.780> of<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.350> sides<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:48.030> ran

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
on the on either of the sides I ran

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.240 
on the on either of the sides I ran
another<00:03:49.540> line<00:03:49.900> of<00:03:50.110> elastic<00:03:50.590> thread<00:03:50.799> to<00:03:50.980> create

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
another line of elastic thread to create

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.340 
another line of elastic thread to create
a<00:03:51.280> bunch<00:03:51.489> leaving<00:03:52.239> this<00:03:52.390> side<00:03:52.660> kind<00:03:53.019> of<00:03:53.140> long

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
a bunch leaving this side kind of long

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.530 
a bunch leaving this side kind of long
and<00:03:53.380> flowing<00:03:53.890> if<00:03:54.040> you<00:03:54.400> wanted<00:03:54.820> you<00:03:55.090> could<00:03:55.239> run

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
and flowing if you wanted you could run

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.949 
and flowing if you wanted you could run
a<00:03:55.750> third<00:03:57.000> stitching<00:03:58.000> line<00:03:58.180> of<00:03:58.360> that<00:03:58.510> elastic

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
a third stitching line of that elastic

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.020 
a third stitching line of that elastic
thread<00:03:59.170> up<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.530> other<00:03:59.650> side<00:03:59.920> but<00:04:00.430> I<00:04:00.459> loved<00:04:00.820> the

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
thread up the other side but I loved the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.110 
thread up the other side but I loved the
look<00:04:01.180> of<00:04:01.590> tight<00:04:02.590> bunch<00:04:02.950> a<00:04:03.340> bunch<00:04:03.850> in<00:04:04.030> the

look of tight bunch a bunch in the
middle<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.570> this<00:04:04.690> long<00:04:04.959> flowing<00:04:05.350> look<00:04:05.700> which
