know even if like fifa 13 it wasn't

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.559 
know even if like fifa 13 it wasn't
online<00:02:42.689> maybe<00:02:43.530> they<00:02:43.709> just<00:02:43.849> tested<00:02:44.849> it<00:02:44.939> like<00:02:45.239> on

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
online maybe they just tested it like on

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
know structure it that that sounds at

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.300 
know structure it that that sounds at
yeah<00:02:51.389> yeah<00:02:51.629> I<00:02:51.690> mean<00:02:51.840> obviously<00:02:52.200> they<00:02:53.040> love<00:02:53.190> to

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.920 
yeah yeah I mean obviously they love to
be<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.459> rating<00:02:53.970> system<00:02:54.000> they'll<00:02:54.569> have<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.750> be

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
be a rating system they'll have to be

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.539 
be a rating system they'll have to be
some<00:02:55.200> boundaries<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:56.069> that<00:02:56.099> you<00:02:56.310> don't<00:02:56.489> need

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
some boundaries so that you don't need

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.490 
some boundaries so that you don't need
to<00:02:56.639> go<00:02:56.760> around<00:02:57.030> telling<00:02:57.540> people<00:02:57.989> off<00:02:58.109> I<00:02:58.290> mean

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
to go around telling people off I mean

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.140 
to go around telling people off I mean
like<00:02:58.680> this<00:02:59.400> should<00:02:59.549> be<00:02:59.609> like<00:02:59.639> different

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
like this should be like different

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.660 
like this should be like different
levels<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.810> start<00:03:01.230> off<00:03:01.409> refereeing<00:03:02.400> it

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
levels that you start off refereeing it

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.740 
levels that you start off refereeing it
say<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.319> the<00:03:04.319> npower<00:03:04.620> league<00:03:04.889> 2<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:06.540> then

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
say like the npower league 2 and then

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.920 
say like the npower league 2 and then
like<00:03:06.989> depending<00:03:07.709> on<00:03:07.739> your<00:03:07.950> ratings<00:03:08.519> yeah<00:03:08.930> you

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
like depending on your ratings yeah you

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.599 
like depending on your ratings yeah you
can<00:03:10.139> right<00:03:10.260> decisions<00:03:10.799> your<00:03:10.950> move<00:03:11.159> up<00:03:11.310> leagues

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
can right decisions your move up leagues

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.210 
can right decisions your move up leagues
and<00:03:11.939> they're<00:03:12.750> getting<00:03:13.079> to<00:03:13.349> like<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.680> Barclays

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
and they're getting to like the Barclays

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.740 
and they're getting to like the Barclays
Prem<00:03:14.549> and<00:03:14.579> maybe<00:03:15.120> even<00:03:15.299> referee

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
Prem and maybe even referee

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.619 
Prem and maybe even referee
international<00:03:16.620> matches<00:03:16.829> I<00:03:17.220> think<00:03:18.150> that'd<00:03:18.449> be

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
international matches I think that'd be

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:25.490 
international matches I think that'd be
a<00:03:19.139> good<00:03:19.530> way<00:03:21.889> EA<00:03:22.889> to<00:03:23.069> make<00:03:23.819> sure<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.750> minimal

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
a good way EA to make sure that minimal

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.259 
a good way EA to make sure that minimal
people<00:03:25.949> actually<00:03:26.489> mess<00:03:26.730> about<00:03:26.879> with<00:03:27.030> this

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
people actually mess about with this

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.879 
people actually mess about with this
mode<00:03:27.510> because<00:03:27.750> like<00:03:28.049> if<00:03:28.199> you<00:03:28.319> do<00:03:28.470> just<00:03:28.500> mess

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
mode because like if you do just mess

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.819 
mode because like if you do just mess
about<00:03:29.040> take<00:03:29.459> advantage<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:30.329> and

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
about take advantage of it and

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.039 
about take advantage of it and
disrespect<00:03:31.829> it<00:03:32.180> then<00:03:33.180> you'd<00:03:33.329> obviously<00:03:33.480> just

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
disrespect it then you'd obviously just

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.229 
disrespect it then you'd obviously just
sit<00:03:34.290> there<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:34.829> league<00:03:35.099> to<00:03:35.400> your<00:03:35.760> whole<00:03:35.879> fifa

first<00:04:19.720> it<00:04:20.720> could<00:04:20.780> do<00:04:21.080> that<00:04:21.290> with<00:04:21.710> the<00:04:22.610> be<00:04:22.760> the

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
first it could do that with the be the

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.700 
first it could do that with the be the
ref<00:04:23.120> move<00:04:23.360> but<00:04:23.630> it<00:04:23.780> is<00:04:23.930> certainly<00:04:24.320> something

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
ref move but it is certainly something

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.120 
ref move but it is certainly something
that<00:04:25.210> I<00:04:26.210> have<00:04:27.170> actually<00:04:27.530> heard<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:27.830> lot<00:04:28.100> of

that I have actually heard a lot of
people<00:04:28.400> talking<00:04:28.730> about<00:04:29.030> they<00:04:29.840> want<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:30.830> on

fifa 13 and i think it's the way forward

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
virtual pro system could work with a ref

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.660 
virtual pro system could work with a ref
now<00:05:39.230> you<00:05:39.290> get<00:05:39.470> if<00:05:39.620> and<00:05:39.770> hairstyles<00:05:40.520> and
