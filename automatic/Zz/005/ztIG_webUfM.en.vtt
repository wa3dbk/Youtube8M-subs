cutting the blade can turn to face any
direction<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:52.109> can<00:00:52.289> see<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> turnout

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829

side<00:00:53.160> down<00:00:53.370> there's<00:00:53.609> a<00:00:53.670> little<00:00:54.329> allen<00:00:54.629> key

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809

side down there's a little allen key
there<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.500> undo<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.800> very<00:00:56.129> slightly

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
there you just undo that very slightly

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:58.189 
there you just undo that very slightly
lift<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:57.359> you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.570> turn<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.989> blade

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
lift and then you can turn that blade

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.689 
lift and then you can turn that blade

to be a lot lot more awkward the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.359 
to be a lot lot more awkward the
all-rounder<00:01:12.869> makes<00:01:13.050> it<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.259> lot<00:01:13.590> lot<00:01:13.800> easier<00:01:14.220> to

I've taken the the piece of laminate

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.800 
I've taken the the piece of laminate
floor<00:01:17.130> I've<00:01:17.610> turned<00:01:17.910> it<00:01:18.060> upside<00:01:18.390> down<00:01:18.630> because

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
floor I've turned it upside down because

laminate floor because this is a flush
cutter<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:23.039> will<00:01:23.220> sit<00:01:23.550> just<00:01:23.580> flat<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.569> top<00:01:24.630> of

the<00:01:25.229> lemon<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.590> life<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.039> it<00:01:26.250> will<00:01:26.670> cut<00:01:26.849> into

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
the lemon of life so it will cut into

the timber if there are any marks which
will<00:01:29.550> only<00:01:29.670> be<00:01:29.880> very<00:01:30.119> very<00:01:30.390> minor<00:01:30.690> they'll<00:01:31.080> be

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
will only be very very minor they'll be

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.020 
will only be very very minor they'll be
on<00:01:31.289> the<00:01:31.410> bottom<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.950> laminate<00:01:32.310> once<00:01:32.849> you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
on the bottom of the laminate once you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.279 
on the bottom of the laminate once you
flip<00:01:33.239> it<00:01:33.330> over<00:01:33.450> obviously<00:01:33.750> you've<00:01:34.080> got<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
flip it over obviously you've got the

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:42.770 
flip it over obviously you've got the
shiny<00:01:34.500> side<00:01:34.739> up<00:01:35.009> doesn't<00:01:35.759> matter

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.010 

and<00:01:43.470> then<00:01:44.150> you<00:01:45.150> can<00:01:45.300> turn<00:01:45.480> their<00:01:45.660> laminate

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
and then you can turn their laminate

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.350 
and then you can turn their laminate
back<00:01:46.200> over<00:01:46.650> so<00:01:46.920> we've<00:01:47.040> got<00:01:47.220> outside<00:01:47.580> and<00:01:48.210> then

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
back over so we've got outside and then

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.730 
back over so we've got outside and then
we<00:01:48.420> can<00:01:48.570> actually<00:01:48.720> fit<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.170> laminate<00:01:49.560> which

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
we can actually fit the laminate which

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.820 
we can actually fit the laminate which
you<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:50.040> see<00:01:50.220> there<00:01:50.780> also<00:01:51.780> as<00:01:52.080> well<00:01:52.260> you<00:01:52.620> get

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
you can see there also as well you get

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.140 
you can see there also as well you get
this<00:01:52.979> which<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.400> what<00:01:53.550> they<00:01:53.610> call<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> plunge

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
this which is what they call the plunge

this which is what they call the plunge
cut<00:01:54.420> blade<00:01:55.040> semi-flexible<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.760> it<00:01:56.820> does<00:01:57.030> move

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
cut blade semi-flexible so it does move

cut blade semi-flexible so it does move
for<00:01:58.200> cutting<00:01:58.500> wood<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.460> can<00:01:59.610> maybe

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
for cutting wood and that you can maybe

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.020 
for cutting wood and that you can maybe
plunge<00:02:00.119> out<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.630> worktop<00:02:01.200> likely<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.820> taxi<00:02:02.820> on

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
plunge out a worktop likely to taxi on

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.359 
plunge out a worktop likely to taxi on
two<00:02:03.330> runs<00:02:03.600> or<00:02:03.780> things<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.080> that

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.220 

when<00:02:11.060> you<00:02:11.150> bowl<00:02:11.300> with<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.540> like<00:02:11.720> that<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.080> can

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
when you bowl with it like that you can

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.540 
when you bowl with it like that you can
actually<00:02:12.349> then<00:02:12.590> double<00:02:12.920> up<00:02:13.010> use<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.400> as<00:02:13.520> a

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
actually then double up use it as a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.949 
actually then double up use it as a
standard<00:02:14.120> because<00:02:14.480> you've<00:02:14.630> got<00:02:14.810> that

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
standard because you've got that

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.809 
standard because you've got that
oscillation<00:02:15.440> that<00:02:15.650> between<00:02:16.099> 2<00:02:16.220> &amp;<00:02:16.370> 3<00:02:16.400> degree

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
oscillation that between 2 &amp; 3 degree

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.750 
oscillation that between 2 &amp; 3 degree
oscillation<00:02:17.569> no<00:02:18.170> matter<00:02:18.349> what<00:02:18.620> area<00:02:19.010> or<00:02:19.430> what

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
oscillation no matter what area or what

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.000 
oscillation no matter what area or what
way<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.090> twist<00:02:20.569> it<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.140> always<00:02:21.349> kind<00:02:21.739> you

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
way you twist it it's always kind you

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.979 
way you twist it it's always kind you
can<00:02:22.190> even<00:02:22.430> count<00:02:22.640> on<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.940> very<00:02:23.239> very<00:02:23.540> slightly

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
can even count on the very very slightly

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.990 
can even count on the very very slightly
curved<00:02:24.349> edges<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.340> doesn't<00:02:25.580> make<00:02:25.700> any

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
curved edges so it doesn't make any

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.699 
curved edges so it doesn't make any
difference<00:02:26.120> what<00:02:27.080> direction<00:02:27.440> you're<00:02:27.680> going

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
difference what direction you're going

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.309 
difference what direction you're going
in<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.459> can<00:02:28.489> use<00:02:28.819> it<00:02:28.970> as<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.090> saw<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:29.840> can<00:02:30.019> sit

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
in you can use it as a saw you can sit

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.440 
in you can use it as a saw you can sit
it<00:02:30.410> flat<00:02:30.739> so<00:02:31.010> just<00:02:31.370> think<00:02:31.610> cuts<00:02:31.849> into<00:02:32.209> it<00:02:32.269> on

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
it flat so just think cuts into it on

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.010 
it flat so just think cuts into it on
its<00:02:32.599> own<00:02:32.750> really<00:02:33.500> versatile
