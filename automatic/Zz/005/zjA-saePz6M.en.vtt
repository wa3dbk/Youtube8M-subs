00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
going to be super particular about it if

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.910 
going to be super particular about it if
I<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.909> more<00:01:18.119> time<00:01:18.330> I'm<00:01:18.780> off<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.290> much<00:01:19.710> more

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
I have more time I'm off and much more

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.710 
I have more time I'm off and much more
careful<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.180> still<00:01:21.360> going<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.630> work

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
careful but this is still going to work

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.830 
careful but this is still going to work
so<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:23.009> don't<00:01:23.159> have<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:23.909> absolutely

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
so you don't have to be absolutely

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.960 
so you don't have to be absolutely
spectacular<00:01:25.830> really<00:01:26.159> perfect<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:26.820> your

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
lines

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.870 
lines
I<00:01:27.540> generally<00:01:28.500> follow<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> lines<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
I generally follow the lines in the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.640 
I generally follow the lines in the
stamp<00:01:30.180> because<00:01:30.540> that's<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.110> direction<00:01:31.350> that

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
stamp because that's the direction that

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.920 
stamp because that's the direction that
the<00:01:31.770> hair<00:01:31.979> goes<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.670> artist<00:01:32.970> created<00:01:33.150> in

the hair goes that the artist created in
the<00:01:34.140> stamp<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.090> now<00:01:36.090> I'm<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.390> add<00:01:36.540> my

hair<00:01:49.619> lines<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.820> look<00:01:51.030> at<00:01:51.149> anybody's<00:01:51.570> hair

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810

hair lines if you look at anybody's hair
they<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.860> innumerable<00:01:53.430> little<00:01:53.820> teeny

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
they just have innumerable little teeny

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.219 
they just have innumerable little teeny
tiny<00:01:54.090> pieces<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.229> all<00:01:55.439> different<00:01:55.890> colors<00:01:56.219> so

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
tiny pieces of all different colors so

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.010 
tiny pieces of all different colors so
coloring<00:01:58.229> them<00:01:58.350> all<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.860> one<00:01:59.100> solid<00:01:59.490> section

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
coloring them all in one solid section

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.230 
coloring them all in one solid section
doesn't<00:02:01.020> usually<00:02:01.490> portray<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.670> realism<00:02:03.149> of

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
doesn't usually portray the realism of

doesn't usually portray the realism of
what<00:02:03.450> real<00:02:03.719> hair<00:02:03.960> actually<00:02:04.170> looks<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:04.829> so

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
what real hair actually looks like so

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.119 
what real hair actually looks like so
I'm<00:02:06.149> coloring<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.229> bottom<00:02:07.680> side<00:02:07.860> and

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
I'm coloring on this the bottom side and

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.469 
I'm coloring on this the bottom side and
then<00:02:08.220> around<00:02:08.429> where<00:02:08.700> those<00:02:08.819> glasses<00:02:09.119> are

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
then around where those glasses are

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.510 
then around where those glasses are
fairly<00:02:10.470> dark<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.009> media

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
fairly dark and that media

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.670 
fairly dark and that media
Tonie<00:02:11.880> ish<00:02:12.060> area<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.720> then<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.080> added<00:02:13.440> just<00:02:13.470> a

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
Tonie ish area and then I added just a

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.170 
Tonie ish area and then I added just a
little<00:02:13.710> tiny<00:02:14.100> bit<00:02:14.400> into<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.970> glasses

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
little tiny bit into the glasses

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.970 
little tiny bit into the glasses
themselves<00:02:15.510> when<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.560> look<00:02:16.680> at<00:02:16.770> something

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
themselves when you look at something

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.920 
themselves when you look at something
transparent<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:18.360> things<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.720> are<00:02:18.810> behind

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
transparent the things that are behind

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.400 
transparent the things that are behind
it<00:02:19.410> often<00:02:19.830> are<00:02:20.040> lighter<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.360> little<00:02:21.810> tiny

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
it often are lighter so that little tiny

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.530 
it often are lighter so that little tiny
bit<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.860> medium<00:02:23.160> tone<00:02:23.370> just<00:02:23.640> just<00:02:24.390> adds

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
bit of the medium tone just just adds

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.570 
bit of the medium tone just just adds
that<00:02:24.660> depth<00:02:25.050> in<00:02:25.230> there

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
that depth in there

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.820 
that depth in there
now<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.640> e97<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.690> lightest<00:02:27.990> color<00:02:28.230> I'm<00:02:28.560> just

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
now the e97 the lightest color I'm just

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.650 
now the e97 the lightest color I'm just
coloring<00:02:29.160> over<00:02:29.580> top<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:30.000> whole<00:02:30.150> thing<00:02:30.420> if

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
coloring over top of the whole thing if

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.750 
coloring over top of the whole thing if
you<00:02:31.020> want<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.440> color<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.740> stay<00:02:32.010> lighter<00:02:32.310> then

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
you want the color to stay lighter then

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.030 
you want the color to stay lighter then
obviously<00:02:32.970> put<00:02:33.570> less<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.440> on<00:02:34.620> there<00:02:34.860> and

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
obviously put less of this on there and

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.030 
obviously put less of this on there and
don't<00:02:35.610> go<00:02:35.730> over<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.060> as<00:02:36.300> many<00:02:36.540> times<00:02:37.040> I'm

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
don't go over it as many times I'm

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.940 
don't go over it as many times I'm
taking<00:02:38.460> my<00:02:38.550> e29<00:02:38.970> now<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.720> just<00:02:39.870> adding<00:02:40.530> in<00:02:40.740> a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
taking my e29 now and just adding in a

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.100 
taking my e29 now and just adding in a
little<00:02:41.010> bit<00:02:41.310> more<00:02:41.520> darkness<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.390> these<00:02:42.990> are

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
little bit more darkness and these are

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.510 
little bit more darkness and these are
gonna<00:02:43.200> be<00:02:43.350> strokes<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.770> I'm<00:02:43.920> not<00:02:44.130> going<00:02:44.430> to

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
gonna be strokes that I'm not going to

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.240 
gonna be strokes that I'm not going to
blend<00:02:44.820> out<00:02:45.000> particularly<00:02:45.480> so<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.320> want<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.100> just

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
blend out particularly so I want to just

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.250 
blend out particularly so I want to just
add<00:02:47.460> a<00:02:47.490> little<00:02:47.670> bit<00:02:48.000> more<00:02:48.210> oomph<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.900> some<00:02:49.170> of

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
add a little bit more oomph to some of

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260 
add a little bit more oomph to some of
those<00:02:49.320> areas<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.800> need<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.370> be<00:02:50.400> dark<00:02:50.670> sorry

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
those areas that need to be dark sorry

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.690 
those areas that need to be dark sorry
at<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.630> angle<00:02:51.980> you're<00:02:52.980> sort<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.310> seeing<00:02:53.490> some

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
at this angle you're sort of seeing some

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.850 
at this angle you're sort of seeing some
of<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.850> reflection<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.540> moisture<00:02:54.990> so<00:02:55.650> it

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
of the reflection of the moisture so it

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.400 
of the reflection of the moisture so it
does<00:02:56.160> actually<00:02:56.550> look<00:02:56.940> much<00:02:57.270> darker<00:02:57.750> from

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
does actually look much darker from

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.400 
does actually look much darker from
above<00:02:58.770> but<00:02:59.640> yeah<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.870> I'm<00:03:01.140> doing<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.380> same

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
above but yeah and I'm doing the same

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.140 
above but yeah and I'm doing the same
thing<00:03:01.710> now<00:03:01.740> with<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.220> medium<00:03:02.610> tone<00:03:02.820> just

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
thing now with the medium tone just

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.210 
thing now with the medium tone just
adding<00:03:03.540> more<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:03.960> color<00:03:04.500> in<00:03:04.710> there<00:03:04.860> now

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
adding more of that color in there now

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.250 
adding more of that color in there now
let's<00:03:05.610> look<00:03:05.700> at<00:03:05.820> my<00:03:05.940> reference<00:03:06.120> sheet<00:03:06.630> for<00:03:07.230> a

let's look at my reference sheet for a

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.870 
let's look at my reference sheet for a
whole<00:03:07.500> bunch<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.800> different<00:03:08.010> hair<00:03:08.610> color

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
whole bunch of different hair color

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.480 
whole bunch of different hair color

it<00:03:14.310> out<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.460> lot<00:03:14.670> more<00:03:14.850> closely<00:03:15.120> but<00:03:15.960> let's<00:03:16.110> look

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
it out a lot more closely but let's look

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.550 
it out a lot more closely but let's look
at<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.620> top<00:03:16.830> row<00:03:17.100> first<00:03:17.490> of<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.930> blonde<00:03:19.260> hair

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
at the top row first of the blonde hair

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.060 
at the top row first of the blonde hair
on<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.460> left<00:03:20.700> this<00:03:21.180> first<00:03:21.480> one<00:03:21.690> has<00:03:22.440> Y<00:03:22.740> zero

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
on the left this first one has Y zero

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.740 
on the left this first one has Y zero
zero<00:03:23.370> which<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.550> a<00:03:23.610> very<00:03:23.790> bright<00:03:24.060> yellow<00:03:24.510> as

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
zero which is a very bright yellow as

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.230 
zero which is a very bright yellow as
the<00:03:24.830> lightest<00:03:25.830> tone<00:03:26.070> so<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.700> get<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:26.940> really

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
the lightest tone so you get a really

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.110 
the lightest tone so you get a really
bright<00:03:27.630> color<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:28.560> darkest<00:03:29.070> tone<00:03:29.280> here<00:03:29.520> is<00:03:29.670> yr

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
bright color the darkest tone here is yr

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.480 
bright color the darkest tone here is yr
one<00:03:30.570> two<00:03:30.840> which<00:03:31.110> is<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.290> bright<00:03:31.860> orange<00:03:32.250> as<00:03:32.460> well

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
one two which is a bright orange as well

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.000 
one two which is a bright orange as well
this<00:03:33.270> is<00:03:33.450> more<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.900> cartoony<00:03:34.560> look<00:03:34.770> if
