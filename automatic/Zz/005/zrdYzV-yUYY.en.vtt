touch<00:00:52.660> monitor<00:00:53.469> from<00:00:53.649> LG<00:00:54.370> so<00:00:54.670> let's<00:00:54.910> go<00:00:55.030> ahead

touch monitor from LG so let's go ahead
and<00:00:55.269> unbox<00:00:55.510> this<00:00:55.719> to<00:00:55.870> see<00:00:55.989> what<00:00:56.109> we<00:00:56.199> have<00:00:56.320> here

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
and unbox this to see what we have here

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.319 
and unbox this to see what we have here
you<00:00:57.039> kind<00:00:57.190> of<00:00:57.280> open<00:00:57.519> that<00:00:57.550> up<00:00:57.789> so<00:00:58.059> do<00:00:58.269> you

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
you kind of open that up so do you

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.090 
you kind of open that up so do you
forgive<00:00:58.480> us<00:00:58.750> that<00:00:59.170> we<00:00:59.379> didn't<00:00:59.649> cut<00:00:59.890> it<00:00:59.920> in

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
forgive us that we didn't cut it in

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.540 
forgive us that we didn't cut it in
front<00:01:00.339> of<00:01:00.519> you<00:01:00.640> but<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:02.829> figured<00:01:03.250> this<00:01:03.399> would

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
front of you but we figured this would

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.350 
front of you but we figured this would
be<00:01:03.609> an<00:01:03.760> easier<00:01:04.120> process<00:01:04.449> do<00:01:04.900> it<00:01:05.019> this<00:01:05.140> way<00:01:06.360> take

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
be an easier process do it this way take

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.070 
be an easier process do it this way take
that<00:01:07.540> out<00:01:07.720> so<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:10.060> monitor<00:01:10.420> actually<00:01:10.600> pulls

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
that out so the monitor actually pulls

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.240 
that out so the monitor actually pulls
out<00:01:11.260> all<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.470> way<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:13.980> looks<00:01:14.980> like<00:01:15.100> that's

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
out all the way and looks like that's

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.460 
out all the way and looks like that's
pretty<00:01:15.340> much<00:01:15.520> it<00:01:15.700> in<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:15.880> box<00:01:16.120> so<00:01:16.990> we<00:01:17.110> drop

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
pretty much it in the box so we drop

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.870 
pretty much it in the box so we drop
that<00:01:17.500> down<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:18.600> second<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:19.870> then<00:01:20.860> take<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.640> box

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
that down a second and then take the box

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.100 
that down a second and then take the box
to<00:01:22.180> what's<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.780> side<00:01:23.020> here<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:25.630> what<00:01:25.750> else<00:01:25.960> we

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
to what's the side here see what else we

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.010 
to what's the side here see what else we
have<00:01:26.140> in<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.590> box<00:01:26.770> I<00:01:27.310> know<00:01:28.210> it's<00:01:28.450> off<00:01:28.600> camera

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
have in the box I know it's off camera

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.440 
have in the box I know it's off camera
so<00:01:29.140> you<00:01:29.230> guys<00:01:29.350> can't<00:01:29.680> really<00:01:29.980> see<00:01:30.250> but<00:01:31.000> we<00:01:31.300> do

got touch sensitive buttons for power
input<00:02:10.899> auto<00:02:11.140> mode

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.270

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
that is SES and menu and of course again

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.920 
that is SES and menu and of course again
this<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.580> full<00:02:18.820> touchscreen<00:02:19.060> monitor<00:02:19.690> for

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
this is a full touchscreen monitor for

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.690 
this is a full touchscreen monitor for
10<00:02:20.200> finger<00:02:20.530> touch<00:02:20.740> so<00:02:20.980> basically<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.520> can

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
10 finger touch so basically you can

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.060 
10 finger touch so basically you can
swipe<00:02:22.450> around<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.900> screen<00:02:23.170> Windows<00:02:23.590> 8<00:02:23.890> and

swipe around the screen Windows 8 and
all<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.340> fun<00:02:24.520> stuff<00:02:24.550> now<00:02:25.030> there<00:02:25.780> were<00:02:25.870> two

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
all that fun stuff now there were two

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.160 
all that fun stuff now there were two
models<00:02:26.500> at<00:02:26.620> e3<00:02:27.090> which<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.630> can<00:02:28.810> check<00:02:29.020> out<00:02:29.140> our

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
models at e3 which you can check out our

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.500 
models at e3 which you can check out our
video<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.800> see<00:02:30.100> what<00:02:30.640> we<00:02:30.760> saw<00:02:30.910> with<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.090> hands-on

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
video to see what we saw with a hands-on

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.290 
video to see what we saw with a hands-on
e3<00:02:32.020> but<00:02:32.470> this<00:02:32.650> model<00:02:33.040> only<00:02:33.220> tilts<00:02:33.730> back<00:02:34.060> and

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
e3 but this model only tilts back and

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.910 
e3 but this model only tilts back and
forth<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.840> can<00:02:34.990> see<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.320> see<00:02:35.350> tilt<00:02:35.710> down

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
forth so you can see can see tilt down

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.040 
forth so you can see can see tilt down
on<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.280> way<00:02:36.460> you<00:02:37.150> can<00:02:37.300> tilt<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.600> up<00:02:37.780> but<00:02:37.960> it

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
on the way you can tilt it up but it

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.600 
on the way you can tilt it up but it
doesn't<00:02:38.200> lay<00:02:38.470> down<00:02:38.710> flat<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.160> that's<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.400> main

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
doesn't lay down flat so that's the main

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.490 
doesn't lay down flat so that's the main
differences<00:02:40.150> with<00:02:40.300> this<00:02:40.390> model<00:02:40.810> here<00:02:41.020> now<00:02:41.440> the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
differences with this model here now the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.930 
differences with this model here now the
other<00:02:41.710> thing<00:02:41.950> too<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.250> if<00:02:42.520> we<00:02:42.580> look<00:02:42.760> at<00:02:42.850> the

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
other thing too is if we look at the

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.430 
other thing too is if we look at the
ports<00:02:43.300> of<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.540> model<00:02:43.870> if<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:43.990> guys<00:02:44.140> can<00:02:44.320> see

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
ports of the model if you guys can see

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.650 
ports of the model if you guys can see
that<00:02:44.620> clearly<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.220> can<00:02:45.790> just<00:02:46.000> drop<00:02:46.240> this<00:02:46.450> down

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
that clearly I can just drop this down

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.720 
that clearly I can just drop this down
for<00:02:46.990> us<00:02:47.110> so<00:02:47.350> we<00:02:47.470> can<00:02:47.620> actually<00:02:47.800> get<00:02:48.490> good

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
for us so we can actually get good

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.130 
for us so we can actually get good
access<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.240> ports<00:02:49.570> if<00:02:49.690> you've<00:02:49.780> got<00:02:49.930> two

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
access to the ports if you've got two

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.940 
access to the ports if you've got two
HDMI<00:02:50.590> one<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.370> two<00:02:51.550> we've<00:02:52.180> got<00:02:52.260> low<00:02:53.260> for<00:02:53.470> power

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
HDMI one and two we've got low for power

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.760 
HDMI one and two we've got low for power
you<00:02:54.280> got<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.459> d-sub<00:02:55.380> you've<00:02:56.380> got<00:02:56.560> your

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
you got a d-sub you've got your

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.820 
you got a d-sub you've got your
headphone<00:02:57.100> jack<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.580> you<00:02:57.640> buy<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.820> USB<00:02:58.830> up

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
headphone jack and you buy the USB up

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.490 
headphone jack and you buy the USB up
there<00:03:00.550> so<00:03:00.850> that's<00:03:01.540> all<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.870> have<00:03:02.020> four<00:03:02.170> ports

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
there so that's all you have four ports

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.400 
there so that's all you have four ports
with<00:03:02.890> this<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.459> are<00:03:03.700> no<00:03:03.970> speakers<00:03:04.600> on<00:03:05.080> there

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
with this the are no speakers on there

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.560 
with this the are no speakers on there
it's<00:03:05.950> got<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.190> lock<00:03:06.910> switch<00:03:07.060> there<00:03:07.360> for<00:03:07.510> the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
it's got a lock switch there for the

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.110 
it's got a lock switch there for the
base<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:08.140> that's<00:03:08.740> about<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.250> but<00:03:09.400> it's<00:03:09.910> very

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
base and that's about it but it's very

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.480 
base and that's about it but it's very
nice<00:03:10.300> in<00:03:10.720> terms<00:03:10.780> of<00:03:11.110> weights<00:03:11.440> this<00:03:11.709> is<00:03:11.830> not<00:03:12.040> too

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
nice in terms of weights this is not too

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.150 
nice in terms of weights this is not too
heavy<00:03:12.850> doesn't<00:03:13.540> feel<00:03:13.810> heavy<00:03:14.020> or<00:03:14.170> strange<00:03:14.680> to

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
heavy doesn't feel heavy or strange to

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.040 
heavy doesn't feel heavy or strange to
you<00:03:15.370> but<00:03:15.910> this<00:03:16.150> is<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.920> IPS<00:03:17.920> monitor<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:19.720> is<00:03:19.900> an

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
you but this is a IPS monitor this is an

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.770 
you but this is a IPS monitor this is an
IPS<00:03:20.880> monitor<00:03:21.880> with<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.209> refresh<00:03:22.540> rate<00:03:22.690> of

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
IPS monitor with the refresh rate of

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.070 
IPS monitor with the refresh rate of
five<00:03:23.220> milliseconds<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:24.790> 1080p<00:03:25.450> monitor<00:03:25.870> so

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
five milliseconds this 1080p monitor so

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.630 
five milliseconds this 1080p monitor so
that's<00:03:26.230> your<00:03:26.350> resolution<00:03:26.950> you<00:03:27.070> will<00:03:27.190> get<00:03:27.400> with

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
that's your resolution you will get with

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.520 
that's your resolution you will get with
this<00:03:27.820> so<00:03:28.360> what<00:03:28.600> we're<00:03:28.720> going<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:28.989> do<00:03:29.140> spend

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
this so what we're going to do spend

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.370 
this so what we're going to do spend
some<00:03:29.739> time<00:03:30.150> see<00:03:31.150> how<00:03:31.330> well<00:03:31.540> this<00:03:31.690> handles<00:03:32.140> and

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
some time see how well this handles and

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.530 
some time see how well this handles and
I<00:03:32.410> would<00:03:33.220> definitely<00:03:33.700> tell<00:03:34.150> you<00:03:34.209> what<00:03:34.420> we

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
I would definitely tell you what we

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.479 
I would definitely tell you what we
think<00:03:34.570> if<00:03:34.930> there's<00:03:35.110> any<00:03:35.260> sluggishness<00:03:35.800> if<00:03:36.310> it

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
think if there's any sluggishness if it

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.360 
think if there's any sluggishness if it
was<00:03:36.610> slow<00:03:37.000> if<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:38.050> response<00:03:38.620> time<00:03:38.920> wasn't

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
was slow if the response time wasn't

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.070 
was slow if the response time wasn't
good<00:03:39.519> enough<00:03:39.550> especially<00:03:40.330> playing<00:03:40.840> some

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
good enough especially playing some

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.960 
good enough especially playing some
touch<00:03:41.470> sensitive<00:03:41.860> game<00:03:42.100> say<00:03:42.370> Angry<00:03:42.640> Birds<00:03:42.820> and

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
touch sensitive game say Angry Birds and

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.970 
touch sensitive game say Angry Birds and
things<00:03:43.180> like<00:03:43.300> that<00:03:43.360> on<00:03:43.690> here<00:03:44.080> but<00:03:44.560> overall<00:03:44.800> I

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
things like that on here but overall I

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.830 
things like that on here but overall I
think<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:46.060> know<00:03:46.180> will<00:03:46.360> give<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:46.630> a<00:03:46.660> good<00:03:46.810> idea

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
think you know will give you a good idea

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.630 
think you know will give you a good idea
you<00:03:47.200> can<00:03:47.290> see<00:03:47.500> of<00:03:47.590> course<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:47.950> borders<00:03:48.400> on

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
you can see of course the borders on

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.400 
you can see of course the borders on
there<00:03:49.239> you<00:03:49.300> can<00:03:49.390> see<00:03:49.510> how<00:03:49.600> thick<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.989> bezel<00:03:50.290> is

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
there you can see how thick the bezel is

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.050

also closing the applications from the
very<00:03:57.790> top<00:03:58.120> so<00:03:58.390> that's<00:03:58.989> something<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.680> take

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
very top so that's something to take

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
note but so far it looks pretty good I

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.120 
note but so far it looks pretty good I
like<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.989> look<00:04:02.170> I<00:04:02.260> like<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.440> white<00:04:02.709> finish

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
like the look I like the white finish

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.850 
like the look I like the white finish
around<00:04:03.910> so<00:04:04.120> you've<00:04:04.239> got<00:04:04.420> this<00:04:04.630> white<00:04:05.350> trimming

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
around so you've got this white trimming

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.400 
around so you've got this white trimming
around<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.640> monitor<00:04:07.450> with<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.780> black<00:04:08.110> bezel

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
around the monitor with the black bezel

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.009 
around the monitor with the black bezel
and<00:04:08.739> a<00:04:09.580> white<00:04:10.000> base<00:04:10.269> so<00:04:10.570> that<00:04:10.600> something's

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
and a white base so that something's

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.600
