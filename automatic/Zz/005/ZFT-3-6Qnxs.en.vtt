00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.910 
tons of times to create have it just
like<00:02:20.579> when<00:02:21.000> bad<00:02:21.329> habits<00:02:21.720> get<00:02:22.140> created<00:02:22.560> because

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
like when bad habits get created because

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.369 
like when bad habits get created because
for<00:02:23.549> example<00:02:23.849> some<00:02:24.000> kids<00:02:24.269> that<00:02:24.510> learn<00:02:25.170> the

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
for example some kids that learn the

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.080 
for example some kids that learn the
Giants<00:02:25.709> on<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:25.920> strap<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.400> just<00:02:26.610> they<00:02:27.060> just

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
Giants on the strap and just they just

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.880 
Giants on the strap and just they just
learned<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.599> go<00:02:27.750> around<00:02:27.989> because<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.409> their<00:02:28.560> of

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
learned to go around because of their of

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.250 
learned to go around because of their of
that<00:02:29.069> momentum<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.819> swing<00:02:30.090> rather<00:02:30.720> than

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
that momentum of the swing rather than

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.319 
that momentum of the swing rather than
by<00:02:32.420> their<00:02:33.420> technique<00:02:33.870> okay<00:02:34.590> we<00:02:35.069> want<00:02:35.430> bars<00:02:36.090> is

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
by their technique okay we want bars is

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.449 
by their technique okay we want bars is
the<00:02:36.510> only<00:02:36.780> event<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.439> you<00:02:37.590> cannot<00:02:38.010> get<00:02:38.310> away

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
the only event that you cannot get away

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.360 
the only event that you cannot get away
just<00:02:39.299> with<00:02:39.659> pure<00:02:39.959> strength<00:02:40.349> you<00:02:40.650> need<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.220> be

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
just with pure strength you need to be

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.149 
just with pure strength you need to be
technical<00:02:42.030> okay<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.409> feel<00:02:43.709> this<00:02:43.920> is

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
technical okay so and I feel this is

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.599 
technical okay so and I feel this is
this<00:02:45.000> really<00:02:45.510> really<00:02:45.659> helps<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:46.319> this<00:02:46.889> is<00:02:47.250> the

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
this really really helps so this is the

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.250 
this really really helps so this is the
second<00:02:48.530> this<00:02:49.530> would<00:02:49.739> be<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.190> second<00:02:51.090> step

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
second this would be the second step

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.690 
second this would be the second step
okay<00:02:53.780> once<00:02:54.780> they<00:02:54.930> learn<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.650> tap<00:02:55.889> correctly

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
okay once they learn to tap correctly

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.280 
okay once they learn to tap correctly
actually<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.359> would<00:02:57.480> be<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.750> first<00:02:57.959> step

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
actually that would be the first step

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.500 
actually that would be the first step
then<00:02:58.889> the<00:02:59.069> second<00:02:59.459> step<00:02:59.639> would<00:02:59.790> be<00:02:59.849> to<00:02:59.970> start

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
then the second step would be to start

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.179 
then the second step would be to start
for<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.379> old<00:03:01.560> would<00:03:02.370> be<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:02.700> one<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.209> to

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189 
for the old would be this one just to

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.750 
for the old would be this one just to
have<00:03:05.189> them<00:03:05.400> go<00:03:05.609> arch<00:03:06.060> tap<00:03:06.540> hollow<00:03:07.530> arch<00:03:08.250> tap

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
have them go arch tap hollow arch tap

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.589 
have them go arch tap hollow arch tap
around<00:03:09.920> did<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.220> terms<00:03:11.609> of<00:03:11.909> terms<00:03:12.180> don't<00:03:12.389> go

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
around did that terms of terms don't go

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.110 
around did that terms of terms don't go
to<00:03:12.659> a<00:03:12.810> handstand<00:03:13.230> heels<00:03:13.980> let's<00:03:14.400> see<00:03:14.639> one<00:03:14.909> that

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
to a handstand heels let's see one that

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.379 
to a handstand heels let's see one that
just<00:03:15.389> goes<00:03:15.750> around<00:03:16.849> there<00:03:17.849> we<00:03:17.970> go

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
just goes around there we go

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.349 
just goes around there we go
right<00:03:18.690> there<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.319> that<00:03:19.530> tons<00:03:19.949> of<00:03:20.220> times<00:03:20.849> tons

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.360 
telling clinics and stop and I
understood<00:04:13.049> how<00:04:13.169> important<00:04:13.799> was<00:04:14.340> that

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
understood how important was that

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.920 
understood how important was that
information<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.510> we're<00:04:15.659> giving<00:04:15.989> me<00:04:16.109> so<00:04:16.500> I

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
information that we're giving me so I

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.039 
information that we're giving me so I
became<00:04:18.930> very<00:04:19.139> disciplined<00:04:19.650> I<00:04:20.329> believe<00:04:21.329> a<00:04:21.359> lot

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
became very disciplined I believe a lot

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.290 
became very disciplined I believe a lot
in<00:04:22.079> this<00:04:22.349> drill<00:04:23.039> so<00:04:23.310> if<00:04:23.729> you<00:04:23.849> can<00:04:24.029> see<00:04:24.150> that

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
in this drill so if you can see that

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.800 
in this drill so if you can see that
shape<00:04:24.659> right<00:04:24.960> there<00:04:24.990> we<00:04:25.440> want<00:04:25.650> to

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
shape right there we want to

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.900 
shape right there we want to
that<00:04:26.050> shape<00:04:26.320> maybe<00:04:26.740> he<00:04:27.460> should<00:04:27.700> be<00:04:27.820> a<00:04:27.850> little

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
that shape maybe he should be a little

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.300 
that shape maybe he should be a little
bit<00:04:28.270> flatter<00:04:28.600> than<00:04:28.930> okay<00:04:29.860> so<00:04:29.919> this<00:04:30.160> is

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
bit flatter than okay so this is

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.940 
bit flatter than okay so this is
actually<00:04:30.850> step<00:04:31.330> number<00:04:31.480> two<00:04:31.870> we<00:04:32.139> first<00:04:32.770> said

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
actually step number two we first said

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.860 
actually step number two we first said
about<00:04:33.160> by<00:04:33.639> the<00:04:33.700> top<00:04:33.970> so<00:04:34.120> we're<00:04:34.389> gonna<00:04:34.570> see<00:04:34.720> it<00:04:34.810> a
