00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:14.189
 hello to all you often send me questions about the 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:16.849
 situation that you crossed today 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.839
 taleo 10 years old I am unemployed I was fired as a 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:21.640
 messy 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.359
 how am I going to explain it% and how we will have a positive image 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.439
 recruiter 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.179
 for the first point that you must have in mind that maybe it takes 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.829
 accept better live this situation 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.070
 is when you walk in the street a majority of people you 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.909
 cross has experienced a situation of failure of difficulties he may have understood the 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:42.470
 recruiter who is in front of you by his first points 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.850
 second point and you know a majority of French 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.330
 fears losing his job 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.380
 alain why do I tell you this points out just because what you 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.910
 live today finally concerning all of our fellow citizens 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.240
 third point there has never been so much dismissal for fault 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.540
 and conventional breakage right now 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.430
 finding perfectly hateful system they lie thales 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.000
 nevertheless it is a reality 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.960
 if you have been fired for misconduct 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.310
 if you accepted an order for a conventional break 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.189
 the guilt not find more we also know the reason 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.180
 deep 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.130
 all this to get to the bar at the fourth point you know you 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.000
 young professionals beugrÃ© is actually a good balance 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.930
 difficult first of all 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.229
 but less 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.229
 it's not about the reason for this failure that you have to test it this will be 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.030
 not who is who and who is expected 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.030
 you will rather make us understand that this failure 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.060
 and you traded us you set up a structure a 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.670
 organization that allowed us to bounce back from failure if you have any 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.310
 makes an opportunity not always very obvious 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.840
 % However 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.430
 rather than you 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.030
 focused on the nature of the termination of the breakup that you experienced 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.050
 lambasting not too much 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.910
 no you will rather organize your communication on everything you have 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.880
 set up to bounce 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.529
 Professional formation 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.549
 a skills assessment 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.529
 if you learned to speak a language you learned to use me as a doughty 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:19.989
 office automation you have increased networks you have animated% and little 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.989
 matter mid-May forums 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.180
 whatever action you have undertaken you have shown that you 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.019
 are to test dynamic and that especially you have set up a structure 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.259
 to bounce 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:34.819
 allawi keep this sentence in mind this is not up to the 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.259
 fall is not important 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:38.009
 it's the robot 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:40.799
 but that's all on it you're going to release recruitment interviews 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.329
 good luck to you and see you soon
