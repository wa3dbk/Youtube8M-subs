into<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.639> start<00:00:14.969> by<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.150> Badgers<00:00:15.570> was

what they needed and they got it against

what they needed and they got it against
the<00:00:18.359> team<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.720> Baylor<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.230> had<00:00:19.320> started<00:00:19.470> out

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
the team in Baylor that had started out

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.189 
the team in Baylor that had started out
so<00:00:19.890> strong<00:00:19.920> throughout<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.970> tournament<00:00:21.199> what

so strong throughout the tournament what
do<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.289> attribute<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.859> great<00:00:23.039> start<00:00:23.340> to

Wisconsin<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.300> think<00:00:24.720> they<00:00:25.350> went<00:00:25.470> inside<00:00:25.830> to

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
Wisconsin I think they went inside to

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.730 
Wisconsin I think they went inside to
Frank<00:00:26.250> Kaminsky<00:00:26.730> right<00:00:26.939> away<00:00:27.619> you<00:00:28.619> know<00:00:28.710> I

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
Frank Kaminsky right away you know I

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.550 
Frank Kaminsky right away you know I
think<00:00:29.449> everybody<00:00:30.449> figured<00:00:30.990> they<00:00:31.140> would<00:00:31.320> be

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
think everybody figured they would be

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.920 
think everybody figured they would be
able<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.800> solve<00:00:32.070> Baylor<00:00:32.880> zone<00:00:33.210> at<00:00:33.420> some<00:00:33.630> point

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
able to solve Baylor zone at some point

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.080 
able to solve Baylor zone at some point
but<00:00:34.710> maybe<00:00:35.100> they'll<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> probe<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.059> little

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
but maybe they'll have to probe a little

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.000 
but maybe they'll have to probe a little
bit<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.570> figure<00:00:36.750> out<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.020> way<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:37.320> they<00:00:37.770> found

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
bit and figure out a way but they found

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.310 
bit and figure out a way but they found
it<00:00:38.219> right<00:00:38.370> from<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> start<00:00:38.899> they<00:00:39.899> had<00:00:40.020> nothing

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
it right from the start they had nothing

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.920 
it right from the start they had nothing
but<00:00:40.469> inside<00:00:41.430> shots<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.969> open<00:00:42.239> jump<00:00:42.480> shots<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
but inside shots and open jump shots the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.350 
but inside shots and open jump shots the
entire<00:00:43.260> first<00:00:43.530> half<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:43.890> set<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> complete

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
entire first half just set the complete

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.569 
entire first half just set the complete
poem<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.870> game<00:00:46.050> was<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> what<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> 15-point

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
halftime lead could have been 25 points

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.930 
halftime lead could have been 25 points
if<00:00:49.530> they<00:00:49.649> have<00:00:49.770> made<00:00:49.890> their<00:00:50.070> wide<00:00:50.280> open<00:00:50.670> jump

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
if they have made their wide open jump

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.869 
if they have made their wide open jump
shots<00:00:51.260> that's<00:00:52.260> how<00:00:52.500> how<00:00:52.920> much<00:00:53.129> they<00:00:53.340> carved<00:00:53.760> up

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
shots that's how how much they carved up

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.610 
shots that's how how much they carved up
that<00:00:53.910> zone<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.690> as<00:00:56.090> whatever<00:00:57.320> Baylor<00:00:58.320> tried

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
that zone and as whatever Baylor tried

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.020 
that zone and as whatever Baylor tried
to<00:00:58.739> do<00:00:58.829> after<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.160> they<00:00:59.520> could<00:00:59.699> just<00:00:59.850> never

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
to do after that they could just never

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.660 
to do after that they could just never
get<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> Badgers<00:01:00.719> stopped<00:01:01.100> Jim<00:01:02.100> Frank

really<00:01:22.680> incredible<00:01:23.189> tonight<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.970> he's

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
really incredible tonight and he's

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.190 
really incredible tonight and he's
played<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> lot<00:01:24.930> lately

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
it just seems like he's a man on a

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.459 
it just seems like he's a man on a
mission<00:01:27.909> and<00:01:28.390> they<00:01:28.810> got<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.110> ball<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.380> him

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
mission and they got the ball to him

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:30.990 
mission and they got the ball to him
early<00:01:29.680> in<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.799> game<00:01:30.009> and<00:01:30.280> like<00:01:30.490> lake<00:01:30.670> holds<00:01:30.909> he

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
early in the game and like lake holds he

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.179 
early in the game and like lake holds he
said<00:01:31.210> really<00:01:31.810> set<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.110> tone<00:01:32.320> and<00:01:32.680> I<00:01:32.920> think

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
said really set the tone and I think

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.669 
said really set the tone and I think
Baylor<00:01:33.539> was<00:01:34.539> a<00:01:34.600> little<00:01:34.810> shocked<00:01:35.079> frankly<00:01:35.560> that

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
Baylor was a little shocked frankly that

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.020 
Baylor was a little shocked frankly that
that<00:01:35.979> they<00:01:36.100> were<00:01:36.159> going<00:01:36.429> right<00:01:36.640> at<00:01:36.850> their

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
that they were going right at their

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.749 
that they were going right at their
biggest<00:01:37.360> shot<00:01:37.570> blocker<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.170> and<00:01:39.100> not

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
biggest shot blocker and and not

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.550 
biggest shot blocker and and not
hesitating<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.600> using<00:01:40.810> shot<00:01:40.990> fakes<00:01:41.259> and<00:01:41.439> ball

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
hesitating and using shot fakes and ball

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.230 
hesitating and using shot fakes and ball
fakes<00:01:41.829> and<00:01:42.070> getting<00:01:42.640> Baylor<00:01:42.909> out<00:01:43.030> of<00:01:43.119> position

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
fakes and getting Baylor out of position

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.270 
fakes and getting Baylor out of position
and<00:01:43.569> off-balance<00:01:43.929> and<00:01:44.319> I<00:01:44.740> think<00:01:44.950> Baylor<00:01:45.100> was

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
and off-balance and I think Baylor was

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.959 
and off-balance and I think Baylor was
stunned<00:01:45.640> I<00:01:45.970> do<00:01:46.420> too<00:01:46.689> and<00:01:46.960> in<00:01:47.289> time<00:01:47.590> I<00:01:47.619> think<00:01:48.009> the

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
stunned I do too and in time I think the

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.630 
stunned I do too and in time I think the
unsung<00:01:49.630> heroes<00:01:49.630> in<00:01:50.259> this<00:01:50.380> are<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.069> badgers<00:01:51.429> on

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
unsung heroes in this are the badgers on

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.910 
unsung heroes in this are the badgers on
defense<00:01:52.200> twenty<00:01:53.200> percent<00:01:53.439> shooting<00:01:53.770> for

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
defense twenty percent shooting for

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.800 
defense twenty percent shooting for
Baylor<00:01:54.130> in<00:01:54.219> the<00:01:54.280> first<00:01:54.460> half<00:01:54.670> I<00:01:55.030> thought<00:01:55.539> said

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
Baylor in the first half I thought said

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.980 
Baylor in the first half I thought said
it<00:01:55.899> all<00:01:56.049> yeah<00:01:56.979> they<00:01:57.330> stopped<00:01:58.330> him<00:01:58.509> inside<00:01:58.869> and

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
it all yeah they stopped him inside and

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.449 
it all yeah they stopped him inside and
they<00:01:59.080> stopped<00:01:59.349> him<00:01:59.500> outside<00:01:59.649> I<00:01:59.920> think<00:02:00.280> was

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
they stopped him outside I think was

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:03.510

in<00:02:32.290> gym<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:32.950> thought<00:02:33.790> one<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.600> keys<00:02:34.840> was

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:35.139 
in gym I thought one of the keys was

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:36.809 
in gym I thought one of the keys was
that<00:02:35.350> every<00:02:35.530> time<00:02:35.680> baylor<00:02:36.010> seemed<00:02:36.549> to<00:02:36.639> have

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
that every time baylor seemed to have

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.580 
that every time baylor seemed to have
momentum<00:02:37.329> on<00:02:37.600> their<00:02:37.690> side<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:38.200> made<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.410> big

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
momentum on their side it made a big

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.410 
momentum on their side it made a big
basket<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.459> Badgers<00:02:39.760> had<00:02:39.910> an<00:02:40.000> answer<00:02:40.299> we

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
basket the Badgers had an answer we

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.610 
basket the Badgers had an answer we
haven't<00:02:40.630> seen<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:40.840> all<00:02:41.049> season<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.500> then

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
haven't seen that all season and then

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.490 
haven't seen that all season and then
from<00:02:42.190> 1<00:02:42.670> through<00:02:42.970> 8<00:02:43.239> in<00:02:43.569> that<00:02:43.720> rotation<00:02:44.290> I

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
from 1 through 8 in that rotation I

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.740 
from 1 through 8 in that rotation I
don't<00:02:45.220> think<00:02:45.400> there<00:02:45.549> was<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.730> bad<00:02:46.150> rotation<00:02:46.660> in

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.910 
don't think there was a bad rotation in
the<00:02:46.810> bunch<00:02:46.989> no<00:02:47.290> this<00:02:47.500> team<00:02:47.650> has<00:02:47.739> had<00:02:47.859> a

the bunch no this team has had a

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.559 
the bunch no this team has had a
tendency<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.400> maybe<00:02:48.609> get<00:02:48.790> up<00:02:48.910> on<00:02:49.060> teams<00:02:49.359> and

tendency to maybe get up on teams and

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.870 
tendency to maybe get up on teams and
let<00:02:49.660> them<00:02:49.750> back<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:49.959> games<00:02:50.579> tonight<00:02:51.579> it<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:51.819> do

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
that that the foot was on the pedal the

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.370 
that that the foot was on the pedal the
entire<00:02:54.579> game<00:02:54.850> they<00:02:55.780> just<00:02:55.959> kind<00:02:56.139> of<00:02:56.170> kept

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
entire game they just kind of kept

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.809 
entire game they just kind of kept
building<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.829> building<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.250> building<00:02:57.340> and

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
building and building and building and

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.390 
building and building and building and
you<00:02:58.690> know<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:59.019> was<00:02:59.139> it<00:02:59.500> was<00:02:59.650> Kim<00:02:59.859> really<00:03:00.040> wasn't

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
you know it was it was Kim really wasn't

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.770 
you know it was it was Kim really wasn't
in<00:03:00.489> doubt<00:03:00.639> i<00:03:00.670> thought<00:03:00.940> maybe<00:03:01.090> Baylor<00:03:01.450> if<00:03:01.690> they

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
in doubt i thought maybe Baylor if they

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.750 
in doubt i thought maybe Baylor if they
came<00:03:02.109> out<00:03:02.260> early<00:03:02.500> in<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.620> second<00:03:02.920> half<00:03:03.069> knock

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
came out early in the second half knock

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.370 
came out early in the second half knock
down<00:03:03.970> some<00:03:04.000> shots<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.510> got<00:03:04.660> that<00:03:04.780> game<00:03:05.079> in

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
down some shots and got that game in

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.530 
down some shots and got that game in
single<00:03:05.859> digits<00:03:06.190> maybe<00:03:06.489> then<00:03:07.269> there's<00:03:07.450> a

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
single digits maybe then there's a

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.970 
single digits maybe then there's a
chance<00:03:07.630> they<00:03:07.989> can<00:03:08.049> come<00:03:08.260> back<00:03:08.470> but<00:03:08.709> Wisconsin

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
chance they can come back but Wisconsin

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.660 
chance they can come back but Wisconsin
and<00:03:09.340> let<00:03:09.430> that

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
and let that

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.730 
and let that
they<00:03:10.150> just<00:03:10.330> like<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.840> said<00:03:11.050> cut<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.380> foot<00:03:11.560> on

they just like I said cut the foot on

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.550 
they just like I said cut the foot on
the<00:03:12.280> pedal<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.819> and<00:03:13.599> stayed<00:03:13.989> aggressive<00:03:14.200> they

kept<00:03:14.739> attacking<00:03:14.860> that<00:03:15.340> zone<00:03:15.580> they<00:03:15.790> kept

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
kept attacking that zone they kept

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
shooting for the final four I think the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.150 
shooting for the final four I think the
way<00:04:25.960> they're<00:04:26.140> playing<00:04:26.320> lately<00:04:26.680> they<00:04:26.979> should

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
way they're playing lately they should

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.430 
way they're playing lately they should
be<00:04:27.310> thinking<00:04:27.700> beyond<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.180> Final<00:04:28.510> Four<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:28.780> in

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
be thinking beyond the Final Four and in

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.020 
be thinking beyond the Final Four and in
doing<00:04:29.950> something<00:04:30.310> like<00:04:30.550> that<00:04:30.729> but<00:04:30.910> it

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
doing something like that but it

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.400 
doing something like that but it
certainly<00:04:31.210> would<00:04:31.479> be<00:04:31.630> a<00:04:31.660> big<00:04:31.900> feather<00:04:32.140> in
