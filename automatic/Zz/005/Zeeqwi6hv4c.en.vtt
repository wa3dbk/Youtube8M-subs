 vhs tapes and dvd discs embossed 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.969
 of our homes at the time of seeing

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.660

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.910

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:14.330
 patton and more and this happened in 1977 and 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.210
 which was the first movie released in 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.830
 my life 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.170
 the overproduction completed in 1996 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.750
 after breaking the box office in theaters 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.000

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.670

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.220
 would dominate the home market for years 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.480
 and now surely you will be 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.450
 asking what was the first movie 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.049
