so much time to rest and okay today I

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.200 
so much time to rest and okay today I
don't<00:00:22.350> think<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.529> play<00:00:22.710> very<00:00:22.890> well<00:00:22.949> but<00:00:23.310> anyway

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
don't think I play very well but anyway

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.009 
don't think I play very well but anyway
I<00:00:24.529> mean<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.920> maybe<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.359> miss<00:00:27.359> play<00:00:27.539> doping<00:00:27.869> and

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
I mean it maybe I miss play doping and

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.660 
I mean it maybe I miss play doping and
it<00:00:28.199> was<00:00:28.320> about<00:00:28.439> equal<00:00:28.590> at<00:00:28.800> some<00:00:28.949> point<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:29.369> he

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
it was about equal at some point but he

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.919 
it was about equal at some point but he
misplays<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.029> after<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.660> got<00:00:30.840> an

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
misplays it after that and I got an

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.870 
misplays it after that and I got an
advantage<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.470> after<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.579> think<00:00:32.759> was

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
advantage and after that I think was

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.630 
advantage and after that I think was
pretty<00:00:33.090> smooth<00:00:33.800> so<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.860> there<00:00:35.309> are<00:00:35.370> actually

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
pretty smooth so you there are actually

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.340 
pretty smooth so you there are actually
some<00:00:35.790> chances<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.480> would<00:00:36.660> use<00:00:37.050> quite<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
some chances that you would use quite a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.020 
some chances that you would use quite a
few<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.710> those<00:00:37.829> rating<00:00:38.280> points<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.760> want<00:00:38.879> in

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
few of those rating points you want in

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.340 
few of those rating points you want in
sync<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.300> feel<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.600> way<00:00:39.719> at<00:00:40.050> any<00:00:40.200> point

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
sync you feel that way at any point

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.630 
sync you feel that way at any point
worried<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.950> you're<00:00:41.070> not<00:00:41.100> gonna<00:00:41.340> win<00:00:41.520> this

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.549 
one no I didn't have any big worries i
mean<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.329> position<00:00:46.200> i<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.469> at

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
mean it's just that position i think at

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.440 
mean it's just that position i think at
some<00:00:46.680> point<00:00:46.739> was<00:00:46.980> equal<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.430> i<00:00:47.670> was<00:00:48.329> never

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
some point was equal but i was never

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.200 
some point was equal but i was never
worse<00:00:48.890> and<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.520> night<00:00:50.670> case<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.030> very

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
worse and the night case it was very

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.479 
worse and the night case it was very
complicated<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.899> felt<00:00:52.350> like<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.280> should

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
complicated so I felt like that I should

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.600 
complicated so I felt like that I should
out<00:00:53.789> claim<00:00:54.000> at<00:00:54.149> some<00:00:54.300> point<00:00:54.770> and<00:00:55.770> here<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.430> are
