00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.470
 macerated 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.490
 hello to all beautiful and ugly as ave 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.610
 the saw I made the game of 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.490
 tris row row 3 tic tac toe re or come 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.950
 you want to call it on man kraft in short 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.320
 now instead of playing at school 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.360
 when the professor can't see you, you can 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.360
 play it in cubes on man kraft 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.269
 between the commands we have two panels one 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.410
 to place the crosses and the other i 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.290
 circles 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.840
 then there are two buttons at the top 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.760
 to start a new game while the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.799
 second to start a new round 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.870
 in the same game 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.239
 finally we have a lever to pass 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.950
 from multiplayer to that 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.110
 single player 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.049
 in the latter you will be the cross 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.819
 minecraft will circle me now 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.670
 I play a single player game 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.640
 since you have already witnessed the beginning 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.120
 to my game against the there 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.670
 in the meantime I'll explain how it works 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.799
 each game is played at the best of 5 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.380
 this means that whoever arrives first is three 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.069
 wins wins at the top 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.440
 billboard 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.079
 we have the points count that is reported 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.630
 also in the scoreboard sidebar a 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.880
 left as always the map is 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.840
 downloadable for free from the link in 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.840
 Description 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:25.060
 betti and look at what work is behind 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.060
 this seemingly simple game 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.610
 we have come to the end 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:41.639

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.689

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:47.080

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.330
