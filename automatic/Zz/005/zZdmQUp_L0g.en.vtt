00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
personal opinion maybe it's because I

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.619 
personal opinion maybe it's because I
don't<00:02:26.189> really<00:02:26.370> understand<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.269> history

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
place nevertheless the boss itself is

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.629 
place nevertheless the boss itself is
like<00:02:33.780> Almar<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.439> sonic<00:02:34.769> bosses<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.430> takes

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.629 
think as an individual BOTS he'd be cool
but<00:04:17.579> I<00:04:17.609> feel<00:04:17.909> like<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.690> sonic<00:04:19.229> generation

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
but I feel like the sonic generation

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.170 
but I feel like the sonic generation
itself<00:04:21.620> it<00:04:22.620> just<00:04:22.949> isn't

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
itself it just isn't

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.459 
itself it just isn't
well<00:04:24.449> like<00:04:24.629> I<00:04:24.749> feel<00:04:24.930> like<00:04:25.080> there<00:04:25.259> might<00:04:25.409> have

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:25.469 
well like I feel like there might have

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:27.760 
well like I feel like there might have
been<00:04:25.680> better<00:04:25.949> options<00:04:26.639> than<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.060> biohazard

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
been better options than the biohazard

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.390 
been better options than the biohazard
personally<00:04:28.770> I<00:04:29.509> suppose<00:04:30.509> to<00:04:31.110> whites<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:32.009> don't

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
personally I suppose to whites I don't

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.070 
personally I suppose to whites I don't
know<00:04:32.520> I'm<00:04:32.639> trying<00:04:32.789> to<00:04:32.969> think<00:04:33.300> of<00:04:33.449> a<00:04:33.539> boss<00:04:33.749> that

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
know I'm trying to think of a boss that

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.879 
know I'm trying to think of a boss that
would<00:04:34.169> be<00:04:34.229> good<00:04:34.590> but<00:04:36.439> feel<00:04:37.439> like<00:04:37.560> there's<00:04:37.800> a

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
would be good but feel like there's a

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.239 
would be good but feel like there's a
better<00:04:38.159> option<00:04:39.469> and<00:04:40.469> that's<00:04:40.710> really<00:04:41.009> my

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:41.249 
better option and that's really my

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:43.580 
better option and that's really my
opinion<00:04:41.759> so<00:04:42.150> I<00:04:42.509> mean<00:04:42.840> you<00:04:42.960> could<00:04:43.110> agree<00:04:43.349> or

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
opinion so I mean you could agree or

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.670 
opinion so I mean you could agree or
disagree<00:04:43.770> but<00:04:44.460> nonetheless<00:04:45.319> that's<00:04:46.319> pretty

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
disagree but nonetheless that's pretty

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.439 
disagree but nonetheless that's pretty
much<00:04:46.800> it<00:04:47.039> for<00:04:47.069> the<00:04:47.310> bio<00:04:47.490> wizard<00:04:47.969> once<00:04:48.180> you<00:04:48.300> have

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
much it for the bio wizard once you have

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.570 
much it for the bio wizard once you have
them<00:04:48.569> down<00:04:48.719> to<00:04:49.020> this<00:04:49.080> final<00:04:49.319> two<00:04:49.800> hits<00:04:50.159> its

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
them down to this final two hits its

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.330 
them down to this final two hits its
bubble<00:04:50.999> dancing<00:04:51.599> yet<00:04:51.870> to<00:04:52.409> another<00:04:52.740> home<00:04:53.039> in

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
bubble dancing yet to another home in

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.490 
bubble dancing yet to another home in
attack<00:04:53.669> and<00:04:54.360> then<00:04:54.719> the<00:04:54.870> last<00:04:55.020> ones<00:04:55.349> a<00:04:55.469> bit

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
attack and then the last ones a bit

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.330 
attack and then the last ones a bit
different<00:04:56.279> it's<00:04:57.150> like<00:04:57.569> a<00:04:57.599> weird

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
different it's like a weird

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.730 
different it's like a weird
gravitational<00:04:59.340> effect<00:04:59.879> I<00:05:00.330> don't<00:05:01.050> understand

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
gravitational effect I don't understand

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.679 
gravitational effect I don't understand
how<00:05:01.949> this<00:05:02.159> works<00:05:02.219> and<00:05:02.879> again<00:05:03.120> that<00:05:03.360> might<00:05:03.509> be

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:03.689 
how this works and again that might be

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:05.600 
how this works and again that might be
just<00:05:03.960> because<00:05:04.199> I<00:05:04.289> don't<00:05:04.469> know<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:04.889> biohazards

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
just because I don't know the biohazards

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.600 
just because I don't know the biohazards
original<00:05:06.150> game<00:05:06.419> or<00:05:06.810> purpose<00:05:07.460> but<00:05:08.460> you

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
original game or purpose but you

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.179 
original game or purpose but you
basically<00:05:09.000> just<00:05:09.150> float<00:05:09.659> your<00:05:09.900> way<00:05:10.050> up<00:05:10.289> and

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:11.189 
basically just float your way up and

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:16.700 
basically just float your way up and
that's<00:05:11.430> how<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.389> bio<00:05:12.719> wizard<00:05:13.199> works<00:05:14.810> and<00:05:15.810> once

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
that's how the bio wizard works and once

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.409 
that's how the bio wizard works and once
you<00:05:16.889> float<00:05:17.189> your<00:05:17.219> way<00:05:17.430> up<00:05:17.729> dodging<00:05:18.300> the

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
you float your way up dodging the

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:31.269 
you float your way up dodging the
bubbles<00:05:19.490> hit<00:05:20.490> the<00:05:20.699> center<00:05:21.979> and<00:05:22.979> down<00:05:23.430> he<00:05:24.089> goes

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:31.279

the<00:06:40.800> Chaos<00:06:41.100> Emeralds<00:06:41.610> in<00:06:41.700> this<00:06:41.850> game<00:06:42.060> really

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
the Chaos Emeralds in this game really

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.200 
the Chaos Emeralds in this game really
aren't<00:06:42.720> that<00:06:42.870> bad<00:06:43.260> like<00:06:43.590> my<00:06:44.280> first<00:06:44.550> Sonic<00:06:45.000> game

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
aren't that bad like my first Sonic game

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.260 
aren't that bad like my first Sonic game
was<00:06:45.420> Sonic<00:06:45.780> Advance<00:06:46.050> 3<00:06:46.590> oh<00:06:46.740> my<00:06:47.310> goodness<00:06:47.820> that

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 
was Sonic Advance 3 oh my goodness that

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.660 
was Sonic Advance 3 oh my goodness that
was<00:06:48.480> so<00:06:48.810> painful<00:06:49.440> getting<00:06:50.040> all<00:06:50.340> the<00:06:50.550> emeralds

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
was so painful getting all the emeralds

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.020 
was so painful getting all the emeralds
in<00:06:51.150> that<00:06:51.360> game<00:06:51.890> so<00:06:52.890> this<00:06:53.190> game<00:06:53.520> really<00:06:53.880> isn't

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
in that game so this game really isn't

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.240 
in that game so this game really isn't
that<00:06:54.270> bad<00:06:54.600> you<00:06:54.870> have<00:06:54.990> no<00:06:55.020> excuse<00:06:55.950> for<00:06:55.980> not

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
that bad you have no excuse for not

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.820 
that bad you have no excuse for not
