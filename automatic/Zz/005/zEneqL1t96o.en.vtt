00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
generation game I think Bab craft

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.420 
generation game I think Bab craft
actually<00:02:24.750> has<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.019> look<00:02:25.439> at<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.709> then<00:02:26.129> you<00:02:26.250> see

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
actually has a look at that then you see

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.729 
actually has a look at that then you see
that<00:02:26.659> technology<00:02:27.659> did<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.439> see<00:02:28.620> this

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
that technology did you see this

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.250 
that technology did you see this
innovation<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.030> going<00:02:30.599> into<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.900> map

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
innovation that is going into the map

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.430 
innovation that is going into the map
design<00:02:31.470> right<00:02:32.250> now<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.489> can<00:02:32.819> close<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:34.170> quick

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
design right now you can close it quick

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.910 
design right now you can close it quick
so<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.829> got<00:02:35.760> killed<00:02:35.970> though<00:02:36.120> but<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:37.319> can<00:02:37.620> close

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
so I got killed though but you can close

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.979 
so I got killed though but you can close
the<00:02:38.129> door<00:02:38.310> open<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.760> door<00:02:38.879> to<00:02:39.060> your<00:02:39.450> advantage

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
the door open the door to your advantage

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.729 
the door open the door to your advantage
and<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.859> think<00:02:40.980> in<00:02:41.489> future<00:02:41.940> maps<00:02:42.209> I<00:02:42.530> want<00:02:43.530> to
