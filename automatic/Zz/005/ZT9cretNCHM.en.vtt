00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
that we're using I recommend putting in

a<00:00:55.800> new<00:00:56.010> color<00:00:56.370> from<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> wrong<00:00:57.300> side<00:00:57.350> as<00:00:58.579> this

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
a new color from the wrong side as this

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.959 
a new color from the wrong side as this
will<00:01:00.050> eliminate<00:01:01.050> most<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.100> issues<00:01:02.699> that

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
weave in the ends a bit better than if

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.590
