all<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:11.719> time<00:01:11.840> kids<00:01:12.320> who<00:01:12.469> told<00:01:12.590> me<00:01:12.680> to<00:01:12.770> do

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
all the time kids who told me to do

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.200 
all the time kids who told me to do
something<00:01:13.219> I'd<00:01:13.340> probably<00:01:13.490> end<00:01:13.700> up<00:01:13.820> doing<00:01:14.119> it

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
something I'd probably end up doing it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.340 
something I'd probably end up doing it
as<00:01:14.299> long<00:01:14.329> as<00:01:14.509> I<00:01:14.600> wouldn't<00:01:14.810> put<00:01:14.930> my<00:01:14.960> life<00:01:15.229> at

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
as long as I wouldn't put my life at

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.139 
as long as I wouldn't put my life at
risk<00:01:15.409> and<00:01:15.860> I<00:01:16.250> figured<00:01:16.520> that<00:01:16.670> what's<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:16.939> worst

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
risk and I figured that what's the worst

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:18.670 
risk and I figured that what's the worst
that<00:01:17.299> could<00:01:17.359> happen<00:01:17.420> if<00:01:17.780> I<00:01:17.869> fucking<00:01:18.289> staple

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
that could happen if I fucking staple

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.980 
that could happen if I fucking staple
myself<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:19.369> I<00:01:19.759> really<00:01:20.060> don't<00:01:20.299> know<00:01:20.390> why<00:01:20.570> I<00:01:20.600> did
