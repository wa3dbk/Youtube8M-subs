00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
wanted to get a video out as quick as

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.800 
wanted to get a video out as quick as
possible<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:08.310> let's<00:03:08.340> talk<00:03:08.790> about<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.540> plasma

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
possible so let's talk about the plasma

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.069 
possible so let's talk about the plasma
shotgun<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:11.250> plasma<00:03:11.700> shotgun<00:03:12.180> has<00:03:12.510> four

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
shotgun the plasma shotgun has four

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.710 
shotgun the plasma shotgun has four
rounds<00:03:13.320> in<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.160> clip<00:03:14.459> as<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:14.910> watch<00:03:15.299> me<00:03:15.329> shoot

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
rounds in the clip as you watch me shoot

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.840 
rounds in the clip as you watch me shoot
with<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:16.019> you'll<00:03:16.170> notice<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.769> animation<00:03:16.950> as

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
with it you'll notice the animation as

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.699 
with it you'll notice the animation as
far<00:03:18.120> as<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.390> spread<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.110> bullets<00:03:19.470> coming

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
far as the spread of the bullets coming

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.009 
far as the spread of the bullets coming
out<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:20.070> very<00:03:20.700> very<00:03:20.970> similar<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.660> the

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
out is very very similar to the

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.140 
out is very very similar to the
automatic<00:03:22.590> shotgun<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.280> that's<00:03:23.820> what<00:03:24.030> it's

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
automatic shotgun and that's what it's

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.000 
automatic shotgun and that's what it's
most<00:03:24.390> like<00:03:24.660> it's<00:03:24.870> very<00:03:25.200> similar<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.890> the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
most like it's very similar to the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.160 
most like it's very similar to the
automatic<00:03:26.579> shotgun<00:03:27.060> but<00:03:27.239> not<00:03:27.450> near<00:03:27.780> as<00:03:27.930> good

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
automatic shotgun but not near as good

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.259 
automatic shotgun but not near as good
as<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.470> automatic<00:03:29.100> shotgun<00:03:29.579> has<00:03:29.790> seven

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
as the automatic shotgun has seven

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.210 
as the automatic shotgun has seven
rounds<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:30.870> one<00:03:31.019> only<00:03:31.110> has<00:03:31.230> four<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:32.160> I

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
rounds and this one only has four so I

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.000 
rounds and this one only has four so I
found<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:32.670> with<00:03:32.910> this<00:03:33.120> weapon<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:34.470> damage

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
found that with this weapon the damage

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.550 
found that with this weapon the damage
was<00:03:35.459> very<00:03:35.730> weak<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.630> lot<00:03:36.900> of<00:03:36.930> times<00:03:37.260> I<00:03:37.440> was

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
was very weak and a lot of times I was

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.170 
was very weak and a lot of times I was
having<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:37.950> reload<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.760> reload<00:03:39.150> is

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
having to reload and the reload is

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.240 
having to reload and the reload is
fairly<00:03:39.780> slow<00:03:40.079> so<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.590> lot<00:03:40.769> of<00:03:40.799> times<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.160> was

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
fairly slow so a lot of times I was

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.039 
fairly slow so a lot of times I was
having<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:41.579> reload<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.150> as<00:03:42.390> I<00:03:42.540> was<00:03:42.660> reloading

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
having to reload and as I was reloading

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.440 
having to reload and as I was reloading
I<00:03:43.320> would<00:03:43.590> get<00:03:43.769> killed<00:03:44.040> watch<00:03:44.790> how<00:03:45.060> long<00:03:45.120> it

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
I would get killed watch how long it

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.069 
I would get killed watch how long it
takes<00:03:45.989> me<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.440> kill<00:03:46.709> my<00:03:47.310> favorite<00:03:48.000> buddy<00:03:48.299> mr.

little<00:03:53.489> bit<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.790> range<00:03:54.000> because<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.360> don't<00:03:54.510> want

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
little bit of range because I don't want

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.270 
little bit of range because I don't want
to<00:03:54.720> get<00:03:54.840> crushed<00:03:55.170> by<00:03:55.350> him<00:03:55.560> as<00:03:55.709> he<00:03:55.860> goes<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.040> the

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
to get crushed by him as he goes to the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.270 
to get crushed by him as he goes to the
ground<00:03:56.489> that<00:03:57.060> had<00:03:57.299> I<00:03:57.329> been<00:03:57.630> using<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.769> proton

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
ground that had I been using the proton

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.979 
ground that had I been using the proton
gun<00:03:59.549> or<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.820> zap<00:04:00.030> gun<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.390> would<00:04:00.600> have<00:04:00.720> fried

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
gun or the zap gun I would have fried

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.099 
gun or the zap gun I would have fried
this<00:04:01.200> marshmallow<00:04:01.620> in<00:04:02.010> half<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.700> time

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
this marshmallow in half the time

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.569 
this marshmallow in half the time
typically<00:04:04.109> it<00:04:04.200> would<00:04:04.290> take<00:04:04.530> me<00:04:04.709> three<00:04:04.739> shots

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
typically it would take me three shots

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.420 
typically it would take me three shots
to<00:04:05.760> kill<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.120> guy<00:04:06.359> so<00:04:06.600> I<00:04:06.660> think<00:04:06.750> this<00:04:07.230> weapon<00:04:08.220> is

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
to kill a guy so I think this weapon is

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.530 
to kill a guy so I think this weapon is
best<00:04:09.090> suited<00:04:09.569> for<00:04:09.599> close<00:04:10.530> range<00:04:10.920> Maps

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
best suited for close range Maps

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.850 
best suited for close range Maps
headquarters<00:04:12.540> I<00:04:12.720> did<00:04:13.050> really<00:04:13.349> good<00:04:13.590> with<00:04:13.739> this

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
headquarters I did really good with this

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.940 
headquarters I did really good with this
weapon<00:04:14.069> popping<00:04:14.610> around

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
weapon popping around

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.550 
weapon popping around
walls<00:04:15.160> and<00:04:15.670> also<00:04:15.970> sandtown<00:04:16.600> stay<00:04:17.380> behind

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
walls and also sandtown stay behind

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.319 
walls and also sandtown stay behind
walls<00:04:17.919> pop<00:04:18.280> around<00:04:18.549> those<00:04:18.790> corners<00:04:19.000> that's

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
walls pop around those corners that's

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.020 
walls pop around those corners that's
your<00:04:19.450> best<00:04:19.690> bet<00:04:19.840> with<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:21.040> plasma<00:04:21.310> shotgun

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
your best bet with the plasma shotgun

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.320 
your best bet with the plasma shotgun
pretty<00:04:22.780> fun<00:04:22.990> weapon<00:04:23.440> also<00:04:24.220> I<00:04:24.430> tried<00:04:24.910> using

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
pretty fun weapon also I tried using

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.720 
pretty fun weapon also I tried using
plasma<00:04:25.540> punch<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.200> still<00:04:26.770> don't<00:04:27.340> like<00:04:27.400> that

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
plasma punch I still don't like that

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.430 
plasma punch I still don't like that
weapon<00:04:28.090> as<00:04:28.240> much<00:04:28.600> as<00:04:28.750> I<00:04:28.870> didn't<00:04:29.169> like<00:04:29.290> it

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
weapon as much as I didn't like it

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.610 
weapon as much as I didn't like it
before<00:04:29.590> it<00:04:30.130> kills<00:04:30.520> way<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.150> slow<00:04:31.690> this<00:04:32.229> weapon

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
before it kills way to slow this weapon

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.040 
before it kills way to slow this weapon
is<00:04:32.740> better<00:04:32.979> than<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.610> plasma<00:04:34.090> punch<00:04:34.330> but<00:04:34.900> I

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
is better than the plasma punch but I

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.010 
is better than the plasma punch but I
prefer<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:36.040> zap<00:04:36.280> gun<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:36.790> the<00:04:37.030> proton<00:04:37.510> gun<00:04:37.810> as

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
prefer the zap gun and the proton gun as

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.800 
prefer the zap gun and the proton gun as
far<00:04:38.560> as<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.800> energy<00:04:39.190> weapon<00:04:39.610> goes<00:04:39.790> over<00:04:40.510> the

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
far as the energy weapon goes over the

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.080 
far as the energy weapon goes over the
plasma<00:04:41.229> shotgun<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:42.340> is<00:04:42.490> going<00:04:42.610> to<00:04:42.669> wrap<00:04:42.910> up

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
plasma shotgun that is going to wrap up

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.790 
plasma shotgun that is going to wrap up
