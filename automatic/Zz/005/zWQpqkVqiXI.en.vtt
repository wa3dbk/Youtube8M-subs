00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.210
 God, why did not you reuse your son? 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:56.770

 in a thornbush by its horns and it was 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:10.480
 abraham and took the ram and offered it 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:13.480
 in holocaust instead of his son and 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:18.340
 I call abraham the name of that place 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:22.170

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.489
 and I call the angel of jehova abraham 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:33.180
 second time from heaven and he said for me 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.910

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.270
 I will bless you and multiply your 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.239
 offspring as the stars of the 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:52.410

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:55.980
 shore of the sea and your offspring or it will be 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:59.790
 the doors of your enemies in your 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.700
 seed will be sold all 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.660
 nations of the earth because I 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:09.750
 you say to my voice and Abraham returned to his 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:14.130
 servants and they got up and left 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.790
