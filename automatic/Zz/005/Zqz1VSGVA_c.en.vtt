00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
probably the least subtle film that I've

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.150 
probably the least subtle film that I've
ever<00:05:02.860> seen<00:05:04.170> also<00:05:05.170> the<00:05:05.320> whole<00:05:05.500> interspecies

ever seen also the whole interspecies

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.000 
ever seen also the whole interspecies
from<00:05:06.700> heads<00:05:07.000> thing<00:05:07.300> it<00:05:07.870> didn't<00:05:08.200> bother<00:05:08.470> me<00:05:08.680> in

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
from heads thing it didn't bother me in

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.230 
from heads thing it didn't bother me in
the<00:05:09.040> extent<00:05:09.550> that<00:05:09.610> I<00:05:09.700> thought<00:05:09.910> it<00:05:10.000> was<00:05:10.060> like

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
the extent that I thought it was like

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.450 
the extent that I thought it was like
disgusting<00:05:10.930> or<00:05:11.140> morally<00:05:11.680> wrong<00:05:12.070> or<00:05:12.340> anything

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
disgusting or morally wrong or anything

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.460 
disgusting or morally wrong or anything
but<00:05:12.820> I<00:05:12.880> just<00:05:13.000> thought<00:05:13.360> it<00:05:13.510> was<00:05:13.600> a<00:05:13.660> little<00:05:14.020> silly

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
but I just thought it was a little silly

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.040 
but I just thought it was a little silly
it<00:05:15.190> kind<00:05:15.430> of<00:05:15.490> reminded<00:05:15.910> a'n't<00:05:16.360> but<00:05:16.810> think<00:05:16.990> of

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
it kind of reminded a'n't but think of

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.970 
it kind of reminded a'n't but think of
like<00:05:17.260> Sonic<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.680> Hedgehog<00:05:19.650> you<00:05:20.650> know<00:05:20.770> maybe

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
like Sonic the Hedgehog you know maybe

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.920 
like Sonic the Hedgehog you know maybe
the<00:05:21.130> main<00:05:21.280> characters<00:05:21.790> like<00:05:21.970> secretly<00:05:22.360> Afari

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
the main characters like secretly Afari

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.860 
the main characters like secretly Afari
maybe<00:05:23.320> that's<00:05:23.560> why<00:05:23.740> he<00:05:23.890> was<00:05:24.010> attracted<00:05:24.550> to<00:05:24.580> the

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
maybe that's why he was attracted to the

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:31.200 
maybe that's why he was attracted to the
ten-foot<00:05:25.870> tall<00:05:25.900> cat<00:05:26.410> lady<00:05:26.910> cat<00:05:27.910> Smurf<00:05:30.210> there

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
part of the gamer part of me was

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.920 
part of the gamer part of me was
thinking<00:05:59.770> of<00:05:59.890> Chrono<00:06:00.190> Trigger<00:06:00.340> but<00:06:00.940> actually

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
thinking of Chrono Trigger but actually

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.140 
thinking of Chrono Trigger but actually
that<00:06:01.960> the<00:06:02.410> bigger<00:06:02.919> part<00:06:03.190> of<00:06:03.370> me<00:06:03.460> the<00:06:03.580> music<00:06:03.940> fan

that the bigger part of me the music fan

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.620 
that the bigger part of me the music fan
was<00:06:04.330> thinking<00:06:04.720> of<00:06:04.930> like<00:06:05.940> covers<00:06:06.940> too<00:06:07.150> many<00:06:07.360> s

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
was thinking of like covers too many s

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.740 
was thinking of like covers too many s
albums<00:06:08.140> like<00:06:08.440> fragile<00:06:08.830> or<00:06:09.540> tales<00:06:10.540> from<00:06:10.660> the

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
albums like fragile or tales from the

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.110 
albums like fragile or tales from the
topographic<00:06:11.440> oceans<00:06:11.590> or<00:06:12.100> whatever<00:06:12.400> ever

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
topographic oceans or whatever ever

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.420 
topographic oceans or whatever ever
relayer<00:06:13.660> and<00:06:14.200> you<00:06:14.770> know<00:06:14.890> there<00:06:15.100> were<00:06:15.190> there

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
relayer and you know there were there

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.710 
relayer and you know there were there
was<00:06:15.520> a<00:06:15.550> lot<00:06:15.760> of<00:06:15.790> little<00:06:16.090> references<00:06:16.600> and

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
was a lot of little references and

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.120 
was a lot of little references and
they're<00:06:16.810> obviously<00:06:17.200> it<00:06:17.320> was<00:06:17.410> very<00:06:17.650> similar<00:06:17.950> to

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
they're obviously it was very similar to

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.710 
they're obviously it was very similar to
dances<00:06:18.700> with<00:06:18.850> wolves<00:06:18.970> everybody's<00:06:19.570> been

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
dances with wolves everybody's been

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.810 
dances with wolves everybody's been
saying<00:06:19.960> that<00:06:20.229> and<00:06:20.440> in<00:06:20.890> essentials<00:06:21.400> in<00:06:21.550> a<00:06:21.640> lot

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
saying that and in essentials in a lot

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.700 
saying that and in essentials in a lot
of<00:06:21.850> ways<00:06:22.090> sort<00:06:22.510> of<00:06:22.600> a<00:06:22.660> remake<00:06:22.840> of<00:06:23.020> dances<00:06:23.560> with

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
of ways sort of a remake of dances with

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.340 
of ways sort of a remake of dances with
wolves<00:06:24.720> in<00:06:25.720> it

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
wolves in it

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.830 
wolves in it
themes<00:06:26.770> and<00:06:27.130> whatnot<00:06:27.520> I<00:06:27.820> thought<00:06:28.210> Dances<00:06:28.690> with

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
themes and whatnot I thought Dances with

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.050 
themes and whatnot I thought Dances with
Wolves<00:06:28.990> was<00:06:29.290> just<00:06:29.440> a<00:06:29.530> better<00:06:29.680> film<00:06:30.070> like<00:06:30.940> I

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
Wolves was just a better film like I

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.640 
Wolves was just a better film like I
said<00:06:31.300> there's<00:06:31.480> nothing<00:06:31.600> subtle<00:06:32.020> about<00:06:32.290> this

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
said there's nothing subtle about this

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.530 
said there's nothing subtle about this
movie<00:06:33.070> there's<00:06:33.700> nothing<00:06:33.940> about<00:06:34.570> it<00:06:34.630> that

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
movie there's nothing about it that

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.730 
movie there's nothing about it that
where<00:06:37.540> they're<00:06:37.660> not<00:06:37.810> beating<00:06:38.110> you<00:06:38.410> over<00:06:38.440> the

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
where they're not beating you over the

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.710 
where they're not beating you over the
head<00:06:38.860> with<00:06:39.040> the<00:06:39.340> message<00:06:39.730> it<00:06:39.880> really<00:06:40.240> kind<00:06:40.630> of

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
head with the message it really kind of

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.900 
head with the message it really kind of
is<00:06:40.870> an<00:06:41.020> insult<00:06:41.380> to<00:06:41.500> your<00:06:41.650> intelligence<00:06:42.280> where

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
is an insult to your intelligence where

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.790 
is an insult to your intelligence where
they're<00:06:43.060> basically<00:06:43.480> coming<00:06:43.810> out<00:06:44.080> and<00:06:44.320> saying

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
they're basically coming out and saying

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.000 
they're basically coming out and saying
you<00:06:45.190> know<00:06:45.220> we<00:06:46.210> think<00:06:46.570> humans<00:06:47.230> are<00:06:47.440> bad<00:06:47.680> guys

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
you know we think humans are bad guys

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.600 
you know we think humans are bad guys
because<00:06:48.730> they<00:06:49.000> do<00:06:49.060> this<00:06:49.540> to<00:06:50.140> these<00:06:50.800> cat<00:06:51.160> people

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
because they do this to these cat people

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.670 
because they do this to these cat people
and<00:06:51.820> we<00:06:51.910> don't<00:06:52.060> like<00:06:52.330> that<00:06:52.570> they<00:06:53.320> never

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
and we don't like that they never

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.770 
and we don't like that they never
explained<00:06:54.340> the<00:06:54.490> unobtanium<00:06:55.000> the<00:06:55.390> mineral

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780 
explained the unobtanium the mineral

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.150 
explained the unobtanium the mineral
that<00:06:55.810> they're<00:06:56.110> after<00:06:56.290> I<00:06:56.470> guess<00:06:56.710> it's<00:06:56.920> sort<00:06:57.040> of

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 
that they're after I guess it's sort of

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.060 
that they're after I guess it's sort of
a<00:06:57.220> MacGuffin<00:06:57.730> it<00:06:57.880> really<00:06:58.090> served<00:06:58.360> no<00:06:58.540> point<00:06:59.070> so

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
a MacGuffin it really served no point so

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.100 
a MacGuffin it really served no point so
you<00:07:00.130> don't<00:07:00.310> know<00:07:00.640> why<00:07:00.910> it's<00:07:01.150> so<00:07:01.270> valuable<00:07:01.420> or

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
you don't know why it's so valuable or

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.510 
you don't know why it's so valuable or
why<00:07:02.290> you<00:07:02.620> know<00:07:02.740> why<00:07:02.980> they<00:07:03.160> can't<00:07:03.370> get

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
why you know why they can't get

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.500 
why you know why they can't get
elsewhere<00:07:05.610> like<00:07:06.610> I<00:07:06.730> said<00:07:06.790> I<00:07:07.000> was<00:07:07.180> disappointed

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:07.510 
elsewhere like I said I was disappointed

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.570 
elsewhere like I said I was disappointed
I<00:07:08.050> thought<00:07:08.410> it<00:07:08.500> was<00:07:08.560> a<00:07:08.650> good<00:07:08.800> movie<00:07:09.070> in<00:07:09.460> the

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:09.580 
I thought it was a good movie in the

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.000 
I thought it was a good movie in the
sense<00:07:09.820> that<00:07:09.940> it<00:07:10.240> was<00:07:10.390> a<00:07:10.630> visual<00:07:11.470> treat<00:07:11.650> the

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.010 
sense that it was a visual treat the

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.340 
sense that it was a visual treat the
action<00:07:12.430> was<00:07:12.550> good<00:07:12.790> and<00:07:13.180> the<00:07:13.570> acting<00:07:13.960> was<00:07:14.140> good

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:14.350 
action was good and the acting was good

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.910 
action was good and the acting was good
and<00:07:15.990> you<00:07:16.990> know<00:07:17.110> that's<00:07:17.260> pretty<00:07:17.410> much<00:07:17.620> it<00:07:17.680> i

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:17.920 
and you know that's pretty much it i

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.000 
and you know that's pretty much it i
thought<00:07:18.070> the<00:07:18.160> script<00:07:18.460> was<00:07:18.640> really<00:07:19.150> blunt<00:07:19.540> and

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.010 
thought the script was really blunt and

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.860 
thought the script was really blunt and
i<00:07:21.010> thought<00:07:21.250> that<00:07:21.490> the<00:07:21.640> message<00:07:22.120> was<00:07:22.450> really

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:22.870 
i thought that the message was really

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.320 
i thought that the message was really
really<00:07:23.050> ham<00:07:23.380> headed<00:07:23.800> like<00:07:23.980> they<00:07:24.270> they<00:07:25.270> were

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
really ham headed like they they were

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.260 
really ham headed like they they were
not<00:07:25.630> at<00:07:25.870> all<00:07:26.730> thinking<00:07:27.730> that<00:07:27.910> they<00:07:28.030> would<00:07:28.210> just

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270 
not at all thinking that they would just

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.510 
not at all thinking that they would just
kind<00:07:28.780> of<00:07:28.960> sneak<00:07:29.380> their<00:07:29.620> message<00:07:29.950> in<00:07:30.100> there<00:07:30.250> the

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 
kind of sneak their message in there the

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.030 
kind of sneak their message in there the
message<00:07:30.820> took<00:07:31.090> the<00:07:31.210> forefront<00:07:31.740> the<00:07:32.740> visual

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:33.040 
message took the forefront the visual
