00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.770 
toggle them back on it does save the
location<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.560> move<00:02:25.800> them<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:27.420> right<00:02:27.600> there

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
location I move them to so right there

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.650 
location I move them to so right there
you<00:02:27.930> could<00:02:28.050> see<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.410> saves<00:02:28.710> both<00:02:29.010> locations<00:02:29.660> so

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660
