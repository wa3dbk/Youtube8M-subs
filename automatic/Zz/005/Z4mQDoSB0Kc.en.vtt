00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 here we have a Bernese mountain dog who 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.109
 has not been groomed for several 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.500
 month we gave a lot at the level of 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.830
 neck and the whole body is very very knotty 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.929
 with them an abundant lot of hair 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.480
 dead we can not even pass the hand to 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.810
 the skin so much the hair is dense and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.810
 thick 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.390
 as the problem is complex we are going 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.349
 mix 4 cream to really have a 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.360
 very rich base 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.210
 the basic product being grapefruit 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.220
 we will put a lot softer because he 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.290
 is a big dog and we will mix 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.839
 to have little loss of product 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.680
 no lumps is a homogeneous whole 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.680
 for the application 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.700
 and 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.370
 we start the application on the pasta 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.720
 and the belly are areas where there are 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.620
 a lot of undercoat and so his 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.050
 again strongly 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.430
 so we go mass and energetically for 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.300
 to make penetrate the creams well 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.300
 the inside of the hair 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.480
 and 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.500
 we then work going up on the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.740
 back the flanks the blow the head we try 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.460
 not to forget anything 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.290
 after the break time of a quarter 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.790
 hour we see that the hair comes off 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.560
 well and that is not so good 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.910
 trained and that the hair is much more 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.280
 flexible when the weight comes off well 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.130
 can consider a rough brushing with 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.690
 a rotating adam device especially not a 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.690
 hard comb to not tear everything off 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.090
 and 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:07.039
 the first step is to make sure that's 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.660
 the cream that was allowed to pose at the base 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.610
 we notice that there are some 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.819
 dandruff because the skin does not 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.040
 not breathing with the dead hairs of 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.319
 blow we will use the shampoo alone 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.390
 times base the colloidal sulfide which 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.470
 serve at the dandruff cid we go 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.470
 only one shampoo 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:31.310
 we will apply the same mixture as 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.049
 previously to hide it we're going 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.120
 put a tablespoon of each 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.280
 for about 500 milliliters of water and 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.579
 we will let the tour go 5 minutes 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.579
 only 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.510
 drying to blow over the plain 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.010
 of force with the tools we will gurs 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.190
 go with a simple brush in 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.010
 rubber started to loosen the hair 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.320
 and then we 'll go deeper to 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:06.400
 the finishes that between the hair will already be 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:08.410
 very specific I have seen that the weight there 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.720
 and supple as the ninths well and that 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.720
 the undercoat without voice without difficulty 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.540
 when the hair and that is we can 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.810
 then go into more detail for 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:31.180
 to be sure that no village has been left 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.180
 no hushed area where we but 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.239
 the end of the care the dog keeps its volume 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.690
 natural if not more than 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:56.810
 volume the hair and saint mont saw he 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.250
 is brilliant it is soft to the touch the 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.440
 skin was not damaged 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.010
 because we did not have to shoot 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.200
 used fairly simple tools if we 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:12.099
 pass the comb we have no knot 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.099
 residuals and the skin is healthy
