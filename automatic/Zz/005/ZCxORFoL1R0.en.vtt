00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
I was going to put in this video was

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.060 
I was going to put in this video was
first<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.570> all<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:34.260> had<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.500> be<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.649> movie<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.040> i

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
first of all it had to be a movie that i

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.920 
first of all it had to be a movie that i
really<00:00:35.399> like<00:00:35.480> it<00:00:36.480> couldn't<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.780> be

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
really like it couldn't just be

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.889 
really like it couldn't just be
something<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:38.040> mediocre<00:00:38.700> if<00:00:39.239> I

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
something that I think is mediocre if I

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.049 
something that I think is mediocre if I
did<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.170> then<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.770> would<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.610> bunch<00:00:41.940> of

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
did that then I would have a bunch of

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.729 
did that then I would have a bunch of
like<00:00:42.270> really<00:00:42.600> cool<00:00:42.840> additions<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:43.410> movies

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
like really cool additions but movies

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.959 
like really cool additions but movies
that<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.950> didn't<00:00:44.280> really<00:00:44.370> love<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.059> then<00:00:45.840> um

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
that I didn't really love and then um

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.209 
that I didn't really love and then um
the<00:00:47.969> other<00:00:48.000> criteria<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.660> used<00:00:48.899> were<00:00:49.230> picture

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
the other criteria I used were picture

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.770 
the other criteria I used were picture
and<00:00:50.340> sound<00:00:50.460> quality<00:00:50.640> because<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.360> think<00:00:51.480> that's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
and sound quality because I think that's

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.779 
and sound quality because I think that's
probably<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.199> most<00:00:52.350> important<00:00:52.860> reason<00:00:53.550> for

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
probably the most important reason for

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.110 
probably the most important reason for
having<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.300> be<00:00:54.390> your<00:00:54.510> favorite<00:00:54.690> blu-ray<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
having it be your favorite blu-ray and

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.180 
having it be your favorite blu-ray and
then<00:00:57.120> also<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.539> having<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.350> top<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.070> that

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
then also just having it on top of that

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.790 
then also just having it on top of that
having<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.969> cool<00:01:00.180> addition<00:01:00.449> as<00:01:00.750> well<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.530> cool

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
the three films and shows how they

the three films and shows how they
intersect<00:05:14.430> with<00:05:14.580> each<00:05:14.639> other<00:05:14.940> and<00:05:15.240> it<00:05:15.750> kind<00:05:15.960> of

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
intersect with each other and it kind of

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.120 
intersect with each other and it kind of
like<00:05:16.259> when<00:05:16.440> you're<00:05:16.590> thinking<00:05:16.919> about<00:05:16.979> watching

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
like when you're thinking about watching

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.920 
like when you're thinking about watching
the<00:05:17.460> movie<00:05:17.759> so<00:05:17.940> I<00:05:18.060> like<00:05:18.330> all<00:05:18.509> three<00:05:18.720> versions

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
the movie so I like all three versions

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.909 
the movie so I like all three versions
and<00:05:19.410> um<00:05:20.960> it's<00:05:21.960> hard<00:05:22.169> to<00:05:22.289> decide<00:05:22.530> which<00:05:22.710> one<00:05:22.889> to

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
and um it's hard to decide which one to

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.560 
and um it's hard to decide which one to
watch<00:05:23.070> some<00:05:23.310> time<00:05:23.460> so<00:05:23.639> I<00:05:23.699> usually<00:05:24.270> pull<00:05:24.449> this

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
watch some time so I usually pull this

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.909 
watch some time so I usually pull this
out<00:05:24.750> and<00:05:24.780> start<00:05:25.260> looking<00:05:25.289> at<00:05:25.650> all<00:05:25.800> the

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
out and start looking at all the

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.129 
out and start looking at all the
differences<00:05:26.340> and<00:05:26.610> then<00:05:26.760> make<00:05:27.389> my<00:05:27.510> decision<00:05:27.960> I

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
differences and then make my decision I

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.570 
differences and then make my decision I
think<00:05:28.620> this<00:05:28.680> is<00:05:28.740> absolutely<00:05:29.159> amazing<00:05:29.340> they
