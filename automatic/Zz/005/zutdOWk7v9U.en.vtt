 in that sense electronic arts do politics 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.230
 and I see the time when little more searched for 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.030

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.300
 for it to be able to be closer quality of life then I was looking for a

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.449
 market 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:24.739
 to take the challenge 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.339
 to do is different 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:29.379
 a business if I had nothing to lose would be advisable 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:32.980
 they feel fascination like me 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.729

 they found it credible that the person who can change his life

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:00.439
 until when I had in the first client that they do the day of the putting to the 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.839
 sale is because I already had money from my pocket

 this showed the opportunity 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:15.429
 efe of being able to develop myself as an entrepreneur 

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:18.559
