00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.780
 Today I am going to teach you how to make a rich 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.670
 fritter the necessary ingredients 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:21.960
 about these is a kilo of flour a 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:26.400
 Can of condensed milk 6 eggs oil 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.619
 now I'm going to teach you how 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.390
 mix everything together with cooper he will be 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.390
 our flour on the table 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.000
 then let's put a teaspoon 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.000
 of anise 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.930
 I've already milled it 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.930
 a teaspoon of anise 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.780
 Anise is for flavor 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.449
 to the donuts 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.699
 then right now I'm going to mix it together 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.940
 with the anise as it is squeezed and dried 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.970
 flour 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.210
 and then we add the others 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.430
 the eggs are already 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.420
 let's add the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.420
 in the flour 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.890
 let's add the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.890
 condensed milk 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.700
 putting milk 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.470
 you do not put the sugar because if you do not 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.680
 they will take the condensed milk if 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.690
 we would put sugar then we put 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.670
 a cup of oil 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.590
 a little half nothing more than the other 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.210
 half we leave it for 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.340
 use it right now what am I 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.299
 preparing everything stirring everything 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.299
 this is mixed together 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.740
 after it shows 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.920
 leaving our mass after 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.210
 leave to prepare them lasted ten minutes 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.910
 kneading to make the donuts 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.220
 good soft 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.980
 As you can see, it does not stick at all 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.980
 the table bring them all well 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.030
 It needs to be collected all together 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.080
 it was already nine miles away I did not have 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.080
 reason for these Masses 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.890
 and beyond is ready to use it 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:46.689
 to prepare us very less right now 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.689
 I'm going to tell you how to extend 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.549
 to start cutting the models we 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.730
 we started to spread out on the table 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.319
 then we enjoyed the table with a little 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.909
 oil 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.700
 my table has a crystal here so that 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.560
 do not stick 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.739
 easier to put the ball also will 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.110
 some oil and I roll him 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.240
 smeared oil 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.800
 on all sides and then grabbed the 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.790
 roll on both sides 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.790
 growing 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.930
 until it is well extended 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.680
 for one side and for another 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.969
 very well what d 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.969
 comes this oblivion 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:44.060
 spreading little by little it does not 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.060
 despair one 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.640
 today 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.640
 being where thicker it is 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.209
 can see well extended 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.010
 and already once being extended the 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.820
 fritter 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.739
 and now I'm going to put it to heat 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:24.280
 we can fry it between oil 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.280
 i 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:31.759
 the lines are already going to 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.090
 and then we started to fry it 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.460
 to take me a right now I'm going to 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.460
 show how he picked it up and take them 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.849
 look I already have my case of the hot 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.959
 Lets put 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:56.599
 I'm going to add a liter of oil 

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:59.349
 It depends on the number of donuts that 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.349
 let's go do 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.480
 so they can be fried well they have to 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:08.750
 be well covered with enough oil 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.330
 and we let you heat the casserole well 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:16.840
 and the oil is already hot and 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.840
 then I start to throw the donuts 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.249
 let's start laughing let's put the 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.249
 casserole 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:32.030
 carlos a la zarzuela 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.030
 and the oil is already very warm 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.480
 let's start frying 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.770
 of 20 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.620
 I put it to do 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.070
 share with your family maybe a lot 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.460
 cheaper than buying the 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.460
 Very rich 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.530
 to turn them around look how easy I 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:10.280
 I have the fork in my hand and a little stick 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.280
 and with that it's very easy to flip it 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.380
 it depends how I want them one of golds to 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.380
 my preference I like golden brown 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.089
 how easy it is to turn them around 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.470
 and our very flight is staying 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.360
 our first the donut 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.940
 drain let's put it here on a 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.040
 strainer 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.740
 to drain well 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.200
 and then it's going to drain and after a while I'll 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.480
 accommodating in a tub with friends and 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.880
