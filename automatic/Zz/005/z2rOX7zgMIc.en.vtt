00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.929
 the guys 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.450
 What do you say, beauty guys? 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.580
 one more microsoft hate tone this time 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.240
 here guys are total with 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.170
 shadows the gls do not know what shaders I 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.650
 I think it's this 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.180
 beauty to see 1.5.2 along with optimal 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.179
 way I think a lot of people are looking for it 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.009
 this beauty mold it does not work very well 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.360
 here on my computer not on the computer 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.570
 it's kind of weak you can see how I fit 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.820
 team start is still disabled yet 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.070
 beauty leaves the asset there to show 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.440
 You, how 's the mod? 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.030
 so it adds shadows to the minecraft and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.129
 there are many versions 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.260
 You can leave him more cartridges to 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.899
 microsoft decided to put one here that i 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.460
 I think it's the one I like, I do not 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.020
 remember let me see that you can do it for yourself 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.309
 create your shadows in the rub so I 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.660
 I do not understand very well 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.250
 I think it 's that most people 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.689
 use beauty people look at this but kraft 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.970
 It looks very well done. 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.540
 while playing on the team here because 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.760
 very heavy imod my goal even is 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.950
 Just bring this door for you, do not talk. 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.509
 much about the way up because I do not 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.549
 I have knowledge about this mold 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.350
 beauty I know they are the shadows and 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.479
 leaves much more beautiful unicredit looks 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.610
 the opel in lacquered but I will not be able to 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.890

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.470
 people who charge on your computer and 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.450
 help a lot of you, beauty leaves you 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.490
 They exchange it here for you to see 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:45.170
 another way to expect it to load now 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:50.549
