00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:10.650
 Hello knit a group of posts 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:15.260
 of 2 nakida with one vertex 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:21.410
 and with one reason for these posts 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:25.699
 3 lifting loops knit do column 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:35.340
 nakid 2 2 nakida 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:40.320
 enter the key oh chick pull out two times 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:45.770
 times remove 2 loops for now one 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:51.030
 column in the same loop of the bottom row 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:54.960
 enter the hook and pull out twice 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:00.420
 we remove on 2 loop here already two 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:06.860
 column throw two times a third time 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:13.439
 too, we pull out the eyelet twice 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:18.150
 We remove here we already have 3 columns with two 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.210
 single base in them and now 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.740
 there will be one vertex 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.130
 three loops 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:32.970
 3 columns 4 loops here we already 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:37.049
 this column has turned out a group of columns 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:42.829
 with one base from one peak 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:46.820
 let them skip 2 loops 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.820
 further knit 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:02:04.100
 three loops throwing hooks 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.860
 the next group of vision 1 2 let's say 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.459
 in the third 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.680
 next group knit threw 2 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:20.709
 nakida hooked out 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:21.830
 one loop and 2 1 for 2 loop each 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.739
 we drag 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.230
 and not taking out the hook here 2 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:33.670
 loop do the following two nakida 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:41.620
 include insert in the same eyelet 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:46.120
 take out the bottom row remove 2 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:51.280
 stretch 2 has been turned 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:56.500
 the second column on our hook we already have 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:01.670
 two column hinges and leading eyelet 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:09.310
 throw another 2 2 nakida enter the hook 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:14.570
 again in this base we take out and 2 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:17.079
 tying 2 on hooks 3 loops 3 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:23.239
 column and loop 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:27.370
 leading through 3 5 river here 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:32.810
 already got an eye a group of columns of 3 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:37.810
 set with apex 1 and with one base 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:44.209
 now about them after 2 loops 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:49.040
 knit further 1 2 3 air loops and 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:52.190
 knit in the next group of three 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.090
 double crochets with one 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:04:00.350
 tops and with one base 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:07.300
 threw 2 nakida 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:07.300
 and knit the next column in pairs 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:26.120
 knit crochet once here 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:31.190
 we knit 2 and 3 columns with a column 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:35.120
 you can knit a different number here 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.130
 one base and one vertex different 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.360
 the number of bars the more you 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:44.920
 crochet with two crochets in 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:51.280
 one foundation is so magnificent you will have 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:51.280
 column and knit in two 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.780
 under which columns further knit for these 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:05.870
 posts 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:11.500
 3 lifting loops we start out of three 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:20.780
 loops for how to column which 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:23.440
 glad from the posts 1 2 we take out and 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.440
 in pairs 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.440
 knit 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:40.060
 here is the first column here see the river 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.060
 the second column is knitted in pairs and 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:45.580
 third column 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:57.729
 pulling out the columns for one centimeter 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:00.009
 or one and a half centimeters and stretch 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:07.470
 through all three 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:12.160
 and then after two remaining such 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:17.979
 single top bollards 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:23.070
 and with one base 3 columns with two 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:23.070
 with two naikida all the best
