00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.369
 or we can do a magic trick that 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.500
 is going to have to do with the letters of 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.080
 tarot these letters a little weird that 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.750
 they use to guess the future 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.849
 Jonathan guessing a precision that I 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.099
 I have here I also have a book here 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.680
 a book of the great king that is a magician 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.860
 that was very famous in a previous era 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.050
 eighteen hundred and something in France that 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.690
 he was a little the creator of magic 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.450
 modern the first one who used this type 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.030
 of suits those of remembrance is a tailcoat 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.850
 of the modern magician because he sees how it 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.050
 the black people dressed at that time 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.430
 these are the confidences of a 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.590
 conjurer a book that you 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.330
 I recommend it is a story he does not have 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.310
 magic tricks but tells the story 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.520
 of this magician's skill made with 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.050
 an autobiography then here I have the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.510
 tarot deck or deck that has 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.489
 arcane has numbers has everything and 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.890
 we are going to use it so that 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.480
 find a page 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.160
 of the book a random page 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.380
 let's do that to see if this 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.750
 prediction that I have that matches the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.210
 page that comes out bashar and with the text 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.210
 what's in the first line happens but 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.860
 you have to think well the low 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.350
 and we are going to find it a very 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.180
 special look I'm going to cover the deck 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.320
 with this handkerchief 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.510
 and the viewer yourself to cut by 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.850
 here so you can not see it could 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.610
 be marked in some way that I 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.550
 could nothing do not want to hear anything you 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.130
 you're going to cut a little bit like that and then 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.830
 lift you'll pick up the cards that there 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.720
 here in the cut but of course as you do not 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.390
 are you also this moment let's say that 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.229
 I'm going to do it, I'll put it here and 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.240
 let's cut the deck we cut a 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.550
 emotional package around here and those that 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.490
 they want me to serve these two 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.130
 for 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.350
 the experiment that we are going to do is a 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.810
 very easy experiment 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.709
 that you can learn and deceive everyone 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.709
 your friends look 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:23.080
 from 5 and 9 of gold 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:27.410
 what do you prefer 5 and 9 or 95 in the book 95 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.850
 perfect 9 and 5 then now let's 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.850
 search page 95 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.920
 the mind page 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.510
 and the first lines of the text I hope 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.750
 that match the prediction that 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.320
 we have 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.350
 here says magic circles words 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:52.290
 elementals and suddenly in the middle of the most 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.290
 Deep silence and follow the text 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.959
 just in case you want to review it 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.870
 my review that says magic circles 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.880
 sacramental words and suddenly in 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.880
 half of the deepest silence 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.320
 thanks to this candle the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.980
 spirit of light and its that you chosen in 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.440
 page 95 you could have chosen the 59 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.980
 and the 59 of course there would have been 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.990
 another text 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.740
 59 I would have said 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:32.010
 59 when torrini called antonio that 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.810
 left abruptly against the text 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.810
 but luckily you have chosen 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.620
 and this mystery we solve in a 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.190
 moment 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.190
 see you later 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.370
 for the explanation of this experiment 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.050
 you need to have a book can be 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.310
 anyone in this case is a book that 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.200
 it has to do with the image because that 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.990
 I bet you step represents a little 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.600
 Robert's story of you also have a 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.040
 about this type of envelope is not better 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.459
 better is the one that opens up 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.400
 because because this card has two 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.560
 texts have from page 25 and in the 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.690
 page 59 depends on which you choose the 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.720
 spectator you take from one side or the 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.050
 another then if this is stuck in here 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.050
 inside 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.979
 imagine that he takes out page 95 only 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:29.310
 He talks like that and he took it like that because I know that 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:32.340
 I was 95 but if the viewer had 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.370
 said page 59 what he would have done 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.530
 is to open the envelope and take out the precision 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.500
 from this side I will never show this 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.780
 that's why when you put it like that you 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.889
 you have to have the audience in front of you 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.449
 if you start reading here 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:51.660
 if you see this part it's about something like that 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:55.320
 so you do not see the back 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.660
 now you also have to force the page 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.490
 of the complicated book not so much because 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.050
 this is a very simple method we are going to 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.660
 make the viewer choose states 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.730
 letter on how with this system 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.760
 you can mix all the bottom part 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.950
 of the deck leaving the two cards on 5 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.950
 and 9 on the fringe 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.530
 then have me a little bit like that without 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.990
 the cards fall and then put 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.280
 the panel above but I have here this 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.580
 handkerchief that will serve to explain 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.830
 how the how the alarm is done what 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.710
 what he thinks he's going to do is this we put 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.230
 to put it on cut a piece and take out 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.490
 the letters you have but of course those are not 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.380
 they are the letters that we want 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.200
 we want you to take the letters from above 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.910
 for that when I am for the handkerchief 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.220
 with the handkerchief here what I do is 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.630
 flip the whole dough 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.370
 leave face up 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.470
 it looks is not 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.860
 to be up here when the viewer 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.680
 court lifts up here me when lifts 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.180
 I turn over the package and he will take 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.910
 two letters that were formerly 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:01.449
 up I do not go out that way you know it's 5 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.370
 and the dead when the viewer puts the 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:04.780
 hand below the cloth I have it 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.060
 to take your hand here as I do I 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.169
 he just put his hand out and leaves the cards but 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.939
 the viewer raises like this 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.979
 put your hand underneath the handkerchief 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.950
 similar and take the two cards there 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.410
 above 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.080
 when I'm going to lower this what you do 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:23.800
 flip the package and when I pull out I flip 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.410
 everything again then without a handkerchief 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.330
 viewer raises this when I 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.630
 neither in the handkerchief did I turn the deck 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.240
 the spectator lifts again flip 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.870
 take the next two letters that 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.870
 they would be these 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.020
 and when the viewer goes down it 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.240
 Flip again and left the deck here 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.730
 when I took out the handkerchief I come back for the 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.160
 shuffle in your position like all this 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:51.140
 under this pattern this is for the opaque and 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.940
 pretty big so there's no 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.820
 moment that you see that the goal the hand and 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.520
 but you can not see the resolution and 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:01.130
 when you have already chosen the two 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.320
 letters is very easy you say of the two 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:06.050
 possibilities can be five and nine the 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.730
 95 that creates the illusion that the 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.350
 viewer he chose could and if there 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.000
 chosen the other the paper had not 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.350
 coincided why not spend the spectrum 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.780
 They know that we have both possibilities 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:19.090
 one and another in two and this is the game 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:23.550
 a candle because you can light your house 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.550
 so practicing and having fun
