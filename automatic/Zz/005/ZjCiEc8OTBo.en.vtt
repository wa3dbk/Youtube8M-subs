00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:30.599
 Boo woo oooo 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.599
 So lure 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:42.750
 The champion has been put in that north small city type Arti already and that much 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:47.420
 Now that we have always done in the champion goal of Chanpon from the opening round of that now 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.420
 I am very happy to be able to win the champion 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:59.130
 Well now it's now at the tournament that Kyushu collected 83 points of teeth and managed to collect it 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:05.340
 That way to take the champion in this time 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:09.120
 Well, I got a little bad condition and I pushed my bag 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:13.350
 Jun got worse by having that fall, too 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:16.409
 Than it was caught Ano champion'm really glad of 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.499
 That this time 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.909
 I'm really happy to jump with the pr key 

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:25.040
 It's still though is that next year I'm still not decided properly and clearly 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.270
 Oh dear 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:33.650
 Wherever I run I will only try my best 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.360
 That one step towards that dream Kitaura Kazuano 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:41.240
 I'm doing my best 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:46.070
 I will work hard one by one from now on aiming for a rider that many people can see 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.080
 I 'm thinking of trying my best, well, I was able to win a winning champion this time 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.790
 But 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.810
 Of course I want to win that champion ia 1 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.920
 More in the world 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:03.040
 I also want to run with the riders in that world 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:07.030
 That to be able to compete with them 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:11.860
 That since the target has seen there until there 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.819
 I'm trying to do my best to have a good battle with them someday 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.819
 Ha
