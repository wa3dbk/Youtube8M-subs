00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
that's pretty much from the defuser when

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.940 
that's pretty much from the defuser when
my<00:04:24.750> hair<00:04:24.900> was<00:04:24.930> still<00:04:25.200> wet<00:04:25.440> everything<00:04:25.830> was

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
my hair was still wet everything was

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.820 
my hair was still wet everything was
uniform<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:27.020> spirally<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:28.170> stuff<00:04:28.410> but<00:04:28.530> I<00:04:28.620> did

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
uniform and spirally and stuff but I did

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.410 
uniform and spirally and stuff but I did
diffuse<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.520> I<00:04:29.610> did<00:04:29.760> shake<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.150> out<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.390> then

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
diffuse and I did shake it out and then

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.660 
diffuse and I did shake it out and then
I<00:04:30.510> did<00:04:30.840> like<00:04:31.110> freestyle<00:04:31.740> blow-dry<00:04:32.160> around

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
I did like freestyle blow-dry around

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.910 
I did like freestyle blow-dry around
just<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.090> make<00:04:33.210> it<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.360> little<00:04:33.480> bigger<00:04:33.690> so<00:04:33.990> yeah

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
just to make it a little bigger so yeah

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.040 
just to make it a little bigger so yeah
if<00:04:35.280> I<00:04:35.430> didn't<00:04:35.760> blow<00:04:35.880> dry<00:04:36.090> it<00:04:36.120> wouldn't<00:04:36.540> be<00:04:36.720> I

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
if I didn't blow dry it wouldn't be I

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.550 
if I didn't blow dry it wouldn't be I
wouldn't<00:04:37.290> have<00:04:37.620> any<00:04:37.890> frizz<00:04:38.310> it<00:04:38.460> off<00:04:38.610> so<00:04:39.570> like

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
wouldn't have any frizz it off so like

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.620 
wouldn't have any frizz it off so like
the<00:04:40.680> protein<00:04:41.010> treatment<00:04:41.400> was<00:04:41.520> legit<00:04:41.880> and<00:04:42.450> it

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
the protein treatment was legit and it

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.910 
the protein treatment was legit and it
was<00:04:42.720> cool<00:04:42.960> and<00:04:43.610> it<00:04:44.610> helped<00:04:45.600> my<00:04:45.780> hair<00:04:45.990> a<00:04:46.140> lot<00:04:46.350> so

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
was cool and it helped my hair a lot so

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.860 
was cool and it helped my hair a lot so
I<00:04:47.540> think<00:04:49.820> it<00:04:50.820> can<00:04:51.030> only<00:04:51.120> get<00:04:51.390> better<00:04:51.450> from<00:04:51.690> here

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
I think it can only get better from here

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.780 
I think it can only get better from here
because<00:04:52.440> you're<00:04:52.590> not<00:04:52.710> really<00:04:52.980> so<00:04:53.250> post<00:04:53.550> like

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
because you're not really so post like

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.670 
because you're not really so post like
you<00:04:53.910> don't<00:04:54.120> it<00:04:54.750> claims<00:04:55.200> that<00:04:55.320> you<00:04:55.440> don't

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
you don't it claims that you don't

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.620 
you don't it claims that you don't
really<00:04:55.860> see<00:04:56.190> full<00:04:56.550> results<00:04:56.730> from<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.300> protein

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
really see full results from the protein

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.140 
really see full results from the protein
treatment<00:04:58.050> until<00:04:58.290> after<00:04:58.620> six<00:04:58.830> weeks<00:04:59.150> it's

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
treatment until after six weeks it's

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.410 
treatment until after six weeks it's
only<00:05:00.360> been<00:05:00.750> about<00:05:00.810> an<00:05:01.320> hour<00:05:01.470> and<00:05:02.040> I<00:05:02.610> see<00:05:03.000> like

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
only been about an hour and I see like

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.810 
only been about an hour and I see like
legit<00:05:04.050> results<00:05:04.530> already<00:05:04.680> so<00:05:05.250> I<00:05:05.400> can<00:05:05.640> only

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
legit results already so I can only

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.190 
legit results already so I can only
imagine<00:05:05.970> what<00:05:06.450> it's<00:05:06.570> going<00:05:06.600> to<00:05:06.720> look<00:05:06.780> like<00:05:06.870> in

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
imagine what it's going to look like in

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.860 
imagine what it's going to look like in
six<00:05:07.830> weeks<00:05:08.040> so<00:05:08.370> maybe<00:05:08.910> my<00:05:09.180> damage<00:05:09.720> will<00:05:09.840> be

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
six weeks so maybe my damage will be

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.950 
six weeks so maybe my damage will be
gone<00:05:10.140> by<00:05:10.320> that<00:05:10.350> and<00:05:10.560> I<00:05:10.650> don't<00:05:10.830> know<00:05:10.890> um<00:05:11.960> but
