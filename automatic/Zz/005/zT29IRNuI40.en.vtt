00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
obviously it's going to be difficult to

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.889 
obviously it's going to be difficult to

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.660 
step up and I think that we have a good
group<00:01:46.929> of<00:01:47.140> guards<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:47.649> that<00:01:48.250> can<00:01:48.369> put<00:01:48.550> up

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
group of guards that that can put up

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.370 
group of guards that that can put up
some<00:01:48.880> numbers<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.479> they<00:01:49.690> can<00:01:49.840> do<00:01:49.960> some<00:01:50.140> things

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
some numbers and they can do some things

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.469 
some numbers and they can do some things
also<00:01:50.860> do<00:01:51.700> you<00:01:51.789> think<00:01:51.909> it's<00:01:52.000> gonna<00:01:52.090> make<00:01:52.300> it<00:01:52.330> a

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
also do you think it's gonna make it a

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.270 
also do you think it's gonna make it a
little<00:01:52.600> bit<00:01:52.840> easier<00:01:53.200> this<00:01:53.409> year<00:01:53.470> as<00:01:53.890> you<00:01:53.920> guys

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
little bit easier this year as you guys

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.430 
little bit easier this year as you guys
are<00:01:54.610> I<00:01:54.640> won't<00:01:54.970> say<00:01:55.090> rebuilding<00:01:55.630> but<00:01:55.840> retooling

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
are I won't say rebuilding but retooling

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.889 
are I won't say rebuilding but retooling
that<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.460> Big<00:01:57.610> East<00:01:57.759> isn't<00:01:58.300> gonna<00:01:58.539> be<00:01:58.720> nearly

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
that the Big East isn't gonna be nearly

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.630 
that the Big East isn't gonna be nearly
as<00:01:59.080> strong<00:01:59.200> as<00:01:59.319> it<00:01:59.530> was<00:01:59.649> last<00:01:59.860> year<00:02:00.190> when<00:02:00.399> I

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
as strong as it was last year when I

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.730 
as strong as it was last year when I
mean<00:02:00.970> you<00:02:01.119> at<00:02:01.539> one<00:02:01.720> point<00:02:01.750> could<00:02:02.289> see<00:02:02.470> as<00:02:02.590> much

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
mean you at one point could see as much

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.440 
mean you at one point could see as much
as<00:02:02.920> 10<00:02:03.159> teams<00:02:03.490> or<00:02:03.729> 11<00:02:04.030> teams<00:02:04.179> make<00:02:04.360> the

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
as 10 teams or 11 teams make the

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.090 
as 10 teams or 11 teams make the
n-c-double-a<00:02:04.929> tournament<00:02:04.960> where<00:02:05.710> this<00:02:05.830> year

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
n-c-double-a tournament where this year

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.290 
n-c-double-a tournament where this year
a<00:02:06.130> lot<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.460> guys<00:02:06.550> graduated<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.209> went

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
a lot of the guys graduated and went

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.729 
a lot of the guys graduated and went
early<00:02:07.539> to<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:07.690> draft<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.440> think<00:02:08.590> it's<00:02:08.709> a

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
early to the draft you think it's a

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.080 
early to the draft you think it's a
little<00:02:08.920> bit<00:02:09.009> easier<00:02:09.099> that<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.670> Big<00:02:09.819> East<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:10.060> a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
little bit easier that the Big East is a

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.729 
little bit easier that the Big East is a
little<00:02:10.270> bit<00:02:10.360> down<00:02:10.509> this<00:02:10.660> year<00:02:10.899> I<00:02:11.050> don't<00:02:11.560> think

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
little bit down this year I don't think

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.360 
little bit down this year I don't think
we're<00:02:11.980> gonna<00:02:12.160> be<00:02:12.280> down<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:12.520> think<00:02:12.819> everyone<00:02:13.420> has

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
we're gonna be down I think everyone has

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.530 
we're gonna be down I think everyone has
