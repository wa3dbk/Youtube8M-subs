00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello friends in this tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.060
 teach how to make a pillow in the form of 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.379
 pig to decorate your room 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.540
 we need the pink pola a 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.840
 little bit darker two little circles 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.790
 black scissors and hot silicone 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.369
 we started by drawing an oval on 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.949
 our fabric is going to be the head of 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.840
 pig if they do not get this fleece 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.630
 Can use any other fabric 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.680
 pink that they have managed to draw 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.010
 the little ears 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.290
 we try to stay the same we start 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.090
 to cut you do not need to leave much 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.090
 edge since we're going to use silicon 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.400
 to join them 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.170
 place the two eyes on the fabric and 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.870
 let's calculate the size that goes to 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.239
 have our piggy nose once 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.370
 that you have it, you are going to cut it and go to 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.570
 place it to make sure that there is 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.030
 left of the right size 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.510
 let's cut out the little ears you have to 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.179
 cut 2 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.420
 We cut two bandages for the nose and 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:04.019
 a longer one for the sheet we started 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.210
 sticking our pig short strips 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.210
 so that the silicone is not going to dry 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.070
 At the end we leave a hole to put 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.070
 the filling that is not very large 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.549
 once it's dry we 're going to turn it 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.720
 when we have rotated it we will locate 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.720
 all the parts about the pig 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.200
 and we will begin to stick with 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.200
 hot silicone 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.250
 when the parties are already all in their 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.250
 place we're going to start stuffing the stuffing 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.700
 the filling that you consider necessary 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.439
 to paste the last part we are going to 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.500
 place the silicon on the part of 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.869
 spinning the fabric a bit and let's go 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.489
 to bring pressure to dry the 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:12.160
 silicon and that 's it, our pig is ready 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.780
 very easy and very fast to do I hope 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.940
