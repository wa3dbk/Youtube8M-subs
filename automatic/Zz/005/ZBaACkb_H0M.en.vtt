00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.110
 It is a metal vibe 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.110
 Yeah it This Is 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.620

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.850
 a 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.400
 It is the name of 15 Played 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.150
 Abbreviated t 1 blade 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:56.770
 This lure 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:01:00.130
 We will launch a brand new launcher and use this lever to actually set the Ranker in Seto 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.110
 I've given you a break 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.230

 Come and since they are already 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.380
 Well then , I'm thinking that I just want to explain orchids for the tackle I used this time 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.860
 However 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.479
 It is Mar to say that Well First Well Dakkuru 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:34.510
 We are using say t 1 Purendo that will explain such a little while ago 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:41.820
 The line uses something rather heavy 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:47.010
 Root takes to become and I would be a waste now leader of the line is 7 lbs 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.550
 I use 8 pounds, so by this head 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.610
 In this 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.600
 Now it is 6 using the p line 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.930
 I use 0.65 It is Awa Negin tool Yes 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.880
 so 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.610
 I'm a rod but I use it without Matilda 7 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.830
 Oh, it is net now 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:12.100
 This it is what state telescopic the is shortened Yes 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:17.950
 Approximately 6 feet in the short state 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:20.040
 7 inches'll stretch in the Well Is about the second half of the roots and tightly 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.360
 Chau okay if 7ft 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.610

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.240

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.380

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.980
 large 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:52.840
 If you say you want to make it a shorter pitch, you can shrink it. 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:58.190
 While high on short pitch here 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:00.130
