turkey meat is not done this is not the

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.780 
turkey meat is not done this is not the
case<00:02:14.330> here<00:02:14.440> but<00:02:15.440> if<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.740> find<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.220> lot<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.430> red

whole turkey wrap it up in foil and pop

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.490 
whole turkey wrap it up in foil and pop
it<00:02:22.790> back<00:02:22.820> in<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.240> oven<00:02:23.420> for<00:02:23.720> just<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.290> few

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
it back in the oven for just a few

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.320 
it back in the oven for just a few
minutes<00:02:24.890> once<00:02:25.400> it's<00:02:25.610> off<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.940> bone<00:02:26.090> it's

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
minutes once it's off the bone it's

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.760 
minutes once it's off the bone it's
going<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.510> heat<00:02:26.690> up<00:02:26.720> really<00:02:26.870> quickly<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:27.530> it

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
going to heat up really quickly and it

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.860 
going to heat up really quickly and it
will<00:02:27.860> finish<00:02:28.190> cooking<00:02:28.430> in<00:02:28.730> no<00:02:28.910> time<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:29.630> don't

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
will finish cooking in no time so don't

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.250 
will finish cooking in no time so don't
worry<00:02:31.360> when<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.450> go<00:02:32.570> to<00:02:32.630> cut<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.990> breast

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
worry when you go to cut the breast

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.170 
worry when you go to cut the breast
there<00:02:33.530> are<00:02:33.650> two<00:02:33.890> ways<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.130> do<00:02:34.490> it<00:02:34.520> and<00:02:34.850> I<00:02:34.940> like

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
there are two ways to do it and I like

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.660 
there are two ways to do it and I like
to<00:02:35.360> do<00:02:35.510> half<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.200> half<00:02:36.230> on<00:02:36.709> one<00:02:36.770> side<00:02:37.640> I

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
to do half and a half on one side I

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.300 
to do half and a half on one side I
carve<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.270> in<00:02:38.390> very<00:02:38.750> thin<00:02:38.870> slices<00:02:39.590> directly

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
carve it in very thin slices directly

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.490 
carve it in very thin slices directly
from<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.640> bone<00:02:40.850> on<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.510> other<00:02:41.720> side<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.170> take

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
from the bone on the other side I take

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.830 
from the bone on the other side I take
the<00:02:42.680> entire<00:02:43.040> breast<00:02:43.550> off<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.090> cut<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.720> in

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
the entire breast off and cut it in

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.710 
the entire breast off and cut it in
thicker<00:02:45.200> slices<00:02:45.650> horizontally<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:47.510> let's

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
thicker slices horizontally so let's

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.110 
thicker slices horizontally so let's
just<00:02:47.959> see<00:02:48.170> how<00:02:48.350> that<00:02:48.380> works<00:02:48.830> so<00:02:49.190> let's<00:02:49.910> have<00:02:50.060> a

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
just see how that works so let's have a

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.300 
just see how that works so let's have a
look<00:02:50.300> at<00:02:50.450> this<00:02:50.630> side<00:02:50.959> I'm<00:02:51.830> usually<00:02:52.010> going<00:02:52.220> to

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
look at this side I'm usually going to

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.640 
look at this side I'm usually going to
use<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:52.520> filleting<00:02:53.180> knife<00:02:53.390> which<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:53.959> very

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
use a filleting knife which is very

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.610 
use a filleting knife which is very
narrow<00:02:55.160> very<00:02:55.910> narrow<00:02:56.300> very<00:02:56.570> long<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.290> kind<00:02:57.500> of

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
narrow very narrow very long and kind of

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.449 
narrow very narrow very long and kind of
flexible<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.840> it's<00:02:59.840> sharp<00:03:00.200> that's<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:01.160> key

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
flexible and it's sharp that's the key

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.970 
flexible and it's sharp that's the key
to<00:03:02.150> make<00:03:02.330> thin<00:03:02.690> slices<00:03:02.720> I'm<00:03:03.560> just<00:03:03.770> going<00:03:03.920> to

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
to make thin slices I'm just going to

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.960 
to make thin slices I'm just going to
start<00:03:04.250> slicing<00:03:05.320> just<00:03:06.320> like<00:03:06.590> this<00:03:06.800> parallel<00:03:07.340> to

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
start slicing just like this parallel to

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.130 
start slicing just like this parallel to
the<00:03:08.150> breastbone<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:12.970> love<00:03:13.970> those<00:03:14.420> thin<00:03:14.690> slices

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
the breastbone I love those thin slices

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.949 
the breastbone I love those thin slices
of<00:03:15.170> Turkey<00:03:16.060> these<00:03:17.060> make<00:03:17.299> for<00:03:17.330> great

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
of Turkey these make for great

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.449 
of Turkey these make for great
sandwiches<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.860> next<00:03:18.890> day<00:03:19.370> too<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:22.250> we'll

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
sandwiches the next day too so we'll

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.039 
sandwiches the next day too so we'll
finish<00:03:22.670> cutting<00:03:23.150> that<00:03:23.269> in<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:23.630> minute

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
finish cutting that in a minute

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.620

removed I'm just gonna use my thin knife
and<00:04:19.880> cut<00:04:20.479> it<00:04:20.600> into<00:04:20.750> slices<00:04:21.169> these<00:04:21.650> are<00:04:21.799> about
