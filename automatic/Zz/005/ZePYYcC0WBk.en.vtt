 that work almost always in sales is 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.009

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.649
 discuss analyze and sometimes a 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.689
 impediment to generalize but this

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.520
 at a high price to be able to give a 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.390
 discount almost always starts with the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.369
 Lowest 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.469
 thinking that it will facilitate 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.560
 sale and it's like life if one asks for more 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:11.799
 he has room to negotiate and withdraw 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.590
 a little if you ask for the minimum necessary already 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.190
 there is no where to be for why he asks 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.150
 plus 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:24.680

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.140
 pose if you are not convinced of 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.600
 your thoughts if you do not believe in what 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.640

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.260
 that thought that you do not believe in what 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.330
 you say that you are not truly 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.540
 involved and engaged in this 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.180
 secret 3 the great power is in your mind 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.720
 is in the attitude in your way of seeing you 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:54.380
 how they see you they treat you like you leave 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.450
 to treat is about 4 knowledge for 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.340
 negotiate if you need to have many 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.770
 knowledge that the 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.230
 competition how much are you worth my 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.200
 costs when the other one needs it 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.970
 is in a gene better knowledge we 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.460
 allows us to move our 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.870
 negotiation variables with much more 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.530
 people 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.810
 secret number 5 do not create all the garbage 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.690
 that they are going to tell you in the world of 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.239
 negotiations and in the world of the people 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.340
 the way we do that people 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.379
 move towards where we want is giving the 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.379
 information that sometimes is not as accurate 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.599
 nor correct therefore a good 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.120
 negotiator is skeptical in the 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:38.120
 negotiation good information good 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.280
 decision bad information bad decision 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.750
 and do not create all the garbage that you are going to 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.299
 say there are many things that are 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.200
 saying simply to demerit your 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.849
 product that mentar of offer so that 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.420
 press and you do not have my case that the 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.420
 processes 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.400
 to search 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.100
 for the concept of negotiation is unique 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.139
 is for people who want not to go 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.360
 the roads that are already doing 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:35.590
 new roads and therefore has 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.870
 thoughts different than normal 6 the 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.990
 time management the final thing is 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.180
 momentary that today I told you that if it is not 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.440
 that I'm always going to say yes 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.180
 today I told you that no 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.389
 it's not that I'm always going to tell you that 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.660
 when you see an ad on TV 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:55.000
 now they say good this advertising is 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.880
 valid until the next few days to vote 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.500
 existence and many times when you see that 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.360
 ad repeats repeats repeats 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.400
 another that has a deadline 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.340
 the deadline is important so that 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.190
 people move towards action but 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.229
 things change with what today was 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:15.430
 allowed tomorrow not necessarily 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:17.110
 allow 7 you have to give concessions 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.480
 so that the other feels important 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.270
 to give you satisfaction is not what 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.870
 important what you give but how you go 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.540
 the secret of price negotiation and 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.990
 in elements is to cry when you're 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.510
 giving or giving away if you give up easy 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.300
 another will think that it has no value or 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.210
 that you have a lot 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.940
 if you give away little and make it feel like 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.770
 very important what are you giving the 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.590
 another is going to evaluate and it's not going to pressure you 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:50.250
 more to give me more discount or better 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:54.000
 I try because I feel that I can not give 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:57.690
 plus the 8 important one works with the 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.330
 time in favor not against the one that has 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.780
 urgency always has to pay more no 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:06.050
 you press with the clock 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:09.230
 plan well to work on time and 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.940
 then you will not have when the other one already 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.669
 think that it will not reach two meters and 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.490
 you put the possibility is it is going to 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:20.510
 give our concessions 9 when already 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:23.570
 is closing the operation summarizes ponte 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.850
 agree the agreements and documentary or 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.700
 in the negotiations we see many 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:31.070
 many many possibilities proposals 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.320
 alternate paths and everyone stays 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.970
 with the idea of ​​what I speak and the 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.460
 problem is that in the end there has to be 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:40.730
 a landing in which the agreements were 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.120
 these and therefore these agreements 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:46.430
 we stay and operate and finally the good 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.290
 remember that you have the rights that 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.480
 it gives us assertiveness and those of being 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.000
 human in the world selling the first 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:56.270
 right is to be persistent to call 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.240
 again and again and again without being annoying 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.180
 but if they persist you have the right to 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.669
 to be human of being wrong 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.889
 always correct and do not mark that 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:09.039
 has a gift is a right to verify 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:11.889
 the information if you understand these you 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:17.820
 you will give respect will be firm in your 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:17.820
 decisions and you will do better business 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.510
 at the end of the negotiation program we 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.820
 look for a lot of taste 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:29.700
 a story about the one who 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:32.010
 he gains victory over the other is strong 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.650
 he who gains victory over himself 

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.270
 same is foolish two fingers that 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.950
 gets victory over another has 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.260
 proved that he is strong but he who 

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:43.260
 he gets victory over himself is 

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:45.570
 almighty to that victory before a 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:48.330
 rival of same conditions oneself 

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:51.720
 that knows you the tricks yourself that 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:54.060
 He knows how to defend oneself

 you know the strengths and weaknesses one 

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.720
 same 

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.650
 and all powerful nothing also does with a 

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.889
 little success 

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:03.319
