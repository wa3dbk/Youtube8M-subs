00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.320 
attack style a very few things have
changed<00:03:48.230> over<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.680> last<00:03:48.830> few<00:03:49.340> months<00:03:49.400> with<00:03:50.150> my

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
changed over the last few months with my

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.960 
changed over the last few months with my
attacking<00:03:50.900> other<00:03:51.140> than<00:03:51.380> trying<00:03:52.070> to<00:03:52.220> adapt<00:03:52.610> to

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
attacking other than trying to adapt to

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.720 
attacking other than trying to adapt to
the<00:03:53.210> style<00:03:53.750> of<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.080> outside<00:03:54.500> mortar<00:03:54.980> changing

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
the style of the outside mortar changing

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.730 
the style of the outside mortar changing
that<00:03:55.850> Leroy<00:03:56.210> L<00:03:56.360> lure<00:03:56.600> a<00:03:56.690> little<00:03:57.050> bit<00:03:57.200> carrying

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
that Leroy L lure a little bit carrying

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.280 
that Leroy L lure a little bit carrying
hog<00:03:57.980> riders<00:03:58.400> other<00:03:58.970> than<00:03:59.360> that<00:03:59.570> I'd<00:03:59.840> say<00:04:00.080> that

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
hog riders other than that I'd say that

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.690 
hog riders other than that I'd say that
my<00:04:00.440> attacking<00:04:00.920> style<00:04:01.100> has<00:04:01.310> been<00:04:01.340> pretty

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
my attacking style has been pretty

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.280 
my attacking style has been pretty
consistent<00:04:01.850> for<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.600> last<00:04:02.780> several<00:04:03.020> months

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
consistent for the last several months

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.050 
consistent for the last several months
and<00:04:03.620> I<00:04:04.100> think<00:04:04.280> that<00:04:04.400> that's<00:04:04.490> probably<00:04:04.730> one<00:04:05.030> of

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
and I think that that's probably one of

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.630 
and I think that that's probably one of
the<00:04:05.210> keys<00:04:05.450> to<00:04:05.810> achieving<00:04:06.290> either<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.100> high

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
the keys to achieving either a high

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.700 
the keys to achieving either a high
trophy<00:04:08.120> count<00:04:08.360> or<00:04:08.570> a<00:04:08.600> high<00:04:08.810> farming<00:04:09.290> record

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
trophy count or a high farming record

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.830 
trophy count or a high farming record
and<00:04:09.890> that<00:04:10.430> is<00:04:10.670> being<00:04:11.060> comfortable<00:04:11.570> with<00:04:11.630> an

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
and that is being comfortable with an

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.780 
and that is being comfortable with an
attack<00:04:12.140> that<00:04:12.170> you<00:04:12.500> can<00:04:12.680> consistently<00:04:13.520> win

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
attack that you can consistently win

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.140 
attack that you can consistently win
with<00:04:14.000> over<00:04:14.510> and<00:04:14.720> over<00:04:14.900> and<00:04:15.200> over<00:04:15.880> now<00:04:16.880> that's

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
with over and over and over now that's

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.690 
with over and over and over now that's
not<00:04:17.359> to<00:04:17.420> say<00:04:17.750> that<00:04:17.780> I<00:04:17.960> never<00:04:18.320> lost<00:04:18.710> i<00:04:19.160> would<00:04:19.430> say

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
not to say that I never lost i would say

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.420 
not to say that I never lost i would say
that<00:04:19.730> on<00:04:20.239> average<00:04:20.870> in<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:21.709> last<00:04:21.920> few<00:04:22.220> months

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
that on average in the last few months

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.390 
that on average in the last few months
I've<00:04:22.760> probably<00:04:23.090> lost<00:04:23.540> between<00:04:24.110> two<00:04:25.070> and<00:04:25.220> five

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
I've probably lost between two and five

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.850 
I've probably lost between two and five
percent<00:04:25.850> of<00:04:25.940> my<00:04:26.030> attacks<00:04:26.390> and<00:04:26.720> I<00:04:27.380> do<00:04:27.440> have<00:04:27.710> an

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
percent of my attacks and I do have an

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.860 
percent of my attacks and I do have an
attack<00:04:28.280> loss<00:04:28.520> to<00:04:28.820> share<00:04:29.090> in<00:04:29.330> an<00:04:29.720> upcoming

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870

episode<00:04:30.430> what<00:04:31.430> I'll<00:04:31.580> be<00:04:31.610> sharing<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.390> loss

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
episode what I'll be sharing the loss

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.350 
episode what I'll be sharing the loss
that<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:33.740> number<00:04:34.190> 18<00:04:34.460> player<00:04:34.700> had<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:35.090> get<00:04:35.240> me

that the number 18 player had to get me

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.500 
that the number 18 player had to get me

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
over 4,000 trophies the painful thing

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.290 
over 4,000 trophies the painful thing
about<00:04:38.690> losses<00:04:39.260> at<00:04:39.440> or<00:04:39.800> near<00:04:39.860> or<00:04:40.550> even<00:04:41.000> above

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
about losses at or near or even above

about losses at or near or even above
4,000<00:04:42.110> trophies<00:04:42.470> is<00:04:42.710> that<00:04:42.920> you're<00:04:43.100> talking

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
4,000 trophies is that you're talking

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.570 
4,000 trophies is that you're talking
about<00:04:43.760> hours<00:04:44.690> maybe<00:04:45.080> even<00:04:45.230> a<00:04:45.770> couple<00:04:46.220> of<00:04:46.280> days

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
about hours maybe even a couple of days

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.300 
about hours maybe even a couple of days
of<00:04:46.940> work<00:04:47.330> to<00:04:47.660> try<00:04:47.690> to<00:04:47.870> recover<00:04:48.260> those<00:04:48.950> losses

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
of work to try to recover those losses

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.590 
of work to try to recover those losses
and<00:04:50.770> here<00:04:51.770> we<00:04:51.950> see<00:04:52.160> a<00:04:52.190> really<00:04:52.670> big<00:04:52.760> win<00:04:53.180> I<00:04:53.210> think

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
and here we see a really big win I think

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.160 
and here we see a really big win I think
that<00:04:53.720> was<00:04:53.840> a<00:04:53.870> 38<00:04:54.620> or<00:04:54.980> 39<00:04:55.190> Cup<00:04:55.850> offer<00:04:56.150> i<00:04:56.570> would

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
that was a 38 or 39 Cup offer i would

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.840 
that was a 38 or 39 Cup offer i would
say<00:04:57.380> that<00:04:57.410> those<00:04:57.770> offers<00:04:58.310> were<00:04:58.520> probably

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
say that those offers were probably

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.590 
say that those offers were probably
showing<00:04:59.300> up<00:04:59.570> about<00:05:00.020> once<00:05:00.560> for<00:05:00.919> every<00:05:00.950> 20<00:05:01.910> to<00:05:02.150> 40

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
showing up about once for every 20 to 40

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.030 
showing up about once for every 20 to 40
hours<00:05:02.900> of<00:05:02.930> searching

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
hours of searching

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.250 
hours of searching
so<00:05:04.820> again<00:05:05.120> to<00:05:05.240> wrap<00:05:05.450> it<00:05:05.600> up<00:05:05.720> it<00:05:05.870> really<00:05:06.080> was

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
so again to wrap it up it really was

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.110 
so again to wrap it up it really was
just<00:05:06.530> a<00:05:06.710> matter<00:05:06.920> of<00:05:07.040> patience<00:05:07.610> and<00:05:07.760> a<00:05:07.880> waiting

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
just a matter of patience and a waiting

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.630 
just a matter of patience and a waiting
