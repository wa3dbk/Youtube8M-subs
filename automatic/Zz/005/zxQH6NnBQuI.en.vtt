00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
this next exercise is bent over reach

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.200 
this next exercise is bent over reach
for<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.530> sky<00:03:39.850> alternating<00:03:40.850> back<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:41.030> forth

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
for the sky alternating back and forth

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.060 
for the sky alternating back and forth
so<00:03:41.480> you're<00:03:41.600> gonna<00:03:41.690> be<00:03:41.870> bent<00:03:42.080> over<00:03:42.230> nice<00:03:42.740> flat

back stomachs tight

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.060 
back stomachs tight
I<00:03:44.450> think<00:03:44.960> about<00:03:45.050> engaging<00:03:45.410> your<00:03:45.620> glutes<00:03:45.890> and

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
go ahead and reach one arm as you rotate

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.510 
go ahead and reach one arm as you rotate
up<00:03:52.550> to<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.910> ceiling<00:03:53.300> keep<00:03:53.810> your<00:03:53.930> eyes<00:03:54.050> on<00:03:54.080> your

hands and then lower back down and
you're<00:03:57.140> going<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.350> repeat<00:03:57.590> other<00:03:57.830> side<00:03:58.160> of<00:03:58.670> the

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
you're going to repeat other side of the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.450 
you're going to repeat other side of the
rotate<00:03:59.740> back<00:04:00.740> down<00:04:01.010> you're<00:04:01.190> just<00:04:01.220> gonna

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
rotate back down you're just gonna

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.440 
rotate back down you're just gonna
repeat<00:04:01.820> back<00:04:02.240> and<00:04:02.480> forth<00:04:04.120> for<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.180> number<00:04:05.390> of

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
repeat back and forth for the number of

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.700 
repeat back and forth for the number of
repetitions<00:04:05.960> and<00:04:06.110> that's<00:04:06.230> in<00:04:06.350> your<00:04:06.470> results

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
repetitions and that's in your results

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.900 
repetitions and that's in your results
boosting<00:04:07.430> recovery<00:04:07.820> workout

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.300 

so<00:04:12.910> this<00:04:13.060> next<00:04:13.240> exercise<00:04:13.390> is<00:04:14.110> a<00:04:14.320> stretch<00:04:14.710> its

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
so this next exercise is a stretch its

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.160 
so this next exercise is a stretch its
going<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.460> stretch<00:04:15.520> your<00:04:15.910> hips<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.630> it's

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
going to stretch your hips and it's

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.569 
going to stretch your hips and it's
basically<00:04:17.500> called<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.860> 9090<00:04:18.280> because<00:04:18.489> you're

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
basically called the 9090 because you're

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.130 
basically called the 9090 because you're
gonna<00:04:18.670> see<00:04:18.850> a<00:04:18.880> 90-degree<00:04:19.329> angle<00:04:19.360> here<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:19.989> make

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
gonna see a 90-degree angle here to make

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.900 
gonna see a 90-degree angle here to make
a<00:04:20.230> degree<00:04:20.440> angle<00:04:20.769> here<00:04:20.980> so<00:04:21.250> what<00:04:21.700> you<00:04:21.760> want<00:04:21.880> to

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
a degree angle here so what you want to

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.880 
a degree angle here so what you want to
think<00:04:22.030> about<00:04:22.150> is<00:04:22.480> getting<00:04:23.230> yourself<00:04:23.590> up<00:04:23.770> and

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890

a lot out of it I really take the time
to<00:04:52.780> do<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.260> repetitions<00:04:54.100> that<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:54.310> laid<00:04:54.550> out

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
to do the repetitions that I laid out

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.730 
to do the repetitions that I laid out
for<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.300> increase<00:04:55.780> the<00:04:55.960> intensity<00:04:56.320> every

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
for you and increase the intensity every

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.320 
for you and increase the intensity every
time<00:04:56.980> that<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.280> repetitions<00:04:57.760> go<00:04:57.910> down<00:04:58.120> so

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
time that the repetitions go down so

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.310 
time that the repetitions go down so
you're<00:04:58.450> really<00:04:58.600> changing<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.140> weights

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
you're really changing the weights

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.840 
you're really changing the weights
really<00:04:59.710> putting<00:04:59.950> a<00:04:59.980> new<00:05:00.130> demand<00:05:00.430> on<00:05:00.550> your<00:05:00.670> body

and challenging yourself to something

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.420 
and challenging yourself to something
that<00:05:02.290> you're<00:05:02.620> not<00:05:02.710> used<00:05:02.919> to<00:05:03.130> so<00:05:03.250> that<00:05:03.370> your

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
body will change and at the end of that

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.290 
body will change and at the end of that
definitely<00:05:06.370> if<00:05:06.610> you<00:05:06.730> want<00:05:06.880> to<00:05:06.940> pick<00:05:07.060> up<00:05:07.150> the
