about the gameplay just having an

exciting gameplay in general it's the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.310 
exciting gameplay in general it's the
most<00:00:38.460> important<00:00:38.969> thing<00:00:39.210> regardless<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.140> what

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
most important thing regardless of what

gun it is now the ak-74 is not

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.350 
gun it is now the ak-74 is not
overpowered<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:43.950> my<00:00:44.100> mind<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:45.120> more

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
overpowered in my mind it's more

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.060 
overpowered in my mind it's more
powerful<00:00:45.539> than<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.170> other<00:00:46.289> submachine<00:00:46.829> guns

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
powerful than the other submachine guns

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.310 
powerful than the other submachine guns
but<00:00:47.250> when<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.460> compare<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.480> g11<00:00:48.750> or

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
but when you compare it to the g11 or

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.240 
but when you compare it to the g11 or
the<00:00:49.440> famas<00:00:50.090> it<00:00:51.090> doesn't<00:00:51.480> beat<00:00:51.629> out<00:00:51.780> those<00:00:51.960> guns

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
the famas it doesn't beat out those guns

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.770 
the famas it doesn't beat out those guns
it's<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.550> when<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.760> compare<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
it's just when you compare it to the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.520 
it's just when you compare it to the
spectre<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.070> Uzi<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.149> Uzis<00:00:57.690> got<00:00:57.930> awful<00:00:58.379> by

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
spectre the Uzi and Uzis got awful by

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.840 
spectre the Uzi and Uzis got awful by
the<00:00:58.590> way<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.190> those<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.550> who<00:00:59.699> haven't

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the way for those of you who haven't

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.900 
the way for those of you who haven't
tried<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.359> yet<00:01:00.420> don't<00:01:01.579> but<00:01:02.579> when<00:01:02.699> you

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
tried it out yet don't but when you

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.369 
tried it out yet don't but when you
compare<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.390> other<00:01:03.510> some<00:01:03.719> machine<00:01:03.989> guns<00:01:04.199> yeah

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
compare to other some machine guns yeah

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.230 
compare to other some machine guns yeah
it<00:01:04.470> does<00:01:04.650> seem<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.949> little<00:01:05.100> overpowered<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:05.939> I

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
it does seem a little overpowered but I

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.570 
it does seem a little overpowered but I
don't<00:01:06.960> think<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.350> ridiculous<00:01:08.010> but<00:01:08.159> if

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580

warfare<00:04:31.350> 2<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.800> highs<00:04:32.130> were<00:04:32.640> a<00:04:32.670> lot<00:04:33.000> higher

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
warfare 2 the highs were a lot higher

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.050 
warfare 2 the highs were a lot higher
but<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.020> lows<00:04:34.290> were<00:04:34.320> so<00:04:34.770> much<00:04:34.920> lower<00:04:35.220> so<00:04:35.880> when

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
but the lows were so much lower so when

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.210 
but the lows were so much lower so when
you<00:04:36.180> were<00:04:36.300> happy<00:04:36.660> you<00:04:36.960> are<00:04:37.080> really<00:04:37.530> happy<00:04:38.100> when

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
you were happy you are really happy when

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.530 
you were happy you are really happy when
you<00:04:38.310> were<00:04:38.400> playing<00:04:38.520> modern<00:04:38.850> warfare<00:04:38.880> 2<00:04:39.330> but

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
you were playing modern warfare 2 but

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.570 
you were playing modern warfare 2 but
when<00:04:39.660> you<00:04:39.750> were<00:04:39.870> pissed<00:04:40.140> your<00:04:40.890> controller<00:04:41.340> was

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
when you were pissed your controller was

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.550 
when you were pissed your controller was
making<00:04:41.880> dents<00:04:42.090> in<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.390> wall<00:04:42.540> and<00:04:42.780> I<00:04:43.320> think

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
making dents in the wall and I think

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.130 
making dents in the wall and I think
that<00:04:43.770> basically<00:04:44.250> sums<00:04:44.550> up<00:04:44.790> how<00:04:44.940> i<00:04:44.970> feel<00:04:45.390> so

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
that basically sums up how i feel so

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.420 
that basically sums up how i feel so
that's<00:04:46.290> it<00:04:46.500> i<00:04:46.530> hope<00:04:46.650> you<00:04:46.920> enjoyed<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.280> video
