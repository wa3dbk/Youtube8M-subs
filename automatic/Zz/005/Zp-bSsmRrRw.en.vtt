00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
completely rebalanced but we also wanted

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
site I'm going to go in and I'm gonna go

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.120 
site I'm going to go in and I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.819> throw<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.480> laser<00:02:22.470> sight<00:02:22.770> on<00:02:22.800> it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
ahead and throw a laser sight on it

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.830 
ahead and throw a laser sight on it
which<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.310> going<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.640> make<00:02:23.850> me<00:02:24.360> quicker<00:02:24.660> to

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
which is going to make me quicker to

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.059 
which is going to make me quicker to
shoot<00:02:25.050> from<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.380> hip<00:02:25.410> it's<00:02:25.680> gonna<00:02:25.800> give<00:02:25.980> me<00:02:26.040> a

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
shoot from the hip it's gonna give me a

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.470 
shoot from the hip it's gonna give me a
better<00:02:26.160> accuracy<00:02:26.550> when<00:02:26.970> I'm<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.180> running

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
better accuracy when I'm just running

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.480 
better accuracy when I'm just running
and<00:02:27.630> gunning<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.990> then<00:02:28.920> I'm<00:02:29.010> gonna<00:02:29.190> throw<00:02:29.430> a

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
and gunning and then I'm gonna throw a

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.630 
and gunning and then I'm gonna throw a
new<00:02:30.360> Chinese<00:02:30.930> suppressor<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.770> as<00:02:32.280> well

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
new Chinese suppressor on it as well

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.400 
new Chinese suppressor on it as well
which<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.360> gonna<00:02:33.480> hide<00:02:33.720> me<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.080> mini-map

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
which is gonna hide me on the mini-map

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.809 
which is gonna hide me on the mini-map
and<00:02:34.709> that's<00:02:34.920> going<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.160> make<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.400> harder<00:02:35.670> for

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
and that's going to make it harder for

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.240 
and that's going to make it harder for
my<00:02:35.970> close<00:02:36.630> range<00:02:37.050> enemies<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.650> find<00:02:37.860> me<00:02:38.069> and

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
my close range enemies to find me and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.670 
my close range enemies to find me and
shoot<00:02:38.400> back<00:02:38.580> at<00:02:38.790> me<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.319> finally<00:02:40.319> I'm<00:02:40.500> gonna

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
shoot back at me and finally I'm gonna

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.290 
shoot back at me and finally I'm gonna
throw<00:02:40.860> one<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:41.069> our<00:02:41.160> new<00:02:41.280> grips<00:02:41.520> on<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.910> I'm

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
throw one of our new grips on it I'm

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.180 
throw one of our new grips on it I'm
gonna<00:02:42.420> go<00:02:42.630> ahead<00:02:42.750> with<00:02:43.050> an<00:02:43.170> Ergo<00:02:43.500> grip<00:02:43.530> and

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
gonna go ahead with an Ergo grip and

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.250 
gonna go ahead with an Ergo grip and
this<00:02:44.400> makes<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.850> easier<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.959> more<00:02:46.080> accurate

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
this makes it easier and more accurate

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.990 
this makes it easier and more accurate
both<00:02:46.800> when<00:02:47.040> I'm<00:02:47.160> aimed<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.700> when<00:02:47.790> I'm<00:02:47.850> not

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
both when I'm aimed and when I'm not

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:58.340 
both when I'm aimed and when I'm not
aimed<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.810> shoot<00:02:48.990> on<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.230> move

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.600 

every<00:02:59.350> gun<00:02:59.500> has<00:02:59.709> its<00:02:59.860> strengths<00:03:00.190> but

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
every gun has its strengths but

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.190 
every gun has its strengths but
customization<00:03:01.330> really<00:03:01.569> lets<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:01.840> push<00:03:02.050> it

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
customization really lets you push it

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.280 
customization really lets you push it
more<00:03:02.500> long<00:03:02.980> or<00:03:03.340> close<00:03:03.610> or<00:03:03.940> accurate<00:03:04.510> or<00:03:04.810> more

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
more long or close or accurate or more

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.380 
more long or close or accurate or more
mobility<00:03:05.770> so<00:03:06.310> let's<00:03:06.730> run<00:03:06.880> through<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.150> long

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
mobility so let's run through a long

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.570 
mobility so let's run through a long
range<00:03:07.630> set<00:03:07.900> up<00:03:08.020> on<00:03:08.200> on<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.890> same<00:03:09.069> weapon

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
range set up on on that same weapon

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.390 
range set up on on that same weapon
the<00:03:09.730> qbz<00:03:10.150> 951<00:03:10.840> are<00:03:11.110> chinese<00:03:11.530> rifle<00:03:11.920> for<00:03:12.280> the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
the qbz 951 are chinese rifle for the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.530 
the qbz 951 are chinese rifle for the
first<00:03:12.610> thing<00:03:12.790> we<00:03:12.910> want<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.270> bit<00:03:13.390> more

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
first thing we want is a bit more

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.020 
first thing we want is a bit more
optical<00:03:13.900> zoom<00:03:14.050> so<00:03:14.650> let's<00:03:14.830> take<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.190> jgm<00:03:15.670> 4

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
optical zoom so let's take the jgm 4

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.420 
optical zoom so let's take the jgm 4
this<00:03:16.300> is<00:03:16.360> a<00:03:16.630> Chinese<00:03:17.020> Forex<00:03:17.470> sight<00:03:17.739> it's<00:03:18.280> going

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
this is a Chinese Forex sight it's going

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.760 
this is a Chinese Forex sight it's going
to<00:03:18.520> give<00:03:18.610> us<00:03:18.640> more<00:03:18.910> soon<00:03:19.120> we<00:03:19.540> also<00:03:19.720> want<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.200> in

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
to give us more soon we also want to in

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.590 
to give us more soon we also want to in
case<00:03:21.160> we<00:03:21.370> need<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.520> go<00:03:21.700> close<00:03:22.030> range

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
case we need to go close range

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.420 
case we need to go close range
we<00:03:22.900> have<00:03:22.989> canted<00:03:23.380> iron<00:03:23.560> sights<00:03:23.860> this<00:03:24.100> lets<00:03:24.310> me

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
we have canted iron sights this lets me

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.030 
we have canted iron sights this lets me
tilt<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.850> gun<00:03:25.030> 45<00:03:25.840> degrees<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.380> lose<00:03:26.830> all<00:03:27.010> my

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
tilt the gun 45 degrees I lose all my

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.070 
tilt the gun 45 degrees I lose all my
zoom<00:03:27.370> but<00:03:27.940> then<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.090> can<00:03:28.300> still<00:03:28.510> have<00:03:28.750> some

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
zoom but then I can still have some

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.199 
zoom but then I can still have some
mobility<00:03:29.319> at<00:03:29.770> close<00:03:29.980> range<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.489> course<00:03:31.000> a

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
mobility at close range of course a

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.270 
mobility at close range of course a
really<00:03:31.660> classic<00:03:31.989> you<00:03:32.560> want<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.800> put<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:32.980> heavy

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
really classic you want to put a heavy

barrel onto the weapon and one of the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.960 
barrel onto the weapon and one of the
things<00:03:35.709> that<00:03:35.860> you<00:03:35.950> can<00:03:36.100> see<00:03:36.280> with<00:03:36.519> each<00:03:36.670> one<00:03:36.850> of

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
things that you can see with each one of

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.790 
things that you can see with each one of
these<00:03:37.030> accessories<00:03:37.630> is<00:03:37.810> that<00:03:38.260> we<00:03:38.410> have<00:03:38.560> bars

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
these accessories is that we have bars

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.560 
these accessories is that we have bars
that<00:03:39.070> show<00:03:39.220> us<00:03:39.340> exactly<00:03:39.790> what<00:03:40.000> each<00:03:40.120> accessory

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
that show us exactly what each accessory

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.930 
that show us exactly what each accessory
does<00:03:40.870> so<00:03:41.350> it<00:03:41.470> might<00:03:41.620> change<00:03:41.890> our<00:03:42.100> range<00:03:42.430> our

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
does so it might change our range our

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.790 
does so it might change our range our
rate<00:03:43.150> of<00:03:43.180> fire<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.750> heavy<00:03:44.230> barrel<00:03:44.440> is<00:03:44.620> going<00:03:44.739> to

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
rate of fire a heavy barrel is going to

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.650 
rate of fire a heavy barrel is going to
give<00:03:44.920> us<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.160> better<00:03:45.400> accuracy<00:03:45.850> but<00:03:46.540> it's

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
give us a better accuracy but it's

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.330 
give us a better accuracy but it's
really<00:03:46.840> going<00:03:47.140> to<00:03:47.230> reduce<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:47.680> way<00:03:47.860> we<00:03:47.980> handle

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
really going to reduce the way we handle

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.380 
really going to reduce the way we handle
the<00:03:48.400> gun<00:03:48.550> it's<00:03:48.670> gonna<00:03:48.760> make<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.000> harder<00:03:49.360> to

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
the gun it's gonna make it harder to

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.540 
the gun it's gonna make it harder to
shoot<00:03:49.690> give<00:03:50.019> it<00:03:50.110> more<00:03:50.260> recoil<00:03:50.560> and<00:03:50.920> then

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
shoot give it more recoil and then

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.940 
shoot give it more recoil and then

angled<00:03:54.340> grip<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.760> this<00:03:55.150> is<00:03:55.269> a<00:03:55.300> grip<00:03:55.540> that

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
angled grip and this is a grip that

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.900 
angled grip and this is a grip that
gives<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:56.019> really<00:03:56.560> good<00:03:56.860> first<00:03:57.459> shot
