00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 everything ready for the historic landing 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.170
 from the robot philae on the comet to more than 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.660
 500 million kilometers from the earth 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.639
 at a point between the orbit of Jupiter and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.610
 the mars two space probes 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.590
 robotic are ready to try a 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.600
 risky operation that has never been 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.660
 tried so far in the exploration 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.630
 of space the descent on the surface 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.769
 of a comet the rosette ship has to 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.289
 release on Wednesday at 09.35 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.149
 peninsular the finlay descent module 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.800
 who has traveled subject to it until the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.870
 comet 67p churyumov gerasimenko 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.329
 This will start the fall of the row of 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.000
 seven hours long to the ground 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.960
 of the comet if everything goes well will take 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.899
 contact with the ground at 16.34 with a 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.449
 40 minute margin of these two 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.789
 key moments the separation of the ship 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.219
 and the landing will be heard at the 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.590
 land in the control centers of the 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.080
 half an hour later mission since 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.600
 signs traveling at the speed of the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.030
 light takes 28 minutes 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.400
 seconds to travel the distance from 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.560
 the comet even on our planet is 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.170
 a mission of the European agency of 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.390
 space that whose experts already 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.060
 they starred in a historic landing 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.110
 successfully in another distant body of 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.220
 Solar system 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.240
 titan the saturn moon in 2005 with the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.420
 huygens probe but the 67p churyumov 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.000
 gerasimenko a small object with scarce 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.890
 gravitational attraction is a huge and 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.590
 new challenge for engineers and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.170
 scientists we are ready and without 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.479
 startles has declared and andrea comaz 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.539
 or flight director of the rosetta mission 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.229
 in the shock control center of the that 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.630
 in darmstadt germany however yes that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.210
 gave a small scare to those responsible 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.220
 of the mission in the last hours when 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.340
 did not turn on properly with the 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.960
 first order commented halconazo did it 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.409
 to the second attempt and operations 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.060
 they went ahead as planned 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.150
 center operating room and shock 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.470
 of liza in darmstadt germany from 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.410
 where they are controlled 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.080
 in rosette from the control center of the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.570
 row and in Cologne germany if it will give the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.790
 gbo forward of the probe for 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.130
 Descent maneuver seven hours before 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.970
 of the planned separation of the ship 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:33.900
 Rosette will be at 2.35 in the morning 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.430
 always peninsular time and at 4.35 am 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.100
 will begin to light some 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.140
 probe instruments as reported 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.720
 O'Rourke and engineer laurencia

 leixa systems from the center of 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.880
 control of the colony descent robot 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.430
 germany as it approaches the 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.070
 expected time it shows that the people of the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.200
 team is increasingly nervous but 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.320
 we are all happy that 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.270
 finally the time arrives adds have been 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.380
 ten years of journey of the automatic ship 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.240
 rosette through the space traveling 6400 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.450
 millions of kilometers from the 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.640
 launch in 2004 and more than 20 from 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.140
 that the mission received the green light in that 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.470
 in 1993 on Wednesday nothing more happened 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.860
 the separation of both artifacts the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.140
 sky 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.930
 in the task of photographing the ship 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.720
 will take two images called 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.690
 Farewell at 12 minutes will be already 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.730
 100 meters away both the ship 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.920
 as the descent probe have to 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.440
 perform maneuvers and functions during 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.470
 the first phase of the operation on 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.560
 13.00 is scheduled to begin on 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.690
 sending data of both artifacts in the 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.520
 land will be listening not only the 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.100
 large tracking antennas 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.170
 satellites of that but also those of 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.110
 the deep space network of the nasa 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.180
 one hour before contacting the 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.010
 floor must activate two of the 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.190
 Fil instruments yesterday to take 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.380
 images we will receive the signal from the 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.360
 descent probe two hours after 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.090
 the separation of the probe and the ship and 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.880
 from that moment we can follow the 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.810
 row and towards the landing summarize that 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.910
 If everything goes well at about 5:00 PM the 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.340
 row and you must land and hold on 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.350
 floor with two harpoons and helped by the 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.850
 bolting devices in their 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.280
 Three legs 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.330
 I did not do it so scant is the severity 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.580
 of the 67p churyumov gerasimenko a body 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.920
 of ice and dust of about 4 kilometers of 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.260
 maximum diameter the robot would come out 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.410
 bounced into space and would be lost 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.960
 within 5 minutes of contacting the 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.330
 ground the fly has the task of taking 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.330
 a panoramic photo of the unusual environment 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.960
 who will have arrived could be known in 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.660
 the earth around 6 pm and for both 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.160
 the first days and a half there the probe 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.160
 has a tight schedule of 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.810
 scientific activities to carry out 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.820
 experts have calculated that the 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.670
 probability of success of the operation 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.190
 is at 70 percent but both 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.710
 scientists as engineers emphasize 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.710
 that even if the rosetta mission went wrong 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.650
 I would continue forward your goal is 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.720
 accompany the comet spinning around in 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.120
 your journey to the sun to investigate 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.820
 how it is activated when approaching the 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.040
 star the ship is scheduled to follow 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.250
 functioning at least until the end of 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.050
 2015 follow-up of the decline for 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.940
 magnetic data during 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.500
 seven hours of falling since it stops 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.069
 of the rosette until it reaches the 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.710
 surface of comet 67p churyumov 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:43.889
 gerasimenko the row probe and should take 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.409
 data in different phases the information 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.900
 It will be sent to the ship and it is down to earth 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.699
 but the onboard instruments 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.430
 dedicated to field measurement 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.830
 magnetic rtc on the ship and roma- of the 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.199
 probe are going to be used to do the 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.690
 follow-up of the decline both 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.699
 space artifacts generate small 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.430
 magnetic fields by the circuits 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.770
 electronic that lead to explained 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.960
 ansÃ³n rich to you researcher of the 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.300
 rome plasma monitor and magnetometer 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.219
 those magnetic fields create 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.530
 disturbances in the data that the 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:18.360
 scientists usually eliminate for 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.520
 analyze the measures of the fields 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.250
 natural magnetic elements of the comet and 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.349
 solar wind but those disturbances 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.389
 can be analyzed to see what happens 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:30.440
 to the row and during its slow fall towards 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.440
 the floor of the comet
