00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
going to hit start triangle now the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.750 
going to hit start triangle now the
background<00:00:54.900> changed<00:00:55.380> I<00:00:55.500> am<00:00:55.740> behind<00:00:56.130> the<00:00:56.490> map

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
background changed I am behind the map

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.120 
background changed I am behind the map
yet<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.870> wait<00:00:58.050> till<00:00:58.380> when<00:00:58.740> you<00:00:58.830> see<00:00:59.010> your

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
yet the wait till when you see your

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.000 
yet the wait till when you see your
friends<00:00:59.490> list<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:01.020> background<00:01:01.500> behind<00:01:01.650> your

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
friends list the background behind your

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.310 
friends list the background behind your
friends<00:01:02.310> list<00:01:02.490> will<00:01:02.700> change<00:01:03.019> and<00:01:04.019> then<00:01:04.170> that

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
friends list will change and then that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.760 
friends list will change and then that
time<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.710> know<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.860> did<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> glitch<00:01:05.489> right

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
time you know you did the glitch right

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.640 
time you know you did the glitch right
so<00:01:07.770> basically<00:01:08.700> start<00:01:09.210> triangle<00:01:10.110> both<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.560> you

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
so basically start triangle both of you

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.170 
so basically start triangle both of you
have<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.890> press<00:01:11.070> at<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> same<00:01:11.610> time<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
have to press at the same time and the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.560 
have to press at the same time and the
one<00:01:12.360> doing<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.869> cannot<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.770> host<00:01:14.570> there's

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
one doing it cannot be the host there's

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.060 
one doing it cannot be the host there's
an<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> roof<00:01:16.230> glitch<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.040> i'll

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
an on the roof glitch to this and i'll

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.770 
an on the roof glitch to this and i'll
figure<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.640> maybe<00:01:18.000> i'll<00:01:18.240> post<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.570> part

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
figure that out maybe i'll post a part

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.540 
figure that out maybe i'll post a part
two<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.320> one<00:01:19.620> I<00:01:19.830> don't<00:01:20.159> want<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.490> make

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
two of this one I don't want to make

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.330 
two of this one I don't want to make
this<00:01:20.700> too<00:01:20.909> long<00:01:21.090> girl<00:01:21.300> still<00:01:21.540> never<00:01:21.780> upload

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
this too long girl still never upload

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.399 
this too long girl still never upload
but<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.820> hop<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.060> onto<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.170> we

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
but you hop up onto here like this we

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.620 
but you hop up onto here like this we
get<00:01:25.560> we've<00:01:25.740> established<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.670> far<00:01:26.880> then

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
get we've established that so far then

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.779 
get we've established that so far then
you<00:01:27.750> hop<00:01:27.900> up<00:01:27.960> onto<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.530> clock

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.469 

and<00:01:34.789> then<00:01:36.460> it's<00:01:37.460> really<00:01:37.759> confusing<00:01:37.939> but

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
and then it's really confusing but

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.149 
and then it's really confusing but
that's<00:01:38.869> how<00:01:39.079> you<00:01:39.170> do<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.560> glitch<00:01:39.710> that<00:01:40.039> you

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
that's how you do the glitch that you

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.580 
that's how you do the glitch that you
guys<00:01:40.340> want<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.729> know<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.630> behind<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.380> map

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
guys want to know the behind the map

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.010 
guys want to know the behind the map
part<00:01:43.009> that's<00:01:43.759> how<00:01:44.000> you<00:01:44.060> do<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:44.299> this<00:01:44.659> other<00:01:44.810> one

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
part that's how you do it this other one

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.059 
part that's how you do it this other one
requires<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.590> jumping<00:01:46.009> on<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.159> clock<00:01:46.490> or

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
requires you jumping on a clock or

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:53.919 
requires you jumping on a clock or
between<00:01:49.069> a<00:01:49.100> clock<00:01:51.969> which<00:01:52.969> I<00:01:53.360> look<00:01:53.630> like<00:01:53.810> an

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
between a clock which I look like an

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.309 
between a clock which I look like an
idiot<00:01:53.990> doing<00:01:54.409> but<00:01:55.189> there<00:01:55.610> we<00:01:55.700> go<00:01:55.819> I<00:01:56.079> just<00:01:57.079> had

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
idiot doing but there we go I just had

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:09.800 
idiot doing but there we go I just had
it

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.160

see here i am up here now here's the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.630 
see here i am up here now here's the
part<00:02:14.200> where<00:02:14.739> I<00:02:14.769> don't<00:02:15.129> know<00:02:15.310> what<00:02:15.489> I'm<00:02:15.610> doing

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
part where I don't know what I'm doing

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.350 
part where I don't know what I'm doing
so<00:02:16.209> I'm<00:02:16.390> gonna<00:02:16.540> end<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.409> video<00:02:17.909> look<00:02:18.909> up<00:02:19.090> how

so I'm gonna end the video look up how
to<00:02:19.390> do<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.080> maybe<00:02:20.830> i<00:02:21.010> might<00:02:21.400> resume<00:02:21.819> from

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
to do it and maybe i might resume from

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.170 
to do it and maybe i might resume from
there<00:02:22.920> all<00:02:23.920> right<00:02:24.159> but<00:02:24.519> that's<00:02:24.670> how<00:02:24.909> you<00:02:24.970> get

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
there all right but that's how you get

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.610
