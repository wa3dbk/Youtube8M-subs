issues<00:00:18.449> picking<00:00:18.810> but<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.320> picked<00:00:19.710> this<00:00:19.830> one

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
issues picking but I picked this one

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.890 
issues picking but I picked this one
because<00:00:20.460> that's<00:00:21.150> what<00:00:21.270> actually<00:00:21.570> looks<00:00:21.720> more

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
because that's what actually looks more

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.859 
because that's what actually looks more
more<00:00:22.590> closer<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.880> original<00:00:23.939> blood<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.660> sit

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
more closer to the original blood to sit

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.790 
more closer to the original blood to sit
like<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.590> costume<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.220> everything<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:27.230> um<00:00:28.230> I

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
like the costume and everything and um I

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.970 
like the costume and everything and um I
think<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.880> like<00:00:30.150> listed<00:00:30.630> or<00:00:30.929> bark<00:00:31.710> had

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
think this like listed or bark had

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.569 
think this like listed or bark had
listed<00:00:32.369> as<00:00:32.579> um<00:00:33.000> as<00:00:33.680> basic<00:00:34.680> Maleficent

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
listed as um as basic Maleficent

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.030 
listed as um as basic Maleficent
maintain<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.630> her<00:00:36.780> costume<00:00:37.590> or<00:00:37.739> something

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
maintain that her costume or something

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.619 
maintain that her costume or something
sat<00:00:38.190> suppose<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:38.610> fancy<00:00:38.820> even<00:00:39.329> though<00:00:39.420> i

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
sat suppose be as fancy even though i

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.209 
sat suppose be as fancy even though i
think<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.020> costume<00:00:40.440> has<00:00:40.680> probably<00:00:41.010> most

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
think this costume has probably most

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.540 
think this costume has probably most
detail<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.980> babies<00:00:43.980> because<00:00:44.370> she

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
detail in it and babies because she

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.850 
detail in it and babies because she

loose because her head seems kind of
loose<00:03:11.109> so<00:03:12.099> hopefully<00:03:12.909> she<00:03:12.970> just<00:03:13.239> died<00:03:13.510> cuz<00:03:13.840> I
