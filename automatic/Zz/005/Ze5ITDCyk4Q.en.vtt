00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.119

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.769
 in the month of today I'll show you 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:36.379
 agrees with this wall using fabric 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:39.920
 so if you want to learn is favorite 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.500
 watch the video you need a 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.830
 fabric with the print of your choice 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.390
 and the measure will vary according to the 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.829
 size of your wall 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 in my case my relative has 1 88 of 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:59.120
 width by two of height 70 I used 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.760
 a fabric that two meters and 20 meters 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.620
 width and 3 meters in height 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.490
 so I did not have to do any 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:12.350
 seam and customer to glue one 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.929
 roll let with a brush two tubes 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.320
 of white glue and his companion in the store 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:21.350
 I paid 1250 and she did not 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:28.549
 a pen or pencil needs to be diluted 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:32.750
 a ruler and a stylus mark on the 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:36.799
 the wall and start by applying the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.079
 Where did you book you need help? 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.630
 of another person in my case I 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.119
 I had the help of my sister because 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.119
 It's really hard to do it alone. 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.979
 shortly after application of the adhesive start 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.979
 put the fabric on the wall 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.200
 race a new distance marking is 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.990
 according to what you think is best 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.920
 with pencil because the marking can 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.520
 appear and repeat the same 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.520
 procedure 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.360
 with the brush pass glue in all 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.360
 corners 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.380
 with a stylus 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.380
 We're going to cut all the leftovers. 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:07.469
 and on top of the cloth, which step again 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.469
 I do not know 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.240
 and this is the end result 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:50.720

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.210
