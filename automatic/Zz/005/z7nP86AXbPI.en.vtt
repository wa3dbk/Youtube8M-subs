environmental damage they were so simple
and<00:02:21.300> they<00:02:21.780> got<00:02:22.019> boring<00:02:22.379> really<00:02:22.739> quick<00:02:23.129> but

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
and they got boring really quick but

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.130 
and they got boring really quick but
what<00:02:23.610> kept<00:02:24.000> them<00:02:24.150> alive<00:02:24.330> with<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.780> different

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140

looks<00:02:35.760> really<00:02:36.150> ridiculous<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.140> fact<00:02:37.410> that

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
looks really ridiculous the fact that

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.990 
looks really ridiculous the fact that
naruto<00:02:38.010> can<00:02:38.220> throw<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:39.170> bijuu<00:02:40.170> dama<00:02:40.670> at<00:02:41.670> the

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
stage and it remains the same like what

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.250 
stage and it remains the same like what
