00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
gonna go through each piece because a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.110 
gonna go through each piece because a
lot<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:34.920> stuff<00:00:35.070> you've<00:00:35.280> seen<00:00:35.309> but<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.820> just

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
lot of this stuff you've seen but I just

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.060 
lot of this stuff you've seen but I just
wanted<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.420> show<00:00:36.570> some<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.140> more<00:00:37.890> unique

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
wanted to show some of the more unique

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.990 
wanted to show some of the more unique
pieces<00:00:39.860> there's<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.250> here<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.760> I

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
pieces there's this one here that I

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.700 
pieces there's this one here that I
thought<00:00:42.390> was<00:00:42.540> really<00:00:42.719> neat<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.100> lid

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
thought was really neat and with the lid

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.740 
thought was really neat and with the lid
if<00:00:46.710> anything<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> lid<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.210> tend<00:00:48.629> to

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
if anything with a lid I tend to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.549 
if anything with a lid I tend to
gravitate<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.770> because<00:00:50.570> a<00:00:51.570> lot<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.170> times<00:00:52.410> you

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
gravitate to because a lot of times you

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.860 
gravitate to because a lot of times you
just<00:00:52.590> don't<00:00:52.860> find<00:00:53.010> things<00:00:53.219> at<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> lid<00:00:53.870> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
just don't find things at the lid and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.330 
just don't find things at the lid and
there<00:00:55.110> was<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.379> piece<00:00:55.710> here<00:00:57.739> which<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.129> I

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
there was this piece here which I like I

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.099 
there was this piece here which I like I
like<00:00:59.489> those<00:00:59.699> pieces<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.239> then<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.570> one<00:01:00.840> is

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
like those pieces and then this one is

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.210 
like those pieces and then this one is
an<00:01:01.640> EO<00:01:02.640> Brody<00:01:03.120> which<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.170> need<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.350> look<00:01:04.830> him<00:01:04.890> up

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
an EO Brody which I need to look him up

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.179 
an EO Brody which I need to look him up
and<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:05.689> kind<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.810> learn<00:01:06.900> about<00:01:07.140> him<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.920> I

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
and see kind of learn about him so I

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.090 
and see kind of learn about him so I
thought<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.150> was<00:01:09.270> pretty<00:01:09.450> neat<00:01:10.100> found

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
one I really liked its that pattern that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.109

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.600 
I really like and it's a bigger one so I
was<00:01:27.330> excited<00:01:27.689> about<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.579> a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
was excited about that and this is a

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.880 
was excited about that and this is a
bigger<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.210> these<00:01:33.360> really<00:01:33.960> common<00:01:34.710> ones

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
bigger one of these really common ones

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.830 
bigger one of these really common ones
here's<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.369> cradle<00:01:36.119> which<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.509> thought<00:01:36.689> was

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
here's this cradle which I thought was

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.120 
here's this cradle which I thought was
really<00:01:36.900> pretty<00:01:37.909> neat<00:01:38.909> different<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:43.130> then

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
really pretty neat different so and then

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.240 
really pretty neat different so and then
this<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.850> really<00:01:45.270> neat<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.500> underside

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
this one is really neat on the underside

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.080 
this one is really neat on the underside
of<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:48.409> is<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.560> really<00:01:50.159> beautiful<00:01:50.729> pattern

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
of it is this really beautiful pattern

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.640 
of it is this really beautiful pattern
so<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.119> thought<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.689> was<00:01:54.810> beautiful

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.730 

and<00:01:58.280> then<00:01:59.120> there's<00:01:59.510> this<00:01:59.690> piece<00:02:00.050> which<00:02:00.500> this

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
and then there's this piece which this

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.920 
and then there's this piece which this
obviously<00:02:01.250> is<00:02:01.460> not<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.670> original<00:02:02.240> wood

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
obviously is not the original wood

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.160 
obviously is not the original wood
that's<00:02:03.290> what<00:02:03.530> they<00:02:03.920> had<00:02:04.100> with<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.960> so<00:02:05.960> I<00:02:05.990> took

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
that's what they had with it so I took

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.630 
that's what they had with it so I took
it<00:02:06.320> why<00:02:06.650> not<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.980> still<00:02:07.190> looks<00:02:07.340> pretty<00:02:07.580> on

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
it why not it still looks pretty on

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.840 
it why not it still looks pretty on
there<00:02:08.500> got<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.560> couple<00:02:09.800> of<00:02:09.950> these<00:02:10.100> which<00:02:10.640> I'm

off it's like a creamer or I don't know

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
but I thought that was pretty neat

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.260 
but I thought that was pretty neat
and<00:04:27.080> then<00:04:27.440> these<00:04:27.650> cream<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.610> sugars<00:04:28.940> were

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
and then these cream and sugars were

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:38.020 
and then these cream and sugars were
neat<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:30.410> thought<00:04:33.640> and<00:04:34.640> those<00:04:34.850> are<00:04:35.680> these<00:04:37.030> yes

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
those are the West meringue and then

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.520 
those are the West meringue and then
this<00:04:41.090> candlestick<00:04:41.600> I<00:04:41.960> thought<00:04:42.169> was<00:04:42.320> really

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
this candlestick I thought was really

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.990 
this candlestick I thought was really
neat<00:04:42.770> it<00:04:43.040> actually<00:04:43.610> has<00:04:43.820> a<00:04:44.270> ribbon<00:04:45.110> of<00:04:45.260> some

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
neat it actually has a ribbon of some

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.110 
neat it actually has a ribbon of some
colored<00:04:47.000> glass<00:04:47.300> in<00:04:47.600> there<00:04:48.760> which<00:04:49.760> I<00:04:49.970> don't

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
colored glass in there which I don't

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.340 
colored glass in there which I don't
care<00:04:50.270> I<00:04:50.300> think<00:04:50.540> it's<00:04:50.660> kind<00:04:50.840> of<00:04:50.900> neat<00:04:51.110> and

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
care I think it's kind of neat and

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.000 
care I think it's kind of neat and
unique<00:04:51.680> so<00:04:53.200> I'm<00:04:54.200> not<00:04:54.320> sure<00:04:54.380> it<00:04:54.590> makes<00:04:54.830> that<00:04:57.010> and

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
unique so I'm not sure it makes that and

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.580 
unique so I'm not sure it makes that and
