00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
he came back he got to see him work a

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.240 
he came back he got to see him work a
little<00:00:12.389> bit<00:00:12.799> and<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.950> know<00:00:14.070> he's<00:00:14.219> still

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
little bit and you know he's still

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.150 
little bit and you know he's still
injured<00:00:14.610> it's<00:00:14.880> kind<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.540> apparent<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.199> his<00:00:16.830> I

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
injured it's kind of apparent that his I

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.650 
injured it's kind of apparent that his I
don't<00:00:17.940> know<00:00:18.000> if<00:00:18.119> it's<00:00:18.270> just<00:00:18.300> for<00:00:18.600> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
don't know if it's just for the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.390 
don't know if it's just for the
storyline<00:00:18.960> but<00:00:19.289> my<00:00:19.529> presumption<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.220> there's

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
storyline but my presumption is there's

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.060 
storyline but my presumption is there's
no<00:00:20.580> way<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> guy<00:00:21.060> can<00:00:21.330> be<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> hundred<00:00:21.750> percent

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
no way a guy can be a hundred percent

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.089 
no way a guy can be a hundred percent
after<00:00:23.070> only<00:00:23.189> two<00:00:23.430> months<00:00:23.460> with<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:25.099> estimated

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
after only two months with the estimated

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.250 
after only two months with the estimated
time<00:00:26.279> being<00:00:26.640> eight<00:00:26.849> months<00:00:27.269> now<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.869> think<00:00:28.019> he's

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
time being eight months now I think he's

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.380 
time being eight months now I think he's
injuring<00:00:28.619> he's<00:00:29.039> hurt<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.640> he's<00:00:30.150> still

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
injuring he's hurt and he's still

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.870 
injuring he's hurt and he's still

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.189 
ways but for me him winning the title is
gonna<00:00:53.579> obviously<00:00:54.000> bring<00:00:54.210> prestige<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.930> it

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
I don't see Del Rio doing anything else

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.670 
I don't see Del Rio doing anything else
what<00:01:48.329> does<00:01:48.479> what<00:01:48.750> else<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.110> there<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.439> him<00:01:49.530> to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
what does what else is there for him to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.590 
what does what else is there for him to
do<00:01:49.860> other<00:01:50.369> than<00:01:50.490> few<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.210> title<00:01:51.479> with

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
do other than few for the title with

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.069 
do other than few for the title with
Cena<00:01:52.610> but<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.060> guess<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.689> kind<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.960> be

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
Cena but you I guess this is kind of be

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.770 
Cena but you I guess this is kind of be
the<00:01:55.229> secondary<00:01:55.710> feud<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.280> all<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.700> think

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
the secondary feud of all and I think

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.480 
the secondary feud of all and I think
Daniel<00:01:57.780> Bryan<00:01:57.810> versus<00:01:58.380> Randy<00:01:59.130> Orton's<00:01:59.340> gonna

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
Daniel Bryan versus Randy Orton's gonna

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.300 
Daniel Bryan versus Randy Orton's gonna
go<00:01:59.670> another<00:01:59.969> two<00:02:00.299> months<00:02:00.950> where<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> blow-off

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
go another two months where the blow-off

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.569 
go another two months where the blow-off
could<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.850> there<00:02:03.119> at<00:02:03.240> Survivor<00:02:03.600> Series<00:02:03.750> or

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
could be there at Survivor Series or

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.399 
could be there at Survivor Series or
actually<00:02:05.750> yeah<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.780> don't<00:02:06.960> know<00:02:07.079> Survivor

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409
