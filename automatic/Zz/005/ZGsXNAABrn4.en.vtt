00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
Queen or at least that she's still

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.789 
Queen or at least that she's still
laying<00:02:21.720> okay<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:22.930> found<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.200> Queen<00:02:24.510> right

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
laying okay so you found the Queen right

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.500 
laying okay so you found the Queen right
there<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.970> longer<00:02:28.299> body<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:30.420> nothing<00:02:31.420> moves

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
there that longer body so nothing moves

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.000 
there that longer body so nothing moves
totally<00:02:32.049> differently<00:02:32.380> than<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.650> other<00:02:32.829> bees

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
totally differently than the other bees

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.920 
totally differently than the other bees
yeah<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:33.940> kind<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.180> almost<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.599> means<00:02:34.780> we

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
yeah it's kind of almost that means we

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.199 
yeah it's kind of almost that means we
get<00:02:35.049> turn<00:02:35.319> eight<00:02:35.470> or<00:02:35.590> something<00:02:35.739> like<00:02:36.730> the

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
get turn eight or something like the

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.490 
get turn eight or something like the
hives<00:02:37.390> accepted<00:02:37.870> her<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:38.079> that<00:02:38.110> means<00:02:38.349> she's

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
hives accepted her so that means she's

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.280 
hives accepted her so that means she's
laying<00:02:38.709> eggs<00:02:39.489> and<00:02:39.700> we've<00:02:40.660> got<00:02:40.810> some<00:02:41.049> brute

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
laying eggs and we've got some brute

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.979 
laying eggs and we've got some brute
growing<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:42.329> hopefully<00:02:43.329> we<00:02:43.420> saved<00:02:43.630> this<00:02:43.780> one

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
growing so hopefully we saved this one

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.620 
growing so hopefully we saved this one
too<00:02:44.139> so<00:02:44.250> I'd<00:02:45.250> be<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.579> added<00:02:46.120> bonus<00:02:46.389> to<00:02:46.510> make

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
too so I'd be it added bonus to make

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:57.809 
too so I'd be it added bonus to make
this<00:02:47.250> into<00:02:48.250> two<00:02:48.430> essentially<00:02:48.940> but<00:02:55.380> focus<00:02:56.380> here

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
this into two essentially but focus here

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.660 
this into two essentially but focus here
it's<00:02:58.269> a<00:02:58.360> little<00:02:58.689> thing<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:58.930> got<00:02:59.110> in<00:02:59.230> there<00:02:59.379> oh

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
newbies on the way we decided not to add

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.050 
newbies on the way we decided not to add
a<00:03:07.569> honey<00:03:08.170> box<00:03:08.379> on<00:03:08.560> this<00:03:08.620> one<00:03:08.709> yet<00:03:09.060> they're

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
a honey box on this one yet they're

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.479 
a honey box on this one yet they're
still<00:03:10.269> kind<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.769> re-establishing<00:03:11.769> there<00:03:12.340> it's

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
still kind of re-establishing there it's

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.420 
still kind of re-establishing there it's
close<00:03:12.700> we'll<00:03:12.970> probably<00:03:13.090> do<00:03:13.299> it<00:03:13.390> next<00:03:13.540> week<00:03:13.750> but

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
close we'll probably do it next week but

the frames out and take a look at it

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.220 
the frames out and take a look at it
we're<00:03:32.440> still<00:03:32.590> kind<00:03:32.769> of<00:03:32.859> dealing<00:03:33.340> with<00:03:33.370> the
