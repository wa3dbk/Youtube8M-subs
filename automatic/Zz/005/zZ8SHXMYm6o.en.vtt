00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
innovative about it you notice the shape

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.510 
innovative about it you notice the shape
is<00:01:28.689> quite<00:01:28.899> typical<00:01:29.170> I<00:01:29.679> asked<00:01:30.069> for<00:01:30.219> that<00:01:30.310> on

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
is quite typical I asked for that on

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.059 
is quite typical I asked for that on
purpose<00:01:30.819> I<00:01:31.270> asked<00:01:32.109> for<00:01:32.200> something<00:01:32.469> that<00:01:32.799> is

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
purpose I asked for something that is

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.270 
purpose I asked for something that is
commonly<00:01:33.759> known<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.749> bass<00:01:34.990> players<00:01:35.409> so<00:01:36.130> there

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
commonly known to bass players so there

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.580 
commonly known to bass players so there
isn't<00:01:36.579> any<00:01:36.700> shock<00:01:37.209> about<00:01:37.569> the<00:01:37.780> design<00:01:38.200> I<00:01:38.229> don't

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
isn't any shock about the design I don't

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.949 
isn't any shock about the design I don't
really<00:01:38.829> believe<00:01:39.249> a<00:01:39.280> bass<00:01:39.579> has<00:01:39.819> to<00:01:39.999> look<00:01:40.209> odd<00:01:40.479> to

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
really believe a bass has to look odd to

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:42.270 
really believe a bass has to look odd to
be<00:01:41.130> interesting

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
be interesting

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.660 
be interesting
so<00:01:43.119> this<00:01:43.539> bass<00:01:43.840> is<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:44.139> low<00:01:44.380> action<00:01:44.670> passive

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
so this bass is a low action passive

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.809 
so this bass is a low action passive
instrument<00:01:46.329> the<00:01:46.509> tone<00:01:46.780> is<00:01:47.310> fabulous<00:01:48.310> I<00:01:48.520> am
