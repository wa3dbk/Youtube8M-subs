tip and today we're going to add an

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.759 
tip and today we're going to add an
effect<00:00:06.960> in<00:00:07.470> toon<00:00:07.950> boom<00:00:08.069> animate<00:00:08.460> non-pro<00:00:09.090> and

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
effect in toon boom animate non-pro and

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.690 
effect in toon boom animate non-pro and
the<00:00:10.769> way<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:11.670> add<00:00:11.910> an<00:00:12.030> effect<00:00:12.150> in<00:00:12.509> animate<00:00:13.019> is

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
the way you add an effect in animate is

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.820 
the way you add an effect in animate is
you<00:00:14.700> have<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.059> add<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> peg<00:00:15.480> layer<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.990> what<00:00:16.740> I'm

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
you have to add a peg layer and what I'm

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.710 
you have to add a peg layer and what I'm
going<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:16.980> do<00:00:17.130> by<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.340> way<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> dabbler<00:00:18.330> to

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
going to do by the way is a dabbler to

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.710 
going to do by the way is a dabbler to
this<00:00:18.869> background<00:00:19.640> and<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:21.300> let's<00:00:21.539> go<00:00:21.689> ahead

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
this background and so let's go ahead

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.189 
this background and so let's go ahead
and<00:00:21.840> add<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.380> egg<00:00:23.279> layer<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.869> the<00:00:24.869> way<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.019> do

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
and add the egg layer and the way to do

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.359 
and add the egg layer and the way to do
that<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.380> come<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.890> little<00:00:26.039> plus<00:00:26.310> sign

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
that is come to this little plus sign

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.810 
that is come to this little plus sign
which<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:26.910> actually<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> add<00:00:27.630> layer<00:00:27.869> icon

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
which is actually the add layer icon

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.999 
which is actually the add layer icon
scroll<00:00:29.820> down<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.300> effect<00:00:30.660> choose<00:00:31.470> your<00:00:31.619> effect

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
scroll down to effect choose your effect

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.540 
scroll down to effect choose your effect
in<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.279> case<00:00:32.489> blur<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:34.130> I<00:00:35.130> was<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> good<00:00:35.489> idea

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
in this case blur and I was a good idea

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:44.750 
in this case blur and I was a good idea
to<00:00:35.910> rename<00:00:41.059> Butler<00:00:43.250> so<00:00:44.250> that's<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.550> peg

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
to rename Butler so that's your peg

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.420 
to rename Butler so that's your peg
layer<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.210> then<00:00:46.020> I'm<00:00:46.140> gonna<00:00:46.260> grab<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> layer

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
layer and then I'm gonna grab the layer

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.729 
layer and then I'm gonna grab the layer
continue<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.059> background<00:00:48.629> I'm<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:49.649> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
continue that background I'm going to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.260 
continue that background I'm going to
drag<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:49.980> into<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.489> peg<00:00:50.730> layer<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:54.090> next

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
drag it into that peg layer and the next

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.450 
drag it into that peg layer and the next
step<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.840> add<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.440> radius<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.070> adjust<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
step is to add the radius to adjust the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.849 
step is to add the radius to adjust the
radius<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.750> blur<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.350> strength<00:00:58.649> of

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
radius of the blur or the strength of

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.560 
radius of the blur or the strength of
the<00:00:58.920> blur<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.370> there's<00:01:00.120> two<00:01:00.270> ways<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.510> doing

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
the blur and there's two ways of doing

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.080 
the blur and there's two ways of doing
that<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.260> either<00:01:01.579> double<00:01:02.579> click<00:01:02.609> here

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
that you can either double click here

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.000 
that you can either double click here
and<00:01:03.920> by<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:05.129> i<00:01:05.159> mean<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.640> peg<00:01:05.850> layer<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:07.049> you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
and by here i mean the peg layer and you

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.820 
and by here i mean the peg layer and you
have<00:01:08.189> your<00:01:08.610> layers<00:01:08.820> properties<00:01:09.570> box<00:01:10.200> pop<00:01:10.619> up

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
have your layers properties box pop up

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.690 
have your layers properties box pop up
and<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.299> radius<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.560> apply<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
and on the radius that and apply the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.039 
and on the radius that and apply the
strength<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:16.790> apply<00:01:17.790> about<00:01:18.060> four<00:01:18.509> for<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.869> K

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
strength and apply about four for this K

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.710 
strength and apply about four for this K
in<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.350> case<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.729> close<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.299> I'll

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
in this case and then close it I'll

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.590 
in this case and then close it I'll
leave<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.049> on<00:01:22.110> high<00:01:22.880> quality<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:27.390> blur

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
leave it on high quality and the blur

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.350 
leave it on high quality and the blur
strength<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.140> added<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> this

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
strength is added and this is the this

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.480 
strength is added and this is the this
is<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> key<00:01:30.840> i<00:01:30.869> think<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.439> adding<00:01:31.979> effects

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
is the key i think in adding effects

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.399 
is the key i think in adding effects
when<00:01:32.670> you're<00:01:32.759> new<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.000> animate<00:01:33.390> once<00:01:34.320> you

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
when you're new to animate once you

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.170 
when you're new to animate once you
added<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> effect<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.340> don't<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:35.970> anything

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
added the effect you don't see anything

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.010 
added the effect you don't see anything
when<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.570> come<00:01:36.829> back<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.689> camera

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
when you come back to the to the camera

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.830 
when you come back to the to the camera

view and once you do that then you could
see<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> effect<00:01:53.509> if<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.990> here<00:01:55.229> you

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
an effect on to add to adjust the radius

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.249 
an effect on to add to adjust the radius
there<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.100> come<00:02:02.280> here<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.790> little
