00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
curved horizontal crossbar now let's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.590 
curved horizontal crossbar now let's
have<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.340> look<00:00:56.489> at<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> features<00:00:56.940> from<00:00:57.300> ground

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
have a look at the features from ground

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.229 
have a look at the features from ground
up<00:00:57.809> that's<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.649> quick-release<00:00:59.160> T<00:00:59.579> leg<00:00:59.760> assembly

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
up that's a quick-release T leg assembly

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.970 
up that's a quick-release T leg assembly
which<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.690> much<00:01:01.289> faster<00:01:01.800> than<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
which is much faster than the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.460 
which is much faster than the
traditional<00:01:02.489> T<00:01:02.699> leg<00:01:02.850> assembly<00:01:03.300> all<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.290> is

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
traditional T leg assembly all you do is
