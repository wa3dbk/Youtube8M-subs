whatever and here we go get a good angle
on<00:03:59.270> it<00:03:59.330> see<00:04:00.170> this<00:04:00.350> is<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:01.450> looks<00:04:02.450> like<00:04:02.600> the

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
on it see this is the looks like the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:12.580 
on it see this is the looks like the
back<00:04:02.960> of<00:04:03.200> it<00:04:08.050> wrap<00:04:09.050> it<00:04:09.290> here<00:04:11.080> yeah<00:04:12.080> this<00:04:12.290> is<00:04:12.470> the

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
back of it wrap it here yeah this is the

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.599 
back of it wrap it here yeah this is the
back<00:04:12.740> of<00:04:12.920> it<00:04:12.980> but<00:04:13.190> look<00:04:13.370> at<00:04:13.490> that<00:04:15.190> will<00:04:16.190> turn<00:04:16.430> it

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
back of it but look at that will turn it

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.400 
back of it but look at that will turn it
around<00:04:16.700> towards<00:04:17.329> the<00:04:17.419> front<00:04:20.019> get<00:04:21.019> it<00:04:21.109> to<00:04:21.169> focus

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
around towards the front get it to focus

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:29.519 
around towards the front get it to focus
I<00:04:23.530> can't<00:04:24.530> get<00:04:24.680> it<00:04:24.770> to<00:04:24.860> focus

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:29.529 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:35.340 

flip<00:04:30.129> it<00:04:30.249> over<00:04:30.519> and<00:04:30.969> there<00:04:31.419> it<00:04:31.509> is

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.950 

they<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.340> difference<00:04:37.180> is<00:04:37.330> that<00:04:37.360> this<00:04:37.600> is<00:04:37.660> not

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
they the difference is that this is not

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.170 
they the difference is that this is not
shiny<00:04:38.410> anymore<00:04:38.950> this<00:04:39.880> part<00:04:40.630> here<00:04:41.080> it's<00:04:41.950> a
