00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.670 
got to find some of this or it's pretty
easy<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.800> notice<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.090> very<00:00:42.390> bright<00:00:42.750> let's

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
easy to notice it is very bright let's

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.490 
easy to notice it is very bright let's
get<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> pickaxe<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.020> when<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.110> mind<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.410> you

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
get a pickaxe so when you mind it you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.440 
get a pickaxe so when you mind it you
won't<00:00:46.649> get<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> dust<00:00:47.160> straight<00:00:47.489> away<00:00:47.670> you've

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
won't get the dust straight away you've

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.810 
won't get the dust straight away you've
got<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.870> actually<00:00:49.200> smelt<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.579> furnace

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
got to actually smelt it in the furnace

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.400 
got to actually smelt it in the furnace
so<00:00:51.090> if<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.329> find<00:00:51.600> some<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.809> these<00:00:51.960> guys<00:00:52.199> you

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
so if you find some of these guys you

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.170 
so if you find some of these guys you
need<00:00:52.710> quite<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> bit<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.370> get<00:00:53.579> everything

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
need quite a bit of it to get everything

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.810 
need quite a bit of it to get everything
so<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.289> think<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.770> need<00:00:55.890> eight<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.489> need<00:00:56.640> eight

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
so I think you need eight you need eight

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.990 
so I think you need eight you need eight
dust<00:00:57.239> per<00:00:57.690> power<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.340> need<00:00:59.520> obviously

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
dust per power and you need obviously

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.420 
dust per power and you need obviously
all<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.570> make<00:01:00.780> all<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.770> armor<00:01:02.280> and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
all of it to make all of the armor and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.640 
all of it to make all of the armor and
then<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.730> need<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.059> armor<00:01:03.470> to<00:01:04.470> make

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
then you need that armor to make

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.600 
then you need that armor to make
frozen's

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
frozen's

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.690 
frozen's
armor<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.960> as<00:01:07.650> that's<00:01:07.920> melt<00:01:08.220> away<00:01:08.369> there<00:01:08.610> i've

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
armor so as that's melt away there i've

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.070 
armor so as that's melt away there i've
got<00:01:08.760> some<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.150> here<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.420> show<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.630> anyway

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
got some in here to show you anyway

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.899 
got some in here to show you anyway
so<00:01:11.000> with<00:01:12.000> these<00:01:12.330> Parris<00:01:13.020> if<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:14.250> add<00:01:14.490> sugar

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
so with these Parris if you add sugar

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.340 
so with these Parris if you add sugar
glass<00:01:15.689> obsidian<00:01:16.049> leather<00:01:16.920> or<00:01:17.189> ice<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.750> toast

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
glass obsidian leather or ice to a toast

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.760 
glass obsidian leather or ice to a toast
so<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.549> do<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:21.140> that<00:01:22.140> makes<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.590> okay

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
so if we do this that makes that okay

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.620 
so if we do this that makes that okay
but<00:01:23.130> if<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.250> add<00:01:23.400> sugar<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:24.119> get<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> speed

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
but if we add sugar we get the speed

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.620 
but if we add sugar we get the speed
para<00:01:24.930> if<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.860> had<00:01:25.950> ice<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.909> get<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> ice<00:01:27.299> power

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
para if we had ice we get the ice power

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.490 
para if we had ice we get the ice power
if<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.710> obsidian<00:01:29.430> we<00:01:29.820> get<00:01:29.970> strength

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
if we have obsidian we get strength

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.109 
if we have obsidian we get strength
leather<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.740> should<00:01:31.890> get<00:01:31.979> flexibility<00:01:32.909> a

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
leather we should get flexibility a

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.870 
leather we should get flexibility a
glass<00:01:34.049> we<00:01:34.229> should<00:01:34.439> get<00:01:34.590> invisibility<00:01:35.490> so

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
glass we should get invisibility so

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.249 
glass we should get invisibility so
that's<00:01:36.030> how<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.210> make<00:01:36.420> those<00:01:36.630> Paras<00:01:37.049> guys

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
that's how you make those Paras guys

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.469 
that's how you make those Paras guys
it's<00:01:37.799> pretty<00:01:38.040> easy<00:01:38.189> pretty<00:01:38.579> cool<00:01:38.820> pretty

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
it's pretty easy pretty cool pretty

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.789 
it's pretty easy pretty cool pretty
handy<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.200> was<00:01:40.259> saying<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.619> will

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
handy but like I was saying you will

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.700 
handy but like I was saying you will
need<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> lot<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.460> incredible<00:01:41.970> essence<00:01:42.500> in<00:01:43.500> this

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
need a lot of incredible essence in this

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.950 
need a lot of incredible essence in this
mod<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.460> make<00:01:44.790> everything<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.360> let's<00:01:45.479> test<00:01:45.750> out

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
mod to make everything so let's test out

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.749 
mod to make everything so let's test out
these<00:01:46.140> parents<00:01:46.590> let's<00:01:47.009> see<00:01:47.189> what<00:01:47.399> happens

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
these parents let's see what happens

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.940 
these parents let's see what happens
these<00:01:48.000> are<00:01:48.270> power<00:01:48.540> removers<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.740> can't

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
these are power removers you can't

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.100 
these are power removers you can't
actually<00:01:50.250> craft<00:01:50.790> them<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.600> mod<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.960> just

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
actually craft them in the mod you just

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.760 
actually craft them in the mod you just
gotta<00:01:52.290> get<00:01:52.439> them<00:01:52.619> from<00:01:52.829> creative<00:01:53.630> but<00:01:54.770> you'll

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
gotta get them from creative but you'll

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.420 
gotta get them from creative but you'll
see<00:01:55.950> what<00:01:56.040> they<00:01:56.159> do

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
see what they do

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.889 
see what they do
basically<00:01:56.790> they<00:01:57.000> remove<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.329> power<00:01:57.509> once<00:01:57.750> it's

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
basically they remove a power once it's

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.870 
basically they remove a power once it's
activated<00:01:58.219> because<00:01:59.219> there's<00:01:59.579> no<00:01:59.670> other<00:01:59.759> way

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
activated because there's no other way

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.510 
activated because there's no other way
unless<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.479> die<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:01.350> first<00:02:01.950> things<00:02:02.159> first<00:02:02.219> we

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
unless you die so first things first we

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.800 
unless you die so first things first we
got<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.729> ice<00:02:02.880> power<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.390> if<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.570> right-click

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
got the ice power so if you right-click

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.499 
got the ice power so if you right-click
it<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:04.979> shoots<00:02:05.189> shoots<00:02:05.700> Nobles

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
it just shoots shoots Nobles

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.139 
it just shoots shoots Nobles
which<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.170> pretty<00:02:07.860> handy<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.459> if<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.849> combine

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
which is pretty handy and if you combine

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.020 
which is pretty handy and if you combine
that<00:02:09.179> with<00:02:09.360> Ozone's

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
that with Ozone's

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.710 
that with Ozone's
frozen's<00:02:12.030> armor<00:02:12.930> then

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
frozen's armor then

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.470 
frozen's armor then
make<00:02:13.840> like<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.200> Ice<00:02:14.440> Warrior<00:02:15.180> next<00:02:16.180> one<00:02:16.330> we

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
make like the Ice Warrior next one we

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.810 
make like the Ice Warrior next one we
got<00:02:16.630> flexibility<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:17.800> as<00:02:18.010> when<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.400> use<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.730> it

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
got flexibility so as when you use it it

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.640 
got flexibility so as when you use it it
goes<00:02:19.000> away<00:02:19.030> unlike<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.930> ice<00:02:20.080> one<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.530> ice

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
goes away unlike the ice one the ice

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.410 
goes away unlike the ice one the ice
once<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.920> only<00:02:21.100> one<00:02:21.250> that<00:02:21.370> stays<00:02:21.640> there<00:02:21.850> you

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
once the only one that stays there you

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.710 
once the only one that stays there you
get<00:02:22.570> speed<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.140> jump<00:02:23.620> boost<00:02:23.860> as<00:02:24.130> long<00:02:24.850> as<00:02:25.120> you

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
get speed and jump boost as long as you

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.490 
get speed and jump boost as long as you
are<00:02:25.930> alive<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:26.800> oh<00:02:27.040> no<00:02:27.760> I<00:02:28.290> was<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.350> bad<00:02:29.470> idea

invisibility can't see me you can't see

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.479 
invisibility can't see me you can't see
me<00:03:32.830> right<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.489> then<00:03:34.180> last<00:03:35.080> but<00:03:35.410> not<00:03:35.709> least<00:03:36.010> we

me right and then last but not least we

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.940 
me right and then last but not least we
get<00:03:36.640> speed<00:03:37.030> which<00:03:37.810> is<00:03:37.840> pretty<00:03:38.110> cool

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
get speed which is pretty cool

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.170 
will end up leaving ice all over your
world<00:05:39.730> so<00:05:40.420> if<00:05:41.110> you<00:05:41.290> don't<00:05:41.440> mind<00:05:41.560> that<00:05:41.800> then

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
world so if you don't mind that then

ability<00:05:47.650> and<00:05:47.980> then<00:05:48.070> obviously<00:05:48.370> if<00:05:48.700> you've<00:05:48.820> got

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000
