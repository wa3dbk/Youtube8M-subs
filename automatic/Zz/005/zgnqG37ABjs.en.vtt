00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.980 
this anymore
did<00:02:00.680> it<00:02:00.799> end<00:02:00.920> right<00:02:01.159> there<00:02:01.190> no<00:02:01.790> nope<00:02:02.390> with<00:02:02.720> a

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
did it end right there no nope with a

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.140 
did it end right there no nope with a
relationship<00:02:03.409> that<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.250> eventually<00:02:04.610> ending

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
relationship that is eventually ending

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.000 
relationship that is eventually ending
it's<00:02:05.270> really<00:02:05.510> hard<00:02:05.720> is<00:02:05.900> just<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.260> confusion

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
it's really hard is just the confusion

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.180 
it's really hard is just the confusion
of<00:02:07.220> not<00:02:07.430> knowing<00:02:08.020> what<00:02:09.020> to<00:02:09.050> do<00:02:09.350> what's<00:02:10.009> the

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
of not knowing what to do what's the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.130 
of not knowing what to do what's the
right<00:02:10.340> call<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:10.850> so<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.120> went<00:02:11.209> on<00:02:11.330> for<00:02:11.780> like

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
right call and so it went on for like

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.840 
right call and so it went on for like
another<00:02:12.470> month<00:02:12.770> that<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.100> was<00:02:13.220> unhappy<00:02:13.520> in

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
another month that I was unhappy in

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.610 
another month that I was unhappy in
Israel<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:14.420> felt<00:02:14.690> awful<00:02:14.959> she<00:02:15.350> couldn't

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
Israel and I felt awful she couldn't

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.350 
Israel and I felt awful she couldn't
settle<00:02:15.830> into<00:02:16.130> what<00:02:16.250> I<00:02:16.280> want<00:02:16.670> but<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:16.970> couldn't

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
settle into what I want but I couldn't

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.840 
settle into what I want but I couldn't
be<00:02:17.540> what<00:02:17.810> she<00:02:18.050> needed<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:19.040> then<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.550> really

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
be what she needed and so then I really

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.699 
be what she needed and so then I really
put<00:02:20.090> SDL<00:02:20.870> aside<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.980> sucked<00:02:23.380> okay<00:02:24.380> but

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
put SDL aside and it sucked okay but

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.729 
put SDL aside and it sucked okay but
then<00:02:24.920> there<00:02:25.250> was<00:02:25.340> this<00:02:25.400> other<00:02:25.580> project<00:02:25.880> and

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
then there was this other project and

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.260 
then there was this other project and
she<00:02:27.739> understood<00:02:28.130> that<00:02:28.190> what<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.700> needed<00:02:28.970> was

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
she understood that what I needed was

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.300 
she understood that what I needed was
just<00:02:29.300> a<00:02:29.569> clear<00:02:29.870> concise<00:02:30.440> plan<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.190> write<00:02:31.280> a

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
just a clear concise plan to write a

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.000 
just a clear concise plan to write a
script<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:31.970> she<00:02:32.090> was<00:02:32.330> fine<00:02:32.540> with<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:33.010> she

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
script and she was fine with that she

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.250 
script and she was fine with that she
likes<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:34.459> that<00:02:35.330> was<00:02:35.450> all<00:02:35.570> she<00:02:35.600> wanted<00:02:36.019> to<00:02:36.140> be

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
likes that that was all she wanted to be

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.180 
likes that that was all she wanted to be
so<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.500> started<00:02:36.890> writing<00:02:37.160> that<00:02:37.280> script<00:02:37.430> blister

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
so I started writing that script blister

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.560 
so I started writing that script blister
blister<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.550> about<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.820> high<00:02:41.060> school<00:02:41.330> track

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.850 
team and the bulk of the story all takes
place<00:02:44.030> in<00:02:44.180> one<00:02:44.450> night<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.170> main<00:02:45.320> conflict

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
place in one night and the main conflict

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.740

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
I could just focus on that and I didn't

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.530 
I could just focus on that and I didn't
have<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.160> world<00:02:52.400> create<00:02:52.850> I<00:02:53.060> didn't<00:02:53.239> have<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.420> do

all this other stuff that I really

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.680 
all this other stuff that I really
wasn't<00:02:55.190> ready<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.700> do<00:02:55.970> yet<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:56.269> we<00:02:56.540> had<00:02:56.660> a

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
wasn't ready to do yet and we had a

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.270 
wasn't ready to do yet and we had a
finished<00:02:57.050> draft<00:02:57.320> that<00:02:57.530> was<00:02:57.650> clear<00:02:57.920> and

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
finished draft that was clear and

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
and I absolutely want to finish it

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.710 
and I absolutely want to finish it
someday<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.340> whatever<00:03:04.549> format<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.180> is<00:03:05.329> but<00:03:05.690> I

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
someday and whatever format it is but I

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.330 
someday and whatever format it is but I
know<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:06.079> it<00:03:06.170> will<00:03:06.380> be<00:03:06.440> different<00:03:06.799> when<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:07.130> go

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
know that it will be different when I go

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.979 
know that it will be different when I go
back<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.760> it<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:07.940> guess<00:03:08.299> what<00:03:08.510> I'm<00:03:08.630> trying<00:03:08.930> to

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
back to it I guess what I'm trying to

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.900 
back to it I guess what I'm trying to
say<00:03:09.200> is<00:03:09.410> sometimes<00:03:09.860> it's<00:03:10.040> good<00:03:10.220> to<00:03:10.250> step<00:03:10.700> away

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
say is sometimes it's good to step away

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.910 
say is sometimes it's good to step away
from<00:03:11.660> an<00:03:11.840> intense<00:03:12.170> relationship<00:03:12.890> with

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
from an intense relationship with

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.620 
from an intense relationship with
something<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:13.519> really<00:03:13.850> care<00:03:14.030> about<00:03:14.329> because

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
something you really care about because

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.330 
something you really care about because
spending<00:03:15.260> this<00:03:15.350> much<00:03:15.530> time<00:03:15.680> with<00:03:15.739> it<00:03:16.010> isn't

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
spending this much time with it isn't

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.520 
spending this much time with it isn't
