00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
anyway I'm rambling for the past week I

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.770 
anyway I'm rambling for the past week I
started<00:01:17.490> using<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.880> tretinoin<00:01:18.270> cream<00:01:18.360> on

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
started using this tretinoin cream on

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.980 
started using this tretinoin cream on
July<00:01:19.080> 28th<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.979> today's<00:01:20.400> July<00:01:20.970> 31st<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
July 28th on today's July 31st and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.420 
July 28th on today's July 31st and
today's<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.200> 28th<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:22.920> almost<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.220> month

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
today's the 28th so it's almost a month

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.679 
today's the 28th so it's almost a month
so<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.640> figured<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.030> would<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> good<00:01:24.420> time

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
so I figured this would be a good time

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.140 
so I figured this would be a good time
to<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:24.990> an<00:01:25.110> update<00:01:25.500> I'm<00:01:26.430> gonna<00:01:26.580> do<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> plate<00:01:27.030> on

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
to do an update I'm gonna do a plate on

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.690 
to do an update I'm gonna do a plate on
the<00:01:27.240> second<00:01:27.540> month<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.900> third<00:01:27.930> month<00:01:28.700> it

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700
