00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
different squirrel pelts which are both

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.849 
different squirrel pelts which are both
here<00:00:18.020> what<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.050> thought<00:00:19.199> I'd<00:00:19.320> show<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.740> just

three years of being turned that way
there's<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.130> inside<00:00:26.430> sphere

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
there's the inside sphere

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.640 
there's the inside sphere
still<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> soft<00:00:27.840> as<00:00:27.990> ever<00:00:30.140> you<00:00:31.140> don't<00:00:31.289> smell<00:00:31.500> of

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
shape that's after three they were like

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.189 
shape that's after three they were like
I<00:01:00.539> say<00:01:00.780> both<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:02.120> that<00:01:03.120> series<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.989> three

I say both in that that series of three
videos<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.680> made<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.040> fur<00:01:05.250> Tony<00:01:05.580> also<00:01:06.390> did<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
videos I made on fur Tony also did a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.240 
videos I made on fur Tony also did a
video<00:01:06.840> I'm<00:01:07.020> making<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.350> crossbow<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:07.950> my<00:01:08.070> um

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
video I'm making a crossbow for my um

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.550 
video I'm making a crossbow for my um
light<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.630> video<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.049> made<00:01:10.530> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
light and in that video I I made a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.560 
light and in that video I I made a
quiver<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> quiver<00:01:11.909> was<00:01:12.150> made<00:01:12.299> out<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
quiver and the quiver was made out a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.960 
quiver and the quiver was made out a
rabbit<00:01:12.810> fur<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.680> trapped<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.729> snare

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
rabbit fur that I trapped in a snare

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.399 
rabbit fur that I trapped in a snare
there's<00:01:15.240> also<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.540> video<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:15.930> probably

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
there's also a video of that probably

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.350 
there's also a video of that probably
something<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:18.030> show<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.240> how

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
something with just to show you how

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.700 
something with just to show you how
that's<00:01:18.450> progressing<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:19.020> wasn't<00:01:19.439> smoke

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
that's progressing that wasn't smoke

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.780 
that's progressing that wasn't smoke
this<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.040> comprised<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.580> lot<00:01:20.700> of

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
this is a comprised of a lot of

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.830 
this is a comprised of a lot of
questions<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.299> asked<00:01:21.540> about<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
questions that get asked about the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.020 
questions that get asked about the
squirrel<00:01:22.229> fur<00:01:22.439> ZZZ<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> have<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.549> smoke<00:01:23.820> and

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
squirrel fur ZZZ do I have to smoke and

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.539 
squirrel fur ZZZ do I have to smoke and
well<00:01:24.150> these<00:01:24.299> are<00:01:24.509> smoked<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.770> wasn't<00:01:26.040> this

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
well these are smoked this wasn't this

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.749 
well these are smoked this wasn't this
is<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:26.939> almost<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:28.650> dried<00:01:28.890> salted<00:01:29.340> dry<00:01:29.579> and

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
is just almost just dried salted dry and

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.030 
is just almost just dried salted dry and
my<00:01:29.880> way<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.090> doing<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.540> worked<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.770> not<00:01:31.950> as

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
my way of doing it worked it's not as

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.380 
my way of doing it worked it's not as
soft<00:01:32.189> as<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.460> others<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:32.970> didn't<00:01:33.150> need<00:01:33.240> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
soft as the others but it didn't need to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.390 
soft as the others but it didn't need to
because<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> quiver<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.890> gets<00:01:35.130> played

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
because it's a quiver this gets played

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.380 
because it's a quiver this gets played
with<00:01:36.590> weakly<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.310> head<00:01:38.490> got<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.939> used<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.299> have

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
with weakly the head got it used to have

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.120 
with weakly the head got it used to have
a<00:01:39.450> head<00:01:39.630> as<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> cover<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.560> long<00:01:40.890> since

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
a head as a cover but that long since

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.490 
a head as a cover but that long since
got<00:01:41.369> tore<00:01:41.640> off<00:01:41.820> its<00:01:42.270> got<00:01:42.450> torn<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.869> lot<00:01:42.990> one<00:01:43.229> bit

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
got tore off its got torn a lot one bit

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.080 
got tore off its got torn a lot one bit
like<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.860> their<00:01:44.220> plate<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.670> gets<00:01:44.880> left

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
like so their plate this gets left

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.679 
like so their plate this gets left
outside<00:01:45.530> it<00:01:46.530> gets<00:01:47.030> took<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.149> he's<00:01:48.240> been<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
outside it gets took it he's been in the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.999 
outside it gets took it he's been in the
bath<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.350> things<00:01:49.619> would<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.890> believe
