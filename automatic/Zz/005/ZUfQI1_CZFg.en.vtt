00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
I mean caffeine being the main

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.340 
I mean caffeine being the main
ingredient<00:01:40.640> as<00:01:41.060> far<00:01:41.329> as<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:41.960> know<00:01:42.079> what's

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
but it just doesn't do anything I mean

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.380 
but it just doesn't do anything I mean
