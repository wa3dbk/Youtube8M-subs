00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
underneath it and and yeah so I just

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.910

have<00:01:32.440> five<00:01:33.149> of<00:01:34.149> thumb<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:34.660> hopefully<00:01:35.380> six<00:01:35.679> if

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
have five of thumb and hopefully six if

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.320

that<00:01:35.950> one<00:01:36.369> in<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.700> egg<00:01:36.849> hatches<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:39.220> I<00:01:40.090> think

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
that one in the egg hatches and I think

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.270 
that one in the egg hatches and I think
this<00:01:40.450> one<00:01:40.660> over<00:01:40.810> here<00:01:40.899> is<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.380> most<00:01:41.590> recent

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
this one over here is the most recent

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.710 
this one over here is the most recent
because<00:01:43.060> it's<00:01:43.239> got<00:01:44.220> some<00:01:45.220> dirt<00:01:45.640> well<00:01:46.270> quite<00:01:46.660> a

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
because it's got some dirt well quite a

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.859 
because it's got some dirt well quite a
lot<00:01:46.959> of<00:01:46.989> ducks<00:01:47.229> still<00:01:47.500> stuck<00:01:47.770> on<00:01:47.800> its<00:01:47.920> head<00:01:48.250> and

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
lot of ducks still stuck on its head and

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.270 
lot of ducks still stuck on its head and
