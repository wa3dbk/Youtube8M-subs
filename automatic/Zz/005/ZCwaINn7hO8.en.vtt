00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:15.330
Whatoplay presents the Top 10 Xbox One Games
So Far

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.970
Our ranking is not a personal opinion.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.650
It's based on a 1 to 10 score that aggregates
gamers and critics' reviews into a unique

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.270
score called playscore.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.360
Opening at number 10 is Mortal Kombat X

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.050
Undoubtedly, the defining one in the series

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.930
MKX may be the prime of its franchise, but
it does come with flaws!

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.160
Shameless micro-transactions
and inconsistent character models.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.730
Still, it's one hell-of-a-game!

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.980
More shocking fatalities
slick visuals

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.780
an interesting story
Enjoyable online play

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.500
And several new fighters!

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.810
Plus you get to play 3 different versions
of each character!

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.120
How cool is that?

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.350
A playscore of 8.6

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.890
9th place is Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.180
Lara is back!

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.899
It's - more or less - the same game.. with
added boost in quality and a multiplayer mode

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.050
is a joy on the Xbox One.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.470
I love the realistic character progression.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.810
Lara starts off innocent and clean - Then
eventually gets ruthless and dirty.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.069
The plot and supporting characters need a
bit of work.

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:24.619
But the action, the tomb raiding, dungeons
challenges and relic hunting were stellar!

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.259
A playscore of 8.7

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.259
Number 8 is Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First
Sin.

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.179
I thought this was a new DLC for Dark Souls
2.

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.130
Boy was I wrong.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.400
It's a repackage of the original DS2!

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.369
Complete with the Crown Trilogy DLC, remastered
visuals and 60 frames per second goodness.

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.750
Oh, and tons of improvements in its core and
online play.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.920
...But beware!

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.380
Much like the original, it's one tough game
to crack!

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.300
A playscore of 8.7

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.930
Ranked 7th is Forza Horizon 2

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.429
It's an open-world racer set in Southern Europe...and
if you played the first game, this is three

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:08.950
times bigger!

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.650
You have a choice of more than 200 cars, each
distinct and carefully-designed.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.490
The races are fun and exciting.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.360
The visuals are gorgeous, especially at night!

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.860
And, most of all, pesky micro-transactions
are no more!

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.799
Stunning scenery and engine revving.

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.260
What a contrast.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.159
A playscore of 8.7.

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.819
Number 6 is Dragon Age: Inquisition

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.379
More on BioWare's good points with some shortcomings.

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.810
Inquisition's world is one sight to behold
- vast and majestic.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.310
It has a wonderful cast of interesting characters!

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.970
You'll find yourself spending a lot of time
talking to them...and even getting occasional

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.500
laughs.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.510
Combat can be tedious.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.849
And...yes, there are some bugs.

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.599
But not enough to hinder you from enjoying
the game!

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.060
A playscore of 8.7

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.890
5th place is Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.200
The most visually-appealing Lord of the Rings
game so far.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.890
It's open-world appears massive and there
are many orcs for you to slay!

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.780
The combat animations are exceptionally fluid.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.520
With the Nemesis system, you'll never get
bored fighting the same foe again and again!

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.469
I urge you to follow through the main quests
first.

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.630
Powerful abilities don't appear until halfway
through the story!

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.209
A playscore of 8.7

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.359
Ranked 4th is Minecraft: Xbox One Edition

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.849
With a whopping 36x larger world compared
to the 360 version!

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.400
This edition makes you want to explore and
build even more.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.470
Offering a boundless potential on creativity.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.310
Minecraft is the perfect game for the creative
minds.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.010
Sharper visuals and a 60 fps upgrade, hunting
for ingredients or building has never been

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.470
this smooth.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.489
This game never ceases to amaze me.

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.549
A playscore of 8.8

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.870
Number 3 is Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.799
After 2 years of patching, Diablo III finally
reached its full potential!

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.090
Ultimate Evil Edition plays and looks fantastic.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.719
It's packaged with the Repears of Soul DLC!

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:16.959
Adventure mode is addicting!

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.709
A 1080p resolution, with an almost constant
60 fps.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.910
And most bugs that plagued D3 on its release
have been patched!

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.020
I found a problem, though.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.460
Some classes aren't suited for solo play.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.720
A playscore of 8.8

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.560
2nd best is Ori and the Blind Forest

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.440
One of the most compelling games I ever played.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.539
It looks gorgeous and playing it is so rewarding.

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.479
The intro was emotional and left me speechless

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.509
If you love puzzles and games with meaningful
stories, this is it!

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.840
beautiful graphics
solid platforming

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.660
and the soundtrack - perfect!

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.880
But it can be frustrating at times...

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.039
Difficulty is uneven and some levels play
like a trial-and-error.

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.130
A playscore of 8.8

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.620
And the best is Grand Theft Auto V

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.080
Smashing record sales, garnering almost every
kind of award, getting high praises, and even

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.840
violent criticisms, GTA 5 is one hell of a
game!

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.280
Set in Los Santos City, a detailed and expansive
virtual playground for anarchy.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.280
GTA 5 boasts the best writing and voice acting
done in video games so far.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.080
with breathtaking visuals
a new first-person mode.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.280
and thrilling heists missions.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.730
Grand Theft Auto V is the top with a playscore
of 9.0

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.310
To recap, here are the 10 best Xbox One Games
So Far
