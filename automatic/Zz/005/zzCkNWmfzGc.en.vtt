think this is a really amazing

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.610 
think this is a really amazing
lightweight<00:01:50.000> serum<00:01:50.270> he<00:01:51.140> wants<00:01:51.440> to<00:01:51.530> use

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
lightweight serum he wants to use

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.410 
lightweight serum he wants to use
something<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:52.400> gives<00:01:52.580> you<00:01:52.760> a<00:01:52.790> little<00:01:53.180> bit<00:01:53.270> of

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
something that gives you a little bit of

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.750 
something that gives you a little bit of
gloss<00:01:53.690> and<00:01:53.960> shine<00:01:54.010> that<00:01:55.010> doesn't<00:01:55.490> weigh<00:01:55.610> your

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
gloss and shine that doesn't weigh your

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.840 
gloss and shine that doesn't weigh your
hair<00:01:55.820> down<00:01:56.110> so<00:01:57.110> I've<00:01:57.530> been<00:01:57.860> absolutely<00:01:58.160> loving

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
hair down so I've been absolutely loving

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.300 
hair down so I've been absolutely loving
this<00:01:58.880> one<00:01:59.180> and<00:01:59.470> you<00:02:00.470> know<00:02:00.590> it's<00:02:00.890> not<00:02:01.070> too

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
this one and you know it's not too

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.880 
this one and you know it's not too
expensive<00:02:01.570> it<00:02:02.570> doesn't<00:02:02.900> feel<00:02:03.020> overly<00:02:03.620> greasy

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
expensive it doesn't feel overly greasy

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.910 
expensive it doesn't feel overly greasy
like<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.370> lot<00:02:04.580> of<00:02:04.730> serums<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:05.540> but<00:02:06.470> you<00:02:06.590> know<00:02:06.710> it

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
like a lot of serums and but you know it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.819 
like a lot of serums and but you know it
gives<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.280> same<00:02:07.490> effect<00:02:07.610> so<00:02:08.209> I<00:02:08.450> think<00:02:08.829> it's

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:09.829 
gives the same effect so I think it's

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.830 
gives the same effect so I think it's
quite<00:02:10.069> rare<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.399> find<00:02:10.609> a<00:02:11.030> good<00:02:11.239> lightweight

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
quite rare to find a good lightweight

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.080 
quite rare to find a good lightweight
serum<00:02:12.109> and<00:02:12.439> this<00:02:12.680> is<00:02:12.799> one<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.010> them<00:02:13.189> if<00:02:13.819> I<00:02:14.030> get

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
serum and this is one of them if I get

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.520 
serum and this is one of them if I get
really<00:02:14.450> dry<00:02:14.780> patches

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
really dry patches

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.130 
really dry patches
skin<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:16.180> quite<00:02:17.180> like<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.480> slather<00:02:17.660> on<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.900> bit<00:02:18.050> of

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.790 
skin I quite like to slather on a bit of
a<00:02:18.319> 45<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.490> is<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.510> really<00:02:21.260> intensive

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
a 45 and this is the really intensive

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.370 
a 45 and this is the really intensive
cream<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.730> comes<00:02:22.940> in<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.120> massive<00:02:23.330> tub<00:02:23.690> it's

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
cream and it comes in a massive tub it's

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.400 
cream and it comes in a massive tub it's
unscented<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.730> know<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.209> it's<00:02:26.450> not<00:02:26.780> luxurious

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
unscented you know so it's not luxurious

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.140 
unscented you know so it's not luxurious
but<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:27.950> don't<00:02:28.459> know<00:02:28.520> whether<00:02:28.670> anyone<00:02:29.000> else

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
but I don't know whether anyone else

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.660 
but I don't know whether anyone else
gets<00:02:29.390> dry<00:02:29.660> shins<00:02:30.080> during<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.620> winter<00:02:30.980> or<00:02:31.220> as

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
gets dry shins during the winter or as

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.880 
gets dry shins during the winter or as
winter<00:02:32.000> starts<00:02:32.239> but<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.170> do<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.739> I<00:02:33.860> think

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
winter starts but I do and I think

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.740 
winter starts but I do and I think
that's<00:02:34.190> because<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.520> actually<00:02:35.120> probably

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
that's because of actually probably

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.780 
that's because of actually probably
wearing<00:02:36.020> jeans<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.950> then<00:02:37.069> socks<00:02:37.370> underneath

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
wearing jeans and then socks underneath

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.750 
wearing jeans and then socks underneath

generally too many layers and central

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.229 
generally too many layers and central
heating<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:42.980> that<00:02:43.130> kind<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.370> thing<00:02:43.459> that<00:02:43.730> this
