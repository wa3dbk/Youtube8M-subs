00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
open and the back man door open thinking

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.820 
open and the back man door open thinking
he<00:01:23.759> would<00:01:23.850> enjoy<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.360> warm<00:01:24.750> breeze<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.439> he's

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
he would enjoy the warm breeze and he's

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.550 
he would enjoy the warm breeze and he's
fast<00:01:26.189> he<00:01:26.610> did<00:01:26.820> not<00:01:26.970> like<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.049> shut<00:01:28.380> them

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
fast he did not like that so I shut them

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.580 
fast he did not like that so I shut them
and<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:29.579> he<00:01:29.729> was<00:01:29.850> calm<00:01:30.090> again<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:31.110> think<00:01:31.350> he

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and then he was calm again so I think he

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.670 
and then he was calm again so I think he
was<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:31.950> terrified<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.520> being<00:01:32.700> outside<00:01:33.619> so<00:01:34.619> I

was just terrified of being outside so I

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.319
