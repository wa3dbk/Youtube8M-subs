understand they have huge huge number of
followers<00:01:02.719> so<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.899> was<00:01:04.080> likely<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.739> people

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
followers so it was likely that people

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.730 
followers so it was likely that people
went<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:06.060> them<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.510> opposed<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.350> see<00:01:07.530> me

I guess I've just given you more of a
chance<00:04:28.090> because<00:04:28.419> when<00:04:28.660> I<00:04:28.690> first<00:04:28.960> saw<00:04:29.949> you<00:04:29.979> in

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
action doing your thing it was it was on

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.309

in<00:04:35.440> that<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:36.039> guess<00:04:36.220> it's<00:04:36.400> hard<00:04:36.580> not<00:04:36.789> to<00:04:36.819> see

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
in that and I guess it's hard not to see

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.510 
in that and I guess it's hard not to see
it<00:04:37.810> as<00:04:38.050> being<00:04:38.080> pretentious<00:04:38.620> at<00:04:38.949> first<00:04:39.190> but

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520

this was opposite lovable and I by the

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.700 
this was opposite lovable and I by the
way<00:04:42.970> I<00:04:43.030> said<00:04:43.300> that<00:04:43.419> was<00:04:43.509> my<00:04:43.660> first<00:04:43.840> opinion<00:04:44.229> and

not because to find out that you're

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.809 
not because to find out that you're
wrong<00:05:24.880> and<00:05:25.120> to<00:05:25.210> acknowledge<00:05:25.360> that<00:05:25.840> is<00:05:26.819> showing

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:27.819 
wrong and to acknowledge that is showing

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:30.089 
wrong and to acknowledge that is showing
that<00:05:28.000> you<00:05:28.270> understand<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:29.110> right<00:05:29.800> way<00:05:30.069> of

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
that you understand the right way of

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.240 
that you understand the right way of
things<00:05:30.460> or<00:05:30.849> the<00:05:31.509> better<00:05:32.009> alternative<00:05:33.009> and

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
things or the better alternative and

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.010 
things or the better alternative and
that's<00:05:33.310> a<00:05:33.520> positive<00:05:33.729> surely<00:05:34.509> it's<00:05:34.750> like

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
that's a positive surely it's like

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.370 
that's a positive surely it's like
prejudice<00:05:35.680> and<00:05:35.889> discrimination<00:05:36.870> okay<00:05:37.870> to<00:05:38.289> be

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
prejudice and discrimination okay to be

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.320 
prejudice and discrimination okay to be
prejudice<00:05:38.889> is<00:05:39.099> not<00:05:39.370> necessarily<00:05:40.000> a<00:05:40.120> bad<00:05:40.270> thing

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
prejudice is not necessarily a bad thing

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.110 
prejudice is not necessarily a bad thing
we<00:05:41.320> need<00:05:41.560> it<00:05:41.740> to<00:05:41.770> differentiate<00:05:42.520> between<00:05:42.880> good

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
we need it to differentiate between good

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.080 
we need it to differentiate between good
and<00:05:43.449> bad<00:05:43.479> in<00:05:43.630> life<00:05:44.020> but<00:05:44.979> discrimination<00:05:45.940> is

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
and bad in life but discrimination is

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.779 
and bad in life but discrimination is
when<00:05:46.960> you<00:05:47.050> take<00:05:47.080> action<00:05:47.860> on<00:05:48.009> those<00:05:48.430> thoughts

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
when you take action on those thoughts

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.899 
when you take action on those thoughts
sometimes<00:05:49.060> and<00:05:49.860> obviously<00:05:50.860> some<00:05:51.310> people<00:05:51.759> have

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:51.909 
sometimes and obviously some people have

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:54.390 
sometimes and obviously some people have
prejudice<00:05:52.419> which<00:05:52.719> are<00:05:52.990> deemed<00:05:53.889> as<00:05:54.070> irrational

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
prejudice which are deemed as irrational

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.820 
prejudice which are deemed as irrational
and<00:05:54.930> he<00:05:55.930> may<00:05:56.080> have<00:05:56.169> heard<00:05:56.349> that<00:05:56.380> term<00:05:56.770> before

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
and he may have heard that term before

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.810 
and he may have heard that term before
and<00:05:57.490> therefore<00:05:58.240> they<00:05:58.539> discriminate<00:05:59.580> just<00:06:00.580> in

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
and therefore they discriminate just in

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.469 
and therefore they discriminate just in
ways<00:06:01.120> that<00:06:01.150> are<00:06:01.719> not<00:06:02.080> very<00:06:02.949> acceptable<00:06:03.880> so<00:06:04.330> all

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
ways that are not very acceptable so all

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.330 
ways that are not very acceptable so all
I'm<00:06:04.630> saying<00:06:04.930> is<00:06:05.110> like<00:06:05.289> Ian<00:06:05.560> Lee<00:06:05.740> said<00:06:06.009> to<00:06:06.039> me<00:06:06.219> on

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
I'm saying is like Ian Lee said to me on

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.279

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.250 
by having that attitude we're gonna be
walking<00:06:29.560> towards<00:06:30.070> solutions<00:06:30.250> and<00:06:31.169> we're<00:06:32.169> not

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.260
