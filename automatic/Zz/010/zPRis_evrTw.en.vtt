good entertainment experience inside the
droid<00:01:06.390> razr<00:01:06.450> maxx<00:01:06.840> because<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> super

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
droid razr maxx because you have a super

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.950 
droid razr maxx because you have a super
amoled<00:01:08.340> display<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:09.510> as<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> high

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
amoled display it's not as the high

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.109 
amoled display it's not as the high
resolution<00:01:10.229> as<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.010> get<00:01:11.189> from<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> Galaxy

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
resolution as you get from the Galaxy

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.060 
resolution as you get from the Galaxy
Nexus<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:13.110> do<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.830> know<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
Nexus but we do like the you know the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.499 
Nexus but we do like the you know the
viewing<00:01:14.369> angles<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> color<00:01:15.299> saturation

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
viewing angles and the color saturation

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.050 
viewing angles and the color saturation
is<00:01:16.080> pretty<00:01:16.530> good<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.280> we'll<00:01:17.549> take<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.759> look<00:01:17.909> at

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
is pretty good so we'll take a look at

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.320 
is pretty good so we'll take a look at
what<00:01:18.090> some<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> content<00:01:19.110> looks<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.500> so

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
what some of the content looks like so

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.940 
what some of the content looks like so
for<00:01:21.330> example<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.780> droid<00:01:22.020> razr<00:01:22.200> maxx<00:01:22.590> comes

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
for example the droid razr maxx comes

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.730 
for example the droid razr maxx comes
preloaded<00:01:23.369> with<00:01:23.670> anna<00:01:24.000> madden<00:01:24.570> NFL<00:01:24.990> 12<00:01:27.740> you

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
preloaded with anna madden NFL 12 you

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.929 
preloaded with anna madden NFL 12 you
can<00:01:28.860> see<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> speakers<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.700> printing

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
can see that the speakers are printing

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.730 
can see that the speakers are printing
allowed<00:01:30.150> to

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.940 

I'm<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.160> resume<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> game

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.499 

which<00:01:40.549> gives<00:01:40.789> you<00:01:40.850> an<00:01:40.909> example<00:01:41.149> of<00:01:41.329> what<00:01:41.390> you

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
which gives you an example of what you

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:42.819 
which gives you an example of what you
can<00:01:41.600> get<00:01:41.810> in<00:01:41.960> terms<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.259> graphics<00:01:42.469> performance

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
can get in terms of graphics performance

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.679 
can get in terms of graphics performance
this<00:01:43.310> is<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.520> 1.2<00:01:44.060> gigahertz<00:01:44.329> dual-core

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
this is a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.319 
this is a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
processor<00:01:45.439> on<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.590> inside<00:01:45.939> and<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:47.060> gig<00:01:47.210> of

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.330 
processor on the inside and the gig of
ram<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.409> certainly<00:01:48.710> have<00:01:48.979> a<00:01:49.009> lot<00:01:49.189> of

ram so you certainly have a lot of
horsepower<00:01:49.700> here<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:51.770> if<00:01:52.219> you<00:01:52.250> go<00:01:52.429> back

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
horsepower here and if you go back

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.200 
horsepower here and if you go back

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
motorola you know it also includes a lot
