them compete has been one of our biggest
products<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.900> really<00:03:13.680> help<00:03:14.609> settle<00:03:15.090> down<00:03:15.209> the

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
products to really help settle down the

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.210 
products to really help settle down the
skin<00:03:15.599> and<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.900> can<00:03:15.930> actually<00:03:16.380> keep<00:03:16.620> going<00:03:17.130> and

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
skin and you can actually keep going and

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.069 
skin and you can actually keep going and
going<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:17.730> what<00:03:18.209> we<00:03:18.359> would<00:03:18.480> normally<00:03:18.630> do<00:03:18.959> is

absolutely like an extra layer skiing

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.540 
absolutely like an extra layer skiing
it's<00:03:28.320> got<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.500> really<00:03:28.710> nice<00:03:28.920> smooth<00:03:29.340> edge

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
it's got a really nice smooth edge

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.330 
it's got a really nice smooth edge
around<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:31.050> bit<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.530> extra<00:03:31.770> padding<00:03:31.980> in<00:03:32.220> the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
around it a bit of extra padding in the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.820 
around it a bit of extra padding in the
middle<00:03:32.610> now<00:03:33.210> that<00:03:33.600> can<00:03:33.780> actually<00:03:34.110> stay<00:03:34.410> on<00:03:34.440> for

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
middle now that can actually stay on for

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.950 
middle now that can actually stay on for
a<00:03:34.860> number<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.190> days<00:03:35.400> such<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:35.940> good<00:03:36.150> product<00:03:36.420> we

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
a number of days such a good product we

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.690 
a number of days such a good product we
might<00:03:37.140> need<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.350> replace<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:38.070> over<00:03:38.460> the<00:03:38.550> top

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
might need to replace this over the top

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.330 
might need to replace this over the top
we'll<00:03:38.880> make<00:03:39.060> sure<00:03:39.270> it<00:03:39.360> does<00:03:39.540> stay<00:03:40.230> on<00:03:40.470> but<00:03:41.160> that

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
we'll make sure it does stay on but that

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.570 
we'll make sure it does stay on but that
will<00:03:41.490> just<00:03:41.520> fit<00:03:42.420> straight<00:03:42.780> over<00:03:43.050> the<00:03:43.140> top<00:03:43.580> and

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
will just fit straight over the top and

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.860 
will just fit straight over the top and
this<00:03:44.700> is<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.910> routine<00:03:45.209> you'll<00:03:45.390> go<00:03:45.510> through<00:03:45.540> with

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
this is a routine you'll go through with

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.290 
this is a routine you'll go through with
with<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.650> lot<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:46.920> players<00:03:47.190> before<00:03:47.490> mattress
