00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
like an imaginary free free room when

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.340 
like an imaginary free free room when
you're<00:02:59.930> doing<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.200> rim<00:03:00.380> free<00:03:01.010> hand<00:03:01.220> here<00:03:05.350> when

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
you're doing the rim free hand here when

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.110 
you're doing the rim free hand here when
you're<00:03:06.440> doing<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.829> I'm<00:03:07.549> doing<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.940> same

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
you're doing that I'm doing the same

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.420 
you're doing that I'm doing the same
thing<00:03:08.329> here<00:03:11.530> I'm<00:03:12.530> pretending<00:03:12.920> there's<00:03:13.190> a<00:03:13.250> rim

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
thing here I'm pretending there's a rim

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.080 
thing here I'm pretending there's a rim
there<00:03:13.670> but<00:03:13.819> I'm<00:03:13.910> not<00:03:14.030> using<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.450> room<00:03:16.090> so

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
there but I'm not using the room so

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.640 
there but I'm not using the room so
you'll<00:03:17.269> see<00:03:17.420> that<00:03:17.569> my<00:03:17.720> arm<00:03:17.930> actually<00:03:18.290> moves<00:03:18.500> a

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
you'll see that my arm actually moves a

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.930 
you'll see that my arm actually moves a
lot<00:03:18.769> of<00:03:18.920> people<00:03:19.160> don't<00:03:19.340> show<00:03:19.519> you<00:03:19.579> that<00:03:19.790> there

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
lot of people don't show you that there

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.090 
lot of people don't show you that there
are<00:03:20.030> much<00:03:20.209> you<00:03:20.359> move<00:03:20.510> yes<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:20.989> does<00:03:21.200> when

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
are much you move yes it does when

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.819 
are much you move yes it does when
you're<00:03:22.220> doing<00:03:22.489> that<00:03:22.810> so<00:03:23.810> basically<00:03:24.680> even

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
you're doing that so basically even

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:40.550 
you're doing that so basically even
trying<00:03:25.220> to

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.839 

and<00:03:41.560> I<00:03:41.620> got<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:41.860> stop<00:03:42.010> watching<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.400> camera<00:03:42.730> to

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
and I got to stop watching the camera to

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.789 
and I got to stop watching the camera to
see<00:03:42.970> it<00:03:43.030> I'm<00:03:43.120> doing<00:03:43.269> so<00:03:43.599> if<00:03:44.349> you<00:03:44.440> don't<00:03:44.620> hear

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
see it I'm doing so if you don't hear

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:56.970 
see it I'm doing so if you don't hear
sticks<00:03:45.159> watch<00:03:45.340> your<00:03:45.519> stick<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:56.560> I'm<00:03:56.680> moving

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
sticks watch your stick and I'm moving

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.440 
sticks watch your stick and I'm moving
forward<00:03:57.370> just<00:03:57.400> kind<00:03:57.700> of<00:03:57.730> for<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:57.940> oxidants

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
forward just kind of for the oxidants

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.210 
forward just kind of for the oxidants
and<00:03:58.510> stuff<00:03:58.720> like<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:59.110> so<00:03:59.650> that<00:03:59.799> just<00:04:00.069> shows

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
and stuff like that so that just shows

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.920 
and stuff like that so that just shows
