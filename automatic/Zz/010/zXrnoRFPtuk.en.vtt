00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.490
 small small credentials that puts 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.440

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.660
 see if the incredible use is 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.830
 the highest thing in the world 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.020
 exactly then an icing sugar a white 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.030
 of egg it is not too bad of slackers 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.279
 no it's impressive is said that 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.480

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.829
 drops of lemon juice 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:45.360
 it is always very easy it was 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:47.550
 not to mix one says oneself so few whites 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.460
 of egg in this amount of sugar that 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.750
 will never work if it will work but in 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.489
 do you go see it is enough 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.440
 surprising 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.390
 it breaks it goes yes that's the frosting 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.680
 and finish very fast while they 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.660

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.639
 must say that we will dig our film 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.469
 food on the surface but really 

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:11.670
 in contact with the frosting then filmed at 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.020
 contact is sure always interesting 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.520
