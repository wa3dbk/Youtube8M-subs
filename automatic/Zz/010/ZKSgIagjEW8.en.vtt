00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.330
 I prepare a second course really 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.490
 elegant in rabbit overhangs 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.860
 stuffed baked with a capable of 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.299
 porcini mushrooms start as fresh onion 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.780
 in a non-stick pan with a wire 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.160
 oil 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.250
 obviously the hated trunks 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.750
 otherwise it became a cream then touches 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.530
 peeled and chopped carrots too 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.570
 this cubes will be half cooked 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.040
 last obviously celery too 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.290
 this peeled to remove the filaments 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.180
 interior cut into small pieces and will be enough 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.130
 23 minutes of cooking to get to 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.540
 have all the vegetables rather than the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.190
 tooth also because they will then go to 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.780
 cook in the foil 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.490
 so we stuff too frying 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.940
 pinch of salt and pass directly 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.410
 to the charge and above all cd 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.820
 rise from April with the knife and then 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.440
 the buttons to get one 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.680
 homogeneous thickness therefore a kind of 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.480
 rabbit sheet I take a film 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.340
 I put three slices of colonnata lard 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.320
 which I will need for flavor and 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.579
 protect the meat from cooking and make 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.320
 so that it does not become too dry 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.750
 too stringy and I go to prepare the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.820
 my bundle salt pepper on the meat le 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.500
 vegetables skip a few pieces of 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.240
 sausage so that the fat release 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.100
 and it has more flavor even in the middle of 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.140
 my roll and some cut olive 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.690
 burnt in oil and if you want some 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.700
 scent of finocchiaro on the roll the 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.560
 all they get satta of candy 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.360
 this will allow me to compact well 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.280
 the meat does not let the juices go too far 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.049
 and ensure that the oven has not suffered 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.580
 after my bundle because of the meat of 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.130
 rabbit is known if it was too much 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.990
 becomes the opposite place this year in 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.760
 oven at 190 degrees for about 18 20 minutes 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.640
 at the end of cooking I rest the meat 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.470
 five minutes out of the oven the waste 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.140
 and the oblique cut into three trunks 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.909
 regular one standing and 2 resting on 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.280
 she cried so as to show the shelf well 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.409
 the sky as we combine it in a manner 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.939
 a very simple porcini carpaccio 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.100
 obviously it must be well compact and 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.930
 very clean, very fine cut and then 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.700
 sprayed with the cooking base which 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.229
 remains in the cartoccio added by a 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.450
 little bit of salt pepper oil and if you want 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.430
 more fennel so that it is hot 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.689
 can frost both the rabbit and the 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.689
 elegant porcino no 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.280
 the mystery 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
 Yup 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.250
 I tried
