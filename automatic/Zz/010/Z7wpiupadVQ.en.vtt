00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160 

okay<00:02:19.160> so<00:02:19.220> here's<00:02:20.060> kind<00:02:20.300> of<00:02:20.330> what<00:02:20.450> I'm<00:02:20.569> doing<00:02:20.959> um

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
okay so here's kind of what I'm doing um

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.699 
okay so here's kind of what I'm doing um
let's<00:02:21.950> scale<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.310> I'm<00:02:22.400> kind<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.640> using<00:02:23.709> go

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
let's scale that I'm kind of using go

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.250 
let's scale that I'm kind of using go
figure<00:02:24.920> it's<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.340> minor<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:25.880> use<00:02:26.720> this<00:02:26.870> one<00:02:27.050> all

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
figure it's a minor I use this one all

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.070 
figure it's a minor I use this one all
the<00:02:27.290> time

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
the time

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.690 
the time
I'm<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:30.290> get<00:02:30.380> uh<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.709> could<00:02:30.830> also<00:02:30.950> be<00:02:31.100> G<00:02:31.459> major

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
I'm you get uh it could also be G major

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.930 
I'm you get uh it could also be G major
D<00:02:32.090> mixolydian<00:02:32.709> but<00:02:33.709> um<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.340> just<00:02:34.610> think<00:02:34.790> it

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
D mixolydian but um I just think it

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.090 
D mixolydian but um I just think it
sounds<00:02:34.970> better<00:02:35.300> over<00:02:35.630> an<00:02:38.320> e4<00:02:39.320> on<00:02:39.530> its<00:02:39.770> pirate

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
sounds better over an e4 on its pirate

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.390 
sounds better over an e4 on its pirate
pig<00:02:40.550> so<00:02:41.140> slow<00:02:42.140> up<00:02:42.320> close<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.950> this

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.180 

and<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:48.269> kind<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.720> weird<00:02:48.930> vibe<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:49.950> when

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
and it's kind of a weird vibe to it when

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.720 
and it's kind of a weird vibe to it when
it's<00:02:50.310> slow<00:02:50.730> fast<00:02:51.209> 30

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.339 

so<00:02:56.730> what<00:02:56.849> I'm<00:02:56.939> doing<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.629> go<00:02:57.810> from<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.109> tenth

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
so what I'm doing is I go from the tenth

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.500 
so what I'm doing is I go from the tenth
fret<00:02:58.590> on<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.819> B<00:02:59.969> string

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
fret on the B string

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.500 
fret on the B string
and<00:03:00.689> I<00:03:01.290> hammer<00:03:01.499> on<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.950> twelfth<00:03:02.389> and<00:03:03.389> then

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
and I hammer on to the twelfth and then
