won't mess up and have to record it
again<00:00:19.289> okay<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.779> it's<00:00:21.779> just<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.020> very<00:00:22.050> casual

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
again okay so it's just a very casual

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.269 
again okay so it's just a very casual
day<00:00:22.769> for<00:00:23.010> me<00:00:23.300> this<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.480> like<00:00:24.570> my<00:00:25.160> you<00:00:26.160> know

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
day for me this is like my you know

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.880 
day for me this is like my you know
casual<00:00:27.000> look<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.300> guess<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:28.170> no<00:00:28.380> idea<00:00:28.740> if

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
casual look I guess I have no idea if

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.910 
casual look I guess I have no idea if
this<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.099> actually<00:00:29.519> considered<00:00:30.029> casual<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.769> if

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
this is actually considered casual so if

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.100 
this is actually considered casual so if
you<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.189> let<00:00:32.340> me<00:00:32.489> know<00:00:32.660> but<00:00:33.660> it's<00:00:33.809> really

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
you can let me know but it's really

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.410 
you can let me know but it's really
difficult<00:00:34.440> for<00:00:34.800> me<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.250> do<00:00:35.460> casual<00:00:36.030> looks

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
difficult for me to do casual looks

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.790 
difficult for me to do casual looks
because<00:00:36.809> I'm<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.200> used<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.649> over<00:00:37.950> dressing<00:00:39.800> but

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
