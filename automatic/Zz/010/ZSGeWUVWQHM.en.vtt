00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.720
Hello everyone.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.720
I - Max_Bally.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:15.539
And today is my review is dedicated to no
one, and the whole three games from the category

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:16.539
of PSP Minis.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.210
This three games of the series Carnivores.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.230
Here, look:

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.180
Carnivores Dinosaur Hunter

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.910
Carnivores Ice Age

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:33.489
And Carnivores Dinosaur Hunter v2

00:00:33.489 --> 00:01:03.060
Well, well, let's go.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:10.450
*click*

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:21.380
So, was the first to Carnivores Dinosaur Hunter
in 2010.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.800
It was a port of the old Carnivores 2.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.960
It was originally made for iPhones.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:37.010
But soon, after a couple of months, has been
released and for the PSP in the form of mini-games.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.910
In fact, in the game we were five large-scale
locations, nine different kinds of dinosaurs,

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.280
and seven kinds of weapons.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.170
Each dinosaur their habits, their level of
sensitivity and level of danger.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.780
So are we in the hands of a given pair of
binoculars, a map and a compass.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:07.300
Honestly to say, the compass to navigate have
been impossible, but on the map you can see

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.300
only themselves.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.260
Still in the game there is a system of trophies.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.260
So, the maps.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.890
Most of the maps were practically totally
flat, although they had massifs.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.300
In the air there pterodactyls, which kept
their wings straight.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.560
There was very little vegetation.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.440
In order to find the dinosaur, to which you
went to hunt it was necessary to spend a lot

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.440
of time.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.810
The game was a bit underdeveloped, although
very interesting.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.730
Then, in 2011, was released Carnivores Ice
Age.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:46.010
He carried in itself a number of changes and
had some plot.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.760
In the game, as well as in its predecessor
was only five cards, and seven types of weapons,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.620
but now was not nine, and ten species of animals
to hunt.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.670
The most dangerous was the Yeti.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.670
What has been changed?

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.000
Was decorated with a compass, although it
is still pointing to nowhere, the locations

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.500
became more hilly, the beasts of the more
dangerous weapons, more accurate, and most

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500
importantly:

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.160
now you can navigate on the map, because the
animal, on which you hunt was обзначено

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.440
on the map of the red dot.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.989
The developers decided to make fun of the
players and made all the animals aggressive.

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.410
Here, for example, you choose the simplest
animal and you say, that it is safe, but in

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.360
actual fact, when you come into his field
of vision, he immediately resorted to tread

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.360
you to death.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.360
System trophies are there.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.450
In general, the game became more comfortable
and colorful.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.530
And now Carnivores Dinosaur Hunter v2

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.800
Now you might ask: "What is the difference
between Carnivores Dinosaur Hunter and Carnivores

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.330
Dinosaur Hunter v2?"

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:55.390
Well, actually this is a reissue of Carnivores
Dinosaur Hunter, transferred to the engine

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.390
Ice Age.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.390
She went in the same 2011.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.390
But the changes were the following:

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.880
Was better landscape, now he is more like
a landscape from the Ice Age.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.880
Was improved management.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.880
New sounds for weapons.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.260
Were added options with sensitivity and settings
inversion axis, which were in the Ice Age.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.810
As an exclusive for the Minis-version of the
game was added to the Laser Rifle.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.500
As in the Ice Age it was possible to navigate
on the map.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.780
Have changed the habits of some species of
lizards.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.070
In general, Tatem Games worked for the glory.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.170
All three games are very interesting.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:39.130
Everywhere wonderful graphics, I am sorry
I only from audio only the dispatcher's voice

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.710
on the radio.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.510
I certainly recommend this game to everyone,
especially those who remember this game even

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.510
with the PC.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.050
Well, with you was Max_Bally.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.430
I wish you all a successful hunt.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.780
Bye.
