00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:03.689
 the Brazilian consumes 8 billion liters per year 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.370
 beer delivers 60 thousand people and moves 10 billion reais per year 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.599
 in Brazil 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.949
 is for example the budget value of the Ministry of Health 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.480
 I was half a percent of GDP 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.069
 gross domestic debt 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:26.069
 but you know what beer is made of 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.380
 look only the raw material of our lourinhã 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.450
 affected 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.309
 relative of wheat barley is a grass cultivated during the winter 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.360
 - em vacaria in the sierra gaúcha one of the colder places of brazil 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.809
 this crop was planted in July 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.809
 and now December is harvest time 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.250
 here productivity reaches three thousand and 600 kilos per hectare hari 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.510
 24% above national average 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.290
 in addition to barley farmers can plant other crops using the same 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.780
 machinery 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.990
 Aries equal this 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.350
 wheat barley and white oats not 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.940
 are counted in the first sequence 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.360
 the white web after the aloe makes what 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.260
 the Brazilian production of being barred is concentrated in the great river of the south 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
 santa catarina and to naia 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.520
 in this small farmer are little more than 80 thousand cultivated hectares 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.350
 this year they must leave the fields two hundred and thirty-three thousand and comments 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.100
 tons of barley 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.110
 almost double the production of last year and all these grains are already 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.120
 sold 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.660
 This is because when the farmer buys seeds for planting he has already closed a 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.570
 production sale agreement 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.500
 for the large breweries 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.640
 when the farmer is missing 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.790
 the barley 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.830
 but already 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.250
 of contract what I did there u seem to me that both obesity first descent 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.210
 the second 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.250
 in brown celebratory tone 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.430
 a parameter 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.970
 in the city there is then we take a technology and know that it is going to reap 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.750
 in place goes with god neither will receive it a predetermined amount are dolls 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.020
 60 is a very good good alternative for winter culture 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.139
 until turning beer weight loss program of a long course 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:28.099
 barley covers only one third of the 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.880
 beer 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.780
 and it would not help the farmers planted and much more because that way 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.950
 would be with transform is seated in a bucket all over Brazil there are 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.310
 only four maltarias a beautiful party here in the municipality of guarapuava in the 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.310
 parana 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.840
 as soon as truck arrived with barley 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.300
 a sample goes to the laboratory where the germination test is done 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:02.369
 of each hundred seeds at least 95 try to sprout for which affected is approved 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.790
 is with this denomination was affected the malt life 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.159
 Fear of late morning protein in unit are also analyzed 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.209
 if the barley does not pass the test recording instead of beer 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.120
 the orange banners and inject air-compressed into these huge ones so 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.349
 to wash the beans 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.739
 affected will absorb water is essential for germination 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.749
 affected festival will mahut 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:47.099
 in this range determination 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.919
 two hundred and sixty tons of barley 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.489
 Let's generate two hundred and twenty mahut 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.489
 a process that takes from 4 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:59.809
 in the community controlled temperatures 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:03.230
 He's there. 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.839
 is already a multiplayer 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:09.869
 the fear the grain will be formed and the shoots will fall so the multi will become 

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:11.059
 ready 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:15.399
 or something like the barley grains edimar great look alike 

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:16.220
 looks 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.070
 but always they that there was a great difference of structure the lay person to 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.210
 The easiest way to find out if they broke the barley malt is to start 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.139
 it's mine 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.080
 and there is no breaking the fish 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.080
 was separated to do the program by death 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:38.599
 now the season or rather an authentic one 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.849
 not only to follow a new trip 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.849
 a brewery 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.550
 only this factory of one of the largest breweries in Brazil process 150 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.979
 tonnes of malt per 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:58.740
 and daily 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.110
 one million 700
