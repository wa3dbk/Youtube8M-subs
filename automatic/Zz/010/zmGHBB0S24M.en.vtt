00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.240

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.710
 basically what we will have here is the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.559
 template to create our banners and 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.570
 this part is visible only in 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.220

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.170
 on any device you will see 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.880
 this part you are already in a pc or in a 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.560
 tablet from here 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.140

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.280
 and from here on computer ready to 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.690
 society the explanation now let's see 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.880
 this is the part of the banner and it is the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.340
 only one that needs to edit this part 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.880
 it does not matter so they can place what 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.390
 you want so very well I'm going to 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.480
 create my banners for that I have this 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.520
 image of my equal fast personalized 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.620
 by the way if you want to customize your 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.310
 glasses on the screen should be coming out 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.680
 link a video about how to customize 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.909
 my equal easy so very well I'm going to 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.549
 pass this layer here 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.549
 the only thing I do is make it smaller 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.000
 more or less here 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.520
 yes 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.520
 this same image fallito 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.850
 and it happened here 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.150
 I'm going to take away the white background like that 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.799
 sterile earth made the layer the 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.770
 magic wand tool and quito 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.950
 this white background and perfected the edge 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.510
 to remove the traces of pure white 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.510
 that were left 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.730
 delete delete delete and ready now 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.640
 also selected the layer I'm going to 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.020
 Transform and flip horizontal edition 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.020
 and adjusted the size 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.640
 more or less 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.400
 here 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.060
 and would place any text in the 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.060
 medium 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.020
 ty control and adjusted the size 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.070
 nothing more once our 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.350
 banner we give to file what we keep 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.150
 how will I keep it in this case in the 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.150
 desktop in jpg format 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.880
 now we open our YouTube channel 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:21.520
 and now we do not wait here we select 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.100
 edit channel design 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.220
 we go to the tab upload photos and 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.400
 we select the image already created that 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.030
 I left the format in the desktop 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.690
 jpg 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.890
 We wait for it to rise and now we give it 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.890
 to select 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.330
 and nothing else that is all as you will see fit 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.920
 perfectly and I hope that this 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.330
 videotutoriales have served them 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.330
