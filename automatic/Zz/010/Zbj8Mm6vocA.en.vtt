a lot of traveling involved and it's

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.690 
a lot of traveling involved and it's
it's<00:00:19.840> tough<00:00:20.140> to<00:00:20.380> physically<00:00:20.980> and<00:00:21.100> mentally<00:00:21.250> be

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
it's tough to physically and mentally be

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.180 
it's tough to physically and mentally be
ready<00:00:21.730> for<00:00:22.150> every<00:00:22.630> match<00:00:22.810> I<00:00:23.140> think<00:00:23.890> today<00:00:24.160> I

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.190 
ready for every match I think today I

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.240 
ready for every match I think today I
struggled<00:00:24.760> with<00:00:24.880> that<00:00:24.910> a<00:00:25.180> lot<00:00:25.390> but<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:27.130> know

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
struggled with that a lot but you know

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.240 
struggled with that a lot but you know
it's<00:00:27.550> we're<00:00:28.480> all<00:00:28.630> competitive<00:00:29.529> athletes<00:00:30.039> and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
it's we're all competitive athletes and

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.859 
it's we're all competitive athletes and
you<00:00:30.520> know<00:00:30.640> we<00:00:30.880> want<00:00:31.029> to<00:00:31.180> win<00:00:31.359> and<00:00:31.510> I<00:00:31.630> think

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
you know we want to win and I think

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.229 
you know we want to win and I think
that's<00:00:32.050> what<00:00:32.320> drives<00:00:32.559> us<00:00:32.829> to<00:00:33.039> you<00:00:33.789> know<00:00:33.820> train

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
that's what drives us to you know train

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.439 
that's what drives us to you know train
harder<00:00:34.690> and<00:00:34.930> you<00:00:35.140> know<00:00:35.260> be<00:00:35.440> successful<00:00:36.129> I

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
harder and you know be successful I

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.239 
harder and you know be successful I
really<00:00:37.449> i<00:00:37.479> think<00:00:37.659> it's<00:00:37.929> consistency<00:00:38.499> you<00:00:39.159> know

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:39.249 
really i think it's consistency you know

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:41.160 
really i think it's consistency you know
I<00:00:39.280> think<00:00:39.460> is<00:00:39.819> a<00:00:39.850> certain<00:00:40.359> level<00:00:40.510> they're<00:00:40.809> all

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
I think is a certain level they're all

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.189 
I think is a certain level they're all
the<00:00:41.350> guys<00:00:41.530> hit<00:00:41.769> the<00:00:41.890> ball<00:00:42.069> really<00:00:42.339> well<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:44.050> it

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
the guys hit the ball really well but it

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.200 
the guys hit the ball really well but it
comes<00:00:44.409> down<00:00:44.530> to<00:00:44.859> guys<00:00:45.039> that<00:00:45.069> you<00:00:45.729> know<00:00:45.760> wanted

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
comes down to guys that you know wanted

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.090 
comes down to guys that you know wanted
more<00:00:46.420> and<00:00:46.449> really<00:00:46.870> just<00:00:47.139> play<00:00:47.379> consistent

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100

mean you got I think it's two ways of
looking<00:01:14.080> at<00:01:14.470> it<00:01:14.530> but<00:01:14.770> if<00:01:14.890> you<00:01:15.010> take<00:01:15.160> it<00:01:15.340> as<00:01:15.430> a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
looking at it but if you take it as a

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.280 
looking at it but if you take it as a
positive<00:01:15.730> and<00:01:16.180> something<00:01:16.330> you<00:01:16.870> know<00:01:16.990> that<00:01:17.170> you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290
