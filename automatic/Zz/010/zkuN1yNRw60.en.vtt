there's a lot of good makes out there
the<00:01:18.860> golden<00:01:19.280> rule<00:01:19.460> really<00:01:19.880> is<00:01:20.180> that<00:01:20.450> the

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
the golden rule really is that the

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.020 
the golden rule really is that the
better<00:01:20.780> quality<00:01:21.200> that<00:01:21.770> you<00:01:21.950> eat<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.760> less

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
better quality that you eat so the less

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.120 
better quality that you eat so the less
ingredients<00:01:23.420> it<00:01:23.840> has<00:01:23.870> in<00:01:24.290> it<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:24.980> you<00:01:25.100> just

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
ingredients it has in it so you just

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.210 
ingredients it has in it so you just
want<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:25.790> to<00:01:25.820> have<00:01:26.120> pork<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:26.870> spices<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.920> salt

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.910 
if it contains milk or any other form of
dairy<00:01:32.210> then<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:32.540> don't<00:01:32.720> want<00:01:32.870> to<00:01:32.960> use<00:01:33.110> it<00:01:33.140> so
