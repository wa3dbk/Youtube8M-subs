cups<00:01:39.420> almost<00:01:39.780> three<00:01:40.080> whole<00:01:40.290> cups<00:01:40.650> it's<00:01:41.520> funny

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
cups almost three whole cups it's funny

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.590 
cups almost three whole cups it's funny
so<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.100> did<00:01:44.220> was<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.910> grabbed<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
so what I did was I just grabbed the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.830 
so what I did was I just grabbed the
whole<00:01:45.780> bunch<00:01:46.490> threw<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:47.790> sandwich<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
whole bunch threw it on the sandwich and

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.780 
whole bunch threw it on the sandwich and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
it made a whole lot so I'm assuming

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.300 
it made a whole lot so I'm assuming
that's<00:01:51.270> about<00:01:51.600> five<00:01:51.870> calories<00:01:52.310> because

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
that's about five calories because

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.900 
that's about five calories because
there's<00:01:53.520> nowhere<00:01:54.530> near<00:01:56.210> it's<00:01:57.210> nowhere<00:01:57.600> near

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
there's nowhere near it's nowhere near

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.260 
there's nowhere near it's nowhere near
half<00:01:59.910> of<00:02:01.130> two<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.280> three<00:02:02.460> four<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.760> cups<00:02:02.940> so

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
half of two and three four of cups so

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.020 
half of two and three four of cups so
and<00:02:03.710> half<00:02:04.710> would<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.010> been<00:02:05.160> ten<00:02:05.400> calories<00:02:05.670> so

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
and half would have been ten calories so

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.870 
and half would have been ten calories so
I'm<00:02:06.660> just<00:02:07.020> attribute<00:02:07.500> five<00:02:07.710> calories<00:02:08.040> and
