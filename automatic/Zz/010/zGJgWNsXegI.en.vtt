book<00:00:36.000> select<00:00:36.420> right<00:00:36.989> over<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.820> slap<00:00:38.820> I'm

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
book select right over that slap I'm

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.130 
book select right over that slap I'm
gonna<00:00:39.989> do<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.379> step<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:41.510> object<00:00:42.510> edit<00:00:42.960> mode

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
gonna do this step in object edit mode

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.540 
gonna do this step in object edit mode
partly<00:00:43.559> because<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.160> do<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.399> I'm

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
partly because you have to do it I'm

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.209 
partly because you have to do it I'm
partly<00:00:44.879> because<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.920> instead<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.010> just

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
partly because it's instead of just

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.270 
partly because it's instead of just
scaling<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.149> into<00:00:48.719> place<00:00:48.960> by<00:00:49.620> parts<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.190> then

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
scaling it into place by parts and then

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.670 
scaling it into place by parts and then
changing<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> final<00:00:51.510> details<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.620> is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
changing the final details this is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.139 
changing the final details this is
better<00:00:53.039> because<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.520> won't<00:00:53.670> mess<00:00:53.850> up<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
better because it won't mess up the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.139 
better because it won't mess up the
array<00:00:54.390> which<00:00:54.719> we're<00:00:54.899> gonna<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:55.199> using<00:00:55.530> today

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
array which we're gonna be using today

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.950 
array which we're gonna be using today
as<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.449> would<00:00:57.570> grab<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:59.250> weave<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.960> grab

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
as you would grab this and weave it grab

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.240 
as you would grab this and weave it grab
it<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> y-axis<00:01:03.739> totally<00:01:04.739> grab<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.129> a

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
it on the y-axis totally grab it a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.399 
it on the y-axis totally grab it a
little<00:01:05.670> more<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.840> y-axis<00:01:07.670> scam<00:01:08.670> X<00:01:09.270> as<00:01:10.049> much

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
little more on the y-axis scam X as much

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.039 
little more on the y-axis scam X as much
as<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.740> want<00:01:11.210> that's<00:01:12.210> gonna<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.689> our<00:01:12.810> first

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
as you want that's gonna be our first

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.520 
as you want that's gonna be our first
step<00:01:13.470> Oh<00:01:14.509> first<00:01:15.509> thing<00:01:15.750> we're<00:01:15.900> gonna<00:01:16.020> do<00:01:16.290> is

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
step Oh first thing we're gonna do is

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.950 
step Oh first thing we're gonna do is
move<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:18.200> this<00:01:19.880> this<00:01:20.880> face<00:01:21.799> so<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.070> line

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
move this this this face so it's in line

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.090 
move this this this face so it's in line
with<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.320> origin<00:01:25.740> point<00:01:25.770> grab<00:01:26.640> why<00:01:27.770> just<00:01:28.770> move

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
with the origin point grab why just move

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.429 
with the origin point grab why just move
it<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> little<00:01:29.780> so<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:30.900> pretty<00:01:31.020> much<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.409> line

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
it a little so it's pretty much in line

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.020 
it a little so it's pretty much in line
with<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.799> origin<00:01:32.250> point<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.250> way<00:01:35.400> oldest

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
with the origin point so that way oldest

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.770 
with the origin point so that way oldest
steps<00:01:36.420> line<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:37.670> okay<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.210> start<00:01:39.570> by

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
steps line up okay we can start by

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.139 
steps line up okay we can start by
adding<00:01:40.200> our<00:01:40.680> array<00:01:41.189> modifier<00:01:43.850> okay<00:01:44.850> we've<00:01:45.000> got

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
adding our array modifier okay we've got

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.760 
adding our array modifier okay we've got
that<00:01:45.299> doesn't<00:01:46.259> really<00:01:46.380> look<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.619> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
that doesn't really look like a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.100 
that doesn't really look like a
staircase<00:01:47.130> at<00:01:47.520> all<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.420> moment<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.869> don't

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
staircase at all at the moment I don't

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.830 
staircase at all at the moment I don't
look<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.290> spiral<00:01:49.890> staircase<00:01:50.270> so<00:01:51.270> change<00:01:51.600> this

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
look a spiral staircase so change this

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.080 
look a spiral staircase so change this
relative<00:01:52.649> offset<00:01:52.829> X<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:54.060> 0<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:56.280> tip<00:01:56.820> 1

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
relative offset X to 0 and that tip 1

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.260 
relative offset X to 0 and that tip 1
not<00:01:57.719> negative<00:01:58.049> 1<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.380> 1<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.790> here<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.119> go

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
not negative 1 just 1 and so here we go

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.340 
not negative 1 just 1 and so here we go
our<00:02:00.450> tree<00:02:00.780> steps<00:02:01.790> now<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.090> get<00:02:03.390> each<00:02:03.630> one<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.049> bit

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
our tree steps now to get each one a bit

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.889 
our tree steps now to get each one a bit
like<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.799> chain<00:02:05.130> 1<00:02:05.430> where<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.360> previous<00:02:06.570> one

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
like the chain 1 where the previous one

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.540 
like the chain 1 where the previous one
rotates<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.530> many<00:02:07.680> degrees<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.250> other<00:02:08.429> one

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
rotates so many degrees to the other one

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.040 
rotates so many degrees to the other one
we<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.149> throughout<00:02:09.420> an<00:02:09.569> empty

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
we have throughout an empty

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.970 
we have throughout an empty
so<00:02:10.200> odd<00:02:11.720> empty<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.960> of<00:02:13.080> course<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.500> new

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
so odd empty and of course a new

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.770 
so odd empty and of course a new
day<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:14.850> right<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.330> origin<00:02:15.750> point

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
day and it's right on the origin point

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.850 
day and it's right on the origin point
there<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:18.300> what<00:02:18.450> I'm<00:02:18.750> going<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.140> rotate<00:02:19.290> it

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
there and what I'm going to rotate it

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.590 
there and what I'm going to rotate it
our<00:02:20.570> rotate<00:02:21.570> z<00:02:22.050> axis<00:02:23.060> 45<00:02:24.060> degrees<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:26.360> so<00:02:27.360> what

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
our rotate z axis 45 degrees and so what

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.380 
our rotate z axis 45 degrees and so what
should<00:02:27.810> come<00:02:28.050> up<00:02:28.230> now<00:02:28.560> if<00:02:29.070> we<00:02:29.220> go<00:02:29.370> empty<00:02:29.850> is

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
should come up now if we go empty is

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.760 
should come up now if we go empty is
that<00:02:30.630> one<00:02:30.920> that's<00:02:31.920> one<00:02:32.160> step<00:02:33.500> now<00:02:34.500> we<00:02:34.560> can

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
that one that's one step now we can

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.770 
that one that's one step now we can
increase<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.220> steps<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:36.000> there<00:02:36.360> we<00:02:36.510> go<00:02:36.720> you

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
increase the steps and there we go you

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.280 
increase the steps and there we go you
got<00:02:37.140> your<00:02:37.350> spiral<00:02:37.800> staircase<00:02:39.080> okay<00:02:40.080> before

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
got your spiral staircase okay before

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.500 
got your spiral staircase okay before
I'm<00:02:40.800> going<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.280> close<00:02:41.550> this<00:02:41.760> off<00:02:42.060> because

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
I'm going to close this off because

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.490 
I'm going to close this off because
that's<00:02:43.020> pretty<00:02:43.260> much<00:02:43.380> all<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.830> do<00:02:45.320> I'm<00:02:46.320> gonna

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
that's pretty much all you do I'm gonna

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.380 
that's pretty much all you do I'm gonna
need<00:02:46.650> something<00:02:47.070> I'll<00:02:47.520> show<00:02:47.820> you<00:02:47.880> example

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
need something I'll show you example

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.390 
need something I'll show you example
what<00:02:48.510> would<00:02:48.570> happen<00:02:48.960> is<00:02:49.430> if<00:02:50.430> this<00:02:51.300> was<00:02:52.160> as<00:02:53.160> it

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
what would happen is if this was as it

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.240 
what would happen is if this was as it
was<00:02:53.550> before<00:02:55.760> increase<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.880> count<00:02:57.090> now<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:58.250> so

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
was before increase the count now and so

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.200 
was before increase the count now and so
you<00:03:00.120> see<00:03:00.300> there's<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.570> bit<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.780> excess<00:03:01.820> say<00:03:02.820> here

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
you see there's a bit of excess say here

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.860 
you see there's a bit of excess say here
and<00:03:03.390> also<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:05.340> steps<00:03:05.610> are<00:03:05.760> very<00:03:06.090> very<00:03:06.360> small

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
and also the steps are very very small

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.520 
and also the steps are very very small
and<00:03:07.200> they<00:03:07.710> don't<00:03:07.950> look<00:03:08.040> realistic<00:03:09.320> so<00:03:10.320> that's

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
and they don't look realistic so that's

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.940 
and they don't look realistic so that's
pretty<00:03:10.860> much<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:11.450> just<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.660> recap<00:03:13.020> we<00:03:13.800> have

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
pretty much it so just to recap we have

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.190 
pretty much it so just to recap we have
to<00:03:14.040> move<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:14.459> I'll<00:03:15.150> move<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.480> five<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.110> you

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
to move this I'll move to five so you

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.500 
to move this I'll move to five so you
can<00:03:16.350> see<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.620> disc<00:03:16.830> business<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:18.180> this<00:03:18.330> is

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
can see the disc business so this is

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.380 
can see the disc business so this is
just<00:03:18.900> in<00:03:19.290> line<00:03:19.709> with<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.190> origin<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.240> the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
just in line with the origin and the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.830 
just in line with the origin and the
other<00:03:21.630> steps<00:03:21.930> mm-hmm<00:03:23.090> as<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.240> can<00:03:24.360> see<00:03:24.570> here

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
other steps mm-hmm as you can see here

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.490 
other steps mm-hmm as you can see here
it's<00:03:24.990> so<00:03:25.110> crazy

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
it's so crazy

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.370 
it's so crazy
very<00:03:25.740> realistic<00:03:26.160> steps<00:03:26.990> spiral<00:03:27.990> staircase

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
very realistic steps spiral staircase

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.949 
very realistic steps spiral staircase
and<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.520> course<00:03:29.850> if<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.270> want<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.690> can<00:03:30.780> always

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
and of course if you want you can always

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.560 
and of course if you want you can always
make<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.260> big<00:03:31.470> sort<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:34.490> tube<00:03:35.490> around<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.390> say

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
make a big sort of tube around and say

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.290 
make a big sort of tube around and say
if<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.750> was<00:03:36.870> castle<00:03:37.260> battlements<00:03:37.830> or

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300
