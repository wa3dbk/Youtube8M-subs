00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 there was 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.249
 uu 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.619
 two 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.050
 as 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.050
 uu 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.070
 4 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.410
 v 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.550
 uu alex and pique 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.030
 also maxim 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.470
 that are marked maximum 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.470
 from Canada, technology, be Canadian 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.970
 cross 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.570
 well then what is it that deserves something totally different good not totally 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.990
 different than what I'm worth 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.090
 the much broader expression of what cinema is 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.300
 that way it was also created with comedy of art 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.300
 much more image much more sound a different experience 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.000
 he also tutored what they call the last experience in 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 in cinemas usa and mexico 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.590
 Thu 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.560
 now 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.120
 basically the image and sound 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.050
 the image is much bigger are 16 proventos meters a cinema screen 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:15.699
 a cinema more or less decent from 10 by 6 meters joseph we have 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:17.909
 about 6 times larger screen 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.049
 the sound is much more powerful we also have 16 thousand watts of power 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.719
 then channels 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.699
 is the one in the movie are 75 millimeters 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.529
 I made a movie there are more than 70 millimeters 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.649
 you can clearly see the difference in the image 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:35.649
 I think they are twelve times 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.499
 we can also appreciate that 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:42.159
 in the sina in the imax movie in the images so glued to the sides 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:46.430
 and the 35-millimeter film the image is pasted 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:48.519
 an enzyme note 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.579
 that way the film tape moves on the project 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.839
 estimated that it is going to move perth and inner calm is highly 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:57.429
 and that to move vertically 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:59.819
 for months the 2 sound 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.209
 I should not include in the 35 mm movie 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.309
 in the soundtrack on the side of the image 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:09.579
 while the imax movie the sound is totally independent digital 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.159
 the problem with these films is how the sound comes together with the image 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.689
 well in the movie is wearing tarancÃ³n 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.180
 with the same tape to be crazy constant abuses especially because the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.049
 rollers 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.479
 fastens the tape of the boards 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.569
 and that's where the sound is 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.339
 I do not know is that it happened to you going to the movies and suddenly it's like the 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:30.119
 sound 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:32.049
 that this is very good 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.710
 which has as defects 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.710
 that does not happen here because this is not currently independent 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.759
 i 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:41.859
 uu 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.479
 its internal scheme two projectors 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:48.060
 each project produces an image that is apparently the same 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.319
 if you see it, you say the mining company that after the turkey one over another 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:54.039
 but actually 

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:57.039
 between the ribbons that were projected on the right side and the one on the left wing 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.109
 a few small differences that are what will make the third emission 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.509
 it can be appreciated 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:06.039
 those differences lie in that the objects the station that those objects 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:08.310
 while greater 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.509
 The closer you are to the viewer 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:12.869
 more past tablemac in 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:14.869
 the farther this 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:17.869
 the weapons together 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:21.789
 as you notice it was eroded 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.569
 because the project in front has a 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:25.949
 a baby 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.409
 polarized lenses 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.929
 excellent polarized serves as an astute filter with these lenses 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.720
 each image is filtered so that 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.719
 with one eye 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:37.330
 I will see only the image 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.190
 that produces a projector and with the other little to see the image of the other project 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.409
 I never go now two images 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:48.409
 with your two governments inside if you dick cd 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:53.219
 if you wear this the you're an eye passed only minor 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.610
 basically what I do is carla film when we say load 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.379
 the movie every function 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:00.729
 what I mean is 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.580
 simply put the function 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.550
 what I do is 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.319
 plow the ribbon that is going to pass 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.319
 pass it through all the rollers is another day are to give direction to 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.839
 they felt a little tension too 

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:16.330
 for this loose 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.059
 He passed the tape through the projector 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:20.189
 which is where 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:22.400
 one of the subject and where is it going 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.650
 sdc part the project is very well 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.910
 very important because yes if you water it without lacking an insurance or not 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:29.700
 perform 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.580
 I put it to pray bad image 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.999
 they bathe the movie 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.830
 or when we open the cinema on a Friday 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.309
 February 9 not 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:40.339
 this space station option and suddenly it thickened to hear a sound 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:41.349
 as 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.430
 a tapping of the tape within the project 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.740
 a tac tac tac tac tac tac 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.350
 per cent those leaders who make the stop of the followers 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.569
 decide to follow her 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.159
 by mistake it was not the aim it is today 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:56.650
 at 30 seconds center a personal profile 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.889
 and there was one that there were quite serious people 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.729
 the mulhacen 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.559
 we do not have 

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:03.830
 3 on the billboard 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.659
 capif and that are two of 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:08.839
 nascar to be in 3d and vips item in 3d 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:12.429
 it is clear then that they come to teach the latest science expedition 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.239
 one
