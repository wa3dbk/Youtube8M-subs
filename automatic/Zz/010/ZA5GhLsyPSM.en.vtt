00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.420
 show you a brand new league 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.539
 it does n't surprise me to do bling bling 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.099
 lines of dinars and the first thing 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.560
 guys as usual for the new team 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.090
 elite will serve a friend and as a second 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.590
 place to buy it rebel as you see me 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.870
 I already bought it for who I am 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.900
 prepared before, however, would understand 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.309
 get out of your garage and you have to do 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.120
 enter your friend on the side of the 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.620
 passenger 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.260
 I recommend you put your privacy 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.780
 let's say 10 how to say access to 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.700
 vehicle to everyone so that yours 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.950
 friend can also become a driver 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.680
 after letting him in 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.239
 you owe yourself the santos races custom 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.309
 before entering, however, let's say stop 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.110
 makes to lift the gate and calls 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.899
 a mechanical lameri weather once 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.840
 which will appear once 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.570
 so the options will be poufs 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.920
 here or even those of the mechanic is 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.050
 indifferent you can enter inside 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.369
 you don't have to take this off 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.009
 therefore it should not have rim 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.560
 hicks you will have to get off the far vehicle 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.930
 go your friend behind the wheel and then 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.880
 remove these options 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.740
 then take any random vehicle 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.270
 even go to foot only one minute 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.030
 vehicle because they are stopped thousand thousand 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.950
 years you will have to go where to go to 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.290
 yours in your garage and take 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.670
 the car you want to duplicate and vi 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.590
 I advise you to take all the precise steps 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.409
 precise because I lost two or three 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.000
 machines to be able to do this 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.820
 he wins as you see my garage 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.180
 and somewhat somewhat empty for this 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.770
 cliché I took the Arctic people then 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.020
 you will have to take your vehicle 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.280
 like saying I'm doing now 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.350
 your friend will always have to stay 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.850
 inside the rebel inside the holy scafa 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.259
 you will not have to move a duty goes down 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.600
 to the machine if leaving the machine 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.310
 the lecce does not work anymore and you will have to 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.229
 start all over again of course 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.820
 then take your vehicle 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.369
 this case the gesta rb gives again 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.720
 the custom status to enter where 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.120
 you have to do the same procedure as that 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.350
 we have done both before and using the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.269
 mechanic as you see I'm doing 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.920
 now that she sees me as I do 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.349
 done before 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.340
 after having called him you will have to do so 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.989
 enter inside as first descend from the 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.630
 get out of your vehicle and throw away 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.730
 out here so much total disasters e 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.920
 throw your friend out of yours 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.660
 vehicle in this way which you have to 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.180
 be careful when you do this thing there 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.830
 I advise you to throw it out you must 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.150
 hold down triangle he must not 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.220
 go down alone but if I have to where 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.019
 throw out the lincoln one otherwise 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.480
 è bell no one will be interested anymore 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.310
 so you'll have to hold down triangle 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.569
 and you will have to throw it out as you can see here 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.980
 I was wrong because I pressed one 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.959
 time only triangle get a degas 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.090
 corner thrown out and he must stay 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.250
 momentarily in garages then exited 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.220
 from your rebel enter into the 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.590
 jester or any other vehicle e 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.600
 after doing do enter keeping 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.569
 always the option of mary weather o 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.390
 your friend's open mechanic 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.470
 will have to go out I have to go out and now it opens 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.230
 will have to go and get yours 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.310
 machine that appeared on the radar this 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.470
 unfortunately I didn't tell you about it 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.100
 because I forgot it appeared 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.310
 when when you just pulled out 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.650
 your friend from the car if 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.239
 I am not mistaken or in any case the icon has appeared 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.920
 of your personal vehicle 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.570
 should let your friend in 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.519
 personal trodica and make it go more 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.260
 far possible to return port for 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.250
 however quite close though it is 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.940
 far away ok you will have to make it go up 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.769
 at the airport your car 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.390
 after which he must come down and he must 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.400
 place next to the machine then 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.870
 you will have to stay where you are next to the 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.310
 car then you have to call it rebel 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.530
 because at the second time that by force 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.560
 who love the mechanic you will have to call it 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.420
 rebel and you will have to wait before 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.510
 sell your car because 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.829
 on the right in a few seconds next to 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.530
 selection and the various options that are there 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.209
 an orange circle had to appear a 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.440
 sure song guys remember a 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.090
 sure and there is not because I will fail 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.220
 you lose the cars you sold 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.540
 the vehicle you lost after this 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.819
 will try dinner will be shot then will have 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.560
 saved will perform let's say one 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.120
 duplication of the vehicle so I priest 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.760
 freely sell your vehicle 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.959
 for glitch terminals we will need to do so 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.180
 have come out of poor status a 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.919
 take a random vehicle 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.660
 I also present given in this case 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.950
 i take the rebel consider you would give 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.300
 because anyway if maybe sometimes 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.250
 it can happen that 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.750
 there are no cars at that intersection 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.000
 so the rebel decided is because it is 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.949
 yours and you can a lan for note 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.199

 where you must enter both with the rebel and 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.340
 with the random vehicle depending on the 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.409
