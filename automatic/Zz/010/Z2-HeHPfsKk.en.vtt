00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.239
 she is well it's the turn of some orders from the om 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.500
 I'm ok German before starting the little video I wanted 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.669
 really to apologize for not coming out of this week 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.699
 I was just sick and still feel by my voice that is 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:25.960
 not very nice to hear 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.300
 since I played a lot touched then 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.140
 I play hard in the red throat 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.150
 the son finally but I can certify you that others 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.590
 so that's six advanced I hope anyway that others it's 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.410
 my voice is not very very ugly record 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.350
 p this is it this time the video here 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.510
 so today we find ourselves 36th points and then the Germans as friendly 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.500
 tomorrow especially our good old that the little modern warfare 2 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.310
 it's a killer it's always good to say more to some shy 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.340
 children to be 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.210
 knowing that kevin rudd in fortran to go out 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.119
 in a month and a half so it's still two years ago that came out 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.050
 and yet for me a year 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.080
 it remains one of the best wishes of children debt 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.350
 So here we are today for a small butcher instance 12 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.750
 this date riders having team death match 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.850
 so there you say yes but of course he had no medal I had 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.540
 full pockets at stage 12 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.320
 or at least what let foot dragging who wants to value their very 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.230
 nice 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.070
 so here is the minister 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.560
 I think I'm actively every style is happening every year not sure of the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.150
 all 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.140
 in the month of August the risk of leaving their farms this post at this double 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.130
 very serious finding 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.250
 eyelids or afp 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.890
 % and therefore according to you the assets because this only this gameplay has been 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.620
 recorded but a small moment to conclude street is still 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.250
 a little moment for poorly started bondage 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.710
 migration of our taxes that risk more and more frequently I pass that 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.570
 what do you think 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.560
 so happy on ps3 i find 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.890
 good if we must say that the collection on ps3 is happening 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.330
 it's not that in the magnet 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.470
 it is not serious 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.580
 I've seen you a man come out even more classy than the atmosphere not a 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.050
 little bit like what is rare 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.870
 who is wrong who draws at the stage bit like that at all 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.750
 so this is what the first year and a second of all I 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.720
 can have fun testing because there were a lot of who challenge her 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.080
 faults in running water for just six minutes% 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.419
 humor blah years I will almost not comment on the gameplay power since 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:18.479
 not today 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.479
 I'm going to tell you about one thing it's through small projects 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.709
 I have for my dog 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:24.820
 % and I wanted 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.489
 what I say I'll tell you betrayed but I thought 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.639
 some small ones at rest forced 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.129
 see the turn of the others knowing I do not know how it is pronounced 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.249
 % and especially with my english mexico accent for cathy rest tramway 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:37.870
 including 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.390
 that is to say, a good translation in the ditch there is a story about 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.569
 of commented history in a video game 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.079
 so that for me I would have thought to make a small 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.920
 and ideas on what bar 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.510
 it's reassuringly dated wire 3 yes of course then it comes out in a month and that 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.469
 like everything 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.159
 two perspectives of the rsa and debate girl 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.369
 I booked 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:59.370
 % 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.749
 hebert but I think I'm going to have a bit of history with you 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.939
 that is to say I'm doing I'm going to play company with you I do not 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.769
 can not do it alone 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.239
 but I was still a little by little for me 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.349
 on the return 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.529
 if these people have trouble disentangling what is less 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:17.529
 hoarau will tell the wgc serving perfect wtc 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:19.049
 so for me wta 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.260
 he has thus left more than one in two old ones I have the impression for so 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.120
 give your opinion the opep for me bowater the thread 3 cc assange this was 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:30.549
 he thought because he did not come out but percent and I think it can 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.339
 it's really nice 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:36.459
 after you have to see it depends% 1 500 for his costs the club med was 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.989
 blocked between the rails and so power for now everything goes well from 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.589
 country at their dictatorship dinner score 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:43.839
 % 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:47.179
 where it was like to dance the very delayed success 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:50.069
 Paris was waiting for you already had some shots 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.759
 on the other hand fulham firefighters 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:54.059
 you have already seen someone six meters in the middle of the map the 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:56.169
 stage six predators here's what 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.049
 % and many also I promise you more to see him with a nickname that 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:00.929
 allow 

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:04.409
 it's an old water well that I took for ps3 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.459
 % and I think bern would have taken into account by cohade 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.099
 gold like mines because 20 years so that's why I can not say 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.089
 that thousands 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:14.779
 I think I'll see this but if you know with all the assets 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:17.779
 finally all classifications 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:19.579
 erbacci of a veil 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.069
 % is good if london 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:24.650
 compared to other blues the summer give me your opinion because 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.710
 I do not know if I keep coming out of etienne then a little bit of everything 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.409
 bulk player 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.059
 i can not afford to d top of 10 see what was selected 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:35.900
 still except to believe that I produce and 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.790
 some pieces in the gameplay theater incident is done is done 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.919
 and makes us adherents whose goal was to avoid a defect 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.650
 I force myself to advance 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.039
 except that bombs and shells explode 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.580
 a little if you look at the texan there sorry for the bugue 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.240
 I keep my action beaten you would be grateful 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.509
 what is it is a truism 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.809
 a year ago I'm little genentech action custom this 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:03.370
 statistically receptive 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.830
 but I'm launching my much-awaited second try the part 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.830
 so for those who say it's not by chance then there 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.830
 my god you can not know how to handle go on the go 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.330
 % pablo for this option has multiplied a lot 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.599
 also conveyed the scores on the bottom left that of course it's a war 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:24.029
 territory if we had played specify them 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:27.370
 these young people scored because lender already supported without their 

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.999
 consent a possible team death match in bad 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:33.889
 so a selection of films on their practices in guard territory 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.090
 otherwise good package three of them to light vehicles 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.349
 so I sincerely think in all cases on a doubled that's for sure 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:45.429
 for this shock for sure it's I do not know what game 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.580
 I really want to make a story is standing 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.800
 already sought from recruiters 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.270
 knowing that ps2 and ps3 at all 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.439
 which is really a lot of old games 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:57.419
 dismantling days we will see 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.879
 I sincerely believe that the dialect what to have fun 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:04.039
 it can really be something to experience in europe end 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:04.639
 historical 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.979
 may be too much 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:09.139
 tell me what you think about it so here is anyway to see the 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:10.400
 bikers of the gameplay 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.650
 so stop 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.080
 a butchery but also a match the express match 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.679
 at 5''3 in five minutes the corner aof and 10000 points 

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:23.849
 and avoid worrying the first with the ticad two wins with 33 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:26.110
 kind of assistance and then death 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.560
 it's rather talkative which is especially 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.690
 christine sud eco-internship 12 years beaten to death by team that's what stood 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.789
 to underline 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.469
 % and so that's why I had you head 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:37.470
 President 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.020
 it's to avoid a butcher's shop 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.270
 so in the meantime until these videos will please you do not hesitate to 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.229
 share 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.099
 alas you liked adding their favorites 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:48.610
 and the good news is that if it's not already done 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.909
 and I tell you the approach of this era of ming that follows the 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:52.039
 trace
