for your light control now let you pull

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.750 
for your light control now let you pull
this<00:01:12.479> down<00:01:12.540> farther<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> hard

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
this down farther so this is the hard

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.719 
this down farther so this is the hard
part<00:01:15.770> if<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.360> up<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.600> there

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
part if you can see up in there

there feel around for it that is touch
the<00:01:55.979> button<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.340> pull<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.180> wire<00:01:57.860> okay

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
the button and pull in on the wire okay

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.520 
the button and pull in on the wire okay
and<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:00.960> what<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.259> looks<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:03.350> with<00:02:04.350> it

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and this is what it looks like with it

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.960 
and this is what it looks like with it
done<00:02:06.170> all<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.290> have<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:08.310> have<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.489> cut

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
done all you have to do you have to cut

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.020 
done all you have to do you have to cut
this<00:02:09.239> black<00:02:10.020> insulator<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:11.730> fold<00:02:11.910> it

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
this black insulator and just fold it

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.369 
this black insulator and just fold it
back<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.540> enough<00:02:12.720> room<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.959> put<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
back so you have enough room to put the

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.970 
back so you have enough room to put the
wire

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
wire

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.250 
wire
on<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.269> wires<00:02:15.569> you<00:02:15.659> want<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.870> tap<00:02:16.050> into

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
on it and the wires you want to tap into

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.430 
on it and the wires you want to tap into
is<00:02:16.800> these<00:02:17.670> two<00:02:17.879> right<00:02:18.090> here<00:02:18.230> it's<00:02:19.230> kind<00:02:19.379> of

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
is these two right here it's kind of

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.240 
is these two right here it's kind of
hard<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.650> see<00:02:19.860> it's<00:02:20.129> like<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.900> vanilla<00:02:21.950> or<00:02:22.950> white

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
hard to see it's like a vanilla or white

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.170 
hard to see it's like a vanilla or white
and<00:02:23.610> red<00:02:23.879> and<00:02:24.769> then<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:26.040> red<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.700> black<00:02:26.879> wire

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
and red and then a red and black wire

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.180 
and red and then a red and black wire
doesn't<00:02:28.110> really<00:02:28.230> mote<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.830> doesn't<00:02:29.069> matter

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
doesn't really mote it doesn't matter

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.770 
doesn't really mote it doesn't matter
what<00:02:29.340> side<00:02:29.489> you<00:02:29.670> put<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.620> squeeze<00:02:31.620> it

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
what side you put it in and squeeze it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.320 
what side you put it in and squeeze it

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
that the red and black is from the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.180 
that the red and black is from the
taillight<00:02:36.569> relay<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:39.650> white<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.799> red<00:02:40.950> is

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
taillight relay and the white and red is

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.319 
taillight relay and the white and red is
the<00:02:42.079> headlight<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.670> I'm<00:02:45.060> gonna<00:02:45.150> put

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
the headlight so I'm gonna put

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.770 
the headlight so I'm gonna put
everything<00:02:45.540> together<00:02:45.780> back<00:02:46.769> together<00:02:47.780> you
