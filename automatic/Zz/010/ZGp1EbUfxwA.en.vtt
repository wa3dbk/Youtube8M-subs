sort so either green tea or Kevin while

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.999 
sort so either green tea or Kevin while
or<00:01:59.729> camomile<00:02:00.600> your<00:02:01.079> oh<00:02:01.110> no<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:01.590> cold

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
or camomile your oh no it's cold

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.810 
or camomile your oh no it's cold
oh<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.909> have<00:02:03.450> an<00:02:03.810> apple<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.770> Sun<00:02:05.579> butter

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
oh I have an apple and I have Sun butter

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.589 
oh I have an apple and I have Sun butter
with<00:02:06.119> honey<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.560> just<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.950> mix<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.599> this

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
with honey so this is just a mix of this

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.140 
with honey so this is just a mix of this
which<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.080> Sun<00:02:10.860> butter

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
which is Sun butter

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.600 
which is Sun butter
so<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:12.599> sunflower<00:02:12.930> seed<00:02:13.230> butter

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
so it's sunflower seed butter

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.150 
so it's sunflower seed butter
essentially<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.440> just<00:02:16.440> mixing<00:02:16.770> some<00:02:16.950> honey

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
essentially and just mixing some honey

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.500 
essentially and just mixing some honey
so<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.459> don't<00:02:17.640> want<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.819> take<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.060> whole

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510
