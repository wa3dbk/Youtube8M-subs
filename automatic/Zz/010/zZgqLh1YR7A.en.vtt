00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.079
 Well here is portrait number 6 is 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.729
 the last large format portrait that I've 

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:09.260
 made in graphite on glued paper 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.500
 table is almost 2 meters high a 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.690
 metro 80 x 120 and unfortunately I lost 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.609
 the initial shots where I had 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.349
 the entire process of fitting the drawing and 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.849
 the beginning of the stain so everything 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.560
 that will incorporate it in the next video 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.670
 the next drawing that I'm already 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.380
 working 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.060
 as seen in this first phase what 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.790
 I do is work in a very 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.059
 classic simply go adding those 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.730
 spaces without putting a pencil is very 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.970
 dark and put the high range of 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.360
 Sometimes I work a lot with hb with efe with 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.090
 very much a 2b and very soft many times I go 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.330
 adding information as he did with the 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.809
 paint to create an image 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:53.239
 balanced and smoothed nuanced 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.010
 set of the portrait and then from 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.570
 air working in this first phase 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.979
 simply with a classic drawing 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:04.339
 pencil rubber pencil hands fingers in 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:06.770
 order to create that surface with the 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.330
 more information and variety 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.920
 possible as we talked in the painting 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.060
 Well, what I like is that I believe 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.159
 many nuances many details there 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.659
 and I'm raising the tone little by little until 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.460
 there comes a time when I consider 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.130
 that I have an image enough 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.820
 balanced to apply what is it 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.840
 what happens here 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.050
 the hand that I give water with glue and water 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.930
 with carpenter's glue diluted to 10 15 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.700
 20 percent 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.560
 I give it to the entire surface of the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.150
 drawing and once we do this the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.520
 surface of the drawing changes has 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.650
 taken is roughness and also has 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.180
 as a small layer of protection we 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.670
 still allows to work perfectly 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.560
 with pencil or rubber pencil without problem 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.300
 but also incorporates this that we are 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.650
 seeing we can work with brushes with 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.420
 clean water or we can work with 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.820
 thicker thicknesses you can enter more 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.010
 at the waist you can reduce the tone of zones 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.320
 wider simply when you go with 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.259
 wider broaches or with a wet paper 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.539
 a kitchen towel dipped in water and 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.190
 giving you touches like you see here is going to 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.350
 remove part of the graffiti will create 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.880
 some very interesting textures then 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.319
 this for me as you see here what 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.390
 we are lowering the whole tone of the 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.470
 chin that was considered to have 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.000
 gone too good then down and so on 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.380
 I convert the drawing for me it becomes 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.780
 in the drawing 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.880
 the drawing in a process that is no longer 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.560
 unidirectional is no longer going adding 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.110
 information until it came to the end 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.740
 sports book admired me here add 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.240
 information removed retouching I return the 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.340
 areas that I have gone from dark 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.560
 I can lower it and also reduced it by creating 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.330
 some very interesting textures and achievements 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.990
 here we use a bar again 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.900
 pencil eat 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.520
 a normal drama not if I did not feel that at 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.050
 start with water all the elements 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.210
 We can work exactly the same with 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.030
 the pencil with the rubber but also 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.430
 we incorporate the possibility of working 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.820
 with water with brushes of course is not 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.770
 one time the application of this is 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.260
 layer of water with glue each time 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.860
 we want we give again and recreate 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.450
 a different surface returns to 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.270
 modify the texture of that surface 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.820
 of the paper and it's very nice for 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.890
 course we can take whites almost 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.740
 authentic with very clean water of a 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.130
 very clean brush then it is a process 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.620
 open in which almost anything goes and for 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.630
 course we start a very general way 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.580
 and in the end we can finish qualifying 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.410
 as much as we want as we say in 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.600
 the painting will be very many 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.310
 information that we do not put because it arrives 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.380
 a moment when the painting works 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.350
 he is interested in how he is and does not want to continue 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.910
 adding but would have possibilities of 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.960
 carry almost everything that is in the 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.510
 drawing 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.830
 much further but as we said in the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.030
 theme of the painting I think what 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.460
 interesting about this is that it be a 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.050
 living relationship a living process in which 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.760
 you see what the box of 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.880
 valera antonio lopez trying to 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.710
 they invited the teacher simply what 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.990
 parties need more than part of less 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.560
 and at a certain point, consider 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.840
 what works 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.020
 well this is actively and professionally 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.640
 what is going 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.680
 creating the image more and more 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.180
 complete being we reach a point that 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.040
 we are already establishing the dark ones more 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.380
 details and this is the point at which 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.300
 We consider that the work works not 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.620
 It needs more detail and well I hope that 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.500
 you liked it and could enter more 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.220
 details in lace in the next 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.220
 regards
