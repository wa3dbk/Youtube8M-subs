there we go I'm gonna zoom in on the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.780 
there we go I'm gonna zoom in on the
supposed<00:01:57.000> signature<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.780> Matt<00:01:57.930> graining<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
supposed signature of Matt graining and

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.889 
supposed signature of Matt graining and
I<00:01:59.790> know<00:01:59.880> if<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.060> make<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> out<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.719> says

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
I know if you make it out but it says

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.700 
I know if you make it out but it says
Matt<00:02:01.200> Groening<00:02:01.950> G<00:02:02.939> ROG<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.750> ing

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
Matt Groening G ROG and ing

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.130 
Matt Groening G ROG and ing
and<00:02:05.149> I<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:06.360> Matt<00:02:06.509> knows<00:02:06.689> how<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> spell<00:02:07.110> his

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
and I think Matt knows how to spell his

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.619 
and I think Matt knows how to spell his
own<00:02:07.350> name<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.940> it's<00:02:08.940> probably<00:02:09.270> not<00:02:09.360> true<00:02:09.569> a

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
own name so it's probably not true a

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.910 
own name so it's probably not true a
plus<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:09.989> if<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.110> look<00:02:10.200> at<00:02:10.319> homers<00:02:10.590> muzzle
