first thing that we have to do with
sweet<00:00:20.490> potatoes<00:00:20.850> obviously<00:00:21.270> we<00:00:21.390> wash<00:00:21.630> it

sweet potatoes obviously we wash it

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.800 
sweet potatoes obviously we wash it
really<00:00:22.050> well<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.939> then<00:00:23.939> we<00:00:24.210> peel<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.750> sweet

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
really well and then we peel the sweet

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:45.260 
really well and then we peel the sweet
potatoes

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.920 

and<00:00:46.270> then<00:00:46.390> once<00:00:46.630> the<00:00:46.810> sweet<00:00:47.020> potato<00:00:47.380> is<00:00:47.620> peeled

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
and then once the sweet potato is peeled

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.900 
and then once the sweet potato is peeled
we<00:00:49.930> chop<00:00:50.170> it<00:00:50.200> up<00:00:50.470> into<00:00:50.680> small<00:00:51.160> pieces<00:00:51.400> and

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
we chop it up into small pieces and

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.610 
we chop it up into small pieces and
again<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.540> smaller<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:53.080> piece<00:00:53.290> is<00:00:53.470> the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
again the smaller the piece is the

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.520 
again the smaller the piece is the
better<00:00:53.860> because<00:00:54.640> it<00:00:55.600> takes<00:00:55.809> less<00:00:56.140> time<00:00:56.170> to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
better because it takes less time to

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.090 
better because it takes less time to
cook<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:58.239> I'm<00:00:58.989> all<00:00:59.200> about<00:00:59.350> saving<00:00:59.739> as<00:00:59.950> much

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
cook and I'm all about saving as much

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.140 
cook and I'm all about saving as much
time<00:01:00.430> while<00:01:00.910> doing<00:01:01.150> this<00:01:01.330> as<00:01:01.540> possible<00:01:02.519> so<00:01:03.519> no

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
time while doing this as possible so no

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.310 
time while doing this as possible so no
particular<00:01:04.690> way<00:01:04.809> that<00:01:05.050> you<00:01:05.140> have<00:01:05.290> to<00:01:05.500> chop<00:01:05.770> it

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
