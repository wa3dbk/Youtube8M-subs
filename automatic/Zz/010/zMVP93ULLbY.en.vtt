from<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.820> brand<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.540> via<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.229> believe<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.040> this

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
from the brand a via I believe and this

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.319 
from the brand a via I believe and this
was<00:01:27.060> let's<00:01:27.600> see<00:01:28.610> $12.99<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.850> normally<00:01:30.180> it's

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
was let's see $12.99 and normally it's

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.170 
was let's see $12.99 and normally it's
26<00:01:30.869> dollars<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.890> I'm<00:01:32.189> definitely<00:01:32.430> discount<00:01:33.060> on

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
26 dollars so I'm definitely discount on

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.030 
26 dollars so I'm definitely discount on
that<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.320> thought<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.740> was<00:01:34.890> nice

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
that and I thought that this was nice

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.590 
that and I thought that this was nice
because<00:01:35.340> these<00:01:35.490> are<00:01:35.700> even<00:01:35.970> cheaper<00:01:36.180> than<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
because these are even cheaper than the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.999 
because these are even cheaper than the
ones<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.900> are<00:01:36.990> at<00:01:37.079> Target<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.740> that's

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
ones that are at Target so that's

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.950 
ones that are at Target so that's
definitely<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.729> really<00:01:39.180> good<00:01:39.299> value<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.810> think

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
definitely a really good value I think

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
in my interest in workout clothes that

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.879 
in my interest in workout clothes that
Nike<00:03:24.639> stuff<00:03:24.879> is<00:03:25.060> pretty<00:03:25.299> expensive<00:03:25.780> for<00:03:26.260> some

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
Nike stuff is pretty expensive for some

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.110 
Nike stuff is pretty expensive for some
reason<00:03:27.129> I<00:03:27.190> never<00:03:27.250> have<00:03:27.519> really<00:03:27.790> thought<00:03:28.060> about

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
reason I never have really thought about

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.039 
reason I never have really thought about
it<00:03:28.389> I<00:03:28.629> guess

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
it I guess

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.259 
it I guess
and<00:03:29.169> I<00:03:29.709> just<00:03:29.889> assumed<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.430> Nike<00:03:30.910> stuff<00:03:31.120> was

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
and I just assumed that Nike stuff was

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.420 
and I just assumed that Nike stuff was
pretty<00:03:31.510> cheap<00:03:31.930> I<00:03:32.109> guess<00:03:32.260> or<00:03:32.440> recently<00:03:33.280> she

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
pretty cheap I guess or recently she

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.960 
pretty cheap I guess or recently she
recently<00:03:34.470> relatively<00:03:35.470> cheap<00:03:35.739> but<00:03:36.699> some<00:03:36.849> of

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
recently relatively cheap but some of

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.030 
recently relatively cheap but some of
its<00:03:37.120> really<00:03:37.480> expensive<00:03:37.750> like<00:03:38.410> I<00:03:38.470> found<00:03:38.769> some

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
its really expensive like I found some

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.830 
its really expensive like I found some
capris<00:03:39.879> that<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.120> really<00:03:40.299> wanted<00:03:40.540> from<00:03:40.690> there

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
capris that I really wanted from there

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.839 
capris that I really wanted from there
and<00:03:40.930> they<00:03:40.989> were<00:03:41.049> like<00:03:41.129> $54<00:03:42.129> and<00:03:42.400> I<00:03:42.430> was<00:03:42.609> like<00:03:42.730> oh

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
and they were like $54 and I was like oh

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.780 
and they were like $54 and I was like oh
my<00:03:43.120> goodness<00:03:43.269> that's<00:03:43.629> so<00:03:43.750> expensive<00:03:44.129> so<00:03:45.129> I<00:03:45.669> was

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
my goodness that's so expensive so I was

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.640 
my goodness that's so expensive so I was
really<00:03:46.000> excited<00:03:46.150> when<00:03:46.540> I<00:03:46.569> saw<00:03:46.840> this<00:03:47.169> and<00:03:47.500> this

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
really excited when I saw this and this

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.159 
really excited when I saw this and this
was<00:03:47.859> only<00:03:48.190> eight<00:03:48.430> dollars<00:03:48.639> so<00:03:48.900> $7.99<00:03:49.900> from

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
was only eight dollars so $7.99 from

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.080 
was only eight dollars so $7.99 from
Burlington<00:03:50.739> I<00:03:50.949> was<00:03:51.099> so<00:03:51.250> excited<00:03:51.549> about<00:03:51.760> that

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
Burlington I was so excited about that

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.599 
Burlington I was so excited about that
and<00:03:52.480> I<00:03:53.319> got<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:53.739> in<00:03:53.829> a<00:03:53.889> size<00:03:54.010> medium<00:03:54.069> because

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
and I got it in a size medium because

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:55.890 
and I got it in a size medium because
that's<00:03:54.760> all<00:03:54.879> that<00:03:55.060> they<00:03:55.180> had<00:03:55.329> left<00:03:55.569> but<00:03:55.840> I

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
that's all that they had left but I

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.149 
that's all that they had left but I
figure<00:03:56.169> it<00:03:56.290> doesn't<00:03:56.500> really<00:03:56.620> matter<00:03:56.829> because

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
figure it doesn't really matter because

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:58.770 
figure it doesn't really matter because
it's<00:03:57.280> just<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.489> workout<00:03:57.819> shirt<00:03:58.180> anyway<00:03:58.540> so<00:03:58.599> it

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
it's just a workout shirt anyway so it

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.990 
it's just a workout shirt anyway so it
doesn't<00:03:58.840> have<00:03:59.139> to<00:03:59.260> be<00:03:59.349> super<00:03:59.560> like<00:04:00.010> figure

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
doesn't have to be super like figure

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.960 
doesn't have to be super like figure
flattering<00:04:01.799> so<00:04:02.799> I<00:04:02.829> love<00:04:03.099> that<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:04.720> then<00:04:05.409> I
