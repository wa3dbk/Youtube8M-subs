last couple of years and he needed a
boot<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.060> was<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.420> little<00:00:27.630> bit<00:00:27.750> stiffer

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
boot that was just a little bit stiffer

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.500 
boot that was just a little bit stiffer
so<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.220> did<00:00:29.400> working<00:00:29.670> with<00:00:29.939> our<00:00:30.179> boot

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
so what we did working with our boot

we have at Nike we created a boob with
the<00:00:35.219> multiple<00:00:35.550> stiffness<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.570> almost<00:00:36.750> an

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
the multiple stiffness so almost an

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.810 
the multiple stiffness so almost an
adjustable<00:00:37.530> stiffness<00:00:38.040> take<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> look<00:00:38.610> at<00:00:38.760> our

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
adjustable stiffness take a look at our

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.110 
adjustable stiffness take a look at our
liner<00:00:39.090> who<00:00:39.870> built<00:00:40.079> these<00:00:40.200> pods<00:00:40.530> or<00:00:40.980> beans<00:00:41.790> on

the medial and the lateral side of the
liner<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:45.300> offer<00:00:45.480> up<00:00:45.809> kind<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.530> two

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
liner and we offer up kind of two

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.560 
liner and we offer up kind of two
different<00:00:46.920> thermometers<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.850> pods<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.329> fit

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
different thermometers and pods that fit

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.860 
different thermometers and pods that fit
inside<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.930> these<00:00:49.200> few<00:00:49.530> slits<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.789> a

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
inside of these few slits so we have a

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.660 
inside of these few slits so we have a
clear<00:00:51.870> infrared<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.770> little<00:00:53.070> bit<00:00:53.190> softer

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
clear infrared is a little bit softer

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.850 
clear infrared is a little bit softer
the<00:00:54.120> purple<00:00:54.480> one<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.660> stiff<00:00:55.050> where<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.710> can

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the purple one is stiff where you can

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.500 
the purple one is stiff where you can
ride<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.190> without<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.360> totally

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
ride it without so it's totally

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.139
