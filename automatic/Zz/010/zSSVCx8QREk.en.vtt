all<00:00:00.900> right<00:00:01.020> I've<00:00:01.140> got<00:00:01.170> a<00:00:01.319> 14<00:00:01.860> millimeter

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
all right I've got a 14 millimeter

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.140 
all right I've got a 14 millimeter
wrench<00:00:03.529> I'm<00:00:04.529> gonna<00:00:04.710> turn<00:00:04.980> on<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.970> ignition

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
wrench I'm gonna turn on the ignition

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.020 
wrench I'm gonna turn on the ignition
and<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:07.440> see<00:00:07.649> that<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.919> light<00:00:08.069> goes<00:00:08.099> on<00:00:08.460> now

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
and I see that the light goes on now

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.459 
and I see that the light goes on now
what<00:00:09.269> I'm<00:00:09.360> gonna<00:00:09.450> try<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.750> do<00:00:09.960> here<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:12.469> move

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
what I'm gonna try to do here is move

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.090 
what I'm gonna try to do here is move
this<00:00:13.679> bolt<00:00:13.980> move<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.490> rotor

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
this bolt move the rotor

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.340 
this bolt move the rotor
until<00:00:17.100> we<00:00:17.279> go<00:00:17.490> until<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.390> light<00:00:18.539> goes<00:00:18.720> off<00:00:18.869> for

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
until we go until the light goes off for

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.349 
until we go until the light goes off for
starters<00:00:19.710> we<00:00:20.340> need<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.609> start<00:00:20.880> with<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.180> light

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
starters we need to start with the light

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.830 
starters we need to start with the light
off<00:00:22.910> eventually<00:00:23.910> we<00:00:24.359> want<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.600> see<00:00:24.720> what

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
off eventually we want to see what

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.189 
off eventually we want to see what
happens<00:00:25.109> in<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.289> like<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:26.869> now

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
happens in the like this now

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.810 
happens in the like this now
one<00:00:28.740> thing<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.099> didn't<00:00:29.369> realize<00:00:29.640> when<00:00:29.760> I

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
one thing that I didn't realize when I

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.860 
one thing that I didn't realize when I
started<00:00:30.179> doing<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:31.520> that<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:33.450> markings

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
started doing this is that the markings

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.459 
started doing this is that the markings
on<00:00:34.079> here

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
on here

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.910 
on here
there's<00:00:34.710> an<00:00:34.829> L<00:00:35.130> F<00:00:35.870> which<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:36.899> left<00:00:37.290> fire<00:00:37.890> I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
there's an L F which is left fire I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.630 
there's an L F which is left fire I
assume<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.610> F<00:00:39.270> which<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.530> for<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> right

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
assume and F which is that for the right

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.549 
assume and F which is that for the right
cylinder<00:00:44.570> excuse<00:00:45.570> me<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.200> little<00:00:46.410> tough

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
cylinder excuse me it's a little tough

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.170 
cylinder excuse me it's a little tough
bolt<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.980> rotor<00:00:50.219> will<00:00:50.430> spin<00:00:50.670> two<00:00:50.910> full

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
bolt the the rotor will spin two full

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.660 
bolt the the rotor will spin two full
rotations<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:52.289> each<00:00:52.410> cycle<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.370> engine

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
rotations for each cycle of the engine

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.400 
rotations for each cycle of the engine
so<00:00:53.940> when<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.660> get<00:00:54.809> close<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.110> LF<00:00:55.559> here<00:00:57.410> which

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
so when we get close to LF here which

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.260 
so when we get close to LF here which
you<00:00:58.739> might<00:00:58.770> not<00:00:59.399> be<00:00:59.579> able<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.820> see<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.149> this

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
you might not be able to see in this

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.490 
you might not be able to see in this
poor<00:01:00.510> lighting<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:04.110> light<00:01:04.260> should<00:01:04.439> go<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
poor lighting the light should go on and

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.440 
poor lighting the light should go on and
we're<00:01:07.500> gonna<00:01:07.590> spin<00:01:07.979> here<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.790> we're<00:01:09.150> gonna<00:01:09.210> go

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
we're gonna spin here and we're gonna go

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.090 
we're gonna spin here and we're gonna go
past<00:01:10.250> F<00:01:14.960> we're<00:01:15.960> gonna<00:01:16.049> go<00:01:16.200> past<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> LF<00:01:16.799> again

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
past F we're gonna go past the LF again

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:27.140 
past F we're gonna go past the LF again
so<00:01:17.430> now<00:01:17.549> we've<00:01:17.700> been<00:01:17.729> 360<00:01:18.689> degrees<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:26.150> it

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
so now we've been 360 degrees and it

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.030 
so now we've been 360 degrees and it
goes<00:01:27.390> off<00:01:27.570> now<00:01:28.080> we're<00:01:28.590> gonna<00:01:28.680> wait

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
goes off now we're gonna wait

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.570 
goes off now we're gonna wait
to<00:01:30.640> get<00:01:30.790> to<00:01:30.880> LF<00:01:31.300> which<00:01:31.630> is<00:01:31.780> right<00:01:31.960> here<00:01:32.580> against

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
to get to LF which is right here against

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.520 
to get to LF which is right here against
the<00:01:33.730> index<00:01:34.030> marker<00:01:34.420> which<00:01:34.570> is<00:01:34.600> here<00:01:34.960> I<00:01:37.470> want<00:01:38.470> to

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
the index marker which is here I want to

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.560 
the index marker which is here I want to
try<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:38.710> move<00:01:38.920> this<00:01:39.040> very<00:01:39.340> slowly<00:01:42.060> LF<00:01:43.060> is<00:01:43.360> right

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
try to move this very slowly LF is right

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:52.080 
try to move this very slowly LF is right
here

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.319 

we<00:01:52.630> see<00:01:52.810> that<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.079> timing<00:01:53.350> is<00:01:53.590> early<00:01:54.329> because

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
we see that the timing is early because

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.760 
we see that the timing is early because
I'm<00:01:55.720> not<00:01:55.899> quite<00:01:56.439> at<00:01:56.680> LF<00:01:57.189> yet<00:01:58.229> LF<00:01:59.229> is<00:01:59.409> actually

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
I'm not quite at LF yet LF is actually

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.249 
I'm not quite at LF yet LF is actually
here<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.340> index<00:02:00.610> mark<00:02:00.850> is<00:02:00.970> here<00:02:01.259> alright

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
here and the index mark is here alright

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.190 
here and the index mark is here alright
so<00:02:02.380> we<00:02:02.500> know<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.710> left<00:02:02.920> side<00:02:03.100> is<00:02:03.250> firing<00:02:03.490> early

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
so we know the left side is firing early

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.230 
so we know the left side is firing early
so<00:02:05.200> I'm<00:02:05.409> gonna<00:02:05.530> hook<00:02:05.740> this<00:02:06.039> alligator<00:02:06.970> clip<00:02:07.210> to

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
so I'm gonna hook this alligator clip to

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.570 
so I'm gonna hook this alligator clip to
the<00:02:07.450> right<00:02:07.600> side<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.220> repeat<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.369> we're

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
the right side and repeat and we're

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.180 
the right side and repeat and we're
gonna<00:02:09.700> see<00:02:10.000> where<00:02:10.810> we<00:02:10.959> are<00:02:10.989> in<00:02:11.410> terms<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:12.040> the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
gonna see where we are in terms of the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.790 
gonna see where we are in terms of the
right<00:02:12.340> side<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:14.260> we're<00:02:14.380> gonna<00:02:14.470> spin<00:02:15.630> and

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
right side so we're gonna spin and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.880 
right side so we're gonna spin and
here's<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.920> F<00:02:18.069> mark<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:20.110> index<00:02:20.380> pointer

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.460 

and<00:02:23.960> we<00:02:24.960> are<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.140> little<00:02:25.350> late<00:02:26.990> so<00:02:27.990> there<00:02:28.200> were

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
and we are a little late so there were

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.410 
and we are a little late so there were
right<00:02:28.709> lined<00:02:28.950> up<00:02:29.130> here<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:32.270> we're<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.300> little

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
right lined up here and we're a little

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.850 
right lined up here and we're a little
late<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:33.870> fortunately<00:02:35.870> since<00:02:36.870> left<00:02:37.319> is<00:02:37.530> early

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
late so fortunately since left is early

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.960 
late so fortunately since left is early
and<00:02:37.980> right<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.120> late<00:02:40.130> we<00:02:41.130> can<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:41.610> can<00:02:41.790> probably

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
and right is late we can we can probably

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.610 
and right is late we can we can probably
do<00:02:42.420> something<00:02:42.750> with<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:42.930> adjustment<00:02:43.260> what

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
do something with this adjustment what

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.199 
do something with this adjustment what
we<00:02:43.680> need<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.980> do<00:02:44.130> is<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:44.459> need<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.670> move<00:02:44.940> this

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
we need to do is we need to move this

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.040 
we need to do is we need to move this
points<00:02:46.100> then<00:02:47.100> Angelo<00:02:47.520> this<00:02:48.060> points<00:02:48.480> baseplate

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
points then Angelo this points baseplate

and<00:02:49.260> we<00:02:49.890> need<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.130> rotate<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.640> whole<00:02:50.790> thing<00:02:51.090> I

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
and we need to rotate the whole thing I

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.979 
and we need to rotate the whole thing I
can't<00:02:52.140> remember<00:02:52.260> if<00:02:52.410> it's<00:02:52.530> left<00:02:52.650> or<00:02:52.800> right<00:02:52.950> and

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
can't remember if it's left or right and

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.430 
can't remember if it's left or right and
that<00:02:54.989> should<00:02:55.560> counteract<00:02:56.870> we'll<00:02:57.870> move<00:02:58.020> it<00:02:58.170> so

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
that should counteract we'll move it so

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.949 
that should counteract we'll move it so
that<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:59.810> left<00:03:00.810> fires<00:03:01.140> on<00:03:01.560> time<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.190> that

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
that the left fires on time and that

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.540 
that the left fires on time and that
should<00:03:03.959> also<00:03:04.019> at<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.830> same<00:03:04.980> time<00:03:05.040> make<00:03:05.519> the

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
should also at the same time make the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.989 
should also at the same time make the
right<00:03:05.820> fire<00:03:06.060> on<00:03:06.269> time<00:03:06.450> let's<00:03:06.870> hope
