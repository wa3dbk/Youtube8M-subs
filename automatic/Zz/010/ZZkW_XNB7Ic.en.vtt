00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 okay it still smells like a holiday 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.190
 but you will agree 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.950
 the scent of the school year becomes a 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.820
 a little stronger from day to day in 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.679
 this hypermarket 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.509
 the bulk of buyers is not yet 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.400
 come equipped with school supplies 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.990
 but there are always those who benefit 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.750
 just tranquility in the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.850
 rays I really hesitate to learn the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.519
 the first private Malagasy 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.470
 why quality simply we have 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.380
 noticed already over several years that 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.060
 the lower quality of quality without 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.070
 to ruin is the wish of 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.840
 consumers and to give them 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.550
 comparisons its members of the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.920
 trade union confederation of families 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.899
 are conducting their small survey of ten 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.270
 basic ink cartridges 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.489
 rules plastic double copies perforated 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.039
 we will actually be raising the prices of 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.230
 different brands than a brand 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.280
 distributor of the store and both 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.590
 other brands one or two others 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.480
 brands in fact relatively well known so 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.160
 for their qualities in these products there 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.170
 a survey conducted at 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.100
 departmental which also supplies a 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.500
 national survey 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.480
 first observation the overall quality of 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.189
 sold papers is better but 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.770
 least on some small equipment 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.720
 gender or compass and pencil sharpener 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.540
 some cases challenges our 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.860
 investigators we mark two stores the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.470
 twelve pencils markers one euro fifty 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.700
 seven a big brand that sells 10 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.080
 two free markers to 3.86 here 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.360
 is another brand that go the same 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.080
 12 felt pens at 4.96 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.880
 so there we come to ask when 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.140
 even questions what is it 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.479
 than these two free felt pens 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.850
 for one brand while on another 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.159
 store product price is already 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.479
 lower the cost of the autumn 2012 does not 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.270
 should not undergo an increase 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.939
 flagrant not at least how in 2011 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.250
 where the rise was 3.11 percent to 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.990
 nationally while waiting for their 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.850
 conclusions for late August 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.280
 our investigators advise you of good 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.860
 look at prices or price per kilo 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.420
 or at the corner unit for especially for 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.390
 small supplies items 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.850
 school and it's not necessarily bought 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.960
 by the water that one finds there 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.240
 price drops of school supplies 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.659
 have been noted since the beginning of the month 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.489
 August 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.929
 a trend that could well be 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.009
 confirm with the rush of the season 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.009
 in shops
