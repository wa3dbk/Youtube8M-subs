00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.200
 but we were watching the end of the video 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.200
 and it has been cut again would be my life 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.650
 if it is not cut because we are solving 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.950
 Other how many Cuba conquered what to do 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.200
 the cube of rubik quite fast is 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.490
 complicated takes a lot of practice there 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.490
 people who could not have people 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.470
 get after me for example I have 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.420
 about two years and a few months ago 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.250
 learn to solve it and good and I continue 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.680
 learning things and I keep seeing things 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.600
 I also tell you that I have a 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.190
 friend who does it already average in less 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.530
 of 15 seconds and he has thrown several 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.989
 times of less than 10 seconds I do not say 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.000
 I took a year unless I carry a 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.610
 year and a few months and already his feet 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.830
 practically now he has put many 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.350
 hours of jackson many hours and nothing 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.570
 and that was we were doing a couple 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.030
 from Cuba all the juices that I have 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.040
 As you can see, they rotate quite well because they are 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.780
 all of piscu well all at home where 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.460
 these 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.710
 I suppose that is fundamental for 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.350
 do the quick rubik cube that's 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.480
 basically the main thing in a bucket of 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.680
 rubik good that is not jammed 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.600
 because if it is not this afternoon it is expected already 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.090
 they are more aware of getting this 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.590
 in the turn that what you have to do 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.890
 but we're going to make a couple of 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.890
 Cuba 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.950
 it would not be that I had a chronometer here 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.330
 because I forgot the chrono and good and 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.390
 that's why we do not have time but we 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.460
 encounter we must enter 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.040
 we're going to be pretty interesting this 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.920
 something whole cross find I put the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.100
 orange on the red to see the blue on the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.460
 green the red in the orange and so 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.740
 counted for then in the end just like that and 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.200
 turn it up 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.200
 let's see if it comes out would be 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.000
 I already have a whole crane but in 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.800
 opposite steels 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.800
 it's a lot of practice it 's a lot of practice 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.110
 and come to fly 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.360
 and we go to the last one and we already said goodbye 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.569
 Video and well you know and those who 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.129
 how much I would know how to do these things 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.930
 that I have counted and even have 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.030
 removed the video but good for those who 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.370
 not for those who are starting to 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.379
 learn the bucket and think and that to me 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.120
 I went to the beginning I did it in a 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.700
 minute and already of the blog and already lands 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.230
 violence and if with this method it is 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.209
 impossible to do the five seconds and not 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.099
 there is physical time to give you so many 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.769
 laps and good and the trick was a bit 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.520
 of that you need two methods of 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.069
 optimal resolution 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.819
 Let's see 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.819
 of the son 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.970
 and already most of all the ultimate trick is 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.950
 get to get it to choose to 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.489
 the hand many people what they do is 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.950
 practice practicing is then solve it 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.930
 in what would be solve it solve it 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.420
 slowly but never so that turning 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.860
 here for example I brakes a bit 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.540
 to see but never for you 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.880
 of turning even though a 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.950
 little good I hope it has not served as 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.360
 help this video that has learned something 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.850
 of rubik's cube methods and 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.560
 you want to be complex and always 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.380
 can continue to learn more and more 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.780
 things 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.470
 and nothing and that's it and we'll see each other 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.470
 we see in another video
