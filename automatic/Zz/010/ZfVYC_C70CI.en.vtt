00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
needed and we try to choose a point

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.590 
needed and we try to choose a point
where<00:02:43.160> we<00:02:43.310> felt<00:02:43.520> that<00:02:43.640> we<00:02:43.850> could<00:02:43.880> be<00:02:44.180> really

where we felt that we could be really

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.590 
where we felt that we could be really
competitive<00:02:45.080> in<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.520> price<00:02:46.760> reflects<00:02:47.360> a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
competitive in and the price reflects a

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.990 
competitive in and the price reflects a
lot<00:02:48.170> of<00:02:48.320> research<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.010> development<00:02:49.070> that

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
lot of research and development that

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.510 
lot of research and development that
went<00:02:50.300> into<00:02:50.450> figuring<00:02:51.080> out<00:02:51.230> ways<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.650> make<00:02:52.040> this

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
went into figuring out ways to make this

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.120 
went into figuring out ways to make this
plane<00:02:52.910> work<00:02:53.360> at<00:02:53.630> that<00:02:53.960> price<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:54.860> think

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
plane work at that price and I think

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.050 
plane work at that price and I think
we've<00:02:55.280> achieved<00:02:55.430> it

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060
