00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.820 
and it's the foundation of our technique
in<00:01:05.519> general<00:01:05.900> we've<00:01:06.900> had<00:01:07.110> advanced<00:01:07.560> dancers

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
in general we've had advanced dancers

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.010 
in general we've had advanced dancers
and<00:01:08.340> professional<00:01:08.850> dancers<00:01:09.299> washed<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.869> say

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
and professional dancers washed and say

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.570 
and professional dancers washed and say
that<00:01:10.170> even<00:01:10.290> they<00:01:10.590> learn<00:01:10.830> something<00:01:11.310> from<00:01:11.340> it

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
that even they learn something from it

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.719 
that even they learn something from it
so<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.930> really<00:01:13.770> validating<00:01:14.369> for<00:01:14.400> us
