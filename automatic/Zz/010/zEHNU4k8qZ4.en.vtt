00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.670
 Hello everyone, max and today we are 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.339
 let's talk about the program glued download 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.450
 You can free mac sites software. no she 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.700
 absolutely free 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.949
 and now let's talk about the program itself and 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.230
 so we have program widgets 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.630
 another what does the program itself mean 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.510
 plastered with is a simplified version of mackeeper 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.510
 no ads and less popular than 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.840
 of course the cyber itself is a miscalculation so 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.030
 look for 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.420
 improved version of the cart here you 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.730
 can delete files 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.340
 easy movement of the mouse and now I'm all 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.230
 I'll show it and tell you here are shown. 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.090
 all programs are installed by our 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.320
 computer, you can choose any 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.540
 and hit that you don't like 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.870
 let's choose adobe flash for example 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.239
 we select and click search by ourselves 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.730
 programs program searches for all files 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.950
 connected in any way with a flash 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.870
 see that it went several folders and 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.910
 several files and all this you can 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.730
 remove with one click it turns out you are not 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.769
 litter your computer with files that 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.430
 could not retire when using 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.200
 basket I that it is very convenient and the most 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.170
 interesting program itself is nothing 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.880
 removes it only helps to search if 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.040
 You are now found if you click now 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.229
 hit she just throw in the trash 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.780
 you empty the basket and more and more 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.869
 file you will not see the most interesting thing 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.869
 it is necessary to delete those installation files 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.490
 dmg file let's say some file here 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.369
 flash cs6 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.799
 there installation installation itself adob 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:40.170
 flash and therefore it binds to and how 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:43.140
 method and gives us how to search files by 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.820
 removing and then widgets and more here 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.409
 the same all the dreams that you 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.750
 installed you can remove from here 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.880
 the only thing I want to say is not worth it 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.759
 touch and those that you did not install 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.490
 or those that are standard on 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.650
 poppy because consequences can be 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.530
 the most terrible so I do not advise you 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.020
 touch and here with a lock later 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.510
 better not delete and you can hardly 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.610
 they gave out what else I want to say on this 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.020
 the program 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.700
 settings and even here this program 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.630
 there are settings let's go now 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.790
 commands are not called, you now see 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.650
 on our screens now move on 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.450
 the setting that we have here you are here 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.430
 can add program to exceptions 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.770
 which cannot be removed for some 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.540
 reasons also exclude running 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.420
 programs and standard can also 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.459
 set up plus or minus here everything is clear 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.560
 what is it with more sharing now this to me 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.250
 included and now I have it to you clearly 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.010
 Iâ€™ll show you a file and open it 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.470
 let's get the program and choose 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.780
 skype example and see what happens 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.239
 when will we transfer skype to 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.780
 cart independently included uplander 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.519
 or not included with us is given such 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.410
 function here with Marty whether that is at once 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.380
 Searches for all files by any 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.090
 way connected with skype and you can 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.430
 in one easy movement remove the full 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.830
 completely program and on and nothing 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.840
 will remain on your computer is such 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.730
 easy and convenient cleaning your 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.510
 computer that will help not to keep 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.400
 unnecessary files on the very make ya delete 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.290
 I will not the most problem is that if you 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.280
 would you like to return something 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.239
 do this 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.920
 back so what else wanna talk about 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.750
 to turn on and off you need 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.260
 be sure to see the password right away 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.140
 requires a password to disable i 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.810
 wrong and was now and after all 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.549
 the smart function itself is disabled 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.680
 device also enable it 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.900
 here you can update too 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.850
 optionally automatically update new 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.450
 features refined update almost 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.299
 add nothing just increase there 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.750
 support and any other rubbish I don't 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:54.980
 I think that every version is very important 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.030
 no different yet wanna say that 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.690
 the program is very 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:04.410
 simple it's not mackeeper it's not climate 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.959
 cuneiform here these all annoying 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.630
 programs and for windows for this is normal 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.770
 program that removes completely 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.500
 a specific program you need 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.639
 I think it can be finished 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.070
 install it all for free she 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.480
 very convenient and does not take much space on 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.760
 your computer 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.760
 thank you for your attention bye bye
