00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
biofilter you can see the small black

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.809 
biofilter you can see the small black
pipe<00:02:30.359> that's<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.950> intake<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.700> the

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
pipe that's the the intake to the

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.170 
pipe that's the the intake to the
biofilter<00:02:33.480> there's<00:02:33.719> a<00:02:33.780> pump<00:02:34.019> there<00:02:34.790> we've<00:02:35.790> got

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
biofilter there's a pump there we've got

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.300 
biofilter there's a pump there we've got
electricity<00:02:36.930> run<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.560> obviously<00:02:37.980> and

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
electricity run to it obviously and

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.250 
electricity run to it obviously and
there's<00:02:38.849> also<00:02:38.969> a<00:02:39.150> spare<00:02:39.480> pipe<00:02:39.719> there<00:02:39.959> in<00:02:40.079> case

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
there's also a spare pipe there in case

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.129 
there's also a spare pipe there in case
I<00:02:40.439> want<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.709> hook<00:02:40.889> into<00:02:41.129> the<00:02:41.670> main<00:02:42.060> coming<00:02:42.780> over

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:43.139 
I want to hook into the main coming over

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.089 
I want to hook into the main coming over
here<00:02:44.180> over<00:02:45.180> there<00:02:45.810> we've<00:02:46.290> got<00:02:46.530> our<00:02:46.560> pipes

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
here over there we've got our pipes

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.149 
here over there we've got our pipes
coming<00:02:47.459> back<00:02:47.819> in<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.359> can<00:02:48.989> hook<00:02:49.319> that<00:02:49.349> up<00:02:49.650> there

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
coming back in I can hook that up there

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.300 
coming back in I can hook that up there
not<00:02:50.549> not<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.939> one<00:02:51.090> draining<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.870> small<00:02:52.709> 25

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
not not that one draining the small 25

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.879 
not not that one draining the small 25
on<00:02:53.519> there<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.879> can<00:02:54.150> run<00:02:54.389> a<00:02:54.599> flexi<00:02:55.200> pipe<00:02:55.409> through

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
on there I can run a flexi pipe through

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:04.030 
on there I can run a flexi pipe through
the<00:02:55.980> water<00:02:56.159> and<00:02:57.319> into<00:02:58.319> their<00:02:59.220> to<00:03:00.150> run<00:03:01.250> hmm

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
there a lot quicker than what the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.670 
there a lot quicker than what the
smaller<00:03:11.969> pump<00:03:12.239> will<00:03:12.389> do<00:03:12.569> we've<00:03:13.109> got<00:03:13.200> about<00:03:13.260> 18

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
smaller pump will do we've got about 18

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.970 
smaller pump will do we've got about 18

thing until I get some decent fish and
crop<00:03:35.069> from<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.459> but<00:03:36.060> anyway<00:03:36.269> we've<00:03:36.419> got<00:03:36.540> tennis

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
crop from it but anyway we've got tennis

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.719 
crop from it but anyway we've got tennis
balls<00:03:37.019> we<00:03:37.229> cut<00:03:37.409> him<00:03:37.470> in<00:03:37.590> half<00:03:37.620> 80<00:03:38.189> balls<00:03:38.489> in

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:38.729 
balls we cut him in half 80 balls in

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.539 
balls we cut him in half 80 balls in
half<00:03:39.060> we<00:03:39.930> were<00:03:40.049> then<00:03:40.260> worried<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:41.040> we<00:03:41.370> would

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
half we were then worried that we would

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.699 
half we were then worried that we would
end<00:03:41.699> up<00:03:41.819> with<00:03:42.000> some<00:03:42.180> anaerobic<00:03:42.810> bacteria<00:03:43.439> so

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
end up with some anaerobic bacteria so

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.589 
end up with some anaerobic bacteria so
we<00:03:43.859> punched<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.400> hole<00:03:44.579> in<00:03:44.609> it<00:03:44.849> you<00:03:45.299> can<00:03:45.329> see

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
we punched a hole in it you can see

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.659 
we punched a hole in it you can see
there<00:03:45.840> so<00:03:46.470> just<00:03:46.769> in<00:03:46.889> case<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.250> was<00:03:47.340> sitting

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
there so just in case it was sitting

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.429 
there so just in case it was sitting
that<00:03:47.879> way<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.419> we<00:03:48.870> didn't<00:03:49.049> want<00:03:49.109> water

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:49.439 
that way and we didn't want water

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.189 
that way and we didn't want water
sitting<00:03:49.709> in<00:03:49.919> there<00:03:50.129> so<00:03:50.819> and<00:03:51.060> then<00:03:51.810> we've<00:03:51.959> used

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
sitting in there so and then we've used

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.530 
sitting in there so and then we've used
PVC<00:03:53.040> piping<00:03:53.549> obviously<00:03:53.939> I've<00:03:54.060> just<00:03:54.239> cut<00:03:54.449> them

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
PVC piping obviously I've just cut them

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.719 
PVC piping obviously I've just cut them
all<00:03:54.689> two<00:03:54.840> different<00:03:55.169> links<00:03:55.439> now<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.459> whole

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:56.729 
all two different links now the whole

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:59.030 
all two different links now the whole
idea<00:03:56.759> there<00:03:57.389> is<00:03:57.599> for<00:03:58.049> that<00:03:58.199> just<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.739> sit<00:03:59.009> in

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
idea there is for that just to sit in

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.979 
idea there is for that just to sit in
this<00:03:59.759> section<00:04:00.169> where<00:04:01.169> the<00:04:01.199> drain<00:04:01.470> hole<00:04:01.709> is<00:04:02.989> to

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
this section where the drain hole is to

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.710 
this section where the drain hole is to
you<00:04:04.979> know<00:04:05.069> make<00:04:05.220> sure<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.669> it<00:04:06.150> doesn't<00:04:06.389> clog

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
you know make sure that it doesn't clog

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.490 
you know make sure that it doesn't clog
up<00:04:06.900> in<00:04:07.079> time<00:04:07.349> and<00:04:07.790> cause<00:04:08.790> any<00:04:09.209> issues<00:04:09.629> so<00:04:10.470> to

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
up in time and cause any issues so to

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.530 
up in time and cause any issues so to
stop<00:04:11.040> all<00:04:11.189> that<00:04:11.250> stuff<00:04:11.579> disappearing<00:04:12.239> down

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
stop all that stuff disappearing down

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.520 
stop all that stuff disappearing down
the<00:04:12.750> hole<00:04:13.790> we've<00:04:14.790> used<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.269> rake<00:04:15.689> that's<00:04:16.259> a

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
the hole we've used a rake that's a

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.270 
the hole we've used a rake that's a
garden<00:04:17.430> rake<00:04:18.229> see<00:04:19.229> it<00:04:19.289> this<00:04:19.530> just<00:04:19.590> one<00:04:20.190> of

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
garden rake see it this just one of

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.740 
garden rake see it this just one of
those<00:04:20.340> little<00:04:20.489> narrow<00:04:20.759> ones<00:04:21.030> so<00:04:21.449> that's<00:04:21.659> just

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
those little narrow ones so that's just

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.240 
those little narrow ones so that's just
stopping<00:04:22.199> a<00:04:22.289> little<00:04:22.590> bits<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:22.919> pieces

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
stopping a little bits and pieces

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.640 
stopping a little bits and pieces
disappearing<00:04:23.759> down<00:04:23.909> a<00:04:23.970> hole<00:04:24.320> that<00:04:25.320> water

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
disappearing down a hole that water

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.680 
disappearing down a hole that water
there<00:04:25.950> is<00:04:26.250> flowing<00:04:26.729> through<00:04:26.849> quite<00:04:27.389> nicely

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
there is flowing through quite nicely

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.129 
there is flowing through quite nicely
over<00:04:28.500> this<00:04:28.860> we're<00:04:29.159> going<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.370> use

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
over this we're going to use

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.610 
over this we're going to use
you<00:04:30.530> know<00:04:30.620> combination<00:04:31.249> of<00:04:31.370> shade<00:04:31.610> cloth<00:04:31.819> and

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
you know combination of shade cloth and

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.529 
you know combination of shade cloth and
fine<00:04:33.620> fiber<00:04:34.689> foam<00:04:35.689> that<00:04:36.139> I've<00:04:36.319> picked<00:04:37.219> up

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
fine fiber foam that I've picked up

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.089 
fine fiber foam that I've picked up
that's<00:04:38.539> suitable<00:04:38.810> with<00:04:39.020> water<00:04:39.289> and<00:04:39.650> we're

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
that's suitable with water and we're

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:41.909 
that's suitable with water and we're
going<00:04:40.219> to<00:04:40.279> have<00:04:40.460> some<00:04:40.669> layers<00:04:40.939> across<00:04:41.509> the<00:04:41.689> top

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
going to have some layers across the top

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.129 
going to have some layers across the top
as<00:04:42.919> just<00:04:43.249> sort<00:04:43.370> of<00:04:43.460> like<00:04:43.580> prefilters<00:04:44.240> for<00:04:44.689> any

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
as just sort of like prefilters for any

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.010 
as just sort of like prefilters for any
filament<00:04:46.039> algae<00:04:46.340> and<00:04:46.460> so<00:04:46.639> forth<00:04:46.909> so<00:04:47.150> I'll<00:04:47.810> show

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
filament algae and so forth so I'll show

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.129 
filament algae and so forth so I'll show
you<00:04:48.080> all<00:04:48.229> in<00:04:48.379> the<00:04:48.409> next<00:04:48.499> video<00:04:48.830> and<00:04:49.870> we<00:04:50.870> got<00:04:51.020> out

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
you all in the next video and we got out

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.659 
you all in the next video and we got out
of<00:04:51.349> this<00:04:51.529> for<00:04:51.969> basically<00:04:52.969> under<00:04:53.240> 100<00:04:53.569> bucks<00:04:53.749> so

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
of this for basically under 100 bucks so

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.249 
of this for basically under 100 bucks so
let's<00:04:55.669> assume<00:04:55.819> it<00:04:56.060> works<00:04:56.270> then<00:04:56.900> I'm<00:04:57.050> pretty

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
let's assume it works then I'm pretty

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:02.619 
let's assume it works then I'm pretty
wrapped<00:04:59.740> now<00:05:00.740> this<00:05:01.039> is<00:05:01.099> the<00:05:01.389> biofilter<00:05:02.389> half

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:02.629 
wrapped now this is the biofilter half

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:04.540 
wrapped now this is the biofilter half
built<00:05:02.930> in<00:05:03.139> the<00:05:03.650> bottom<00:05:03.919> we've<00:05:04.099> got<00:05:04.310> all<00:05:04.430> the

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
built in the bottom we've got all the

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.749 
built in the bottom we've got all the
tennis<00:05:05.090> balls<00:05:05.330> and<00:05:05.870> the<00:05:06.139> PVC<00:05:07.069> piping<00:05:07.490> which

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 
tennis balls and the PVC piping which

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.899 
tennis balls and the PVC piping which
should<00:05:08.449> give<00:05:09.039> really<00:05:10.039> good<00:05:10.069> drainage<00:05:10.430> no

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909 
should give really good drainage no

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:12.820 
should give really good drainage no
blockages<00:05:11.419> at<00:05:11.599> the<00:05:11.689> bottom<00:05:11.990> and<00:05:12.379> also

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
blockages at the bottom and also

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.800 
blockages at the bottom and also
hopefully<00:05:13.129> somewhere<00:05:13.639> for<00:05:13.849> the<00:05:13.939> beneficial

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
hopefully somewhere for the beneficial

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.890 
hopefully somewhere for the beneficial
bacteria<00:05:14.870> to<00:05:15.560> harbor<00:05:16.150> now<00:05:17.150> we've<00:05:17.389> also<00:05:17.569> got

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
bacteria to harbor now we've also got

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.230 
bacteria to harbor now we've also got
this<00:05:18.050> foam<00:05:18.379> damn<00:05:18.979> the<00:05:19.219> piece<00:05:19.400> I<00:05:19.550> had<00:05:19.729> as<00:05:19.849> a<00:05:19.879> demo

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
this foam damn the piece I had as a demo

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.939 
this foam damn the piece I had as a demo
it's<00:05:20.389> fine<00:05:20.599> fibrous<00:05:21.139> foam<00:05:21.379> any<00:05:21.560> way<00:05:21.710> you<00:05:21.770> could

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
it's fine fibrous foam any way you could

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.510 
it's fine fibrous foam any way you could
probably<00:05:22.159> see<00:05:22.490> it<00:05:22.520> there<00:05:22.849> is<00:05:23.629> nice<00:05:24.349> and<00:05:24.710> well

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
probably see it there is nice and well

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.429 
probably see it there is nice and well
it's<00:05:25.849> fine<00:05:26.120> enough<00:05:26.360> for<00:05:26.539> the<00:05:26.599> bacteria<00:05:27.229> to

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:27.439 
it's fine enough for the bacteria to

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:30.369 
it's fine enough for the bacteria to
hold<00:05:27.740> on<00:05:27.919> to<00:05:28.099> but<00:05:28.900> course<00:05:29.900> enough<00:05:30.139> for<00:05:30.319> the

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:30.379 
hold on to but course enough for the

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:33.279 
hold on to but course enough for the
water<00:05:30.589> to<00:05:30.710> flow<00:05:31.009> through<00:05:31.310> easily<00:05:31.580> so<00:05:32.210> will<00:05:33.199> you

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
landscaping days so we're going to be

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.110 
landscaping days so we're going to be
cutting<00:06:15.439> that<00:06:15.649> up<00:06:15.830> and<00:06:16.550> at<00:06:16.699> the<00:06:16.759> very<00:06:16.789> top

we're going to cut that up into sections

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:22.689 
we're going to cut that up into sections
and<00:06:20.060> have<00:06:20.870> that<00:06:21.080> life<00:06:21.319> as<00:06:21.409> a<00:06:21.439> pre-filter<00:06:21.830> so

that you know we're going to be able to

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.369 
that you know we're going to be able to
just<00:06:25.039> lift<00:06:25.759> those<00:06:25.969> out<00:06:26.210> easily<00:06:26.449> and<00:06:26.689> clean

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:27.379

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
little demo some of the filament algae

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.129 
little demo some of the filament algae
that<00:06:31.129> we're<00:06:31.430> rough<00:06:31.699> dealing<00:06:32.060> with<00:06:32.180> it's<00:06:32.990> like

that we're rough dealing with it's like
a<00:06:33.169> big<00:06:34.330> horse<00:06:35.330> quota<00:06:35.629> anyway<00:06:36.560> it's<00:06:36.830> elves<00:06:37.339> or

boom but the water is getting better

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:44.119 
boom but the water is getting better
there<00:06:42.389> is<00:06:42.629> get<00:06:43.169> some<00:06:43.319> fresh<00:06:43.529> green<00:06:43.770> algae

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
growing over the barramundi floating

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.100 
growing over the barramundi floating
cage<00:06:47.189> but<00:06:47.819> it<00:06:48.089> will<00:06:48.419> all<00:06:48.599> be<00:06:48.779> under<00:06:48.809> control
