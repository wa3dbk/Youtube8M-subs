only<00:01:10.860> does<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.220> look<00:01:11.520> what<00:01:11.700> 65<00:01:12.270> 70<00:01:12.689> per<00:01:12.840> cents

only does like look what 65 70 per cents

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.510 
only does like look what 65 70 per cents
i<00:01:13.170> was<00:01:13.260> hoping<00:01:13.439> i<00:01:13.619> cut<00:01:13.799> out<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> little<00:01:14.130> bit<00:01:14.280> more

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
i was hoping i cut out a little bit more

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.390 
i was hoping i cut out a little bit more
but<00:01:15.180> here<00:01:15.570> i<00:01:15.689> think<00:01:16.439> i<00:01:16.590> decided<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.009> i<00:01:17.130> might

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
but here i think i decided that i might

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.649 
but here i think i decided that i might
want<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.670> keep<00:01:17.790> my<00:01:17.909> Garchomp<00:01:18.119> earlier<00:01:18.540> just

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
want to keep my Garchomp earlier just

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.120 
want to keep my Garchomp earlier just
because<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.020> does<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.470> some<00:01:19.710> uses<00:01:20.040> that

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
because it does have some uses that

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.740 
because it does have some uses that

on<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:22.650> speeds<00:01:22.860> teeter<00:01:23.280> um<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.939> I

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
on that it all speeds teeter um so I

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.920 
on that it all speeds teeter um so I
really<00:01:24.210> didn't<00:01:24.360> want<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.509> keep<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.720> around<00:01:24.840> for

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
really didn't want to keep it around for

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.899 
really didn't want to keep it around for

sucker<00:02:24.360> punching<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:24.990> i<00:02:25.020> decided<00:02:25.320> that<00:02:25.500> i

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
sucker punching but i decided that i

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.290 
sucker punching but i decided that i
might<00:02:26.010> as<00:02:26.100> well<00:02:26.130> just<00:02:26.340> knock<00:02:26.550> off<00:02:26.760> because<00:02:27.120> i

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
might as well just knock off because i

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.490 
might as well just knock off because i
kind<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.780> thought<00:02:27.870> he<00:02:27.990> would<00:02:28.110> go<00:02:28.230> into<00:02:28.350> his

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
kind of thought he would go into his

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
kind of thought he would go into his
scissor<00:02:28.740> over<00:02:28.800> here<00:02:29.010> because<00:02:29.280> if<00:02:29.400> he<00:02:29.490> is

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
scissor over here because if he is

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.550 
scissor over here because if he is
megazor<00:02:30.300> he<00:02:30.840> could<00:02:30.960> eat<00:02:31.050> up<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.230> knock<00:02:31.380> off

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
megazor he could eat up a knock off

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.500 
megazor he could eat up a knock off
really<00:02:31.710> well<00:02:31.800> but<00:02:32.430> no<00:02:32.580> he<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:32.850> packing<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.240> HP

here<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.880> reason<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.180> Drake<00:03:06.420> code<00:03:06.630> is<00:03:06.780> mainly

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
here the reason I Drake code is mainly

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.840 
here the reason I Drake code is mainly
because<00:03:07.470> in<00:03:07.830> case<00:03:08.070> he<00:03:08.280> wanted<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.550> go<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.700> his

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
because in case he wanted to go to his

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.400 
because in case he wanted to go to his
tea<00:03:09.030> tour<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.390> get<00:03:09.480> off<00:03:09.570> a<00:03:09.600> nice<00:03:09.870> fifty<00:03:10.320> to

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
tea tour and get off a nice fifty to

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.080 
tea tour and get off a nice fifty to
sixty<00:03:10.709> percent<00:03:10.860> cuz<00:03:11.489> at<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.700> point<00:03:11.880> I<00:03:11.940> was

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
sixty percent cuz at this point I was

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.820 
sixty percent cuz at this point I was
fairly<00:03:12.480> sure<00:03:12.750> he<00:03:12.900> was<00:03:13.020> scarf<00:03:13.290> if<00:03:13.470> this<00:03:13.650> has

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
fairly sure he was scarf if this has

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.890 
fairly sure he was scarf if this has
rocks<00:03:14.100> um<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.850> he<00:03:14.940> led<00:03:15.120> with<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.570> was

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
rocks um and he led with it I was

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.210 
rocks um and he led with it I was
thinking<00:03:16.200> he<00:03:16.290> was<00:03:16.440> most<00:03:16.650> likely<00:03:16.769> scarf

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
thinking he was most likely scarf

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.190 
thinking he was most likely scarf
because<00:03:17.400> i'm<00:03:17.730> still<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:18.660> my<00:03:18.690> mind<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.049> thought

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
because i'm still in my mind I thought

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.080 
because i'm still in my mind I thought
scissor<00:03:19.470> was<00:03:19.620> gonna<00:03:19.739> be<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:19.920> mega<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:20.820> I<00:03:20.850> knock

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
scissor was gonna be the mega so I knock

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.460 
scissor was gonna be the mega so I knock
him<00:03:21.269> out<00:03:21.360> as<00:03:21.540> he's<00:03:21.720> gonna<00:03:21.840> be<00:03:22.019> able<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.290> bring

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
him out as he's gonna be able to bring

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.900 
him out as he's gonna be able to bring
his<00:03:22.680> teeth<00:03:22.860> out<00:03:22.980> here<00:03:23.160> now<00:03:23.310> here<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.519> thought<00:03:23.760> he

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
his teeth out here now here I thought he

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.850 
his teeth out here now here I thought he
might<00:03:24.060> pursuit<00:03:24.420> what<00:03:24.660> there<00:03:25.320> was<00:03:25.350> no<00:03:25.560> point<00:03:25.709> of

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
might pursuit what there was no point of

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.920 
might pursuit what there was no point of
me<00:03:25.890> staying<00:03:26.010> here<00:03:26.370> cuz<00:03:26.730> getting<00:03:27.600> off<00:03:27.720> like

me staying here cuz getting off like

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.570 
me staying here cuz getting off like
twenty<00:03:28.410> percent<00:03:28.709> or<00:03:28.830> whatever<00:03:29.070> on<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.220> pursuit

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
twenty percent or whatever on a pursuit

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.520 
twenty percent or whatever on a pursuit
really<00:03:30.360> isn't<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.630> much<00:03:30.750> damage<00:03:31.049> so<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.380> just

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
really isn't that much damage so I just

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.870

his mana feed now I thought about going
to<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.590> waterfall<00:04:10.920> here<00:04:11.130> because<00:04:11.459> my<00:04:11.670> two

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.640 
to the waterfall here because my two
switches<00:04:12.480> here<00:04:12.660> were<00:04:12.840> either<00:04:12.989> raikou<00:04:13.500> or

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
switches here were either raikou or

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.550 
switches here were either raikou or
latias<00:04:13.980> both<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.579> which<00:04:14.700> t<00:04:14.880> TR<00:04:15.060> b<00:04:15.239> 1<00:04:15.420> vs<00:04:15.780> 1<00:04:15.810> so<00:04:16.530> i

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
latias both of which t TR b 1 vs 1 so i

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.620 
latias both of which t TR b 1 vs 1 so i
was<00:04:16.799> really<00:04:17.040> like<00:04:17.400> nervous<00:04:18.120> whether<00:04:18.450> i<00:04:18.540> should

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630

was really like nervous whether i should
go<00:04:18.720> for<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:18.959> waterfall<00:04:19.320> just<00:04:19.530> switch<00:04:19.680> out<00:04:19.859> but

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.670 
knowing that like he's most definitely
scarfed<00:04:33.840> at<00:04:33.930> this<00:04:34.050> point<00:04:34.259> just<00:04:34.349> the<00:04:34.470> way<00:04:34.560> he's

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
scarfed at this point just the way he's

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.950 
scarfed at this point just the way he's
been<00:04:34.710> playing<00:04:35.069> it<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:36.330> way<00:04:36.449> he<00:04:36.569> stays<00:04:36.810> in

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960

been playing it and the way he stays in
here<00:04:37.050> pretty<00:04:37.259> much<00:04:37.349> confirms<00:04:37.800> that<00:04:37.889> so<00:04:38.130> I'm

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
here pretty much confirms that so I'm

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.529 
here pretty much confirms that so I'm
actually<00:04:38.340> in<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.610> sec<00:04:38.789> my<00:04:38.819> dragon<00:04:39.300> I<00:04:39.360> just

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
actually in a sec my dragon I just

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.360 
actually in a sec my dragon I just
because<00:04:39.750> it's<00:04:40.169> not<00:04:40.349> gonna<00:04:40.530> do<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:40.770> much<00:04:41.190> work

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
because it's not gonna do that much work

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.890 
because it's not gonna do that much work
I<00:04:41.610> mean<00:04:41.849> I<00:04:41.880> think<00:04:41.970> I<00:04:42.270> think<00:04:42.479> this<00:04:42.539> was<00:04:42.690> just<00:04:42.810> a

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
I mean I think I think this was just a

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.689 
I mean I think I think this was just a
DD<00:04:43.050> night<00:04:43.289> yeah<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:43.860> he<00:04:44.009> has<00:04:44.099> a<00:04:44.130> scissor<00:04:44.460> which

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
DD night yeah and he has a scissor which

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.430 
DD night yeah and he has a scissor which
can<00:04:44.849> wall<00:04:45.030> this<00:04:45.210> thing<00:04:45.449> and<00:04:45.720> as<00:04:45.930> well<00:04:46.080> as<00:04:46.259> ohm

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
can wall this thing and as well as ohm

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.890 
can wall this thing and as well as ohm
just<00:04:47.370> stuff<00:04:48.000> on<00:04:48.120> this<00:04:48.210> team<00:04:48.419> was<00:04:48.509> gonna<00:04:48.720> beat

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
just stuff on this team was gonna beat

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.089 
just stuff on this team was gonna beat
the<00:04:49.050> so<00:04:49.169> there<00:04:49.289> was<00:04:49.380> no<00:04:49.500> point<00:04:49.530> keeping<00:04:49.830> it

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
the so there was no point keeping it

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:52.129 
the so there was no point keeping it
