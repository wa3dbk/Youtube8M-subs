like<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.799> crisscross<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.900> finale<00:03:17.260> strings

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
like the crisscross the finale strings

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.670 
like the crisscross the finale strings
instead<00:03:18.519> of<00:03:18.609> put<00:03:18.730> them<00:03:18.910> all<00:03:19.030> in<00:03:19.180> one<00:03:19.209> line<00:03:19.569> I<00:03:19.870> go

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
instead of put them all in one line I go

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.110 
instead of put them all in one line I go
back<00:03:20.859> and<00:03:21.010> forth<00:03:21.280> so<00:03:21.519> that<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.730> shells<00:03:21.970> will

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
back and forth so that the shells will

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.190 
back and forth so that the shells will
spread<00:03:22.329> out<00:03:22.480> in<00:03:22.599> the<00:03:22.660> air<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:25.109> think<00:03:26.109> it

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
spread out in the air and I think it

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.789 
spread out in the air and I think it
makes<00:03:26.319> it<00:03:26.440> look<00:03:26.530> nicer<00:03:28.440> but<00:03:29.440> I<00:03:29.500> will<00:03:29.650> go<00:03:29.769> ahead

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
makes it look nicer but I will go ahead

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.479 
makes it look nicer but I will go ahead
and<00:03:30.780> tie<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.840> finale<00:03:32.290> together<00:03:32.650> in<00:03:33.129> a<00:03:33.220> couple
