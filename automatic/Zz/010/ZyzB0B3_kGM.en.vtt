00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.280
 now handsome complaint services 8 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.140
 What is capitalist mismanagement in Greece? 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.830
 is there any such thing? 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.830
 Socialism does not have the exclusive right to mismanagement 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:13.979
 Socialist mismanagement is known 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:17.820
 Socialism that does not work without mismanagement that everyone knows 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.260
 who frees his citizens to economise their land 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.169
 inevitably in the ruins 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.229
 quite in contrast to the capitalism of the free market economy and the free 

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:33.250
 Playing the forces in a free market automatically leads to that sensibly 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.930
 is managed 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.890
 That is what the democratic organized free markets have 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.980
 western world since the fall of the Berlin Wall 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.200
 Thanks to the free market economy, he not only on tour 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.400
 is held that people buy unnecessary junk on the pump 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:52.850
 For example, in Germany, ten percent of private households 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.850
 so indebted that they would have to honor one of Greeks 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.360
 Now pay them later that's the slogan of the capitalist 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.490
 market economy 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.620
 There used to be an advertising slogan meant to be covered 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.650
 and it was not about condoms but about could 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.580
 Without this consumption on pump there is no growth 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.420
 and all profit the banks find cash are the shops 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.000
 Sell ​​goods and consumers live happily ever after 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.160
 until the day they report in the advertisement later 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.300
 and this later comes often too early and there a bit smile is too late 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.650
 he is never deep in the Dispo way notes 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.560
 Indices are just a pretty paraphrase for the ass 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.890
 Let's take a prominent case 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.010
 Franjo Poth the life sentiment of Verona Pooth born Fieldbusch instead 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.920
 his grandiose bankruptcy at the Sparkasse Dusseldorf with over ten 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.950
 Millions of euros in the chalk 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.920
 that would have cost around € 7,000 a year in interest 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.660
 even for his wife Chen a big chunk 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.800
 That's why the Sparkasse has agreed to a deal 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.760
 Happurg has paid about 1 kor 5 million euros of its debts and the bank 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.659
 renounced the rest 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:13.629
 according to the motto, either you take the fifth percent and really nothing 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:18.019
 The savings bank could cope with this, Mr. Tod would have hundreds of millions of euros 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.019
 Debt 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.019
 The savings banks had to call for the state to survive 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.859
 because if both in the loan agreement as if behind the desks too many 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.739
 Zeros are in the game, the taxpayer must bleed 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.919
 this is called free market economy 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.889
 then the old rule is you have a million euros debt you are in 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:36.769
 trouble 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.459
 Do you have a hundred million euros debt is a bank in trouble you have 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.909
 One hundred billion debt is the world in trouble 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:44.569
 until recently
