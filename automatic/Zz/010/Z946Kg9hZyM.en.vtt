00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.510
 hello today we will tell you how 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.870
 handle decorative 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.969
 stickers 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.860
 simple tricks that we show 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.279
 You can also use these clips stencils. 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.099
 materials principle works perfectly 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.429
 similarly 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.689
 as an example we will show double layer on film 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.029
 that is, consisting of two parts of different 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.380
 colors 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.560
 in fact it's like two ordinary 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.779
 single-layer bonds 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.079
 just need to repeat the same thing twice 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.270
 act 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.560
 as auxiliary 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.740
 tools we need but what 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.850
 paper masking tape and plastic spatula 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.100
 it's just a piece of plastic with ron vab 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.000
 bank 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.270
 all that we show in brief and difficult in 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.950
 attached instructions which 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.160
 for nails clamorous stencil green 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.690
 colors 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.810
 Sberbank must be removed at the edges 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.550
 adler and scotch pieces 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.040
 what is keeping you on the spot 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.140
 nba are not needed only at least 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.420
 transportation 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.040
 before sticking out of them 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.220
 should be removed 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.430
 this fleet of life at all on the climate 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.110
 if it had not been discovered 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.110
 experiencing means so necessary 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.340
 turn the label face down into 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.550
 Penza Bai couple centimeters white 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.940
 paper backing 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.200
 on the type of them at an acute angle to 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.190
 equipment and stickers we now have the price of wives 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.250
 third layer mounting ice 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.010
 trying on the stencil in place and glue 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.010
 this or priblovskogo 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.820
 on the glass that's enough 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.789
 but if you have a sticker poland 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.969
 or surfaces not smooth for example 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.070
 more or live tree 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.970
 then further secure and Perm 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.110
 edges with paint sports 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.110
 proceed to gluing 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.420
 start pulling out under the knife 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.860
 simultaneously smoothing 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.950
 mounting film so that it is exactly 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.080
 stuck surface 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.939
 along with the film sticks pattern 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.009
 well, or stencil if stuck 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.149
 adhesive stencil 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:13.529
 the assembly work of the executive committee which 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.309
 successfully removed on a flat 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:16.729
 carefully smoothing 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.359
 plastic sleep 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.649
 what you see is not very correct so 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.999
 pulling the substrate can be if your 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.899
 picture no small details 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:26.999
 if details are available submarine 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:28.379
 should be set out in the suburbs 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.119
 morally on the second block almost 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:33.179
 block 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:34.799
 if unpleasant happened 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.379
 it can be corrected 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.879
 under a flat surface 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.989
 The main thing that they gave the picture did not hang in 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:41.809
 the air 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:44.129
 even if the drawing is divided part by 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.399
 substrate and part to the surface 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.819
 about what parts to connect together 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.639
 making sure everything is fine 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.639
 carefully offered them bonds 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:56.769
 if secured with adhesive tape 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.849
 remove heat and begin to shoot 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.759
 mounting g 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:03.040
 here are no exceptions 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.570
 bend the film at an acute angle that is 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.110
 the fifth part should lie on the one that else 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.110
 stuck 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.200
 and thus tightening mounting navel 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.729
 start to finish it is very important 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.729
 otherwise details your drawing of lithuania paintings 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:27.089
 installation to us is no longer useful therefore 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:29.009
 can be ruthless complex in favor 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.929
 whistle 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:32.509
 even if you do it right 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:34.839
 watching the details of the picture 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.789
 if there is a suspicion that one of them 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.139
 trying to escape gently swear 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.169
 getaway toothpick clip or any 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.839
 other board items 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:44.650
 well, that's the first layer 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.569
 if he is your one and only 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.319
 in general, all the work is completed in a minute 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.229
 but we have a more difficult task 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.229
 and we proceed to layer two on two 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:56.099
 boat stickers and stencils have 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.329
 special tags are a combination of those that 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.259
 were we in the first year is on 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:03.009
 the glass does not have a second layer yet on the substrate 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.379
 everything is simple 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.359
 to make the pattern compatible with you on 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.419
 notes of the second layer to hit the mark 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:09.379
 first 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.950
 however the substrate is opaque therefore 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.029
 take the needs of the papers set aside under 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.579
 sticker sticking and cutting through tags 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.910
 second layer through to make it happen 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.329
 economists mecca exactly by its size and 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.939
 forms 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:26.439
 Understand relatively not 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:27.969
 relive jewelery accuracy 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:30.969
 there is no need 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.719
 mark spread take the second layer 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:49.020
 transportation this time I beat back 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.099
 and targets all marks of the first layer 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.470
 if there are two of you 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.130
 101 takes aim while second ton 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.439
 stiglitz scoot on top of sticker 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:59.469
 fixing it in position 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:00.870
 if there is no help 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.030
 but foreseeing a couple of sips of scotch 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.529
 top edge stickers 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:05.520
 and further 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.440
 everything is just like that book page 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.160
 picking up a perm sticker 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.590
 trying to scotch 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.010
 that will take a label label cavity contribution 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.889
 or walls 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.090
 consume several centimeters of substrate 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.650
 and free montage stick 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:19.570
 surface 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.080
 this is the most responsible stage further 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.870
 will be much easier 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.139
 on the second layer we have a lot of small parts 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.430
 therefore, we recall the recommendation and 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.430
 We pull out the substrate for a good lock 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.119
 but finally smoothing down the montage 

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:40.119
 new images in the past 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.620
 remove pops tatsyak you montazhku 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.620
 just like the first time 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:12.139
 but that's all 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.060
 in our case, Christmas decorations 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.289
 shop windows 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:17.360
 moscow post it can be a nasty sticker on 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.270
 the wall 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.539
 everything is ready and firmly on your 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.539
 surfaces 

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:27.339
 if it was a stencil but us 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:28.899
 it only remains to take the paints and 

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:30.529
 draw a picture 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:31.869
 but we have a sticker 

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:34.439
 so we move to the final stage then 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:37.439
 have admire the creation of their hands 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.270
 I once again draw your attention 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.460
 something and career stickers that for 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.349
 stencil tricks perfect 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:48.240
 the same 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.020
 so we will not shoot a separate 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.020
 stencil series 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:01.960
 well that's all for today 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.430
 and meeting in the next series
