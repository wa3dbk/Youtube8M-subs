the<00:00:12.030> ice-t<00:00:12.629> program<00:00:12.959> is<00:00:13.139> unique<00:00:13.289> because<00:00:13.590> of

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
the ice-t program is unique because of

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.880 
the ice-t program is unique because of
the<00:00:15.209> flexibility<00:00:15.840> overall<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.560> degree

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
the flexibility overall of the degree

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.410 
the flexibility overall of the degree
program<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.369> there's<00:00:17.550> five<00:00:17.760> areas<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
program so there's five areas of the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.410 
program so there's five areas of the
degree<00:00:18.689> but<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:20.369> most<00:00:20.550> important<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.119> 42

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
degree but the most important is the 42

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.600 
degree but the most important is the 42
credit<00:00:21.980> elective<00:00:22.980> area<00:00:23.220> which<00:00:23.340> allows

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
credit elective area which allows

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.790 
credit elective area which allows
students<00:00:23.940> to<00:00:23.970> transfer<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.869> lot<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.500> credits

out of or not flex out of it also gives

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.760 
out of or not flex out of it also gives
us<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> ability<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.840> move<00:00:46.079> credits<00:00:46.500> around

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
us the ability to move credits around

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.799 
us the ability to move credits around
between<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.610> various<00:00:47.910> areas<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.480> IFT

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
between the various areas of the IFT

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.750 
between the various areas of the IFT
programs<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.500> they<00:00:49.739> dive<00:00:49.980> into<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.370> number<00:00:50.670> of

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
programs so they dive into a number of

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.030 
programs so they dive into a number of
different<00:00:51.030> areas<00:00:51.300> from<00:00:51.510> IT<00:00:51.840> ethics<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.710> web

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
different areas from IT ethics to web

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.000 
different areas from IT ethics to web
development<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.910> database<00:00:54.570> programming<00:00:55.260> so

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
development to database programming so

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.400 
development to database programming so
they<00:00:56.309> come<00:00:56.579> out<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.239> degree<00:00:57.540> with<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> skill

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
they come out of the degree with a skill

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.590 
they come out of the degree with a skill
set<00:00:58.649> that's<00:00:58.710> really<00:00:59.430> broad<00:00:59.700> and<00:01:00.000> appealable

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
set that's really broad and appealable

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.200 
set that's really broad and appealable
to<00:01:00.660> employers<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.440> they<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.800> go<00:01:01.980> off<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.820> number

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
to employers so they can go off a number

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.880 
to employers so they can go off a number
of<00:01:03.360> different<00:01:03.660> offshoots<00:01:04.170> into<00:01:04.500> what<00:01:04.680> really

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
of different offshoots into what really

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.749 
of different offshoots into what really
interests<00:01:05.280> them

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
interests them

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.039 
interests them
well<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.149> curriculum<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> think<00:01:06.780> will<00:01:06.899> give

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
well I curriculum I think will give

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.350 
well I curriculum I think will give
students<00:01:07.409> an<00:01:07.500> edge<00:01:07.680> because<00:01:08.360> we're

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
students an edge because we're

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.000 
students an edge because we're
constantly<00:01:09.690> looking<00:01:10.110> at<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> private<00:01:10.590> sector

entrepreneurial sorts of things so the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.160 
entrepreneurial sorts of things so the
lean<00:01:26.640> launchpad<00:01:26.670> things<00:01:27.510> like<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.080> are

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
lean launchpad things like that that are

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.200 
lean launchpad things like that that are
giving<00:01:29.010> students<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.400> ability<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> go<00:01:30.150> out

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
and the ethics side of

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.770 
and the ethics side of
things<00:02:02.549> but<00:02:02.820> also<00:02:02.969> understand<00:02:03.540> how<00:02:03.630> to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
things but also understand how to

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.260 
things but also understand how to
program<00:02:04.500> or<00:02:04.860> create<00:02:05.280> databases<00:02:05.729> create

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
program or create databases create

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.050 
program or create databases create
websites<00:02:07.099> so<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.130> think<00:02:08.220> they<00:02:08.520> have<00:02:08.640> they<00:02:08.970> have

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
websites so I think they have they have

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.790 
websites so I think they have they have
a<00:02:09.119> good<00:02:09.270> understanding<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:10.050> where<00:02:10.560> they<00:02:10.769> fit

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
a good understanding of where they fit

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.589 
a good understanding of where they fit
in<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.430> what<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.730> think<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.120> student<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.480> is

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
in and what I think the student that is

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.570 
in and what I think the student that is
successful<00:02:13.140> in<00:02:13.230> Flex<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:13.739> one<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.340> has

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
successful in Flex is one that has

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.089 
successful in Flex is one that has
probably<00:02:14.819> been<00:02:15.150> out<00:02:15.630> in<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.950> whether<00:02:16.950> it's

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
probably been out in the whether it's

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.550 
probably been out in the whether it's

for five ten maybe fifteen years

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.839

in the way family happened other things

in the way family happened other things
happen<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.670> career<00:02:30.000> happen<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.780> Wow<00:02:31.080> all<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.500> a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
happen to career happen and Wow all of a

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.830 
happen to career happen and Wow all of a
sudden<00:02:32.150> maybe<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.239> don't<00:02:33.360> wanna<00:02:33.510> go<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.660> school

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
sudden maybe I don't wanna go to school

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.220 
sudden maybe I don't wanna go to school
maybe<00:02:34.019> I'm<00:02:34.140> gonna<00:02:34.260> work<00:02:34.410> right<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.819> I<00:02:36.660> think<00:02:37.049> a

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
maybe I'm gonna work right and I think a

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.050 
maybe I'm gonna work right and I think a
lot<00:02:37.349> of<00:02:37.380> IT<00:02:37.590> positions<00:02:38.099> are<00:02:38.190> fairly<00:02:38.370> organic<00:02:38.910> I

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
lot of IT positions are fairly organic I

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.820 
lot of IT positions are fairly organic I
mean<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.360> start<00:02:39.660> sort<00:02:40.049> of<00:02:40.080> doing<00:02:40.380> desktop

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
mean you start sort of doing desktop

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.890 
mean you start sort of doing desktop
support<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.489> then<00:02:42.000> ultimately<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:42.690> find

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
support and then ultimately you find

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.240 
support and then ultimately you find
yourself<00:02:43.290> being<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.890> database

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
yourself being the database

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.130 
yourself being the database
administrator<00:02:44.730> or<00:02:44.970> being<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.989> web

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
administrator or being the the web

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.400 
administrator or being the the web
developer<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.780> can<00:02:48.959> move<00:02:49.080> towards

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
developer and so you can move towards

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.839 
developer and so you can move towards
degree<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:49.950> never<00:02:50.130> really<00:02:50.459> want<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.640> go<00:02:50.730> back

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
degree and never really want to go back

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.789 
degree and never really want to go back
to<00:02:51.239> school<00:02:51.450> because<00:02:51.720> there<00:02:52.349> doesn't<00:02:52.620> seem<00:02:52.680> to

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
to school because there doesn't seem to

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.110 
to school because there doesn't seem to
be<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.980> whole<00:02:53.130> lot<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.280> benefit<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.880> can<00:02:54.030> be

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
be a whole lot of benefit and it can be

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.580 
be a whole lot of benefit and it can be
really<00:02:54.660> expensive<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.260> time-consuming<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:58.560> I

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
really expensive and time-consuming so I

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.890 
really expensive and time-consuming so I
think<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.220> those<00:02:59.340> people<00:02:59.640> that<00:02:59.819> are<00:03:00.360> saying

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
think that those people that are saying

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.240 
think that those people that are saying
well<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.200> skills<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.500> they<00:03:01.680> have<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.220> that

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
well the skills that they have and that

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.550 
well the skills that they have and that
they've<00:03:02.430> learned<00:03:02.700> but<00:03:03.510> want<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.840> get<00:03:04.440> that

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
they've learned but want to get that
