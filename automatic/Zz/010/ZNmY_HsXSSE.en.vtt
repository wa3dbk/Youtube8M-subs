00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.000

 rocker you're dreaming preceded 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.920
 and the dumping of the most roman and romantic 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.570

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.140
 like 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.630
 well to try 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.750
 very good, let's start applying 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.829
 a makeup foundation that is the same 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.629
 color of your skin 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.989
 I'm going to apply it with a hair brush 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.910
 synthetic very little amount 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.110
 If you want to buy a brush this is 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:53.909
 the ideal we are going to apply the base in everything 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:56.129
 the face does not have to be noticed 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:58.320
 difference if we are going to thank those 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.149
 ladies who put on excesses and are 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.030
 note the rust here seems to have a 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.970
 mask that I'm not going to put a 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.720
 correction of dark circles or the same color 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:14.789
 of the skin and I will apply throughout the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.880
 eyelid a shadow is the color but 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:20.970
 the more sunken we have the more 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.130
 bright and more clarito we are going to put 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.970
 once you apply the pain shadows 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.680
 pearl i'm going to work with some shadows 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.310
 pink that in this case is a color 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.630
 mate and I will apply it only in the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.700

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.400
 magic that is called the patent for 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.849
 segment it and give it color this is going to 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.040
 make the lipstick last a lot longer 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:19.260
 I'm going to outline the lips to give you a 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.180
 good shape let's choose two colors 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.410
 of lipstick take into account that the brush 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.560
 it has to be good hair sometimes 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.210
 The brush cutting style is called 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.840
 the tongue of cat 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:39.890
 I'm going to put the other color that is more 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.890
 beautiful cited only in the center of the lip 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.550
 the pinkest color at the ends 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.550
 and the color 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.310
 more neutral in the center of the lip 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.160
 while forming the achievement that the lips 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.760
 they look a little bit thicker choose two 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.959

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.959
 more brownish 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.720
 and then I'm going to apply a color that 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.709
 call these candy and if we want to 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.959
 we can laugh and in the upper part of the 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.150
 cheekbone apply 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.699

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.650
 fiber optic brush that is what we 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.840
 will help illustrate and lift the 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.930
