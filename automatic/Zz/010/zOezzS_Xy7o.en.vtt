00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.060 

okay<00:00:00.510> so<00:00:00.570> I'm<00:00:01.230> going<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.439> show<00:00:01.560> how<00:00:01.650> to<00:00:01.800> replace

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
okay so I'm going to show how to replace

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.130 
okay so I'm going to show how to replace
this<00:00:02.399> water<00:00:02.850> pressure<00:00:03.090> regulator<00:00:03.449> it's<00:00:03.959> not

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
this water pressure regulator it's not

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.210 
this water pressure regulator it's not
working<00:00:04.500> properly

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
working properly

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.570 
working properly
it's<00:00:06.210> running<00:00:06.660> beyond<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.950> recommended

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
it's running beyond the recommended

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.690 
it's running beyond the recommended
pressure<00:00:08.790> range<00:00:10.250> inspector<00:00:11.250> said<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.519> was

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
pressure range inspector said I was

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.950 
pressure range inspector said I was
running<00:00:11.910> around<00:00:12.030> 100<00:00:12.570> 120<00:00:13.170> psi<00:00:13.940> so<00:00:14.940> it's<00:00:15.839> a

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
running around 100 120 psi so it's a

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.750 
running around 100 120 psi so it's a
model<00:00:16.440> 70<00:00:17.510> from<00:00:18.510> wilkinson<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:20.460> got<00:00:20.609> one

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
model 70 from wilkinson and I got one

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.820 
model 70 from wilkinson and I got one
with<00:00:20.910> similar<00:00:21.300> specs<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:22.550> I<00:00:23.570> made<00:00:24.570> sure<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.170> was

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
with similar specs and I made sure I was

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.500 
with similar specs and I made sure I was
lucky<00:00:26.039> enough<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.250> take<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.460> picture<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:27.150> its

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
lucky enough to take a picture of its

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.980 
lucky enough to take a picture of its
size<00:00:28.439> it's<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.769> one-inch<00:00:29.099> pipe<00:00:29.369> or<00:00:29.670> one<00:00:30.660> size

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
size it's a one-inch pipe or one size

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.209 
size it's a one-inch pipe or one size
pressure<00:00:31.289> regulator<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:33.140> basically<00:00:34.140> all<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
pressure regulator so basically all the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.830 
pressure regulator so basically all the
wrenches<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.550> had<00:00:35.730> at<00:00:35.850> home<00:00:35.880> run<00:00:36.180> big<00:00:36.360> enough<00:00:36.570> I

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
wrenches I had at home run big enough I

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.299 
wrenches I had at home run big enough I
ended<00:00:37.829> up<00:00:37.860> getting<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.309> plumbers<00:00:39.180> wrench

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
ended up getting this plumbers wrench

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.930 
ended up getting this plumbers wrench
the<00:00:41.309> nut<00:00:41.550> sizes<00:00:41.940> are<00:00:42.030> about<00:00:42.320> two<00:00:43.320> inches<00:00:43.620> in

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
the nut sizes are about two inches in

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.520 
the nut sizes are about two inches in
diameter<00:00:45.469> so<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:47.450> entire<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.410> what

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
diameter so this entire this is what

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.560 
diameter so this entire this is what
came<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.010> kit<00:00:52.610> two<00:00:53.610> sets<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.000> nuts<00:00:54.210> and

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
came with the kit two sets of nuts and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.830 
came with the kit two sets of nuts and
then<00:00:55.160> this<00:00:56.160> pressure<00:00:56.399> regulator<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.510> model

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
then this pressure regulator the model

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.160 
then this pressure regulator the model
number<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.109> about<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> same<00:00:58.680> model<00:00:59.070> 70<00:01:00.170> XL

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
number is about the same model 70 XL

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.350 
number is about the same model 70 XL
instead<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.800> 170<00:01:02.840> so<00:01:04.700> getting<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:08.360> xld

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
instead of just 170 so getting this xld

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.750 
instead of just 170 so getting this xld
you<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.979> size<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.159> definitely<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.580> same

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
you and size is definitely the same

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.950 
you and size is definitely the same
one-inch<00:01:14.270> all<00:01:15.270> right<00:01:15.390> I'm<00:01:15.509> going<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.720> go<00:01:15.840> ahead

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
one-inch all right I'm going to go ahead

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.080 
one-inch all right I'm going to go ahead
I<00:01:16.409> think<00:01:17.040> most<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.400> waters<00:01:17.670> been<00:01:17.790> drained

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
I think most of the waters been drained

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.999 
I think most of the waters been drained
out<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.509> start<00:01:18.810> opening<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.409> current

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
out and start opening up this current

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.560 
out and start opening up this current
pressure<00:01:20.220> regulator<00:01:22.580> now<00:01:23.580> sometimes<00:01:24.030> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
pressure regulator now sometimes it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.109 
pressure regulator now sometimes it
could<00:01:24.780> be<00:01:24.840> attached<00:01:25.430> like<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.580> saw<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.909> some

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
could be attached like I saw on some

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.149 
could be attached like I saw on some
other<00:01:27.270> YouTube<00:01:27.600> videos<00:01:27.900> right<00:01:28.200> next<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
other YouTube videos right next to the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:29.690 
other YouTube videos right next to the
water<00:01:29.310> heater

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
water heater

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.330 
water heater
but<00:01:30.000> luckily<00:01:30.200> comes<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.350> nice<00:01:31.530> convenient

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
but luckily comes a nice convenient

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.609 
but luckily comes a nice convenient
location<00:01:32.759> outside<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:36.290> just<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.500> put

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
location outside and just going to put

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.010 
location outside and just going to put
it<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.610> photos<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.119> round<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.720> open<00:01:39.930> it

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
it up that photos that round and open it

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:52.550 
it up that photos that round and open it
up<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.020> right<00:01:43.170> size<00:01:43.439> on

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.270 

all<00:01:53.560> right<00:01:54.900> well<00:01:55.900> let's<00:01:56.320> coat<00:01:56.590> enough<00:01:56.860> hoping

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
all right well let's coat enough hoping

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.560 
all right well let's coat enough hoping
will<00:01:57.430> rust<00:01:57.730> I'll<00:01:58.540> just<00:01:58.720> clean<00:01:58.960> up<00:01:59.110> afterwards

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
will rust I'll just clean up afterwards

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.080 
will rust I'll just clean up afterwards
get<00:02:01.570> a<00:02:01.600> nice<00:02:01.810> tight<00:02:02.290> snug<00:02:02.500> fit<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.000> start<00:02:04.000> to

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
get a nice tight snug fit and start to

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:24.030 
get a nice tight snug fit and start to
take<00:02:04.240> it<00:02:04.270> off<00:02:19.290> all<00:02:20.290> right<00:02:21.510> okay<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:22.770> we<00:02:23.770> managed

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
take it off all right okay so we managed

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.320 
take it off all right okay so we managed
to<00:02:24.130> take<00:02:24.250> off<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.520> top<00:02:24.700> one<00:02:24.880> now<00:02:25.030> it's<00:02:25.150> time<00:02:25.300> to

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
to take off the top one now it's time to

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.120 
to take off the top one now it's time to
get<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.630> bottom<00:02:25.959> one<00:02:26.110> right<00:02:26.350> there

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.290 

alright<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:30.190> I'm<00:02:30.430> trying<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.700> loosen<00:02:30.970> this<00:02:31.090> one

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
alright so I'm trying to loosen this one

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.320 
alright so I'm trying to loosen this one
up<00:02:31.420> right<00:02:31.900> here<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.410> basically<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:34.150> is

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
up right here and basically this is

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.490 
up right here and basically this is
going<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.540> probably<00:02:34.690> hit<00:02:34.990> into<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.260> wall<00:02:35.470> I

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
going to probably hit into the wall I

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.640 
going to probably hit into the wall I
don't<00:02:35.709> wanna<00:02:35.980> want<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.940> eat<00:02:37.120> into<00:02:37.270> this<00:02:37.650> paint

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
don't wanna want to eat into this paint

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.010 
don't wanna want to eat into this paint
right<00:02:38.830> here<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:40.120> I'm<00:02:40.209> basically<00:02:40.360> put<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:40.870> like

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
right here so I'm basically put it like

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.510 
right here so I'm basically put it like
a<00:02:41.050> wooden<00:02:41.290> block<00:02:41.470> or<00:02:41.740> something<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.280> blocked

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
a wooden block or something to blocked

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.490 
a wooden block or something to blocked
away<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:42.940> then<00:02:43.030> instead<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:43.959> holding<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.380> in

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
away and then instead of holding it in

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.949 
away and then instead of holding it in
place<00:02:44.850> because<00:02:45.850> it's<00:02:46.000> loosening<00:02:46.450> at<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.720> same

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
place because it's loosening at the same

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.590 
place because it's loosening at the same
time<00:02:47.200> while<00:02:47.410> I'm<00:02:47.500> loosing<00:02:47.830> they're<00:02:47.950> not<00:02:48.600> okay

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
time while I'm loosing they're not okay

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.590 
time while I'm loosing they're not okay
so<00:02:49.660> because<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.200> bottom<00:02:50.500> end<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:52.330> threads

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
so because the bottom end the threads

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.449 
so because the bottom end the threads
upside<00:02:52.959> down<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:53.440> we<00:02:53.560> have<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:53.709> rotate<00:02:54.190> it

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
upside down so we have to rotate it

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.670 
upside down so we have to rotate it
counterclockwise<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.750> loosen<00:02:55.900> instead<00:02:56.530> of

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
counterclockwise to loosen instead of

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.759 
counterclockwise to loosen instead of
father<00:02:57.610> likes<00:02:57.880> like<00:02:58.239> we<00:02:58.390> did<00:02:58.540> last<00:02:58.720> time<00:03:01.769> there

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769

and that one up fell down there let's
see<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.680> pull<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.100> out<00:03:09.220> now<00:03:12.300> put<00:03:13.300> that<00:03:13.330> little

see the pull it out now put that little
piece<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.900> block<00:03:14.080> there<00:03:14.350> so<00:03:14.620> that<00:03:14.830> this

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
piece of block there so that this

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.530 
piece of block there so that this
wouldn't<00:03:16.210> hit<00:03:16.420> into<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.750> wall<00:03:17.970> all<00:03:18.970> right<00:03:19.150> now

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
wouldn't hit into the wall all right now

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.170 
wouldn't hit into the wall all right now
we<00:03:19.600> can<00:03:19.750> put<00:03:19.900> in<00:03:19.990> a<00:03:20.080> new<00:03:20.200> one<00:03:20.350> in<00:03:20.500> oh<00:03:21.090> it's<00:03:22.090> a

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
there's no way to take it off so we have

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.430 
there's no way to take it off so we have
to<00:03:41.440> use<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.680> current<00:03:41.980> one<00:03:43.170> that's<00:03:44.170> kind<00:03:44.380> of

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
to use the current one that's kind of

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.500 
to use the current one that's kind of
lame<00:03:45.430> I<00:03:45.490> would<00:03:45.760> have<00:03:45.850> liked<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.000> use<00:03:46.210> the<00:03:46.240> new

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
lame I would have liked to use the new

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.790 
lame I would have liked to use the new
one<00:03:46.690> but<00:03:46.840> oh<00:03:46.900> well<00:03:48.570> okay<00:03:49.570> so<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:50.110> can't<00:03:50.440> take<00:03:50.620> off

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
one but oh well okay so I can't take off

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.520 
one but oh well okay so I can't take off
these<00:03:51.010> original<00:03:51.820> nuts<00:03:52.080> looks<00:03:53.080> like<00:03:53.260> they<00:03:53.410> got

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
these original nuts looks like they got

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.090 
these original nuts looks like they got
a<00:03:53.590> little<00:03:53.740> flange<00:03:54.100> there<00:03:55.500> let's<00:03:56.500> prevent<00:03:56.860> them

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
a little flange there let's prevent them

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.030 
a little flange there let's prevent them
from<00:03:57.130> coming<00:03:57.490> off<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.870> I'll<00:03:59.350> just<00:03:59.650> use<00:03:59.830> these

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
from coming off so I'll just use these

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.500 
from coming off so I'll just use these
same<00:04:00.220> ones<00:04:00.520> but<00:04:00.760> I'll<00:04:01.000> make<00:04:01.240> sure<00:04:01.390> that

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
same ones but I'll make sure that

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.160 
same ones but I'll make sure that
replace<00:04:01.870> them<00:04:02.050> with<00:04:02.170> new<00:04:02.530> o-rings<00:04:03.750> so<00:04:04.750> I<00:04:04.900> guess

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
replace them with new o-rings so I guess

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.830 
replace them with new o-rings so I guess
I<00:04:05.290> won't<00:04:05.500> be<00:04:05.590> able<00:04:05.710> to<00:04:05.800> use<00:04:06.010> these<00:04:06.600> but<00:04:07.600> I'll<00:04:07.690> be

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
I won't be able to use these but I'll be

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.360 
I won't be able to use these but I'll be
able<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.050> use<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.410> o-rings<00:04:08.830> that<00:04:09.010> came<00:04:09.220> with

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
able to use the o-rings that came with

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:20.710 
able to use the o-rings that came with
it

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.920 

all<00:04:21.200> right<00:04:21.620> okay<00:04:22.490> so<00:04:22.550> I've<00:04:23.000> managed<00:04:23.660> to<00:04:23.720> get

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
all right okay so I've managed to get

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.780 
all right okay so I've managed to get
the<00:04:24.110> o-ring<00:04:24.500> down<00:04:24.680> there<00:04:24.890> at<00:04:24.980> the<00:04:25.040> bottom<00:04:25.250> and

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
the o-ring down there at the bottom and

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.670 
the o-ring down there at the bottom and
then<00:04:26.420> I'm<00:04:26.600> gonna<00:04:26.780> go<00:04:26.960> for<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.200> bottom<00:04:27.530> and

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
then I'm gonna go for the bottom and

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.020 
then I'm gonna go for the bottom and
first<00:04:28.070> just<00:04:28.970> so<00:04:29.150> it<00:04:29.900> doesn't<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:31.580> doesn't<00:04:31.820> move

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
first just so it doesn't it doesn't move

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.940 
first just so it doesn't it doesn't move
around<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:33.020> then<00:04:33.170> I'm<00:04:33.230> gonna<00:04:33.350> put<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.560> o-ring

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
around and then I'm gonna put the o-ring

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.500 
around and then I'm gonna put the o-ring
at<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.130> top<00:04:34.370> because<00:04:34.670> it's<00:04:34.970> kind<00:04:35.240> of<00:04:35.270> hard<00:04:35.330> to

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
at the top because it's kind of hard to

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.810 
at the top because it's kind of hard to
put<00:04:35.660> it<00:04:35.750> on<00:04:35.900> at<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.140> same<00:04:36.260> time<00:04:36.490> so<00:04:37.490> right<00:04:37.640> now

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
put it on at the same time so right now

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.820 
put it on at the same time so right now
there's<00:04:38.060> no<00:04:38.240> ring<00:04:38.630> there<00:04:38.840> that's<00:04:39.530> just<00:04:39.620> a

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
there's no ring there that's just a

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.670 
there's no ring there that's just a
flange<00:04:40.100> right<00:04:40.400> there<00:04:44.230> okay<00:04:45.230> so<00:04:45.290> it's<00:04:45.500> kind<00:04:45.650> of

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
flange right there okay so it's kind of

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.530 
flange right there okay so it's kind of
really<00:04:45.920> hard<00:04:46.100> to<00:04:46.250> get<00:04:46.340> that<00:04:46.550> second<00:04:47.390> whole

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
really hard to get that second whole

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.330 
really hard to get that second whole
ring<00:04:47.750> in<00:04:47.990> first<00:04:48.470> right<00:04:48.740> now<00:04:48.890> so<00:04:49.070> I'm<00:04:49.130> going<00:04:49.250> to

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
ring in first right now so I'm going to

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.370 
ring in first right now so I'm going to
tighten<00:04:49.700> it<00:04:49.790> up<00:04:49.910> from<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.240> bottom<00:04:50.390> and<00:04:50.720> see<00:04:51.290> if

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
tighten it up from the bottom and see if

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.480 
tighten it up from the bottom and see if
I<00:04:51.470> can<00:04:51.650> okay

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
I can okay

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.250 
I can okay
tighten<00:04:53.030> up<00:04:53.150> enough<00:04:53.450> to<00:04:53.570> get<00:04:53.630> creating<00:04:54.140> that

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
tighten up enough to get creating that

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.500 
tighten up enough to get creating that
gap<00:04:54.620> and<00:04:54.860> put<00:04:55.010> in<00:04:55.100> a<00:04:55.190> second<00:04:55.490> all<00:04:55.640> rang<00:04:55.820> calm

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.050 

okay<00:04:59.510> so<00:04:59.800> basically<00:05:00.800> got<00:05:01.430> this<00:05:01.610> tightened

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
okay so basically got this tightened

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.910 
okay so basically got this tightened
down<00:05:02.120> as<00:05:02.480> much<00:05:02.660> as<00:05:02.780> I<00:05:02.870> could<00:05:02.930> so<00:05:03.380> I<00:05:03.830> could

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
down as much as I could so I could

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.950 
down as much as I could so I could
create<00:05:04.280> enough<00:05:04.610> of<00:05:04.730> an<00:05:04.820> opening<00:05:05.210> to<00:05:05.390> install

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
create enough of an opening to install

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.480
