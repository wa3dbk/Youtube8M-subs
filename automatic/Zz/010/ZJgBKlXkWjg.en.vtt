had<00:01:58.450> her<00:01:58.570> first<00:01:59.140> period<00:01:59.440> and<00:01:59.940> this<00:02:00.940> year

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
had her first period and this year

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.630 
had her first period and this year
didn't<00:02:01.479> I<00:02:01.540> had<00:02:01.690> math<00:02:01.960> and<00:02:02.290> I'm<00:02:02.350> like<00:02:02.530> this<00:02:03.370> just

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
didn't I had math and I'm like this just

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.250 
didn't I had math and I'm like this just
does<00:02:03.820> not<00:02:03.850> feel<00:02:04.180> right<00:02:04.240> this<00:02:04.600> does<00:02:04.750> not<00:02:04.900> feel

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
does not feel right this does not feel

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.449 
does not feel right this does not feel
right<00:02:05.320> at<00:02:05.770> all<00:02:05.950> so<00:02:06.909> I<00:02:06.940> went<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.390> guidance<00:02:07.780> and

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
right at all so I went to guidance and

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.290 
right at all so I went to guidance and
guidance<00:02:09.459> is<00:02:09.610> where<00:02:09.759> you<00:02:09.849> change<00:02:10.119> your

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
guidance is where you change your

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.559 
guidance is where you change your
schedule<00:02:10.450> I<00:02:10.810> went<00:02:11.499> there<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.889> I<00:02:12.489> changed<00:02:13.329> my

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
schedule I went there and I changed my

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.539 
schedule I went there and I changed my
schedule<00:02:13.749> got<00:02:14.079> rid<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.290> math<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.859> just<00:02:15.310> dropped

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
schedule got rid of math I just dropped

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:16.500 
schedule got rid of math I just dropped
it<00:02:15.730> completely<00:02:16.120> because<00:02:16.209> I

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
it completely because I

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.229 
it completely because I
don't<00:02:16.629> need<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:17.049> just<00:02:17.409> uh<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:18.030> don't<00:02:19.030> need<00:02:19.120> it

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
don't need it I just uh I don't need it

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.399 
don't need it I just uh I don't need it
for<00:02:19.330> what<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.480> want<00:02:19.629> to<00:02:19.689> be<00:02:19.780> which<00:02:19.989> is<00:02:20.019> a<00:02:20.140> teacher

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
for what I want to be which is a teacher

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.899 
for what I want to be which is a teacher
so<00:02:20.799> screwed<00:02:21.549> don't<00:02:22.540> need<00:02:22.659> my<00:02:22.780> math<00:02:22.989> and<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.909> dry

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
so screwed don't need my math and I dry

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.910 
so screwed don't need my math and I dry
well<00:02:25.569> I<00:02:25.629> did<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.870> would<00:02:26.140> be<00:02:26.260> my<00:02:26.379> math<00:02:26.560> was<00:02:26.769> gonna

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
well I did I would be my math was gonna

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.350 
well I did I would be my math was gonna
be<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.040> math<00:02:27.250> teacher<00:02:27.280> I'm<00:02:27.700> not<00:02:27.730> obviously

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
be a math teacher I'm not obviously

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.720 
be a math teacher I'm not obviously
gonna<00:02:28.510> be<00:02:28.599> a<00:02:28.720> math<00:02:28.870> teacher<00:02:28.900> but<00:02:29.379> uh<00:02:29.950> yeah<00:02:30.700> I

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
gonna be a math teacher but uh yeah I

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.729 
gonna be a math teacher but uh yeah I
dropped<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.540> took<00:02:31.599> another<00:02:31.989> social

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
dropped it and I took another social

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.640 
dropped it and I took another social
science<00:02:33.220> class<00:02:33.370> which<00:02:33.610> is<00:02:33.790> um<00:02:34.650> Canadian

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
science class which is um Canadian

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.160 
science class which is um Canadian
history<00:02:35.769> and<00:02:36.510> then<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.569> have<00:02:37.659> native<00:02:38.019> studies

chemistry<00:02:42.579> and<00:02:43.120> I've<00:02:43.510> great<00:02:43.690> eleven

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
chemistry and I've great eleven

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.300 
chemistry and I've great eleven
chemistry<00:02:44.260> because<00:02:44.409> I<00:02:44.590> didn't<00:02:44.890> take<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.010> last

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
chemistry because I didn't take it last

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.599 
chemistry because I didn't take it last
year<00:02:45.549> because<00:02:46.480> i<00:02:46.599> was<00:02:46.750> debating<00:02:46.870> on<00:02:47.290> which

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
year because i was debating on which

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.640 
year because i was debating on which
which<00:02:48.609> of<00:02:48.819> which<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:49.989> sciences<00:02:50.319> i<00:02:50.440> wanted

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
which of which of the sciences i wanted

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.899 
which of which of the sciences i wanted
to<00:02:50.709> continue<00:02:51.010> with<00:02:51.250> like<00:02:51.459> you<00:02:51.579> don't<00:02:51.730> want<00:02:51.849> to

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
to continue with like you don't want to

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.119 
to continue with like you don't want to
continue<00:02:52.180> with<00:02:52.269> bio<00:02:52.750> or<00:02:53.019> physics<00:02:53.409> and<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:54.099> I

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
continue with bio or physics and so I

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.610 
continue with bio or physics and so I
took<00:02:54.250> both<00:02:54.549> of<00:02:54.579> those<00:02:54.819> in<00:02:55.060> grade<00:02:55.209> 11<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.690> i

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
took both of those in grade 11 and i

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.940 
took both of those in grade 11 and i
think<00:02:56.889> i<00:02:57.010> continue<00:02:57.670> i<00:02:57.700> picked<00:02:58.090> physics<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.079> in

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
think i continue i picked physics and in

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.649 
think i continue i picked physics and in
order<00:03:00.159> for<00:03:00.370> me<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.489> take<00:03:00.940> both<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.239> them<00:03:01.480> in

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
order for me to take both of them in

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.470 
order for me to take both of them in
grade<00:03:01.780> 11<00:03:01.810> i<00:03:02.170> had<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.889> had<00:03:03.849> to<00:03:04.030> not<00:03:04.269> take
