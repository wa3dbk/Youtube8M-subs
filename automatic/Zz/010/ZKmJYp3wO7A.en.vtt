00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:29.440
 There are fears to work in Indonesia, but expectations are greater. 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:35.770

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.459
 I'm from Jakarta but 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.270
 It hurts from the other person and it sounds but it has been a year since I entered my body at muscle training 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.330
 Also 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:06.840
 I can speak words already 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:12.590
 At first I was confused at first, but I spend time with good members 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.590
 I remembered a lot and it was very early a year 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:23.099
 I have a question to do not smoke and Nakagawa, but rather a culture of Tteyuu Jakarta and Japan 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:29.400
 I think it is different, but have you ever wanted to go back to Japan ? 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:32.860
 Well it was a close Japan is really to you there is a difference of culture 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.450

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:43.360
 But after all there are many things I remember every day 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:48.010
 Since the Toka members who will support around the instep I have been working as a lecturer Te' Katie 4

 This while asked to support Toka fans 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:58.910
 It's not a cultural exchange, but if you learn Indonesian culture like this, it will be for Japan 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:00.900
 I'll tell you if I can do that I have a microphone I have an uneasy country 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.730
