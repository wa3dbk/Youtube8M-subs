00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
being goober charged as a pyro and why

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.380 
being goober charged as a pyro and why
it's<00:01:15.990> actually<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.100> good<00:01:17.729> thing<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.270> why<00:01:18.360> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
it's actually a good thing and why I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.990 
it's actually a good thing and why I
think<00:01:18.720> more<00:01:18.930> people<00:01:18.960> should<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.740> obviously

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
think more people should do it obviously

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.749 
think more people should do it obviously
if<00:01:21.000> there<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> competent<00:01:22.380> demo<00:01:22.740> man<00:01:23.040> or<00:01:23.460> a

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
if there is a competent demo man or a

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.910 
if there is a competent demo man or a
really<00:01:24.450> good<00:01:24.600> soldier<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:25.200> heavy<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> team

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
really good soldier or heavy on the team

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.770 
really good soldier or heavy on the team
you<00:01:26.460> want<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.090> them<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.750> you

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
you want to do it to them but if you

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.960 
you want to do it to them but if you
have<00:01:27.869> one<00:01:28.290> line<00:01:28.530> around<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.159> there's<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.759> good

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
have one line around and there's a good

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.190 
have one line around and there's a good
pyro<00:01:30.270> that's<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> team

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
pyro that's on the team

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.530 
pyro that's on the team
throwing<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.950> their<00:01:32.100> way<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> bad<00:01:33.329> idea

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
throwing it their way is not a bad idea

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.469 
throwing it their way is not a bad idea
because<00:01:33.869> an<00:01:34.140> uber<00:01:34.439> pyro<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:35.610> cause<00:01:35.880> such

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
because an uber pyro can cause such

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.960 
because an uber pyro can cause such
havoc<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> enemy<00:01:38.340> team<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.790> more

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
havoc to the enemy team and the more

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.460 
havoc to the enemy team and the more

really the one reason is not it's not

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.230 
really the one reason is not it's not
the<00:01:40.619> damage<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.579> not<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.150> know

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
the damage it's not that you know

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.370 
the damage it's not that you know
getting<00:01:42.509> close<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.750> hitting<00:01:43.049> somebody<00:01:43.200> with

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
getting close and hitting somebody with

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.380

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the extinguisher like you're seeing it's

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.510 
the extinguisher like you're seeing it's
because<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> flames<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.280> really

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
because of the flames if you really

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.800 
because of the flames if you really
think<00:01:47.610> about<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.030> when<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.299> go<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.509> as<00:01:48.600> an<00:01:48.689> uber

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
flinching they're all going to have

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.149

this<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.869> especially<00:01:58.259> effective<00:01:59.250> right<00:01:59.939> when

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
this is especially effective right when

only get into very very close
flamethrower<00:02:56.610> distance<00:02:57.090> but<00:02:57.570> then<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.720> also

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
flamethrower distance but then I also

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.530 
flamethrower distance but then I also
have<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.380> get<00:02:58.470> even<00:02:58.530> closer<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.550> hit<00:03:00.150> somebody

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
have to get even closer and hit somebody

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.350 
rather than just running right into
somebody's<00:03:10.410> face<00:03:10.770> and<00:03:10.800> smash<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.910> get<00:03:12.030> did<00:03:12.300> I

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
somebody's face and smash and get did I

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.180 
somebody's face and smash and get did I
get<00:03:12.600> them<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.900> don't<00:03:13.500> like<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.800> at<00:03:13.950> all

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190

get them I don't like that at all
now<00:03:14.310> there<00:03:14.460> are<00:03:14.520> some<00:03:14.640> situations<00:03:14.850> where<00:03:15.270> I

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
now there are some situations where I

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.090 
now there are some situations where I
think<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.750> could<00:03:15.870> be<00:03:15.900> better<00:03:16.110> than<00:03:16.770> having<00:03:16.950> to

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
think it could be better than having to

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.530 
think it could be better than having to
use<00:03:17.220> something<00:03:17.459> like<00:03:17.490> a<00:03:17.580> shotgun<00:03:17.790> oh<00:03:18.060> like<00:03:18.510> I

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
use something like a shotgun oh like I

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.240 
use something like a shotgun oh like I
said<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.750> flare<00:03:18.930> gun<00:03:18.959> like<00:03:19.770> in<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:20.010> tight

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
said the flare gun like in a tight

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.100 
said the flare gun like in a tight
corridor<00:03:20.850> where<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.390> guy<00:03:21.540> really<00:03:21.810> can't<00:03:21.990> get

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
corridor where the guy really can't get

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.980 
corridor where the guy really can't get
away<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.850> running<00:03:23.850> at<00:03:24.060> them<00:03:24.240> with<00:03:24.420> your<00:03:24.450> melee

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
away and running at them with your melee

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.510 
away and running at them with your melee
outs<00:03:25.170> not<00:03:25.530> going<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.100> cause<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.340> any

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
outs not going to cause you any

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.490 
outs not going to cause you any
detriment<00:03:27.150> like<00:03:27.660> if<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.900> whole<00:03:28.080> team<00:03:28.290> is

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
detriment like if the whole team is

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.990 
detriment like if the whole team is
right<00:03:28.680> there<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.310> only<00:03:29.490> reason<00:03:29.670> why<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:29.910> is

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
right there the only reason why this is

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.520 
right there the only reason why this is
really<00:03:30.209> working<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.690> well<00:03:30.900> on<00:03:31.170> in<00:03:31.320> this

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530

stuff but let's really talk about the

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.140 
stuff but let's really talk about the
downside<00:04:16.200> here<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.709> it's<00:04:17.220> pretty<00:04:17.609> obvious<00:04:18.000> I

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
downside here and it's pretty obvious I

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.789 
downside here and it's pretty obvious I
guess<00:04:18.209> if<00:04:18.510> there's<00:04:18.690> an<00:04:18.840> enemy<00:04:18.989> pyro<00:04:19.410> on<00:04:19.709> the
