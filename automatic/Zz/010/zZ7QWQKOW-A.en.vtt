00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
like Jenna's hair because it was

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.380 
like Jenna's hair because it was
shedding<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.310> i<00:00:29.340> always<00:00:29.760> had<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.150> tie<00:00:30.330> it

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
shedding and so i always had to tie it

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.600 
shedding and so i always had to tie it
back<00:00:30.599> i<00:00:30.660> really<00:00:31.050> couldn't<00:00:31.260> comb<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.710> otherwise

her<00:00:33.059> hair<00:00:33.300> would<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.780> falling<00:00:34.140> off<00:00:34.290> and

like a light orange at her hair there in

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.539 
like a light orange at her hair there in
like<00:01:05.489> ringlets<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.350> it<00:01:07.350> starts<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.310> like<00:01:08.520> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
like ringlets and it starts with like a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.140 
like ringlets and it starts with like a
jet<00:01:08.909> black<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.600> then<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.900> sort<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:11.150> blends

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
jet black and then it sort of blends

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.249 
jet black and then it sort of blends
with<00:01:12.420> burgundy<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:14.630> here<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:15.900> where

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
with burgundy and then here it's where

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.950 
with burgundy and then here it's where
most<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.189> burgundy<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.790> at<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.330> then

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
most of the burgundy is at and then

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.350 
most of the burgundy is at and then
towards<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> end<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.159> roots<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.670> her<00:01:20.820> hair<00:01:20.880> it

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
towards the end the roots of her hair it

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.969 
towards the end the roots of her hair it
turns<00:01:22.369> black<00:01:23.369> again<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.990> that's<00:01:25.350> what<00:01:25.799> she

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
turns black again so that's what she

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.320 
turns black again so that's what she
looks<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.640> think<00:01:26.729> she<00:01:27.000> came<00:01:27.119> out

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
looks like and I think she came out

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.700 
looks like and I think she came out
really<00:01:27.479> nice<00:01:27.750> my<00:01:28.650> opinion<00:01:30.020> it's<00:01:31.020> not<00:01:31.409> an

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
really nice my opinion it's not an

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.030 
really nice my opinion it's not an
overwhelming<00:01:32.670> red<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.259> very<00:01:34.500> subtle

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
overwhelming red it's a very subtle

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.179 
overwhelming red it's a very subtle
shade<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.210> red<00:01:37.640> it's<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> dark<00:01:39.990> color<00:01:40.650> so

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
shade of red it's a like a dark color so

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.590 
shade of red it's a like a dark color so
it<00:01:41.460> didn't<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.720> too<00:01:42.990> much<00:01:43.170> contrast<00:01:44.600> between

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
it didn't do too much contrast between

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.340 
it didn't do too much contrast between
the<00:01:45.960> black

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
the black

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.510 
the black
and<00:01:49.450> so<00:01:50.450> that's<00:01:50.689> what<00:01:51.009> she<00:01:52.009> looks<00:01:52.189> like<00:01:52.250> now

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
and so that's what she looks like now

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.450 
and so that's what she looks like now
and<00:01:52.850> alongside<00:01:53.180> of<00:01:53.720> her<00:01:53.930> is<00:01:54.200> my<00:01:54.830> other<00:01:55.159> doll
