hey kids it's me PDR

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.260
and YouTube...

00:00:09.187 --> 00:00:11.187
and Mr. Youtube

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:16.601
a bunch of people have asked me why i made my previous video

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:21.393
so today me and Mr. Youtube are gonna explain what it was

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.100
but before that have you noticed that the channel design has changed?

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.449
at the moment you have a choice of changing to the new layout

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:40.209
but eventually you're gonna force us to use this right?

00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:44.227
errr.....not....um...maybe not

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.130
no matter how many people say the new design/layout (at the 
 time )is shit you always change the design anyway

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:58.096
The King doesn't have time to listen to everything the peasants have to say!!!

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.280
whatever!!! anyways

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.979
if you're subscribed to a channel this is what you see

00:01:06.338 --> 00:01:09.338
if you're not this is what you see. as you 
 can see there is space for one video

00:01:10.878 --> 00:01:13.878
so Mr. YouTube told me to make a trailer of my channel to 
 put here (i'm still not changing to that shitty design though)

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:16.106
hence the video i posted a few days ago

00:01:19.572 --> 00:01:23.572
so now that i listened to your shitty demand you're gonna make a 
 set for me at the youtube waste of space tokyo right?

00:01:25.703 --> 00:01:27.703
....errrr....maybe...

00:01:31.138 --> 00:01:33.138
you're never gonna build me a set are you?

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.130
not in a million years!!!

00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:45.220
Please give me a thumbs up if you enjoyed the video(^-^)b
