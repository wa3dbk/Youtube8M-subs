00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 carrot if it seems that little 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:53.579
 fluid before you can add 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.619
 Naturally tomato juice with some water I 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.390

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.500

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.270

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.100
 lukewarm so much that is pepper 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.930
 smooth tone quickly heats up now 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.640
 will start to boil and I will 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.340
 and make meatballs 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.550
 so the liquid is well boiled yes good 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.890

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.500
 small and not very small well only 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.390
 how to look from the beginning you can 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.640
 find the meatballs fry but I have 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.280
 quite fat meat is pork 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.200
 and I don't want to fry you can 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.860
 fry and then later pour 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.709
 and juice or gravy than I want you 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.470

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.340
 a fat dish and what are these croquettes of what 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.340
 lay out 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.170
 naturally should boil well in 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.970
 pan that you pour 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:58.590
 I am pure water or water with tomato juice 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.590
 the gravy that I used today 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.280

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.739

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:15.130

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.470
