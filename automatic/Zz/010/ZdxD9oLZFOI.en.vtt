00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
it's going to be the building that when

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.440 
it's going to be the building that when
you<00:00:46.739> level<00:00:47.070> up<00:00:47.160> you're<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.789> unlock<00:00:48.120> more

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
them to buy other resources so we're

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.710 
them to buy other resources so we're
going<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.850> jump<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.240> here<00:01:42.390> we're<00:01:42.540> going<00:01:42.630> to

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
going to jump in here we're going to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.179 
going to jump in here we're going to
scout<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.229> space<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.770> that's<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.009> good

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
scout this space and that's a good

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.770 
scout this space and that's a good
practice<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.670> get<00:01:44.880> into<00:01:45.119> guys<00:01:45.329> make<00:01:45.600> sure<00:01:45.750> you

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
practice to get into guys make sure you

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.569 
practice to get into guys make sure you
scout<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> bases<00:01:46.710> before<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.100> attack<00:01:47.369> them

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
scout the bases before you attack them

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.219 
scout the bases before you attack them
now<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.149> reason<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.540> do<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
now the reason we do that is just to

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.660 
now the reason we do that is just to
make<00:01:49.380> sure<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:49.979> actually<00:01:50.159> take<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
make sure that you can actually take the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.249 
make sure that you can actually take the
base<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.270> type<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.630> troops<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.170> you

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
base with the type of troops that you

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.200 
base with the type of troops that you
have<00:01:52.439> because<00:01:52.680> maybe<00:01:52.890> someones<00:01:53.610> defenses<00:01:54.090> are

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
have because maybe someones defenses are

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.580 
have because maybe someones defenses are
just<00:01:54.390> too<00:01:54.509> good<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.930> your<00:01:54.990> troops<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.409> take

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
just too good for your troops to take

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.770 
just too good for your troops to take
right<00:01:56.100> now<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.210> might<00:01:57.360> want<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.540> take<00:01:57.719> a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
right now so you might want to take a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.330 
right now so you might want to take a
look<00:01:58.049> before<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.469> jump<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:58.979> waste<00:01:59.130> your

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
look before you jump in and waste your

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.190 
look before you jump in and waste your
troops<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.329> jump<00:02:00.479> right<00:02:00.600> into<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.899> battle

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
troops so we jump right into the battle

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.109 
troops so we jump right into the battle
we<00:02:01.320> shoot<00:02:01.500> some<00:02:01.680> missiles<00:02:02.040> will<00:02:02.579> lay<00:02:02.759> down<00:02:02.790> our

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
soldiers and this is just going to be a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.530

this<00:02:06.750> base<00:02:07.020> out<00:02:07.259> real<00:02:07.560> quick<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.940> a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
this base out real quick it's just a

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.430 
this base out real quick it's just a
computer<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.569> we're<00:02:09.840> battling<00:02:10.140> right<00:02:10.289> now

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
computer that we're battling right now

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.190 
computer that we're battling right now
this<00:02:10.679> isn't<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:11.009> real<00:02:11.160> person

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
this isn't a real person

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.589 
this isn't a real person

alright<00:04:21.780> so<00:04:22.560> that<00:04:22.620> was<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:23.009> PvP<00:04:23.550> battle<00:04:23.879> like<00:04:24.000> I

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
alright so that was a PvP battle like I

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.339 
alright so that was a PvP battle like I
said<00:04:24.330> guys<00:04:24.539> and<00:04:25.250> basically<00:04:26.720> when<00:04:27.720> we<00:04:27.810> do<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:27.930> PvP

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
said guys and basically when we do a PvP

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.200 
said guys and basically when we do a PvP
battle<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:28.800> get<00:04:28.979> to<00:04:29.220> metals<00:04:29.610> instead<00:04:29.909> of<00:04:30.000> one

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
battle you get to metals instead of one

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.610 
battle you get to metals instead of one
so<00:04:30.389> that's<00:04:30.569> a<00:04:30.659> little<00:04:30.750> bit<00:04:30.870> more<00:04:31.080> incentive

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
so that's a little bit more incentive
