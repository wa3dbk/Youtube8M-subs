looks ready when it puts on the card is
handmade<00:03:23.769> and<00:03:24.609> that's<00:03:24.790> why<00:03:24.940> supercar<00:03:25.450> is

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
handmade and that's why supercar is

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.149 
handmade and that's why supercar is
quite<00:03:25.690> expensive<00:03:26.049> it's<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.500> lot<00:03:26.620> of<00:03:26.769> work<00:03:26.890> to

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
of Indian testing something that really

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.610 
of Indian testing something that really
really<00:03:56.919> is<00:03:57.989> important<00:03:58.989> for<00:03:59.109> a<00:03:59.169> rallycross<00:03:59.470> car

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.910 

and<00:04:08.910> almost<00:04:09.180> go<00:04:09.360> as<00:04:09.510> fast<00:04:09.660> as<00:04:09.960> on<00:04:10.110> on<00:04:10.410> gravel

and almost go as fast as on on gravel
and<00:04:11.100> tarmac<00:04:17.060> now<00:04:18.060> you've<00:04:18.209> seen<00:04:18.359> everything

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
and tarmac now you've seen everything

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.370 
and tarmac now you've seen everything
although<00:04:19.019> women<00:04:19.440> say<00:04:19.590> in<00:04:20.239> India<00:04:21.239> we<00:04:22.140> have

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
although women say in India we have

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.190 
although women say in India we have
basically<00:04:23.280> used<00:04:24.030> every<00:04:24.510> single<00:04:24.960> square

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
basically used every single square

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.290 
basically used every single square
metres<00:04:25.710> squeeze<00:04:26.280> everything<00:04:26.580> in<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.150> it

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
metres squeeze everything in and it

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.760 
metres squeeze everything in and it
started<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.690> get<00:04:27.870> more<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:28.080> more<00:04:28.230> tight<00:04:28.530> there

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
started to get more and more tight there

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.040 
started to get more and more tight there
but<00:04:28.950> and<00:04:29.730> so<00:04:30.060> far<00:04:30.270> when<00:04:30.450> we<00:04:30.600> stand<00:04:30.750> all<00:04:30.930> the

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
but and so far when we stand all the

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.780 
but and so far when we stand all the
cars<00:04:31.230> away<00:04:31.380> again<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:32.100> can<00:04:32.280> work<00:04:32.370> in<00:04:32.640> Europe

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
cars away again you can work in Europe

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.690 
cars away again you can work in Europe
and<00:04:33.090> America<00:04:33.600> and<00:04:33.630> then<00:04:34.560> then<00:04:34.950> it<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.580> it's

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
and America and then then it and it's
