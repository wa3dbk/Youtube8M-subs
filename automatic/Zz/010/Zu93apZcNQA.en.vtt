00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.160
 or the sounds that I am going to teach you 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:08.850
 as a place the false eyelashes 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.850
 superior and inferior 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.690
 before placing the false eyelashes 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.520
 what we are going to do we are going to add a 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.050
 little rhyme or mask our 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.270
 Natural eyelashes I've already done 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.430
 previously and was to help 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.340
 our eyelashes are better combined with 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.619
 the false eyelashes and it is also very 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.379
 important that of the inem his eye with 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.540
 Black eyeliner can make a line 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.370
 very thin thin depending on how 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.140
 you are left and this is going to help 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.690
 that the band of the tab is hidden 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.910
 and do not see the separation between 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.030
 our natural eyelashes and 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.839
 false eyelashes well we will need 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.530
 a resistol I use this that I've 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:58.799
 used a long time ago and it never fails me 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.180
 this is transparent first know the 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:03.269
 comparison of transparent what 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.600
 I recommend a lot and obviously we are going 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.940
 to need false eyelashes and use 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.250
 some tweezers is optional these are the 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.909
 points he used to get my hair out 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.909
 of the eyebrows 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.350
 The first thing we are going to do is take 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.220
 our false eyelash 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.240
 and I 'm going to study it with my tweezers 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.180
 because it's easier for me 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.080
 let's squash our boat a little 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.790
 resistol 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.630
 and we are going to place the resistol 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.630
 in the tab 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.340
 make sure to put more resistol in 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.190
 this part that is the little tip 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.170
 inside because this is the part that is 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.440
 it tends to take off more quickly and 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.690
 also at the other end let it dry 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.920
 the resistol between 30 seconds or a 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.050
 minute 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.149
 for garcía rascón it becomes sticky and 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:08.690
 the application of the lashes will be more 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.690
 easy so let's wait a minute 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.500
 I've spent a minute or something 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.020
 and also what you can do as good 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.640
 tip these from before placing the 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.220
 receiver usually with tabs 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.770
 that are new is to do it so that 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.860
 is made more retouched are plans that do not 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.890
 it is possible to apply 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.450
 And I'll try to mirror not me 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.220
 forget no, I'm not so pro as to 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.020
 do it have mirrors and I 'm going to 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.380
 do it with a mirror and somehow 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.390
 that you can see the truth this 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.040
 to apply the false eyelashes takes 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.180
 a lot of practice 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.130
 so practice a lot and I hope that 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.030
 can see the super process of how to 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.030
 with the tabs 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.530
 Viktor I explain and simply the 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.530
 they can play with their fingers 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.160
 I hope you could have seen 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.040
 how do i do it 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.790
 and remember this practical take is not 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.180
 something that 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.969
 you do it the first time you go super 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.870
 well so if you do not get the 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:47.480
 first times do not worry 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.760
 just keep planning 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.510
 ready hear me put this tab and 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.970
 Now I'm going to place the other tab in 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.640
 what was determined to dry this post 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.769
 how can they look white yet this one 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.049
 it's completely transparent 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.599
 for I have already placed the two tabs 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:09.549
 and after I Verdasco as 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:12.940
 I usually pass the black eyeliner 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:16.660
 above that hides the wiki residue of 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.430
 resistol or some imperfection 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.269
 I'm trying that you can 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.580
 watch 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.349
 emerges without anger added a laugh 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.509
 and if you are trying to make a 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:30.099
 normal makeup and do not want the 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.830
 stations want materials that their 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:35.259
 eye simply against the part 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.750
 outside tailored to your eye and 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:40.050
 place them just like I said 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.050
 previously 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.060
 to place the lower lashes the 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.240
 true if I recommend that they are the tweezers 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.130
 what makes everything much easier just 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.440
 that the upper false eyelashes 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:56.400
 let's add resistol 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.400
 Our Spain 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.800
 and to place the lower ones is not 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.660
 necessary to let it dry between 30 a 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.420
 a minute like when we put the 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.450
 higher so you can leave that 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.670
 dry with for 10 seconds and blow law and 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.370
 move it 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:26.370
 to dry faster and be more 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:30.120
 easy to place the ones that I'm going to take 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:33.950
 our lower false eyelash and the 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:36.550
 place under our eyelashes 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.550
 real 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.240
 and ready we have already placed if they want 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.520
 can add a little mask up 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.080
 your real lashes but if you do not want 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.080
 it is not necessary that they do 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.650
 and with a black eyeliner let's move 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.039
 above the tab that we have 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:14.500
 placed to hide any residue 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.500
 of resistol that we have 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.170
 the times you can use the lashes 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:23.920
 They vary a lot depending on the design of the 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:25.720
 style of the brand and everything I've had 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.270
 some lashes that lasts of our 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.130
 50 months of reuse and understood some 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.100
 that only last me 5 times because it 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:36.070
 they deform so they just use their 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.770
 false eyelashes as much as they can 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:41.950
 until they see them deformed and that they 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.840
 they see how or what is already very ugly no longer what 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.320
 I'm going to use and they also understand the 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.320
 The trash 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:52.620
 we are simply going to take our 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:55.979
 makeup for few we will place 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:58.220
 in a tool can place much much 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:58.220
 much 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.099
 so as not to damage our skin and that 

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:05.860
 find with the tab that our rocks 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:08.240
 real 12 jalen we're just going to 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:11.870
 pass it by the rival 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:14.919
 the false eyelashes until they leave 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.919
 taking off solitates 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:37.330
 your dreams is the best so as not to hurt 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.080
 our 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.080
 eye 

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:47.699
 yet I hope that the video has 

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:50.189
 been useful and that has served them well 

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:54.919
 see you and greetings to all who 

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:54.919
 They see us black to me I am a girl
