00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello kids here febre and good in 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.790
 this new video I will show a plugin 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.610
 called tnt tag is a mini game that 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.530
 it's like a pilla-pilla so we're just going to 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.500
 need the permissions at this point 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.690
 tag has join point bird has 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.590
 tits point speed and has tits point is 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.390
 touch 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.939
 if we do not want to put equal power 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.640
 because this plugin can be used without or 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.980
 with permits does not matter 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.800
 well this is the configuration and everything and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.120
 well I will teach the configuration that 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.949
 has the cnt tag is this is I here 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.949
 pick up that or 12 bullets will come out that 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.809
 you put 2 vouchers to play two 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.660
 people for like that to prove it and that 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.829
 because 12 people will be hard case 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.019
 that you have a follower with many 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.800
 people here in this permission I have 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:52.140
 put a true but here it comes out 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.089
 default false so good this from 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.010
 The same triumph does not matter, but if 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.800
 you put you will have to put the permissions 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.059
 that I already told you 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.550
 now I'm going to teach you how to set the 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.040
 sand this is a simple sand worth 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.860
 let's start by selecting the lobby 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.370
 forgive spam that is net 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.810
 tag 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.880
 setup set perfect sand entities 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.130
 selected spam now here I'm going to 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.640
 selecting the lobby here is the same 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.680
 tnt tag set 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.260
 gabe 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.590
 perfect 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.990
 and now let's create the sand tnt tag 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.540
 set up and operate 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.950
 I'm missing what the viewer can put 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.270
 spectators but if you put the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.040
 viewer I recommend that all this what 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.380
 tape and it's worth it so that people can not 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:43.490
 enter or anything still would be tnt tag 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.100
 setup set 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.890
 is 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.190
 perfect now we create the sand tnt of 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.550
 tag 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.040
 sand crater setup and we'll call it 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.140
 sand 1 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.010

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.010

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.780
 joint 16 I'm the first to enter guys 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.109
 as I said for the perfect they are 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.109
 entering 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.650
 and 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.630
 lack a strong lack strong lack 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.580
 flexo for his people 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.580
 I close if you want to enter 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.210
 has to be in one does not let me 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.850
 repeat then put this with command like 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.080
 well with that and then they can have 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.080
 details 1 vale 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.960
 is that it does not let you put it twice 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.420
 command because it's the anti hack for 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.340
 avoid spam or we do not care 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.940
 I had to put me that is a command to 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.790
 I blow something up you invent something like that and 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.470
 is little in this in this tag join but 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.440
 well it does not matter how you see we have already 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.370
 started they give us super speed and now 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.560

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.850
 remember that you have to put the 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.709

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.980
