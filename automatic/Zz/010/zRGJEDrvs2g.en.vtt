uh you know I'm always busy doing other
stuff<00:02:33.610> anyway<00:02:34.610> um<00:02:34.820> yeah<00:02:35.630> as<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:35.989> saw<00:02:36.170> there's

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
stuff anyway um yeah as you saw there's

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.040 
stuff anyway um yeah as you saw there's
nothing<00:02:36.739> much<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:37.040> that<00:02:37.160> besides<00:02:37.550> a<00:02:37.640> big<00:02:37.820> room

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
nothing much in that besides a big room

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.420 
nothing much in that besides a big room
there's<00:02:39.050> nothing<00:02:39.350> gonna<00:02:39.470> I'll<00:02:40.070> pierce<00:02:40.310> my

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
there's nothing gonna I'll pierce my

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.520 
there's nothing gonna I'll pierce my
automatic<00:02:40.850> wheat<00:02:41.000> farm<00:02:41.239> it's<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:42.050> very<00:02:42.230> simple

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
automatic wheat farm it's a very simple

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.860 
automatic wheat farm it's a very simple
design<00:02:42.799> all<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.190> do<00:02:43.340> switches<00:02:44.120> on<00:02:44.239> activates

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
design all you do switches on activates

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.259 
design all you do switches on activates
this<00:02:45.170> which<00:02:45.769> travels<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.340> repeater<00:02:46.760> they

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
this which travels to a repeater they

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.900 
this which travels to a repeater they
repaired<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.720> deactivator<00:02:48.350> pool<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:49.459> repeats

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
repaired a deactivator pool it repeats

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.830 
repaired a deactivator pool it repeats
and<00:02:50.209> deactivates<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.049> other<00:02:51.260> side<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:53.390> no

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
and deactivates the other side it no

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.670 
and deactivates the other side it no
sorry<00:02:54.230> it's<00:02:54.380> an<00:02:54.470> actually<00:02:54.799> a<00:02:54.829> redstone<00:02:55.160> torch

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
sorry it's an actually a redstone torch

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.440 
sorry it's an actually a redstone torch
inverter<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:57.920> think<00:02:58.160> it's<00:02:58.280> called<00:02:58.489> red<00:02:59.269> Sun

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
inverter I think it's called red Sun

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.090 
inverter I think it's called red Sun
torches<00:02:59.840> here<00:02:59.959> so<00:03:00.140> when<00:03:00.290> this<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.560> activated

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
torches here so when this is activated

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.970 
torches here so when this is activated
this<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:01.940> deactivated<00:03:02.209> therefore<00:03:03.140> pulling

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
this is deactivated therefore pulling

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.560 
this is deactivated therefore pulling
the<00:03:04.100> Pistons<00:03:04.519> back<00:03:04.760> there<00:03:05.060> for<00:03:05.239> loading<00:03:05.390> the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
the Pistons back there for loading the

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.270 
the Pistons back there for loading the
waterfall<00:03:05.959> down<00:03:06.079> travel<00:03:06.500> eight<00:03:06.620> blocks<00:03:06.920> and

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
waterfall down travel eight blocks and

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.699 
waterfall down travel eight blocks and
all<00:03:08.180> your<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.780> scenes<00:03:09.049> and<00:03:09.320> waiting<00:03:09.620> and

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
all your the scenes and waiting and

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.259 
all your the scenes and waiting and
breaking<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.130> for<00:03:10.310> collection<00:03:10.760> because<00:03:11.120> this

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
breaking it for collection because this

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.229 
breaking it for collection because this
is<00:03:11.450> an<00:03:11.540> automatic<00:03:11.989> weight<00:03:12.110> farm<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.790> then<00:03:14.030> you

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
is an automatic weight farm and then you

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.810 
is an automatic weight farm and then you
push<00:03:14.480> this<00:03:14.860> deactivates<00:03:15.860> this<00:03:16.100> which<00:03:16.370> travels

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
push this deactivates this which travels

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.789 
push this deactivates this which travels
to<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.120> torch<00:03:17.329> and<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.989> torturer<00:03:18.410> therefore

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
to the torch and the torturer therefore

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.580 
to the torch and the torturer therefore
inverts<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.430> signal<00:03:19.820> therefore<00:03:20.690> activating

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
inverts and signal therefore activating

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.190 
inverts and signal therefore activating
this<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:21.980> therefore<00:03:22.160> again<00:03:23.079> extending<00:03:24.079> the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
this and therefore again extending the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.930 
this and therefore again extending the
Pistons<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.280> stops<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.670> water<00:03:25.850> from

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
Pistons and that stops the water from

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.259 
Pistons and that stops the water from
falling<00:03:26.329> so<00:03:26.480> you<00:03:26.540> can<00:03:26.660> go<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.810> annalisa<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:28.269> in

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
falling so you can go to annalisa and in

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.569 
falling so you can go to annalisa and in
here's<00:03:29.660> water<00:03:29.989> blocks<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:30.560> water<00:03:31.190> blocks

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
here's water blocks and water blocks

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.819 
here's water blocks and water blocks
hydrate<00:03:32.510> for<00:03:32.870> blocks<00:03:33.170> of<00:03:33.320> water<00:03:33.500> in<00:03:33.680> each

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
hydrate for blocks of water in each

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.090 
hydrate for blocks of water in each
direction<00:03:34.040> so<00:03:34.549> one<00:03:34.820> two<00:03:35.239> three<00:03:35.269> four<00:03:35.900> then<00:03:36.829> for

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
direction so one two three four then for

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.810 
direction so one two three four then for
this<00:03:37.250> way<00:03:37.430> as<00:03:37.489> well

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
this way as well

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.420 
this way as well
so<00:03:38.780> it's<00:03:38.959> pretty<00:03:39.049> even<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.590> this<00:03:39.709> is<00:03:39.860> an<00:03:40.010> 8<00:03:40.190> by

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
so it's pretty even and this is an 8 by

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.460 
so it's pretty even and this is an 8 by
8<00:03:40.610> block<00:03:40.850> of<00:03:42.489> plantable<00:03:43.489> land

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
8 block of plantable land

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.220 
8 block of plantable land
farmable<00:03:45.250> land<00:03:45.430> whatever<00:03:45.970> it<00:03:46.120> is<00:03:46.270> you<00:03:47.110> know

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
farmable land whatever it is you know

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.470 
farmable land whatever it is you know
that's<00:03:47.440> this<00:03:48.010> is<00:03:48.070> not<00:03:48.370> my<00:03:48.520> design<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:49.120> found<00:03:49.360> out

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
that's this is not my design I found out

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.150 
that's this is not my design I found out
on<00:03:49.510> YouTube<00:03:49.900> I've<00:03:50.110> just<00:03:50.290> modified<00:03:50.710> it<00:03:50.830> a<00:03:50.860> tiny
