00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello everyone with you distrmaster today 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.580
 we look at superheroes marvel 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.200
 more precisely on the guardians of the galaxy 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.200
 escape from oblivion 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.540
 those who watched movies not to know what 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.150
 Oblivion is called the head of the dead 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.980
 Space creatures which inhabit 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.340
 all sorts of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.650
 mysterious person though in English 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.290
 the name is of course 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.000
 more interesting sounds such a pun 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.460
 but what awaits us in this set 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.640
 in the picture we can see that set by 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:44.020
 Essentially small but the main thing is that it has 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.390
 it's me nose and brutal two of the coolest guys 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:51.789
 Of course there is still a nebula yasaka 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:54.339
 knapsack and space shuttle and some 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:58.589
 a tower with a gun, well, let's hurry 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.589
 let's collect this thing and take a closer look 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.159
 the guards of the galaxy undoubtedly became a whole 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.100
 phenomenon is a great movie with 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.350
 colorful heroes and just incredible 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.750
 fun concept so 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.990
 no wonder all that concerns this 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.920
 the movie became insanely popular i'm talking 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.409
 about the film 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.299
 since before the screen version the universe was 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.450
 almost unknown to Russian fans 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:28.450
 super heroic comics and in this set 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:33.119
 there are two characters who are without question 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:36.159
 everyone liked this raccoon raccoon and groot 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.250
 it is from the beginning that the assembly begins 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.149
 its again it is a big and cool detail 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.829
 around which the whole body is going 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.950
 the design is simple but entertaining 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.670
 A good example of how to collect 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.299
 beautiful figure 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.549
 and then begin to collect a small 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.950
 construction or rather different sections of this 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.950
 constructions which eventually turns out 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.950
 quite large and functional though 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.680
 This is an amateur but a little functional 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.500
 later on 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.450
 still a little and designs she 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.220
 consists of interesting details that 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.320
 there is a considerable amount 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.930
 between the assembly of different sections of this 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.560
 designs we collect and raccoon with his 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.920
 a cannon 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.500
 enable as well as the rescue capsule 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.320
 or shuttle in which raccoons peter quil 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.920
 flew over the sphere last going 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.750
 coriander and its stationary cannon 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.830
 simple she is well stylized thing 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.000
 which by the way and in the film was shown 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.459
 there is still a comic inside 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.410
 but he is every set of the series I have him 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.480
 but if you want to see what 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.810
 there inside look at my other review 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.790
 on a series of guardians of the galaxy what is the set 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.400
 assembled and now it can be carefully 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.120
 consider we start of course with 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.100
 incredible rocket couple this little 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.070
 figurine in orange 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.470
 with cannon and sphere main detail here 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.290
 of course raccoon head at all 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.170
 incredible facial expressions she does not transmit but 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.299
 this excusable figure is funny and 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.739
 very pleased that the raccoon cannon even 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.380
 more than himself 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:16.220
 and he also has a rubber tail 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.590
 the truth is that the legs do not move but that's cool 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.230
 this is a huge team figure 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.799
 and besides his coolest body is the coolest 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.320
 this is his claws all the details with the pattern this 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.290
 prints and by the way, you can also 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.360
 something to fasten the whole body perfectly 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.570
 moves help here and small 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.660
 the hinges the very basis is very beautiful 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.760
 embossed and honestly confess that if 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.950
 the whole figure was made of these 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.910
 unusual details and i would just 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.489
 was glad 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.890
 in general, the league could stuff into a set 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.560
 just these two guys and this set 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.510
 dare to sleep from all the shop 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.430
 let's go to the canoe this little thing 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.010
 new lot of details 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.280
 Yes, and most of the stickers by the way 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.130
 inside you can put a raccoon hand 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.650
 snap sticking in front can twist 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.620
 but they do not fold or fold 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.500
 although they are so small so everything is 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.600
 order from the back there is a compartment in 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.950
 which is stored in a green can 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.989
 disgusting though to be honest i don't know what 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.330
 the nebula figure is rather rustic and and 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.000
 different from other ordinary figures 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.910
 only color and prints no 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.400
 unusual things in it is not armed she 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.210
 two katanas and in the set there is another 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.790
 spare 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.419
 There is here and Sagari they with a robe and with 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.250
 blaster but it is not important his main 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.320
 a gun 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.960
 she is simple but looks cool and 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.229
 beautifully styled for that 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.620
 appeared in the film shoots as usual 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.919
 no problem well, now consider 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.460
 construction 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:59.430
 it represents 4 segments the most 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.729
 the big one is the bunk tower in 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.729
 the basis of which is viscous slurry and above it 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.800
 mouse with ladder pulling for special 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.910
 the lever can be dropped into this slush of the one 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.970
 standing on top 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.789
 after that the whole tower can be demolished by clicking 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.500
 on the lever of another segment 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.840
 the third segment is just a track to 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.510
 the fourth which is small 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.289
 the pool with the edge of which is a mini 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.900
 catapult 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.720
 so you can shoot it first 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.570
 to any 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.820
 bags then dump another into the pool 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.150
 if he somehow miraculously hold out the 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.980
 demolish the whole structure 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.650
 pretty cool functional set 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.920
 will be interesting and film lovers and 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.690
 just for those who want unusual characters 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.850
 collection so this set I can 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.070
 he advises absolutely everyone 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.740
 really super cool though outwardly 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.140
 that you could not tell but it is just the 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.050
 the case when you should not judge by the cover 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.480
 Like you if the video seemed to you 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.280
 interesting but if you love the guards 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.420
 galaxies then don't forget to write in 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:08.490
 comments i'm gruff but i say goodbye to 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.490
 good luck to you all and bye 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.020
 but 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:52.789
 Yes 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.430
 at 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.510
 but
