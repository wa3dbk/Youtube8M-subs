00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.700

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.960 

you<00:02:10.710> can<00:02:10.860> see<00:02:11.010> that<00:02:11.130> we're<00:02:11.310> coming<00:02:11.520> into<00:02:11.760> a

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
you can see that we're coming into a

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.080 
you can see that we're coming into a
little<00:02:12.600> thickness<00:02:13.080> here<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:14.700> want<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.910> be

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
little thickness here you want to be

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:27.950 
little thickness here you want to be
more<00:02:15.300> bad<00:02:15.510> or<00:02:15.720> like<00:02:23.990> we're<00:02:24.990> getting<00:02:25.140> closer<00:02:26.960> it

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
more bad or like we're getting closer it

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.390 
more bad or like we're getting closer it
takes<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.530> little<00:02:28.800> bit<00:02:28.920> longer<00:02:29.160> when

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
takes just a little bit longer when

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.010 
takes just a little bit longer when
you're<00:02:29.490> adding<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.940> water<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.330> incrementally

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
you're adding the water in incrementally

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.140 
you're adding the water in incrementally
but<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.620> end<00:02:31.740> it'll<00:02:31.980> save<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.880> time

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
but in the end it'll save you the time

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:46.120 
but in the end it'll save you the time
of<00:02:33.330> adding<00:02:33.660> another<00:02:33.840> mirror<00:02:34.110> placement

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.880 

okay<00:02:46.880> once<00:02:47.150> we<00:02:47.300> have<00:02:47.480> kind<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:47.990> a<00:02:48.080> thick<00:02:48.380> batter

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
okay once we have kind of a thick batter

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.740 
okay once we have kind of a thick batter
here<00:02:49.370> what<00:02:49.970> I'm<00:02:50.090> going<00:02:50.240> to<00:02:50.270> do<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:50.480> go<00:02:50.630> ahead

spoons so I go back into maybe just a

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:50.910 
spoons so I go back into maybe just a
little<00:03:45.250> bit<00:03:45.519> more<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:45.849> top<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.209> off<00:03:46.329> with<00:03:49.920> when
