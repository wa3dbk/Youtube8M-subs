00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
all right welcome to my next map that

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.830 
all right welcome to my next map that
I'm<00:00:02.700> going<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:02.970> play<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.480> this<00:00:03.629> is<00:00:03.720> the

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
I'm going to play and this is the

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.509 
I'm going to play and this is the
Carson's<00:00:04.319> Jedi<00:00:04.770> versus<00:00:05.190> clone<00:00:05.899> custom<00:00:06.899> map

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519 
Carson's Jedi versus clone custom map

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.450 
Carson's Jedi versus clone custom map
this<00:00:08.519> was<00:00:08.730> also<00:00:08.940> one<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.480> very<00:00:10.460> popular

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
this was also one of the very popular

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.730 
this was also one of the very popular
maps<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.630> think<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.200> pretty<00:00:13.349> much<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
maps and I think it pretty much is the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.939 
maps and I think it pretty much is the
same<00:00:13.860> map<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.340> we<00:00:14.639> all<00:00:14.759> know<00:00:14.969> but<00:00:15.240> then<00:00:15.949> on

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
same map that we all know but then on

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.250 
same map that we all know but then on
the<00:00:17.010> Jedi<00:00:17.580> side<00:00:17.940> or<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.300> can<00:00:18.330> at<00:00:18.570> least<00:00:18.660> choose

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
the Jedi side or you can at least choose

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.810 
the Jedi side or you can at least choose
to<00:00:19.710> be<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.070> Jedi's<00:00:22.250> as<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.400> said<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.789> very

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
to be the Jedi's as I said this is very

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.480 
to be the Jedi's as I said this is very
popular<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.840> shows<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.279> people<00:00:26.279> just

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
popular so it shows that people just

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.279 
popular so it shows that people just
love<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.789> be<00:00:27.119> them<00:00:27.300> Jedi's

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:34.289 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:36.770 

yeah<00:00:34.829> pretty<00:00:35.010> much<00:00:35.250> at<00:00:35.670> first<00:00:36.030> glance<00:00:36.179> the<00:00:36.600> map

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
yeah pretty much at first glance the map

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.110 
yeah pretty much at first glance the map
is<00:00:36.989> not<00:00:37.199> it's<00:00:37.649> not<00:00:37.859> anything<00:00:38.160> special<00:00:38.519> really

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
is not it's not anything special really

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.930 
is not it's not anything special really
just<00:00:39.859> you'll<00:00:40.859> have<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> opportunity<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.789> play

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
just you'll have the opportunity to play

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.779 
just you'll have the opportunity to play
as<00:00:42.179> a<00:00:42.210> Jedi<00:00:42.539> and<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.100> think<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.370> enough<00:00:44.609> for

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
as a Jedi and I think that is enough for

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:54.920 
as a Jedi and I think that is enough for
many<00:00:45.030> people<00:00:51.949> pretty<00:00:52.949> fun<00:00:53.190> though<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.930> like

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
many people pretty fun though I like

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.349 
many people pretty fun though I like
language<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.409> as<00:00:55.530> well

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.939 

bit<00:01:00.359> disappointed<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> whole

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
bit disappointed that it's not a whole

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:02.930 
bit disappointed that it's not a whole
new<00:01:02.190> map

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
new map

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.450 
new map
even<00:01:03.239> though<00:01:03.359> well<00:01:03.629> technically<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.979> map<00:01:05.250> is

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
even though well technically this map is

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.249 
even though well technically this map is
of<00:01:05.580> course<00:01:05.820> not<00:01:06.060> available<00:01:06.509> in<00:01:06.690> the<00:01:06.960> regular

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
of course not available in the regular

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.399 
of course not available in the regular
multiplayer<00:01:07.970> only<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.390> single-player<00:01:09.840> where

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
multiplayer only in single-player where

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.430 
multiplayer only in single-player where
you<00:01:10.649> play<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.819> the<00:01:12.390> side<00:01:12.569> of<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.840> Clones

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
you play on the side of the Clones

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.990 
you play on the side of the Clones
so<00:01:18.619> it<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.740> understandable<00:01:20.310> why<00:01:20.549> someone

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
so it is understandable why someone

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.559 
so it is understandable why someone
would<00:01:21.149> mock<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.659> map<00:01:21.929> the<00:01:22.200> other<00:01:22.350> way<00:01:22.590> around

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
would mock this map the other way around

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.940 
would mock this map the other way around
I'm<00:01:24.569> here<00:01:24.810> having<00:01:24.899> fun<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.409> some<00:01:25.530> hack<00:01:25.740> and

I'm here having fun with some hack and

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.480 
I'm here having fun with some hack and

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
terms of reinforcements yet I wonder if

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.230 
terms of reinforcements yet I wonder if
you're<00:02:01.440> at<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:02.330> well<00:02:03.330> outside<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:05.240> be

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
you're at like well outside you can be

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.760 
you're at like well outside you can be
Anakin<00:02:06.869> Skywalker<00:02:07.590> as<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:08.039> hero<00:02:08.940> class<00:02:09.770> our

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
Anakin Skywalker as a hero class our

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.060 
Anakin Skywalker as a hero class our
hero<00:02:11.009> unit<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.880> like<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.240> single-player

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
hero unit just like the single-player

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:21.260 
hero unit just like the single-player
campaign<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:19.070> think<00:02:20.070> it's<00:02:20.370> definitely<00:02:20.910> fun<00:02:21.150> to

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
campaign I think it's definitely fun to

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.420 
campaign I think it's definitely fun to
see<00:02:21.450> how<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.750> works<00:02:21.989> when<00:02:22.260> like<00:02:22.470> both<00:02:22.860> parties

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
see how it works when like both parties

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.210 
see how it works when like both parties
are<00:02:23.870> real<00:02:24.870> players<00:02:25.230> instead<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.680> NPCs<00:02:28.190> still<00:02:29.190> I

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
are real players instead of NPCs still I

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.120 
are real players instead of NPCs still I
think<00:02:29.400> then<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:31.380> Jedi<00:02:31.650> would<00:02:31.950> be

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
think then that the Jedi would be

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.350 
think then that the Jedi would be
overpowered<00:02:32.700> because<00:02:32.790> they<00:02:33.030> have<00:02:33.150> those

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
overpowered because they have those

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.449 
overpowered because they have those
jumps<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:36.140> can<00:02:37.140> attack<00:02:37.410> from<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.680> distance<00:02:38.250> and

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
jumps and can attack from a distance and

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.770 
jumps and can attack from a distance and
whatnot<00:02:40.489> which<00:02:41.489> can<00:02:41.700> actually<00:02:42.150> also<00:02:42.390> be<00:02:42.480> fun

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
whatnot which can actually also be fun

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.210 
whatnot which can actually also be fun
because<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.200> means<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.470> for<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.890> clones

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
because that means that for the clones

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.360 
because that means that for the clones
like<00:02:44.970> teamwork<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.170> absolutely<00:02:46.950> essential

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
like teamwork is absolutely essential

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.100 
like teamwork is absolutely essential
because<00:02:47.790> otherwise<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.630> won't<00:02:48.810> make<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.739> work

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.240 

Oh<00:02:52.460> actually<00:02:53.460> having<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.970> bit<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.150> trouble<00:02:54.360> now
