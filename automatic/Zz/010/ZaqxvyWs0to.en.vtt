00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.940
 girls go straight to the point because there 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:13.780
 I want to talk about these eye shadows here 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:17.380
 essence which are the new eye shadows of 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.790
 line to the rowan these, however, of 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.740
 speak because I fell in love with it 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.930
 girls I bought the first of 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.890
 these eye shadows and precisely the number 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.100
 4 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:31.990
 I really have this wonderful color 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.819
 bought it almost two months ago and from 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.890
 then I almost always use it 

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:40.210
 become one of my eyeshadows 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:43.569
 later favorite recently I have 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.219
 wanted to take two more because why 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:46.629
 not having used this really 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.659
 I find that they are eye shadows 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:53.859
 very pale cost 3 euros and 49 if well 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:56.289
 remember and for the price they have the 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.629
 their validity is very high so there is a 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:02.469
 high quality price ratio 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.269
 I baby month singing advice is 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.619
 precisely in love as seen on 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.439
 title of this video I am 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.789
 in love lately when there is video 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:13.420
 you all tell me I have tricks 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:15.969
 beautiful that I still have 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.500
 beautiful or elegant of all shades 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:19.119
 etcetera etc. reality that so far 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.909
 he had only used this here 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.979
 as a basis he then consumed the fold 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.430
 then in the fold with a color 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.429
 brownish however changed the color 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.649
 here in the final part of the eye to no 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.259
 change the color and then we put one 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.600
 simply eyeliner line this 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:42.009
 the trick I did was the number 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.090
 4 illuminating plan or bloom which is this 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.130
 what amazing that I do n't know 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.259
 they would describe it really beautiful 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.859
 a sort of iridescent dove though 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:54.840
 really beautiful a guy who sometimes 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.840
 looks like silver sometimes takes j 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.210
 if really different then really 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.130
 wonderful and what I recommend in 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.020
 absolute and then wanted to take now 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.230
 two others of this line that is the number 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.380
 1 and the number 2 and precisely the number 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.110
 1 illuminating ping and apple in apple in 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.600
 apple and the number 2 illuminating one 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.910
 sberla that are this yellowish color 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.890
 golden however not always for i 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.700
 celebrations that I saw describe 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.230
 girls 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.080
 and then this run here that what 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.530
 I 'm wearing this morning for example 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.450
 it's really beautiful I always said 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.230
 that I don't like shimmer things 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:40.270
 too much light on the eyes too much surfaces 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.520
 what certain is so though these have a 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.550
 that different I do n't know different are gods 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.790
 they are however full of inter but not 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.100
 they are disturbing heavy glitter 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.320
 see girls I approached he tries to 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.780
 bring the camera closer I hope to 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.310
 to be in focus however you see year give a 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.330
 very gentle effect on the eye e 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.450
 this is what struck me more than 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.760
 all the estate is really extreme 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.860
 I wrote it on facebook and it 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.570
 I repeat here I did a make up at 7 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.370
 in the morning because we have one anyway 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.440
 long day ahead so I did 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.930
 a backup at 7 am in the evening 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.690
 at half past nine 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.910
 in short, when at the moment of removing make-up 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.769
 I had everything perfectly on the eye there 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.410
 where we put it can be 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.420
 also used as a base and 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.490
 I really feel like recommending them well 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.170
 I wanted to talk because so many between then 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.300
 they asked me lately that 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.560
 I had eyeshadow on my eyes and so I have 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.600
 thought to make you that right for 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:46.540
 talk about it now I'll try to revise it 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:54.580
 more closely this is this one 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:58.860
 this color super super nice here is 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:10.510
 wonderful girls this here then girls 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:15.970
 the number one this is beautiful here 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:17.590
 this I do I will be rejected as 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.239
 these are amazing girls 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.700
 parties in my opinion 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:28.950
 look at this here then girls the 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:34.570
 number two 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:37.660
 this you see guys are really beautiful 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.610
 the thing that you then like further and 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.000
 which can also be put to an end 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.550
 of makeup just like light point for 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.840
 example doing for matt make-up let's go 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:53.590
 then go a touch of glamorous touch a 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.810
 touch chic add an extra touch 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.070
 always a pinch of forced then a 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.080
 point of this eye shadow all 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.480
 in the middle of the eye then from a 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.210
 something more to makeup without let's say 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.300
 the special effects too busted up here 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.430
 girls so everything here I show you 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.220
 maybe you see it from here as much as I am 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.440
 beautiful these these in short I hope that 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.060
 this video has been useful, however 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.670
 but also to have framed the products 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.800
 more closely in the right way 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.330
 I hope so much in doubt with where 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.000
 I will end the filming done in 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.490
 more precise way here so that 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.230
 you could have said this then 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.770
 I'll send you a kiss I'll see you at 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.700
