00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.170 

it's<00:01:28.830> all<00:01:28.980> custom<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.670> don't<00:01:29.910> think<00:01:30.030> there's

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
it's all custom I don't think there's

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.510 
it's all custom I don't think there's
anywhere<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.870> world<00:01:31.080> I'm<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.070> gonna<00:01:32.250> go

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
anywhere in the world I'm just gonna go

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.790 
anywhere in the world I'm just gonna go
off<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.730> that<00:01:33.120> except<00:01:33.630> for<00:01:33.810> BC<00:01:34.200> or<00:01:34.440> they<00:01:34.590> take

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
off on that except for BC or they take

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.760 
off on that except for BC or they take
an<00:01:34.950> excavator<00:01:35.570> rip<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.720> right<00:01:36.870> apart<00:01:37.020> rebuild

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
an excavator rip it right apart rebuild

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.160 
an excavator rip it right apart rebuild
it<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.600> tough<00:01:39.600> enough<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.050> withstand

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
it so it's tough enough to withstand

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
it so it's tough enough to withstand
what<00:01:40.680> goes<00:01:40.830> on<00:01:41.040> around<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:43.010> these<00:01:44.010> are

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
what goes on around here these are

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.730 
what goes on around here these are
really<00:01:44.700> strong<00:01:45.030> cabs<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:46.380> basically<00:01:48.740> workers

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
really strong cabs and basically workers

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.060 
really strong cabs and basically workers
compensation<00:01:50.550> approved<00:01:51.980> instead<00:01:52.980> of

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
compensation approved instead of

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.700 
compensation approved instead of
building<00:01:53.400> guarding<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:53.970> them<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
building guarding on them so the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.440 
building guarding on them so the
half-inch<00:01:59.100> class<00:01:59.400> has<00:01:59.700> such<00:01:59.910> a<00:01:59.940> strength

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
half-inch class has such a strength

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.960 
half-inch class has such a strength
factor<00:02:00.690> that<00:02:01.140> that's<00:02:01.430> counts<00:02:02.430> as<00:02:02.550> guarding

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
factor that that's counts as guarding

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.780 
factor that that's counts as guarding
and<00:02:03.150> then<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.450> metal<00:02:03.960> bars<00:02:04.170> behind<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.790> also

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
and then the metal bars behind it also

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:22.710

I'm<00:02:23.350> gonna<00:02:23.530> say<00:02:24.070> I<00:02:24.400> don't<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.750> meter<00:02:26.020> says<00:02:26.320> 45

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
I'm gonna say I don't the meter says 45
