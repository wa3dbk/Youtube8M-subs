the cancer had already spread by the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.440 
the cancer had already spread by the
time<00:02:51.660> he<00:02:51.780> saw<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.739> far<00:02:52.769> from<00:02:53.100> eating<00:02:53.340> people<00:02:53.670> he

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
time he saw so far from eating people he

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.789 
time he saw so far from eating people he
saw<00:02:54.660> these<00:02:54.870> healers<00:02:55.109> actually<00:02:55.590> killing

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
saw these healers actually killing

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.039 
saw these healers actually killing
people<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:57.150> as<00:02:57.329> a<00:02:57.390> Christian<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.750> worried

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
people and as a Christian that worried

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.960 
people and as a Christian that worried
me<00:02:58.200> enormously<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.859> thought<00:02:59.130> well<00:02:59.400> if<00:02:59.790> that's

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
me enormously I thought well if that's

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.759 
me enormously I thought well if that's
happening<00:03:00.480> then<00:03:00.630> this<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:00.930> very<00:03:01.140> serious

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
happening then this is very serious

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.009 
happening then this is very serious
and<00:03:01.859> we've<00:03:02.190> got<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.820> monitor<00:03:03.329> this<00:03:03.600> carefully

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
and we've got to monitor this carefully

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.050 
and we've got to monitor this carefully
and<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:04.320> my<00:03:04.739> has<00:03:04.890> always<00:03:05.160> picked<00:03:05.519> up<00:03:05.700> since

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
and so my has always picked up since

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.140 
and so my has always picked up since
when<00:03:06.930> stories<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.620> miraculous<00:03:08.519> healing<00:03:08.910> have

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
when stories of miraculous healing have

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.330 
when stories of miraculous healing have
been<00:03:09.630> floated<00:03:10.049> around<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.769> ask<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.190> next

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
been floated around to ask the next

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.490 
been floated around to ask the next
question<00:03:11.459> what's<00:03:12.329> actually<00:03:12.570> going<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:13.049> here

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
question what's actually going on here

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.710 
question what's actually going on here
has<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.489> person<00:03:14.640> been<00:03:14.819> healed<00:03:15.180> what<00:03:15.510> do<00:03:15.600> they

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
has the person been healed what do they

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.849 
has the person been healed what do they
do<00:03:16.019> they<00:03:16.109> really<00:03:16.290> have<00:03:16.440> what<00:03:16.560> they<00:03:16.650> claim<00:03:16.829> to

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
do they really have what they claim to

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:22.370 
do they really have what they claim to
have<00:03:17.180> so<00:03:18.180> it's<00:03:18.299> gone<00:03:18.480> on<00:03:18.630> since<00:03:18.900> then<00:03:20.840> well<00:03:21.840> the

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
have so it's gone on since then well the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.740 
have so it's gone on since then well the
the<00:03:22.620> reason<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.250> these<00:03:23.519> states<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.269> altered

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
the reason that these states of altered

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.870 
the reason that these states of altered
consciousness<00:03:25.500> are<00:03:25.650> dangerous<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.819> because

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
consciousness are dangerous is because

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.140 
consciousness are dangerous is because
in<00:03:27.750> my<00:03:28.530> opinion<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.370> opens<00:03:29.819> you<00:03:29.940> up<00:03:30.120> to

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
in my opinion it opens you up to

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.059 
in my opinion it opens you up to
seducing<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:30.989> familiar<00:03:31.380> spirits<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:33.180> the

seducing and familiar spirits the the

came<00:04:05.160> from<00:04:05.520> that<00:04:06.000> experiences<00:04:06.870> are<00:04:06.990> that

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
came from that experiences are that

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.220 
came from that experiences are that
alleged<00:04:07.680> anointing<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:09.510> they<00:04:09.660> end<00:04:09.840> up<00:04:10.020> in

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
alleged anointing and and they end up in

alleged anointing and and they end up in
in<00:04:10.860> terrible<00:04:11.570> psychological<00:04:12.570> conditions<00:04:13.050> and

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
in terrible psychological conditions and

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.670 
in terrible psychological conditions and
that's<00:04:14.400> what's<00:04:14.730> so<00:04:14.910> sad<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.600> many<00:04:16.260> people

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
that's what's so sad and many people

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.000 
that's what's so sad and many people
then<00:04:16.860> become<00:04:17.040> totally<00:04:17.820> turned<00:04:18.090> off<00:04:18.270> of<00:04:18.540> God

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
then become totally turned off of God

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.520 
then become totally turned off of God
because<00:04:20.010> they<00:04:20.520> believe<00:04:20.940> that<00:04:21.170> somehow<00:04:22.170> if

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
because they believe that somehow if

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.060 
because they believe that somehow if
they<00:04:22.680> can't<00:04:22.980> sustain<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.820> strong<00:04:24.180> feeling

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
they can't sustain that strong feeling

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.740 
they can't sustain that strong feeling
there<00:04:26.070> then<00:04:26.550> there<00:04:26.910> must<00:04:27.120> be<00:04:27.270> something<00:04:27.720> wrong

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
there then there must be something wrong

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.320 
there then there must be something wrong
with<00:04:28.230> them<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:28.890> so<00:04:29.430> they<00:04:29.610> keep<00:04:29.820> going<00:04:30.150> back

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330
