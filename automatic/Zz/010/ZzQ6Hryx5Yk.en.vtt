you using a shelter a wall spear fighter
I<00:00:29.170> use<00:00:29.590> this<00:00:29.770> technique<00:00:30.160> for<00:00:30.220> all<00:00:30.759> the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
I use this technique for all the

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.180 
I use this technique for all the
sheltering<00:00:31.540> models<00:00:31.930> in<00:00:32.080> the<00:00:32.140> rulebook<00:00:32.320> pretty

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
sheltering models in the rulebook pretty

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.130 
sheltering models in the rulebook pretty
much<00:00:33.400> it's<00:00:34.030> actually<00:00:34.180> a<00:00:34.390> very<00:00:34.540> easy<00:00:34.809> technique

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
much it's actually a very easy technique

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.020 
much it's actually a very easy technique
to<00:00:35.350> do<00:00:35.620> once<00:00:35.890> you<00:00:36.040> know<00:00:36.160> how<00:00:36.370> and<00:00:36.699> I'll<00:00:36.850> talk

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
to do once you know how and I'll talk

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.780 
to do once you know how and I'll talk
you<00:00:37.059> through<00:00:37.300> it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
you through it

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.299 
okay I'm going to show you another
technique<00:00:41.650> here

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
technique here

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.580 
technique here
this<00:00:42.730> technique<00:00:43.090> is<00:00:43.540> one<00:00:43.750> that<00:00:43.930> I<00:00:44.019> have<00:00:44.199> I

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
this technique is one that I have I

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.770 
this technique is one that I have I
basically<00:00:44.980> developed<00:00:45.370> to<00:00:45.640> paint<00:00:46.239> the<00:00:46.390> shelter

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
basically developed to paint the shelter

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.479 
basically developed to paint the shelter
II<00:00:46.809> specifically<00:00:47.530> but<00:00:47.830> you<00:00:47.890> could<00:00:48.129> use<00:00:48.309> it<00:00:48.340> for

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
II specifically but you could use it for

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.259 
II specifically but you could use it for
any<00:00:48.760> army<00:00:49.090> or<00:00:49.440> certain<00:00:50.440> parts<00:00:50.830> of<00:00:50.949> the<00:00:51.040> model

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
any army or certain parts of the model

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.880 
any army or certain parts of the model
um<00:00:52.269> I'm<00:00:52.720> not<00:00:52.930> even<00:00:52.989> sure<00:00:53.290> if<00:00:53.409> this<00:00:53.559> technique

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
um I'm not even sure if this technique

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.590 
um I'm not even sure if this technique
has<00:00:54.040> a<00:00:54.100> name<00:00:54.339> I'm<00:00:54.850> going<00:00:55.030> to<00:00:55.120> call<00:00:55.239> it<00:00:55.420> ink

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
has a name I'm going to call it ink

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.439 
has a name I'm going to call it ink
toning<00:00:56.049> for<00:00:56.500> now<00:00:56.650> so<00:00:57.640> basically<00:00:58.030> you're<00:00:58.360> gonna

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
toning for now so basically you're gonna

00:00:58.449 --> 00:00:59.910 
toning for now so basically you're gonna
lay<00:00:58.690> down<00:00:58.720> a<00:00:58.900> base<00:00:59.170> coat<00:00:59.440> which<00:00:59.769> is<00:00:59.799> a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
lay down a base coat which is a

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.799 
lay down a base coat which is a
completely<00:01:00.400> different<00:01:00.580> color<00:01:00.909> almost<00:01:01.330> to

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
completely different color almost to

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.479 
completely different color almost to
what<00:01:02.019> you're<00:01:02.140> going<00:01:02.229> to<00:01:02.290> end<00:01:02.470> up<00:01:02.559> with<00:01:02.769> the

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
what you're going to end up with the

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.030 
what you're going to end up with the
actual<00:01:03.820> final<00:01:04.059> color<00:01:04.420> will<00:01:04.659> be<00:01:04.809> given<00:01:05.500> by<00:01:05.619> inks

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
actual final color will be given by inks

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.160 
actual final color will be given by inks
rather<00:01:06.580> than<00:01:06.820> by<00:01:06.970> a<00:01:07.000> base<00:01:07.240> coat<00:01:07.479> with<00:01:07.750> acrylics

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
rather than by a base coat with acrylics

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.469 
rather than by a base coat with acrylics
as<00:01:08.320> you'd<00:01:08.440> normally<00:01:08.590> achieve<00:01:09.100> so<00:01:10.060> here<00:01:10.330> we're

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
as you'd normally achieve so here we're

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.930 
as you'd normally achieve so here we're
going<00:01:10.510> to<00:01:10.659> go<00:01:10.810> for<00:01:11.020> a<00:01:11.049> nice<00:01:11.229> deep<00:01:11.530> red<00:01:11.830> but<00:01:12.760> to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
going to go for a nice deep red but to

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.070 
going to go for a nice deep red but to
achieve<00:01:13.030> that<00:01:13.360> we're<00:01:13.510> gonna<00:01:13.600> start<00:01:13.930> off<00:01:14.049> with

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
achieve that we're gonna start off with

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.899 
achieve that we're gonna start off with
bright<00:01:14.470> yellow<00:01:14.500> that<00:01:15.430> we're<00:01:15.520> going<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.670> start

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
bright yellow that we're going to start

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.260 
bright yellow that we're going to start
off<00:01:16.000> with<00:01:16.030> Vallejo<00:01:16.840> model<00:01:16.869> air<00:01:17.229> gold<00:01:17.830> yellow

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
off with Vallejo model air gold yellow

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.399 
off with Vallejo model air gold yellow
with<00:01:19.270> an<00:01:19.360> airbrush<00:01:19.600> but<00:01:19.930> you<00:01:20.110> could<00:01:20.290> also

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
with an airbrush but you could also

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.650 
with an airbrush but you could also
paint<00:01:20.830> this<00:01:21.010> by<00:01:21.220> hand<00:01:21.430> with<00:01:21.700> a<00:01:21.729> brush<00:01:22.150> but<00:01:22.510> it's

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
paint this by hand with a brush but it's

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.600 
paint this by hand with a brush but it's
just<00:01:22.750> quicker<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.110> do<00:01:23.260> it<00:01:23.320> for<00:01:23.440> now<00:01:23.530> brush<00:01:23.740> so

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
just quicker to do it for now brush so

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.220 
just quicker to do it for now brush so
here<00:01:24.790> we've<00:01:24.970> got<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.420> resin<00:01:25.750> model<00:01:25.990> and<00:01:26.110> it's

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
here we've got a resin model and it's

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.790 
here we've got a resin model and it's
been<00:01:26.440> base<00:01:26.800> coated<00:01:27.220> with<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.990> tamia<00:01:29.500> fine

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
brushes do work particularly well with

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.580 
brushes do work particularly well with
yellows<00:02:05.760> because<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.600> dries<00:02:06.900> instantly<00:02:07.140> when

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590

it goes on almost with an airbrush which

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.720 
it goes on almost with an airbrush which
is<00:02:10.590> good<00:02:10.800> because<00:02:10.890> yellows<00:02:11.280> often<00:02:11.610> have

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
is good because yellows often have

yellow<00:03:21.420> will<00:03:21.600> shine<00:03:21.810> through<00:03:21.840> very<00:03:22.320> strongly

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
particularly good but as I say we'll be

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.699 
particularly good but as I say we'll be
putting<00:03:27.720> on<00:03:27.840> two<00:03:28.080> more<00:03:28.260> coats

first layer dry so now it's time to
throw<00:03:58.580> on<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.880> second<00:03:59.530> exactly<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.620> same

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
throw on the second exactly the same

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.910 
throw on the second exactly the same
deal<00:04:00.980> as<00:04:01.010> before<00:04:01.130> just<00:04:02.120> Chuck<00:04:02.390> on<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.690> ink<00:04:02.920> see

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
deal as before just Chuck on the ink see

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.730 
deal as before just Chuck on the ink see
this<00:04:04.070> time<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:04.490> will<00:04:04.550> come<00:04:04.730> out<00:04:04.820> darker<00:04:05.740> really

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
this time it will come out darker really

put<00:04:06.920> on<00:04:07.070> loads<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:07.790> loads<00:04:07.820> of<00:04:08.090> ink<00:04:08.270> for<00:04:08.480> this

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
put on loads and loads of ink for this

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.380 
put on loads and loads of ink for this
technique<00:04:08.930> don't<00:04:09.790> skimp<00:04:10.790> because<00:04:11.060> when

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
technique don't skimp because when

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.180 
technique don't skimp because when
acrylic<00:04:11.750> inks<00:04:12.020> dry<00:04:12.080> this<00:04:12.560> there's<00:04:12.890> not<00:04:12.980> much

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
acrylic inks dry this there's not much

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.060 
acrylic inks dry this there's not much
pigment<00:04:13.490> in<00:04:13.850> them<00:04:14.080> so<00:04:15.080> when<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.620> carrying

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
pigment in them so when the carrying

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.370 
pigment in them so when the carrying
liquid<00:04:16.820> basically<00:04:17.630> evaporates<00:04:18.109> away<00:04:18.320> you

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
liquid basically evaporates away you

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.720 
liquid basically evaporates away you
just<00:04:18.620> end<00:04:18.829> up<00:04:18.890> with<00:04:18.950> a<00:04:19.070> small<00:04:19.370> amount<00:04:19.579> of

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
just end up with a small amount of

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.699 
just end up with a small amount of
pigment<00:04:19.880> on<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.269> model<00:04:20.540> so<00:04:20.780> there's<00:04:21.560> no

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
pigment on the model so there's no

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.310 
pigment on the model so there's no
problem<00:04:22.100> with<00:04:22.160> losing<00:04:22.940> detail<00:04:23.090> by<00:04:23.570> putting<00:04:24.230> on

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
problem with losing detail by putting on

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.770 
problem with losing detail by putting on
too<00:04:24.530> much<00:04:24.680> ink<00:04:24.980> like<00:04:25.760> there<00:04:25.940> is<00:04:26.060> with<00:04:26.210> ordinary

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
too much ink like there is with ordinary

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.590 
too much ink like there is with ordinary
paints<00:04:27.400> this<00:04:28.400> strength<00:04:28.970> of<00:04:29.120> this<00:04:29.210> effect

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
paints this strength of this effect

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.980 
paints this strength of this effect
really<00:04:29.840> is<00:04:30.200> that<00:04:31.130> it<00:04:31.340> essentially<00:04:31.760> does<00:04:32.090> most

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
really is that it essentially does most

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.260 
really is that it essentially does most
of<00:04:33.169> your<00:04:33.320> highlighting<00:04:33.950> work<00:04:34.130> for<00:04:34.460> you<00:04:34.669> so

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
of your highlighting work for you so

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.840 
of your highlighting work for you so
this<00:04:36.230> easy<00:04:36.500> to<00:04:36.830> just<00:04:37.010> track<00:04:37.220> on<00:04:37.400> inks<00:04:37.669> with<00:04:37.820> a

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
this easy to just track on inks with a

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.120 
this easy to just track on inks with a
nice<00:04:38.000> big<00:04:38.270> brush<00:04:38.480> and<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:39.470> get<00:04:39.680> a<00:04:39.710> really<00:04:39.890> good

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
nice big brush and you get a really good

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.580 
nice big brush and you get a really good
toned<00:04:40.910> effect<00:04:41.300> don't<00:04:42.050> only<00:04:42.200> work<00:04:42.380> with

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
toned effect don't only work with

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.690 
toned effect don't only work with
certain<00:04:42.890> colors<00:04:43.040> it's<00:04:43.310> particularly

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
certain colors it's particularly

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.310 
certain colors it's particularly
effective<00:04:44.210> with<00:04:44.450> bright<00:04:44.750> colors<00:04:45.110> which<00:04:45.290> is

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
effective with bright colors which is

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.990 
effective with bright colors which is
why<00:04:45.560> it<00:04:45.620> works<00:04:45.830> so<00:04:46.160> well<00:04:46.340> on<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.580> Scheldt<00:04:46.790> re

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
why it works so well on the Scheldt re

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.780 
why it works so well on the Scheldt re
but<00:04:47.330> it<00:04:48.110> can<00:04:48.260> work<00:04:48.410> on<00:04:48.560> any<00:04:48.620> race<00:04:48.979> and<00:04:49.280> any

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
but it can work on any race and any

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.969 
but it can work on any race and any
model<00:04:50.150> you<00:04:50.600> just<00:04:50.660> obviously<00:04:51.200> experiment<00:04:51.830> and

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
model you just obviously experiment and

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.550 
model you just obviously experiment and
see<00:04:52.280> what<00:04:52.310> works<00:04:52.490> for<00:04:52.820> you<00:04:52.940> so<00:04:53.470> there<00:04:54.470> we<00:04:54.530> go

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
see what works for you so there we go

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.310 
see what works for you so there we go
that's<00:04:54.890> the<00:04:54.950> second<00:04:55.340> coat<00:04:55.900> so<00:04:56.900> I'll<00:04:57.080> be<00:04:57.200> back

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
that's the second coat so I'll be back

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.050 
that's the second coat so I'll be back
in<00:04:57.380> a<00:04:57.500> minute<00:04:57.590> when<00:04:57.800> this<00:04:57.979> one's<00:04:58.190> dry<00:05:00.490> okay<00:05:01.490> so

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
in a minute when this one's dry okay so

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.090 
in a minute when this one's dry okay so
that's<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.450> second<00:05:02.720> coat<00:05:02.900> dry<00:05:03.140> so<00:05:03.590> same<00:05:04.070> as

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
that's the second coat dry so same as

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.670 
that's the second coat dry so same as
before<00:05:04.220> just<00:05:04.729> throw<00:05:05.180> it<00:05:05.270> on<00:05:05.419> with<00:05:05.570> this<00:05:06.410> coat

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
before just throw it on with this coat

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.100 
before just throw it on with this coat
the<00:05:07.310> third<00:05:07.520> coat<00:05:07.790> is<00:05:08.120> better<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:08.510> be<00:05:08.660> slightly

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
the third coat is better to be slightly

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.490 
the third coat is better to be slightly
lighter<00:05:09.800> on<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.310> amount<00:05:10.760> you<00:05:10.850> apply<00:05:11.290> the<00:05:12.290> main

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
lighter on the amount you apply the main

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
purpose here is to take some of this

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.740 
purpose here is to take some of this
sake<00:05:14.900> a<00:05:14.930> bit<00:05:15.169> more<00:05:15.350> of<00:05:15.440> a<00:05:15.530> yellow<00:05:15.800> tone<00:05:16.010> away

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
sake a bit more of a yellow tone away

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.640 
sake a bit more of a yellow tone away
replaced<00:05:17.750> with<00:05:17.960> a<00:05:17.990> read<00:05:18.200> it<00:05:18.350> in<00:05:20.320> so<00:05:21.320> I'm<00:05:21.410> here

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
replaced with a read it in so I'm here

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.680 
replaced with a read it in so I'm here
you<00:05:21.950> just<00:05:22.250> put<00:05:22.490> on<00:05:22.610> as<00:05:22.729> many<00:05:22.910> coats<00:05:23.120> as<00:05:23.479> you

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
you just put on as many coats as you

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.030 
you just put on as many coats as you
think<00:05:23.900> you're<00:05:24.020> gonna<00:05:24.140> need<00:05:24.320> essentially<00:05:24.919> if

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
think you're gonna need essentially if

you think you're gonna need more than

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.870 
you think you're gonna need more than
three<00:05:26.660> then<00:05:26.930> put<00:05:27.290> on<00:05:27.410> more<00:05:27.680> than<00:05:27.770> three<00:05:28.010> just

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
three then put on more than three just

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.130 
three then put on more than three just
keep<00:05:29.060> going<00:05:29.330> until<00:05:29.419> you're<00:05:29.720> happy<00:05:29.810> with<00:05:29.990> the

keep going until you're happy with the

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.400 
keep going until you're happy with the
effect<00:05:30.669> always<00:05:31.669> good<00:05:31.850> to<00:05:31.940> test<00:05:32.180> this<00:05:32.330> on<00:05:32.540> spare

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
effect always good to test this on spare

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.670 
effect always good to test this on spare
part<00:05:33.710> or<00:05:33.950> whatever<00:05:34.190> to<00:05:35.560> experiment<00:05:36.560> with<00:05:36.650> how

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
part or whatever to experiment with how

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.080 
part or whatever to experiment with how
many<00:05:36.979> layers<00:05:37.160> you<00:05:37.310> want<00:05:37.490> to<00:05:37.610> put<00:05:37.729> on<00:05:37.850> to

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
many layers you want to put on to

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.460 
many layers you want to put on to
achieve<00:05:38.180> the<00:05:38.479> right<00:05:38.630> color<00:05:40.600> so<00:05:41.600> I'm<00:05:42.110> putting

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
achieve the right color so I'm putting

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.710 
achieve the right color so I'm putting
on<00:05:42.590> a<00:05:42.620> little<00:05:42.800> bit<00:05:43.040> less<00:05:43.220> with<00:05:43.520> this<00:05:43.700> last<00:05:44.150> coat

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.880 

so<00:05:47.720> there<00:05:48.260> we<00:05:48.470> go<00:05:50.110> okay<00:05:51.110> and<00:05:51.380> then<00:05:51.560> I'll<00:05:51.650> be

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
so there we go okay and then I'll be

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.829 
so there we go okay and then I'll be
back<00:05:52.039> in<00:05:52.190> a<00:05:52.250> minute<00:05:52.310> when<00:05:52.610> that<00:05:52.789> one's<00:05:52.970> dry

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:55.839 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:58.510 

okay<00:05:56.839> so<00:05:56.899> now<00:05:57.409> the<00:05:57.469> layers<00:05:57.949> dry<00:05:58.219> and<00:05:58.369> you<00:05:58.459> can

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
okay so now the layers dry and you can

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.339 
okay so now the layers dry and you can
see<00:05:58.789> the<00:05:58.909> effect<00:05:59.239> and<00:05:59.779> this<00:05:59.899> is<00:06:00.050> after

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
see the effect and this is after

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:02.079 
see the effect and this is after
freak-outs<00:06:00.800> this<00:06:01.429> is<00:06:01.580> where<00:06:01.759> I'm<00:06:01.849> going<00:06:02.029> to

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:02.089 
freak-outs this is where I'm going to

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:04.389 
freak-outs this is where I'm going to
stop<00:06:02.330> but<00:06:02.599> you<00:06:02.689> could<00:06:02.869> easily<00:06:02.989> add<00:06:03.409> on<00:06:03.589> more

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:04.399 
stop but you could easily add on more

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:06.549 
stop but you could easily add on more
layers<00:06:04.610> to<00:06:04.999> make<00:06:05.119> the<00:06:05.330> red<00:06:05.509> darker<00:06:05.989> in<00:06:06.289> this

00:06:06.549 --> 00:06:06.559 
layers to make the red darker in this

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:08.549 
layers to make the red darker in this
case<00:06:06.800> to<00:06:07.069> be<00:06:07.309> more<00:06:07.550> towards<00:06:07.999> a<00:06:08.059> deep<00:06:08.239> red<00:06:08.509> and

00:06:08.549 --> 00:06:08.559 
case to be more towards a deep red and

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:11.499 
case to be more towards a deep red and
less<00:06:09.559> of<00:06:09.679> an<00:06:09.769> orange<00:06:10.039> color<00:06:10.399> and<00:06:11.330> this<00:06:11.449> is

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:11.509 
less of an orange color and this is

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:13.269 
less of an orange color and this is
exactly<00:06:11.779> how<00:06:12.080> I<00:06:12.199> painted<00:06:12.589> the<00:06:12.709> shell<00:06:12.889> tari

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:13.279 
exactly how I painted the shell tari

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:15.909 
exactly how I painted the shell tari
in<00:06:13.429> the<00:06:13.909> raw<00:06:14.149> book<00:06:14.330> so<00:06:15.289> at<00:06:15.529> least<00:06:15.619> for<00:06:15.830> the

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
in the raw book so at least for the

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:17.799 
in the raw book so at least for the
initial<00:06:16.279> stage<00:06:16.519> basically<00:06:17.300> treat<00:06:17.509> this<00:06:17.629> as<00:06:17.779> a

00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:17.809 
initial stage basically treat this as a

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:19.540 
initial stage basically treat this as a
base<00:06:18.019> coat<00:06:18.289> and<00:06:18.469> then<00:06:18.559> you<00:06:18.709> can<00:06:18.860> highlight<00:06:19.189> on

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
base coat and then you can highlight on

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.089 
base coat and then you can highlight on
top<00:06:19.580> manually<00:06:20.330> harder<00:06:21.199> char<00:06:21.439> lighting<00:06:21.830> again

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099 
top manually harder char lighting again

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:24.129 
top manually harder char lighting again
just<00:06:22.369> like<00:06:22.459> everything<00:06:22.939> else<00:06:23.089> it<00:06:23.300> however<00:06:24.080> the

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
just like everything else it however the

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:25.540 
just like everything else it however the
child<00:06:24.319> lighting<00:06:24.679> takes<00:06:24.949> a<00:06:25.009> very<00:06:25.189> long<00:06:25.309> time

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
child lighting takes a very long time

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.730 
child lighting takes a very long time
but<00:06:25.729> it's<00:06:25.879> a<00:06:25.939> nice<00:06:26.119> effect<00:06:26.300> for<00:06:26.689> getting<00:06:26.929> these

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
but it's a nice effect for getting these

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.730 
but it's a nice effect for getting these
raised<00:06:28.069> areas<00:06:28.659> brought<00:06:29.659> up<00:06:29.809> but<00:06:30.589> this<00:06:30.679> is

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
raised areas brought up but this is

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.529 
raised areas brought up but this is
brilliant<00:06:31.009> for<00:06:31.249> the<00:06:31.490> shadows<00:06:31.849> and<00:06:32.179> all<00:06:32.360> the

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
brilliant for the shadows and all the

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:35.199 
brilliant for the shadows and all the
general<00:06:33.039> general<00:06:34.039> raised<00:06:34.339> areas<00:06:34.759> it<00:06:34.939> creates

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:35.209 
general general raised areas it creates

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:37.329 
general general raised areas it creates
a<00:06:35.269> very<00:06:35.479> good<00:06:35.689> shading<00:06:36.469> effect<00:06:36.769> without<00:06:36.979> with

00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:37.339 
a very good shading effect without with

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:39.249 
a very good shading effect without with
very<00:06:37.580> very<00:06:37.819> little<00:06:38.089> effort<00:06:38.209> a<00:06:38.569> little<00:06:39.110> bit<00:06:39.199> of

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.259 
very very little effort a little bit of

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:40.659 
very very little effort a little bit of
patience<00:06:39.589> with<00:06:39.769> drying<00:06:40.009> but<00:06:40.279> that's<00:06:40.490> it

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
patience with drying but that's it

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:42.519 
patience with drying but that's it
really<00:06:40.819> so<00:06:41.779> I<00:06:41.809> hope<00:06:41.959> you<00:06:42.080> enjoyed<00:06:42.349> this

really so I hope you enjoyed this

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:44.079 
really so I hope you enjoyed this
