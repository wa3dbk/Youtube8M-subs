00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:12.959
 it all I want to take you with you show the trailer that is 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.039
 this one 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.089
 and I made it with a number of new products that have been released 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:22.590
 including it is a parking in the house and a new job with flashy van 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.060
 cartels 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.470
 I started with one 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.210
 your plate is square and that is actually 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.640
 find your plate album like this there are two holes on the side with 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.240
 the book was added 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.010
 you can make it differently 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.100
 what have i done i just have time 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.300
 spicy what actually would be 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.670
 turned a quarter turn 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.900
 I had two guarantees at the top 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.660
 where can I be and you must have received that 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.660
 and the paper is from a retirement home 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.340
 and that is of this series in the house the of the winter collection and this series 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.770
 hot sno this paper is the line 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.270
 I found that brain and that was very nice goal fits me completely 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.300
 interior 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.240
 is the use made of it 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.090
 I picked out one of the sheets and that 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.950
 as a base cut out on 14 May 14 centimeters so you still have some of it 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.800
 supporters would of course I have collected there with my favorite 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.800
 to run into the stress of running 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.120
 when I picked up 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.290
 then i have 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.470
 and it is not 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.850
 It will make you see the council that is becoming more defensively loose 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.130
 and that is basically just worn meters the kids with selby see but me 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.670
 used it to 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.040
 and because your plate is home garden 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.020
 to wrap 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.200
 fixed 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.960
 after that I have with 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.110
 it's from anyway 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.550
 the eli yishai syria of the same 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.640
 it also feels that it is a quick week with and 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.530
 cosmo cricket beaters made this turnover 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.330
 and in the middle this is from the 10 coasters collection of tickets 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.560
 they have and line with depth crochet flowers very beautiful red-brown that fit 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.250
 good at it 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.509
 for those who can't make it so well 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.520
 like me 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.910
 is very nice that it is ready for sale 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.249
 after a nice brett in the middle 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:13.499
 those are these and very beautiful with more one 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:18.449
 and still with glitter 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.109
 and that makes it a cross at all 8 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.729
 and there I made a whole with very nice also from the issues collection 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:26.289
 and two of that pole inside 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.289
 this is a shame I've put it before 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:33.119
 make crocheted flower come back with the same kind of fun 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.329
 this x also very nice on TV 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.139
 to point out that it is a cook of a student house and those are the words one 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:40.899
 minutes 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:43.989
 the small little wooden fingers 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.379
 and you have that in dersim buttons 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.179
 of those 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:53.319
 bmc response eg but because that's what I call it you can 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.680
 again of that 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.769
 thread around it people think it looks like it's right 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.389
 wooden chairs are only 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.079
 the Hungarians go offline for their bikes 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.539
 and some time 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:05.749
 I have taken the buttons off 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:09.419
 and provided with some heemstede advice and not hurt so much 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.589
 and this super cute owl is the same 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:14.659
 the substance of your own house 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.299
 I was shown earlier in the video what such a lab looks like from eli to 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.069
 is just a very big piece 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.790
 and you stand with all different patterns 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.060
 the styles that they have all fit together so if you and this one 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.180
 dust in this case it was very common with brown complexion types of bread 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.830
 coming back 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.930
 he now says that with pastel shades and that with bright colors 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:37.930
 and in the middle of this series of fabrics there are all figures 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.460
 why the actress l well I think that is totally amazing 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.059
 and especially in the counterattack style 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:46.560
 and I've got there 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.130
 cut out a double-sided exit 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.779
 just a little bit the edges 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.949
 geeraedts so that it got a little more vintage look 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:55.719
 and there to the pasted 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:58.719
 and the whole on it finished with a nice dark brown touch 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.419
 and I did when I finished this and 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:05.129
 I thought so but that is actually nice to see but I really like it 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:06.689
 ommen really 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:11.719
 Christmas passages so I still have the set and colors in the same 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.809
 another door made her 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:17.430
 that has become this one 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.489
 and this this nonsense has become a Christmas gala 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.019
 m i have 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.240
 it is also a pillar a minus a sheet of select only on 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.909
 Sundays were quickly met with snowflakes 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:32.309
 and there the basic elf this is again against geert widers to set this 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:33.479
 cups small 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.199
 enne and grubbing up 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.819
 I made a rosette from the material 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.169
 I once learned a movie clip to show you how to make it 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.670
 after what more do i have value pins come back and the 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.309
 flowers I have and some 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:51.180
 beautiful dark brown 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.689
 just let it come back from flowers 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:58.110
 have what I also really liked to be stuck in a series of Marianne 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.180
 the waterfall also by eric berkhof 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.689
 one designed 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:04.659
 it's these got boas 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:09.050
 and there are two more, if I say correctly, two more instances 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.940
 nothing with let's not impressed minsk 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.580
 I have already opted for the and strong 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.050
 and the caller 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.439
 and systems that can collect the edges that with nv curnet of course 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.479
 and in the middle acres of hooked flowers 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.979
 to this time i got one was taken 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.719
 with some luck south 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:32.089
 and the bernard you could put the outlet and the letters that i used it 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:35.150
 very nice letters from the great women 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.550
 and those are these 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.920
 the site on both incredibly many 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.539
 it turned 6 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.300
 and it's a bit it's hard to see and think many 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.250
 but it is as if the city looks like structures 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.849
 foot voltes of women 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.690
 and a bit of sterile structures is declining 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.919
 but I like it at the breakdown style 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.169
 this door just hangs very nicely 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.409
 the perpetrator who actually made it from abbreviated 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.490
 Christmas does not apply to the couch now 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.449
 and m I used this slome and first see what you arranged 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:11.300
 click here 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.669
 that's this one 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:13.759
 and 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.759
 a small one that matters is last year 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.779
 jacob sharpened 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:23.279
 the estimates along provides heaven stuck together I just have a piece 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:24.520
 cut off 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.659
 and then of course you can also access 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:29.869
 the swo better optimal use finds this in any case because then you do not have 

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:32.929
 the once to do but day you just use the last of it 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.050
 and yes then you can press below 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.479
 come out after the guild awaited finished with a dark brown serving 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.499
 and we still have a beautiful hanging hanging with the cherry man 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:47.539
 so we have not sat still we are busy 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:50.639
 and I think I will certainly continue with the lines because we still have enough 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:52.580
 paper and fabric m 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.530
 disagree is to make a lot of beautiful things everywhere 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.180
 I would like to show you this 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.180
 good luck possibly and she found it
