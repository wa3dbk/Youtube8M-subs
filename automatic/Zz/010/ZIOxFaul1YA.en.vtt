which is the favicon format actually it

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.870 
which is the favicon format actually it
should<00:01:21.960> be<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.939> jpg<00:01:23.939> or<00:01:24.090> PNG<00:01:24.710> format<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.520> in

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
should be in a jpg or PNG format and in

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.010 
should be in a jpg or PNG format and in
my<00:01:27.060> case<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.200> favicon<00:01:28.770> I'm<00:01:30.020> using

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
my case this is the favicon I'm using

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.600 
my case this is the favicon I'm using
and<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:32.970> PNG<00:01:33.329> form<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:35.460> should

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
and it is in PNG form and you should

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.679 
and it is in PNG form and you should
take<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.600> dimensions<00:01:37.320> should<00:01:37.799> be

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
take that the dimensions should be

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.410 
take that the dimensions should be
exactly<00:01:39.689> 16<00:01:40.380> into<00:01:40.680> 16<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.970> achieve

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
exactly 16 into 16 and you can achieve

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.179 
exactly 16 into 16 and you can achieve
that<00:01:42.659> by<00:01:43.310> going<00:01:44.310> into<00:01:44.490> paint<00:01:45.890> this<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
that by going into paint this is the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.069 
that by going into paint this is the
image<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.970> click<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.540> resize<00:01:49.189> go<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.250> pixels

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
image so click on resize go to pixels

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.710 
image so click on resize go to pixels
and<00:01:52.079> take<00:01:52.579> maintain<00:01:53.579> aspect<00:01:53.790> ratio<00:01:54.090> because

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
and take maintain aspect ratio because

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.410 
and take maintain aspect ratio because
that's<00:01:55.290> not<00:01:55.560> possible<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.189> case<00:01:56.430> it

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that's not possible in this case it

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.300 
that's not possible in this case it
should<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:57.869> spa<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.560> should<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> square

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
should be in spa it should be a square

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.219 
should be in spa it should be a square
image<00:01:59.899> if<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.460> are<00:02:02.460> taking<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.140> 1616<00:02:04.140> and

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
image if you are taking that 1616 and

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.070 
image if you are taking that 1616 and
this<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:06.140> now<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.220> save<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.929> has<00:02:09.929> been

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
this is it now we save this has been

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.600 
this is it now we save this has been
let's<00:02:12.080> give<00:02:12.320> it<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.530> name<00:02:14.740> as<00:02:15.820> favicon<00:02:18.610> image

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
let's give it a name as favicon image

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.000 
let's give it a name as favicon image
okay<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:22.850> this<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:24.170> now<00:02:24.200> let's<00:02:24.740> go

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
okay so so this is it and now let's go

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.740 
okay so so this is it and now let's go
to<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:26.390> editor<00:02:26.830> this<00:02:27.830> is<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.190> deter<00:02:28.400> so

and<00:04:22.830> then<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:24.090> header<00:04:24.300> code<00:04:24.600> we<00:04:24.810> will<00:04:26.570> copy<00:04:27.570> and

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
and then to header code we will copy and

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.290 
and then to header code we will copy and
paste<00:04:28.140> a<00:04:28.470> pointing<00:04:29.280> code<00:04:29.550> which<00:04:29.790> is<00:04:29.940> used<00:04:30.120> to

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
paste a pointing code which is used to

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.300 
paste a pointing code which is used to
point<00:04:30.690> them<00:04:30.960> image<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:31.860> we<00:04:32.010> have<00:04:32.100> uploaded

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
point them image that we have uploaded

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.500 
point them image that we have uploaded
to<00:04:32.670> the<00:04:32.870> servers<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.200> and<00:04:35.130> then<00:04:35.790> tell<00:04:36.060> the

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
to the servers and and then tell the

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.700 
to the servers and and then tell the
server<00:04:36.860> that<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:39.510> image<00:04:39.750> should<00:04:40.110> be<00:04:40.170> used<00:04:40.440> for

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
server that the image should be used for

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.660 
server that the image should be used for
a<00:04:40.740> favicon<00:04:41.160> homage

a favicon homage

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.340 
a favicon homage
so<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.840> pointing<00:04:43.230> code<00:04:43.410> I<00:04:43.620> have<00:04:44.690> that<00:04:45.690> in<00:04:46.020> this

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
so the pointing code I have that in this

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.670 
so the pointing code I have that in this
txt<00:04:47.040> file<00:04:47.250> and<00:04:47.490> this<00:04:48.390> same<00:04:48.930> code<00:04:49.200> is<00:04:49.350> also

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
txt file and this same code is also

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.890 
txt file and this same code is also
available<00:04:49.890> in<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.310> image<00:04:50.610> description<00:04:50.900> so

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
available in the image description so

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.570 
available in the image description so
let's<00:04:52.080> copy<00:04:52.350> this<00:04:52.590> code<00:04:52.980> and<00:04:56.060> paste<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:57.570> here

this is the image URL that we used and

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.180 
this is the image URL that we used and
between<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.430> two<00:05:32.610> inverted<00:05:33.390> commas<00:05:34.040> we<00:05:35.040> will

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
between the two inverted commas we will

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.840 
between the two inverted commas we will
paste<00:05:35.430> the<00:05:35.780> URL<00:05:36.830> so<00:05:37.830> this<00:05:37.980> is<00:05:38.100> done<00:05:38.310> click<00:05:38.640> on
