00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.870
 the farmer betting on the crop, the government knows that there are few options 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.389
 adapts to cold weather 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.300
 then smaller state university research points out that canola is 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.769
 considered the cold climate soybean 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.039
 the students of the agronomy course carried out a study to evaluate the 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.039
 development and production of this oilseed 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.279
 here at the pontifical Catholic university of paraná are for sale 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.159
 the study of professor edson will have of agronomy 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.199
 want to know how the actual canola nitrogen application 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.780
 how is this study that has been going on for two years 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.740
 will define how they develop better 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.620
 We are working with 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.340
 different doses 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.360
 of nitrogen 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.710
 which of these two times is the most appropriate 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.030
 we were working as 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.070
 of zero so that the witness up to 120 kilograms of maize per hectare 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.920
 besides we are also working 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.280
 What is the best moment of the application of always 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.650
 so we are doing 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.399
 or all nitrogen precautions on campus 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:11.200
 or else 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.390
 in coverage 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.440
 in total 20 students accompany each city of plant cultivation 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.500
 the ability to search for future agronomists and biologists grows to the extent 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.400
 in which the canola is blooming at the end of the year we have to do a job 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.690
 of course completion 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.400
 she's the one who's practically doing it until now so we'll stay 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.240
 on the first floor forward is like a test 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.100
 she intended to deliver more 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.950
 more directories knowing best 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.400
 the wisdom seized in nature demonstrates why canola is an alternative 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.390
 of field diversification 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.290
 which generates income mainly in winter 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.290
 canola produces rubble around 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.410
 and 38% oil 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.490
 while for example soybeans 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.280
 produces around 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.810
 18 20% 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.110
 so she has 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.110
 a competitive advantage over the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.499
 on the other hand 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:11.499
 the home is a winter culture 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.119
 it is also a great product alternative 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.529
 the production of the canoe is also very simple 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:23.039
 the most common pest control is the statoil in the here called turnip 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:28.139
 forage the white flowers even tried to cheat but to get rid of the herb 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.219
 we just need to put it 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:34.649
 no more are close to 130 days to the planting is at the point of harvest 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:39.459
 with the market guaranteed today the canola is the third largest colleges ours 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.719
 cultivated by area in the world 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.389
 in the paraná 10 thousand hectares are destined to plant the thousand only in 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:47.319
 towers of 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.859
 in the university and 112 plots studied are in full development 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.099
 were planted together the difference is in law enforcement driving 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.199
 in fact the monkey that contains nitrogen 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:02.389
 during the sugarcane cycle 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.389
 carried out a series day evaluations 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.869
 since 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.349
 in the background was an age at germination 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.769
 uniformity in flowering uniformity renata emission of 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.769
 What these people have here in the chamber is called themselves. 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.519
 the apa are then for example 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.680
 to shoot 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.769
 measuring height and plant height 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.769
 we also do not determine for example 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:34.709
 how much leafing canola produces how many 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:38.409
 after asking us 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:39.609
 it produces 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.290
 that we have a direct relationship with the quantity of 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.819
 nitrogen that has been applied 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:45.930
 normally 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.570
 if I apply more heterogeneous the plant grows more study nine statistic 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.909
 observation and laboratory analysis 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:58.069
 the whole process lasts about eight months in the most important the result obtained 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.400
 here the influence of the dollar on the rural properties the average I love the 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:07.399
 as the 'red earth' of the region is very fertile well drained and little 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:08.559
 compacted 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:13.489
 to high grain development, which gives excellent results at the time of 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.220
 sale of the product normally the price of canola soy 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.229
 What's worth the price? 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.099
 countries 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.309
 today they are holders of 30 reais 30 thirty two reais 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.560
 much smaller 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.669
 the new account is marketed next to it too 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.380
 looks at canola is a good option for crop rotation 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.090
 at the same time she did not do well in the north and northwest region of the parana 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.610
 pressure from warmer climates 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.280
 already in the region cold as the tournament and also in the south of the country she has 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.419
 developed well if you want to get in touch with us write down the address 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:54.969
 of the rural property of the streets tal 20 97 the sebrae should be 0 11 970 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:58.689
 on the internet young people should look for the guilty party did nothing 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:59.349
 it's OK
