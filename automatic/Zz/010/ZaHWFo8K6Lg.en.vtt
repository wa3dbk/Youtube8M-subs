00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
was telling these guys that riding the

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.780 
was telling these guys that riding the
BMW<00:03:26.450> GS<00:03:26.660> is<00:03:26.989> probably<00:03:27.440> easier<00:03:27.890> or<00:03:28.160> easier<00:03:28.610> than

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
BMW GS is probably easier or easier than

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.190 
BMW GS is probably easier or easier than
writing<00:03:29.000> this<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.270> workload<00:03:29.720> on<00:03:29.840> this<00:03:30.020> is

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
writing this the workload on this is

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.560 
writing this the workload on this is
greater<00:03:30.800> than<00:03:30.920> it<00:03:31.190> is<00:03:31.310> on<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.550> BMW<00:03:32.030> GS<00:03:32.209> just

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
greater than it is on the BMW GS just

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.090 
greater than it is on the BMW GS just
because<00:03:32.840> there's<00:03:33.350> so<00:03:33.440> much<00:03:33.620> more<00:03:33.800> to<00:03:33.860> think

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
because there's so much more to think

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.920 
because there's so much more to think
about<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:34.520> the<00:03:34.610> brake<00:03:34.820> brakes<00:03:35.180> on<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.420> GS

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
about it and the brake brakes on the GS
