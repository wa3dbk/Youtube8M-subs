again<00:01:39.959> and<00:01:40.619> get<00:01:40.770> back<00:01:40.920> into<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.280> center

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
again and get back into the center

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.020 
again and get back into the center
another<00:01:43.740> good<00:01:43.920> combination<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.610> use<00:01:44.819> when

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
another good combination to use when

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.059 
another good combination to use when
you're<00:01:45.149> deep<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.509> battle<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.619> down<00:01:46.829> P

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 
you're deep in battle is the down P

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:48.649 
you're deep in battle is the down P
combination<00:01:47.340> because<00:01:48.000> not<00:01:48.149> only<00:01:48.179> is<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.509> a

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
combination because not only is it a

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.479 
combination because not only is it a
shield<00:01:48.989> sending<00:01:49.770> people<00:01:49.890> propelling

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:50.489 
shield sending people propelling

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:52.190

backward but if you get knocked into the
air<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.679> do<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> smash<00:01:53.189> attack

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.020 

now<00:02:02.770> if<00:02:02.890> you're<00:02:03.009> planning<00:02:03.189> on<00:02:03.369> using<00:02:03.429> Mario

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
now if you're planning on using Mario

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.870 
now if you're planning on using Mario
use<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.390> same<00:02:04.659> up<00:02:04.899> in<00:02:05.229> P<00:02:05.590> combination<00:02:05.890> you'll

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
use the same up in P combination you'll

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.300 
use the same up in P combination you'll
still<00:02:07.210> do<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.570> front<00:02:07.899> kick<00:02:08.080> however<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:09.160> will

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
still do the front kick however you will

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.070 
still do the front kick however you will
slightly<00:02:09.819> move<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.450> left<00:02:10.660> or<00:02:10.840> right<00:02:11.050> or

slightly move to the left or right or

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.540 
slightly move to the left or right or
whatever<00:02:11.440> direction<00:02:11.620> you're<00:02:11.980> facing<00:02:12.220> and

whatever direction you're facing and

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.890 
whatever direction you're facing and
that's<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.819> problem<00:02:13.239> considering<00:02:13.569> you<00:02:13.750> don't

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
that's a problem considering you don't

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.600 
that's a problem considering you don't
want<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.080> go<00:02:14.140> off<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.290> edge<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:15.220> have<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.430> move

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
want to go off the edge you have to move

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.949 
want to go off the edge you have to move
back<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.120> center<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.569> could<00:02:16.780> risk

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
back to the center and you could risk

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.920 
back to the center and you could risk
being<00:02:17.230> knocked<00:02:17.680> off<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.010> stage<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:19.510> best<00:02:19.750> way

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
being knocked off the stage the best way

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.509 
being knocked off the stage the best way

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
shape you see that hexagon shape that's

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.289 
shape you see that hexagon shape that's
in<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.230> middle<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.500> this<00:02:26.650> arena<00:02:27.400> just<00:02:28.090> stay

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
in the middle of this arena just stay

in the middle of this arena just stay
within<00:02:28.569> that<00:02:28.720> area<00:02:29.049> and<00:02:29.319> you'll<00:02:29.440> be<00:02:29.560> fine<00:02:29.830> as

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
within that area and you'll be fine as

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:41.640 
within that area and you'll be fine as
long<00:02:30.430> as<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:30.640> don't<00:02:30.790> go<00:02:31.000> too<00:02:31.060> high<00:02:31.390> or<00:02:31.599> too<00:02:31.629> low

you and behind you now the only other
disadvantage<00:02:55.879> like<00:02:56.120> with<00:02:56.359> Mario<00:02:56.780> is<00:02:57.049> that

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
disadvantage like with Mario is that

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.199 
disadvantage like with Mario is that
you'll<00:02:58.010> move<00:02:58.219> forward<00:02:58.639> every<00:02:58.849> time<00:02:59.060> you

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
you'll move forward every time you

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.629 
you'll move forward every time you
execute<00:02:59.540> either<00:03:00.079> of<00:03:00.290> these<00:03:00.349> attacks<00:03:00.739> so<00:03:01.430> once

again<00:03:01.790> stay<00:03:02.150> within<00:03:02.299> that<00:03:02.420> hexagon<00:03:02.870> shape<00:03:03.400> on

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
again stay within that hexagon shape on

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.250 
again stay within that hexagon shape on
a<00:03:04.430> side<00:03:04.730> note<00:03:04.909> if<00:03:04.969> an<00:03:05.150> object<00:03:05.359> falls<00:03:05.780> near<00:03:06.109> you

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
a side note if an object falls near you

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.780 
a side note if an object falls near you
you<00:03:06.409> can<00:03:06.439> pick<00:03:06.739> it<00:03:06.859> up<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.129> use<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.280> but<00:03:07.579> don't

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
you can pick it up and use it but don't

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.580 
you can pick it up and use it but don't
go<00:03:08.000> after<00:03:08.209> any<00:03:08.540> objects<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.109> fall<00:03:09.349> too<00:03:09.560> far

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
go after any objects that fall too far

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.879 
go after any objects that fall too far
out<00:03:09.919> of<00:03:09.950> reach<00:03:10.219> simply<00:03:10.639> because<00:03:10.939> you'll<00:03:11.180> risk

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
out of reach simply because you'll risk

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.440 
out of reach simply because you'll risk
getting<00:03:12.889> knocked<00:03:13.040> out<00:03:13.219> the<00:03:13.430> ring<00:03:13.609> doing<00:03:14.269> that

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
getting knocked out the ring doing that

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.209 
getting knocked out the ring doing that
like<00:03:15.019> that<00:03:15.169> heart<00:03:15.439> I'm<00:03:15.620> not<00:03:15.650> gonna<00:03:15.889> go<00:03:16.099> after

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:16.219 
like that heart I'm not gonna go after

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:17.979 
like that heart I'm not gonna go after
it<00:03:16.489> because<00:03:16.639> if<00:03:16.760> I<00:03:16.849> go<00:03:17.030> up<00:03:17.209> someone<00:03:17.659> will<00:03:17.780> punch

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
it because if I go up someone will punch

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.140 
it because if I go up someone will punch
me<00:03:18.169> halfway<00:03:18.439> across<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.769> screen<00:03:19.060> now<00:03:20.060> I'm

very<00:04:05.700> much<00:04:06.680> but<00:04:07.680> as<00:04:07.800> I<00:04:07.950> said<00:04:08.010> before<00:04:08.520> there's

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
very much but as I said before there's

very much but as I said before there's
some<00:04:09.000> really<00:04:09.150> good<00:04:09.330> items<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.720> pick<00:04:09.900> up<00:04:10.050> like

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
some really good items to pick up like

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.050 
some really good items to pick up like
this<00:04:10.530> rubber<00:04:10.740> flipper<00:04:11.040> that's<00:04:11.700> one<00:04:11.880> of<00:04:11.970> the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
this rubber flipper that's one of the

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.640 
this rubber flipper that's one of the
best<00:04:12.300> items<00:04:12.510> that<00:04:12.780> they<00:04:12.930> can<00:04:13.080> give<00:04:13.200> you<00:04:13.350> and

best items that they can give you and
thankfully<00:04:14.280> for<00:04:14.310> me<00:04:14.490> it<00:04:14.730> came<00:04:14.910> within<00:04:15.150> my

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
thankfully for me it came within my

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.270 
thankfully for me it came within my
reach<00:04:18.290> another<00:04:19.290> reason<00:04:19.680> why<00:04:19.800> I<00:04:19.830> really<00:04:20.070> like

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
reach another reason why I really like

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.100 
reach another reason why I really like
using<00:04:20.489> Pikachu's<00:04:21.120> because<00:04:21.510> he's<00:04:21.720> one<00:04:21.930> of<00:04:21.960> the

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
using Pikachu's because he's one of the

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.810 
using Pikachu's because he's one of the
hardest<00:04:22.350> characters<00:04:22.950> to<00:04:23.070> eliminate<00:04:23.520> like<00:04:23.700> if

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
hardest characters to eliminate like if

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.820 
hardest characters to eliminate like if
you<00:04:23.940> look<00:04:24.120> where<00:04:24.300> jigglypuff<00:04:24.540> is<00:04:25.050> not<00:04:25.620> on<00:04:25.740> the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
you look where jigglypuff is not on the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.690 
you look where jigglypuff is not on the
screen<00:04:26.070> but<00:04:26.130> on<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:28.050> percentage<00:04:28.440> box<00:04:28.710> it'll

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
screen but on the percentage box it'll

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.870 
screen but on the percentage box it'll
become<00:04:29.910> Pikachu<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:30.840> watch<00:04:31.680> as<00:04:31.980> Pikachu<00:04:32.400> does

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
become Pikachu and watch as Pikachu does

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.740 
become Pikachu and watch as Pikachu does
not<00:04:33.060> die

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
not die

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.700 
not die
one<00:04:34.130> two<00:04:35.630> three<00:04:37.010> four<00:04:38.900> until<00:04:39.900> I<00:04:40.260> hit<00:04:40.440> him<00:04:40.590> a

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
one two three four until I hit him a

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.410 
one two three four until I hit him a
fifth<00:04:41.010> time<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.520> he<00:04:41.580> finally<00:04:41.820> flies<00:04:42.120> out<00:04:42.300> the

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
fifth time and he finally flies out the

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.110 
fifth time and he finally flies out the
ring<00:04:42.570> he<00:04:43.020> keeps<00:04:43.230> using<00:04:43.440> a<00:04:43.860> four<00:04:44.610> word<00:04:44.730> people

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
ring he keeps using a four word people

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
ring he keeps using a four word people
and<00:04:45.240> that's<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:46.020> spinning<00:04:46.650> -<00:04:47.370> move<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.480> what

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
and that's the spinning - move and what

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.600 
and that's the spinning - move and what
that<00:04:49.290> does<00:04:49.440> is<00:04:49.620> it<00:04:49.740> kind<00:04:49.920> of<00:04:49.950> propels<00:04:50.310> him<00:04:50.490> it

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
that does is it kind of propels him it

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.070 
that does is it kind of propels him it
stops<00:04:50.850> him<00:04:51.060> from<00:04:51.090> moving<00:04:51.630> in<00:04:51.780> whatever

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
stops him from moving in whatever

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.260 
stops him from moving in whatever
direction<00:04:52.320> he's<00:04:52.650> going<00:04:53.040> and<00:04:53.190> it<00:04:53.820> sends<00:04:54.090> him

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
direction he's going and it sends him

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.970 
direction he's going and it sends him
going<00:04:54.510> in<00:04:54.600> the<00:04:54.660> opposite<00:04:54.960> direction<00:04:55.020> so<00:04:55.800> it's

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
going in the opposite direction so it's

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.460 
going in the opposite direction so it's
really<00:04:56.160> helpful<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:56.760> um<00:04:56.970> that's<00:04:57.870> why<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.110> like
