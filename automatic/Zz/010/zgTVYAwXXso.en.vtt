now but and then the cards trade I mean
this<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.200> an<00:02:25.320> experiment<00:02:25.770> Austrian<00:02:26.130> economics

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
this is an experiment Austrian economics

and we love what liberty dollar did and
some<00:02:31.470> other<00:02:31.700> organizations<00:02:32.700> like<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:33.060> they

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
some other organizations like that they

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.910 
some other organizations like that they
stamp<00:02:33.690> but<00:02:33.960> they<00:02:34.050> stamped<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.350> number<00:02:34.710> on<00:02:34.830> the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
coin and it always confused me and i

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.480 
coin and it always confused me and i
think<00:02:37.620> i<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:37.710> fuse<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:38.040> lot<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.250> other<00:02:38.370> people

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
think i can fuse a lot of other people

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.900 
think i can fuse a lot of other people
and<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.570> gave<00:02:39.990> just<00:02:40.230> more<00:02:40.470> tools<00:02:41.130> for<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.610> for

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
and it gave just more tools for the for

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.590 
and it gave just more tools for the for
the<00:02:41.940> man<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:43.850> come<00:02:44.850> down<00:02:45.000> on<00:02:45.030> like<00:02:45.390> you're

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
the man to to come down on like you're

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.420 
the man to to come down on like you're
creating<00:02:46.050> alternative<00:02:46.410> currency<00:02:46.740> so<00:02:46.890> we

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
creating alternative currency so we

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.950 
creating alternative currency so we
don't<00:02:47.640> say<00:02:48.030> we're<00:02:48.270> creating<00:02:48.570> alternative

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
don't say we're creating alternative

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.180 
don't say we're creating alternative
currency<00:02:49.260> we're<00:02:49.410> just<00:02:49.620> creating<00:02:49.950> a

currency we're just creating a

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.380 
currency we're just creating a
convenient<00:02:50.610> packaging<00:02:51.000> for<00:02:51.180> something

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390

don't think we'll be doing another
machine<00:03:46.530> we're<00:03:47.220> gonna<00:03:47.310> keep<00:03:47.610> carrying<00:03:48.240> this

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
machine we're gonna keep carrying this

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.980

if you'll get a cut of those probably at

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.490 
if you'll get a cut of those probably at
the<00:03:53.880> end<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.090> video<00:03:54.180> for<00:03:54.960> supporting<00:03:55.440> us

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
the end of the video for supporting us

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.650 
the end of the video for supporting us
in<00:03:55.620> this<00:03:55.710> project<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.460> 10<00:03:56.820> displayed<00:03:57.480> on<00:03:57.600> the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
in this project to 10 displayed on the

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.500 
in this project to 10 displayed on the
side<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.080> locked<00:03:58.230> in<00:03:58.350> writing<00:03:58.740> yeah<00:03:58.920> yeah<00:03:59.190> and

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
side it locked in writing yeah yeah and

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.380 
side it locked in writing yeah yeah and
and<00:04:00.590> so<00:04:01.590> will<00:04:02.250> be<00:04:02.430> taking<00:04:02.760> around<00:04:03.000> at<00:04:03.240> least

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
and so will be taking around at least

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.550 
and so will be taking around at least
throughout<00:04:04.050> this<00:04:04.350> political<00:04:04.980> cycle<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.370> 2012

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
throughout this political cycle of 2012

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.260 
throughout this political cycle of 2012
but<00:04:07.560> other<00:04:07.770> than<00:04:07.950> that<00:04:08.010> it's<00:04:08.400> real<00:04:08.580> easy<00:04:08.610> to

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
but other than that it's real easy to

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.990 
but other than that it's real easy to
will<00:04:10.170> probably<00:04:10.470> just<00:04:10.590> resell<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.340> machine<00:04:11.640> or

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
will probably just resell the machine or

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.480 
will probably just resell the machine or
something<00:04:12.470> we<00:04:13.470> would<00:04:13.740> have<00:04:13.980> wanted<00:04:14.130> something
