00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.590
 well this is a request of the friend 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.709
 luÃ­s tie that you tell us you could explain 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.719
 which is the circle of rooms or sales 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.910
 let's see how good we are clarifying 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.269
 one thing the circle of fifths in 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.189
 reality is a greater benefit 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:27.390
 when one is formally studying 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.339
 music theory basically because when 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.409
 do not study this on your own 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.720
 certain empty and certain bad 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:36.790
 understood so I'll try to be 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.920
 as clear and as concise as possible 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.560
 good is the circle of fifths of zone 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.960
 graphic as we see here with several notes 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.990
 those notes are separated by a 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.780
 quarter and fifth intervals 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:54.310
 for example of do sun we have five 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.080
 distance notes do re my sun fa but 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.640
 if we go that would be in the sense 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.640
 schedule if we go in direction 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.620
 counterclockwise is to say left 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.330
 we give to fa that only a fourth 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.270
 of distance that is four notes of 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.040
 distance do re my fa 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.830
 how it is used to work 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.110
 to start we can find how 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.180
 we can form larger scales with the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.510
 fifth circle and thus hues 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.990
 greater 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:26.350
 for example if we know that of the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.240
 tonality of two has no sharps 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.390
 no flats ie all your notes are 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.670
 natural 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.229
 from that point we can follow the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.090
 circle of fifths and go knowing which 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.130
 are the tones that are going to start 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.300
 have sharps and flats for example 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.750
 the sun clockwise we are 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.210
 watching the sun would have a sharp the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.920
 network hue would have two sharps 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.420
 the tonality of the would have three 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.729
 etc 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.299
 if we go counterclockwise fa 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.490
 would have a flat B flat and it would have two 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.350
 flats the tone of my flat would have 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.479
 three et cetera 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.110
 let's see an example let's say 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.730
 we want the tonality of the greatest 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.250
 we know that it only has a sharp that 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.110
 retains two and that should have three 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.260
 I'm following the order of the circle 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.170
 Now I need to know what those are 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.450
 three sharp for that let's start 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.070
 from the note phases of the first sharp 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.200
 within any tonality that 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.720
 contain sharps 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.700
 then easy and the first sharp and 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.530
 following circle 2 would be the second 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.560
 sharp sun would be the third sharp 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.330
 therefore the scale of the greatest 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:48.980
 would have the following notes the 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.270
 do sharp re my fa sharp and sun 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.220
 sustained 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.810
 then there we can see the three 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.930
 sustained that correspond to the 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.360
 tonality of the major and that are factor and 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.730
 sun now the circle of fifths also 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.030
 describes a fairly common movement 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.880
 between the chords of a key 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.209
 for example, going back to the example of 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:15.430
 greater a pretty chord production 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.430
 common in the greatest would this be 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.950
 the circle of fifths 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.920
 we noticed that if we start from the fa 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.120
 sustained 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.550
 that is precisely the sustained order 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.790
 A) Yes 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.950
 and of course 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.810
 a fairly common variation of this 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.680
 chord progression is instead of 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.680
 use the minor if 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.410
 the song of the police 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.259
 and that is also used for songs 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.729
 as stand by me is quite common other 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:21.160
 example of this we can see in the 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:25.000
 blues we know that they even use three 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.789
 chords let's go back to the key of the 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.820
 would be the first chord to determine 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:34.150
 which is the second chord I can go on 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.050
 counter- clockwise the king would come as 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.120
 we can see 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.979
 and the third agreed that I would use a 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.460
 blues would be the one after the 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.800
 clockwise is to say me 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.449
 all three can be major chords or 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.250
 of seventh I will use chords of 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.270
 seventh then basically a blues 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.270
 would be the 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.440
 to me 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:05.729
 and another example let's see where it 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:07.240
 use the circle is the song 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.520
 Jimi Hendrix 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.270
 that starting at everything and moving around 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.750
 the circle of 15 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.750
 A) Yes 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.090
 all right 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.790
 to 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.199
 i 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.730
 then 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.419
 old 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:59.009
 that's basically the use let's say more 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:02.129
 common circle of fifths I hope that 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:05.479
 Serve them that they have solved their doubts and 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:05.479
 See you in the next video
