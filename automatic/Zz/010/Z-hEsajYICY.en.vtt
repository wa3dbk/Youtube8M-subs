so in this video today I'll be showing
you<00:00:02.580> how<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:02.879> draw<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.270> very<00:00:04.080> very<00:00:04.529> basic

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
you how to draw the very very basic

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.620 
you how to draw the very very basic
proportions<00:00:06.150> for<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.750> guy<00:00:07.970> so<00:00:08.970> as<00:00:09.300> you<00:00:09.450> can<00:00:09.570> see

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
proportions for a guy so as you can see

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.190 
proportions for a guy so as you can see
I've<00:00:10.370> got<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> little<00:00:11.580> bit<00:00:11.820> started<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.960> heads

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
I've got a little bit started the heads

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.220 
I've got a little bit started the heads
here<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:13.889> I've<00:00:14.639> marked<00:00:15.360> where<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.719> top<00:00:16.049> of

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
here and I've marked where the top of

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.040 
here and I've marked where the top of
the<00:00:16.289> head<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.039> then<00:00:17.760> by<00:00:18.270> taking<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
the head is and then by taking the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.800 
the head is and then by taking the
length<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.800> head<00:00:20.010> down<00:00:20.460> I've<00:00:20.939> marked

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
length of the head down I've marked

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.050 
length of the head down I've marked
about<00:00:22.350> seven<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.130> half<00:00:23.160> heads<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.850> length

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
about seven and a half heads in length

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.599 
about seven and a half heads in length
which<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.750> general<00:00:25.140> human<00:00:25.439> figure<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.279> seven

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
which the general human figure is seven

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.380 
which the general human figure is seven
and<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.789> half<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.330> eight<00:00:29.210> obviously<00:00:30.210> that

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
and a half to eight obviously that

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.269 
and a half to eight obviously that
varies<00:00:30.750> but<00:00:31.199> that's<00:00:31.740> what<00:00:31.949> we'll<00:00:32.070> be<00:00:32.250> working

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
varies but that's what we'll be working

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.040 
varies but that's what we'll be working
with<00:00:32.759> today<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.149> then<00:00:33.270> I've<00:00:33.360> also<00:00:33.480> marked<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
with today and then I've also marked the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.900 
with today and then I've also marked the
midpoint<00:00:34.200> which<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.860> where<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.340> legs<00:00:35.579> need

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
midpoint which is where the legs need

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.940 
midpoint which is where the legs need
the<00:00:36.030> torso<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:38.070> let's<00:00:38.250> get<00:00:38.370> started<00:00:38.790> um<00:00:39.950> we'll

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the torso so let's get started um we'll

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.819 
the torso so let's get started um we'll
just<00:00:41.160> bring<00:00:41.340> down<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.670> neck<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.469> course<00:00:43.469> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
just bring down the neck of course and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.959 
just bring down the neck of course and
then<00:00:44.960> bring<00:00:45.960> out<00:00:46.110> some<00:00:46.379> shoulders<00:00:46.969> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
then bring out some shoulders the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.319 
then bring out some shoulders the
shoulder<00:00:48.390> width<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.899> an<00:00:49.680> average<00:00:50.430> guy<00:00:50.969> is

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
shoulder width on an average guy is

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.939 
shoulder width on an average guy is
about<00:00:51.690> twice<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.739> length<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.340> head<00:00:54.949> on

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
about twice the length of the head on

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.350 
about twice the length of the head on
girls<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.760> different<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.270> I'll

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
girls that is different and I'll

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.630 
girls that is different and I'll
definitely<00:00:57.930> show<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.440> another<00:00:58.530> video<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
definitely show in another video the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.020 
definitely show in another video the
basic<00:00:59.969> anatomy<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.600> girl<00:01:01.309> but<00:01:02.309> once<00:01:02.879> you

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
basic anatomy for a girl but once you

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.920 
basic anatomy for a girl but once you
have<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:04.040> you<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.129> come<00:01:05.519> down<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.390> every

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
have that you can come down and every

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.870 
have that you can come down and every
artist<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.799> know<00:01:07.920> definitely<00:01:08.310> approaches

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
artist you know definitely approaches

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.190 
artist you know definitely approaches
this<00:01:08.939> differently<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> way<00:01:10.170> I

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
this differently this is just the way I

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.530 
this differently this is just the way I
found<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.130> easiest<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.670> draw<00:01:11.880> people

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
found that it's easiest to draw people

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.899 
found that it's easiest to draw people
if<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.530> doesn't<00:01:13.740> work<00:01:13.830> for<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.430> is

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
if it doesn't work for you that is

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.960 
if it doesn't work for you that is
totally<00:01:15.299> fine<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.290> kind<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.560> draw<00:01:16.970> basically

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
totally fine so I kind of draw basically

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.719 
totally fine so I kind of draw basically
kind<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.330> where<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.509> pectorals<00:01:18.990> are<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.729> then

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
kind of where the pectorals are and then

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.310 
kind of where the pectorals are and then
come<00:01:20.939> down<00:01:21.119> more<00:01:21.979> just<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.189> show<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:24.450> torso

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
come down more just to show the torso

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.950 
come down more just to show the torso
and<00:01:26.030> then<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.740> waist

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.720 

as<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.080> can<00:01:34.170> see<00:01:34.350> we're<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:35.010> really<00:01:35.340> worried

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
as you can see we're not really worried

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.340 
as you can see we're not really worried
about<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.240> making<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.630> look<00:01:36.720> nice<00:01:36.930> or

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
about like making it look nice or

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.200 
about like making it look nice or
perfect<00:01:37.800> or<00:01:37.950> anything<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.700> basic

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
perfect or anything it's just the basic

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.800 
perfect or anything it's just the basic
blocky<00:01:39.570> shapes<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.320> help<00:01:41.540> know<00:01:42.540> where

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
blocky shapes to help know where

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.700 
blocky shapes to help know where
everything<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:44.390> here<00:01:45.390> I'll<00:01:45.570> mark<00:01:45.870> a<00:01:46.110> big<00:01:46.320> area

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
everything is here I'll mark a big area

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.900 
everything is here I'll mark a big area
of<00:01:46.770> where<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.980> want<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.310> put<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.550> ankles

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
of where I want to put the ankles

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.100 
of where I want to put the ankles
eventually<00:01:48.480> because<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.750> don't<00:01:48.930> want<00:01:49.050> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
eventually because I don't want the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.230 
eventually because I don't want the
ankles<00:01:49.410> to<00:01:49.650> like<00:01:49.830> end<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.610> right<00:01:50.940> on<00:01:51.120> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
ankles to like end up right on the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.610 
ankles to like end up right on the
height<00:01:51.420> line<00:01:51.690> cuz<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.080> need<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.260> have<00:01:52.410> some

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
height line cuz you need to have some

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.360 
height line cuz you need to have some
room<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:54.000> specify<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.450> feet<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:55.320> now<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.950> want

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
room to specify the feet but now I want

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.510 
room to specify the feet but now I want
to<00:01:56.460> find<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.850> midpoint<00:01:57.620> between<00:01:58.620> here<00:01:59.130> for

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
to find the midpoint between here for

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.359 
to find the midpoint between here for
the<00:01:59.730> knees<00:02:01.400> so<00:02:02.400> that's<00:02:02.520> roughly<00:02:03.110> in<00:02:04.110> there<00:02:04.920> ish

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.330 

and<00:02:08.369> then<00:02:08.550> mark<00:02:08.790> where<00:02:08.850> those<00:02:09.240> will<00:02:09.420> be<00:02:10.340> and

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
and then mark where those will be and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.970 
and then mark where those will be and
then<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.760> ankles<00:02:12.240> as<00:02:12.420> well<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:16.410> here<00:02:16.680> you

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
then the ankles as well and here you

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.320 
then the ankles as well and here you
know<00:02:17.100> it's<00:02:17.250> always<00:02:17.400> good<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.820> know<00:02:17.850> as<00:02:18.210> much

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
know it's always good to know as much

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.660 
know it's always good to know as much
Anatomy<00:02:18.840> as<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.020> can<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:20.130> don't<00:02:20.280> have<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.550> go

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
Anatomy as you can you don't have to go

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.040 
Anatomy as you can you don't have to go
out<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:20.970> take<00:02:21.120> an<00:02:21.210> anatomy<00:02:21.630> class<00:02:21.660> or

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
out and take an anatomy class or

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.320 
out and take an anatomy class or
anything<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:24.330> femur<00:02:24.660> comes<00:02:25.350> in<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:25.950> way

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
anything but the femur comes in this way

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:34.010 
anything but the femur comes in this way
and<00:02:27.330> then<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> bones<00:02:28.440> go<00:02:28.950> out<00:02:29.070> like<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:33.020> and

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
and then the bones go out like this and

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.340 
and then the bones go out like this and
so<00:02:34.380> when<00:02:34.680> we<00:02:34.800> bring<00:02:35.160> in<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.400> leg<00:02:36.350> there's

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
so when we bring in the leg there's

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.060 
so when we bring in the leg there's
definite<00:02:37.830> muscle<00:02:38.250> movement<00:02:38.820> in<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.950> know

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
definite muscle movement in you know

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.180 
definite muscle movement in you know
that<00:02:41.340> way<00:02:41.900> but<00:02:42.900> just<00:02:42.930> for<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.590> know<00:02:43.709> basic

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
that way but just for you know basic

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.510 
that way but just for you know basic
cartoonish<00:02:44.730> drawings<00:02:45.180> it's<00:02:46.020> not<00:02:46.520> necessary

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
cartoonish drawings it's not necessary

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.449 
cartoonish drawings it's not necessary
to<00:02:47.580> know<00:02:47.790> or<00:02:47.970> anything<00:02:51.260> but<00:02:52.260> if<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.830> want<00:02:53.310> to

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
to know or anything but if you want to

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.670 
to know or anything but if you want to
go<00:02:53.610> into<00:02:53.850> figure<00:02:54.090> drawing<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.900> would<00:02:55.050> be<00:02:55.200> good

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
go into figure drawing it would be good

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.500 
go into figure drawing it would be good
to<00:02:55.830> know<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:57.980> think<00:02:58.980> I've<00:02:59.160> made<00:02:59.520> this<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.760> bit<00:03:00.239> too

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
to know I think I've made this a bit too

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.699 
to know I think I've made this a bit too
long

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.199 

it's<00:03:06.709> important<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.610> know<00:03:07.730> something<00:03:08.090> like

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
it's important to to know something like

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.460 
it's important to to know something like
the<00:03:08.329> muscle<00:03:08.720> group<00:03:08.900> so<00:03:09.140> you<00:03:09.230> know<00:03:09.349> the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
the muscle group so you know the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.280 
the muscle group so you know the
different<00:03:09.769> shapes<00:03:10.099> that<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.459> legs<00:03:10.670> make<00:03:11.290> and

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
different shapes that the legs make and

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.649 
different shapes that the legs make and
just<00:03:12.560> by<00:03:12.769> observing<00:03:13.220> people<00:03:13.849> around<00:03:14.360> you

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
just by observing people around you

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:26.880 
just by observing people around you
you'll<00:03:14.950> pick<00:03:15.950> up<00:03:16.099> on<00:03:16.310> that

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.530 

once<00:03:27.890> again<00:03:28.010> obviously<00:03:28.670> this<00:03:28.819> isn't<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.420> know

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
once again obviously this isn't you know

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.300 
once again obviously this isn't you know
looking<00:03:29.900> nice<00:03:30.109> I<00:03:30.500> remember<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.069> was<00:03:31.189> like

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
looking nice I remember and I was like

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.710 
looking nice I remember and I was like
trying<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:31.609> figure<00:03:31.790> out<00:03:31.939> how<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.180> draw<00:03:32.329> people

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
trying to figure out how to draw people

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.319 
trying to figure out how to draw people
looking<00:03:33.049> at<00:03:33.140> all<00:03:33.230> these<00:03:33.319> different<00:03:33.379> tutorials

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
looking at all these different tutorials

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.059 
looking at all these different tutorials
they<00:03:35.329> always<00:03:35.569> like<00:03:35.750> looked<00:03:36.049> so<00:03:36.470> nice<00:03:36.799> and

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
they always like looked so nice and

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.190 
they always like looked so nice and
professional<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:37.849> it<00:03:38.720> was<00:03:38.840> really<00:03:39.019> daunting

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
professional and it was really daunting

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.470 
professional and it was really daunting
to<00:03:39.530> me<00:03:39.650> but<00:03:39.889> you<00:03:40.069> know<00:03:40.190> if<00:03:41.120> you're<00:03:41.269> just

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
to me but you know if you're just

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.180 
to me but you know if you're just
sketching<00:03:41.900> out<00:03:41.989> a<00:03:42.019> person<00:03:42.349> does<00:03:42.530> not<00:03:42.769> have<00:03:43.010> to

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
sketching out a person does not have to

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.220 
sketching out a person does not have to
look<00:03:43.370> good<00:03:43.720> especially<00:03:44.720> when<00:03:44.840> it's<00:03:44.959> just<00:03:45.019> like

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
look good especially when it's just like

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.770 
look good especially when it's just like
this<00:03:45.409> awkward<00:03:45.650> straight-on<00:03:46.549> position<00:03:47.450> like

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
this awkward straight-on position like

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.960 
this awkward straight-on position like
you're<00:03:48.470> never<00:03:48.680> gonna<00:03:48.859> really<00:03:49.069> draw<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.549> so

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
you're never gonna really draw that so

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.990 
you're never gonna really draw that so
this<00:03:50.840> is<00:03:50.900> simply<00:03:51.500> just<00:03:51.799> for<00:03:51.980> getting<00:03:52.069> down<00:03:52.400> the

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
this is simply just for getting down the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.879 
this is simply just for getting down the
measurements<00:03:53.599> and<00:03:54.139> proportions<00:03:54.680> of

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
measurements and proportions of

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:01.929 
measurements and proportions of
everything<00:03:59.530> now<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.560> we<00:04:00.950> have<00:04:01.159> that<00:04:01.519> we<00:04:01.909> can

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:01.939 
everything now that we have that we can

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.979 
everything now that we have that we can
do<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.900> arms<00:04:03.849> the<00:04:04.849> length<00:04:05.090> of<00:04:05.269> the<00:04:05.389> arm<00:04:05.569> plus

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
do the arms the length of the arm plus

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.509 
do the arms the length of the arm plus
the<00:04:06.139> length<00:04:06.290> of<00:04:06.439> the<00:04:06.500> hand<00:04:06.709> extends<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.489> a

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
the length of the hand extends to a

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.479 
the length of the hand extends to a
little<00:04:07.790> bit<00:04:07.849> past<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.389> midpoint<00:04:09.010> of<00:04:10.010> the

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
little bit past the midpoint of the

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.300 
little bit past the midpoint of the
thigh<00:04:11.680> sometimes<00:04:12.680> a<00:04:12.739> little<00:04:12.799> bit<00:04:12.980> shorter

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
thigh sometimes a little bit shorter

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.339 
thigh sometimes a little bit shorter
sometimes<00:04:13.519> longer<00:04:13.970> it<00:04:14.299> yeah<00:04:14.989> obviously

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
sometimes longer it yeah obviously

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.120 
sometimes longer it yeah obviously
depends<00:04:16.010> um<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.539> then<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:17.780> elbow<00:04:18.199> usually<00:04:18.889> is

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
depends um and then the elbow usually is

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.240 
depends um and then the elbow usually is
around<00:04:19.870> you<00:04:20.870> know<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.500> top<00:04:21.739> where<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.070> can

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
around you know the top where you can

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.790 
around you know the top where you can
kind<00:04:22.610> of<00:04:22.699> feel<00:04:22.880> your<00:04:23.060> hip<00:04:23.360> bone<00:04:23.570> it's<00:04:24.560> really

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
kind of feel your hip bone it's really

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.529 
kind of feel your hip bone it's really
where<00:04:25.159> the<00:04:25.310> elbow<00:04:25.580> generally<00:04:26.240> kind<00:04:26.419> of

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
where the elbow generally kind of

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:36.740 
where the elbow generally kind of
touches<00:04:27.580> so

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.510 

come<00:04:37.350> in<00:04:37.560> add<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:37.920> first<00:04:38.220> top<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:38.790> arm<00:04:38.970> and

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
come in add the first top of the arm and

00:04:40.520 --> 00:05:21.330 
come in add the first top of the arm and
then<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.640> horror

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.380 

so<00:05:22.340> that's<00:05:22.940> sort<00:05:23.210> of<00:05:23.980> very<00:05:24.980> basic<00:05:25.390> bare

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
so that's sort of very basic bare

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.870 
so that's sort of very basic bare
minimum<00:05:26.930> of<00:05:27.490> drawing<00:05:28.490> a<00:05:28.640> figure<00:05:30.880> hopefully

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
minimum of drawing a figure hopefully

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.610 
minimum of drawing a figure hopefully
this'll<00:05:32.090> least<00:05:32.360> get<00:05:32.570> you<00:05:32.690> started<00:05:33.140> you<00:05:33.530> know

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
this'll least get you started you know

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.200 
this'll least get you started you know
there's<00:05:34.010> so<00:05:34.940> much<00:05:35.120> more<00:05:35.180> to<00:05:35.570> it<00:05:35.600> but<00:05:37.210> maybe

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
there's so much more to it but maybe

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.960 
there's so much more to it but maybe
that'll<00:05:38.570> help<00:05:39.050> a<00:05:39.590> little<00:05:39.830> bit<00:05:39.980> in<00:05:40.130> getting<00:05:40.850> the

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
that'll help a little bit in getting the

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.420 
that'll help a little bit in getting the
measurements<00:05:41.120> right<00:05:41.860> later<00:05:42.860> I'll<00:05:43.040> be<00:05:43.130> doing<00:05:43.340> a

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
measurements right later I'll be doing a

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.120 
measurements right later I'll be doing a
video<00:05:43.550> that's<00:05:44.090> more<00:05:44.330> about<00:05:44.620> gestures<00:05:45.620> and

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
video that's more about gestures and

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.590 
video that's more about gestures and
drawing<00:05:46.370> in<00:05:46.610> different<00:05:46.880> positions<00:05:47.270> and<00:05:47.450> stuff

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
drawing in different positions and stuff

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.510 
drawing in different positions and stuff
to<00:05:48.320> really<00:05:48.710> you<00:05:48.800> know<00:05:48.860> that's<00:05:49.070> what<00:05:49.220> you<00:05:49.310> want

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
to really you know that's what you want

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.040 
to really you know that's what you want
to<00:05:49.700> draw<00:05:49.940> you<00:05:50.210> don't<00:05:50.360> want<00:05:50.480> to<00:05:50.540> draw<00:05:50.690> people

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
to draw you don't want to draw people

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.770 
to draw you don't want to draw people
just<00:05:51.260> standing<00:05:51.850> stick<00:05:52.850> straight<00:05:53.150> and<00:05:53.390> then

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
just standing stick straight and then

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.020 
just standing stick straight and then
I'll<00:05:53.900> also<00:05:54.020> draw<00:05:54.380> a<00:05:54.410> video<00:05:54.680> on<00:05:55.040> girls<00:05:55.730> and

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
I'll also draw a video on girls and

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.590 
I'll also draw a video on girls and
because<00:05:56.570> they<00:05:56.720> have<00:05:57.430> different<00:05:58.600> measurements

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
because they have different measurements

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.930 
because they have different measurements
and<00:05:59.930> everything<00:06:00.410> it's<00:06:00.950> similar<00:06:01.130> but<00:06:01.460> a<00:06:01.520> little

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
and everything it's similar but a little

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.970 
and everything it's similar but a little
bit<00:06:02.090> different<00:06:02.170> so<00:06:03.170> I<00:06:03.200> really<00:06:03.680> hope<00:06:03.800> this

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
bit different so I really hope this

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.520 
bit different so I really hope this
