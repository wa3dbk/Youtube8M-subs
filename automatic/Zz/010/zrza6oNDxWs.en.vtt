to solve it okay out of the box this
thing<00:00:25.109> was<00:00:25.380> very<00:00:25.650> stiff<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.130> was<00:00:26.250> for<00:00:26.460> me<00:00:26.580> it

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
with it as you can see the clear plastic

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.700 
with it as you can see the clear plastic
from<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.799> logo<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.280> peeling<00:01:05.640> off<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:09.710> shape

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
from the logo is peeling off the shape

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.620 
from the logo is peeling off the shape
of<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.040> cube<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.460> obviously<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.479> see

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
of this cube is obviously you can see

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.020 
of this cube is obviously you can see
that<00:01:12.659> its<00:01:12.930> payload<00:01:13.369> it<00:01:14.369> doesn't<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
that its payload it doesn't have the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.730 
that its payload it doesn't have the
same<00:01:15.150> shape<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> regular<00:01:16.229> cube<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.680> is

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
same shape as a regular cube that is

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.609 
same shape as a regular cube that is
squared<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:19.710> weight<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:21.090> fine

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
squared the weight of it is just fine

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.920 
squared the weight of it is just fine
and<00:01:23.600> let's<00:01:24.600> talk<00:01:24.840> about<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.590> speed<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.369> now

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
and let's talk about the speed of it now

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.870 
and let's talk about the speed of it now
after<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.990> lubricated<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:29.009> myself<00:01:29.159> you

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
after I lubricated it for myself you

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.370 
after I lubricated it for myself you
know<00:01:29.909> take<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.180> all<00:01:30.360> apart<00:01:30.479> wiped<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.020> out<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
know take it all apart wiped it out and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.950 
know take it all apart wiped it out and
just<00:01:31.680> put<00:01:31.920> lubick<00:01:32.250> sin<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:33.540> was<00:01:33.720> still<00:01:33.900> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
just put lubick sin it it was still a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.740 
just put lubick sin it it was still a
little<00:01:34.140> harder<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.619> turn<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.610> after<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> brick

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
little harder to turn but after a brick

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.319 
little harder to turn but after a brick
broke<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.729> started<00:01:38.729> turning<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.119> much

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
broke it in started turning a much

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.920 
broke it in started turning a much
better<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.900> now<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.829> cube<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:42.240> would<00:01:42.840> say

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
better and now this cube is I would say

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.620 
better and now this cube is I would say
this<00:01:43.049> Cuban<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.680> really<00:01:43.920> fast<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:45.210> outside

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
this Cuban is really fast the outside

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.740 
this Cuban is really fast the outside
players<00:01:46.020> are<00:01:46.470> really<00:01:46.560> fast<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:48.420> inside

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
players are really fast and the inside

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.249 
players are really fast and the inside
layers<00:01:48.990> are<00:01:49.200> really<00:01:49.350> fast<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:50.750> this<00:01:51.750> cube<00:01:52.049> only

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
layers are really fast to this cube only

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.170 
layers are really fast to this cube only
took<00:01:52.439> about<00:01:52.500> an<00:01:52.979> hour<00:01:53.040> for<00:01:53.640> me<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.820> break<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.090> in

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
took about an hour for me to break it in

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.289 
took about an hour for me to break it in
before<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.840> became<00:01:55.350> as<00:01:55.619> good<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.700> so

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
before we became as good as it is so

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.760 
before we became as good as it is so
about<00:01:57.420> an<00:01:57.570> hour<00:01:57.689> an<00:01:58.049> hour<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.320> half<00:01:58.500> for<00:01:58.649> me

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
about an hour an hour and a half for me

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.430 
over why share does this cube lockups
sometimes<00:02:27.900> because<00:02:28.349> you<00:02:28.530> cannot<00:02:28.860> cut<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.760> the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
sometimes because you cannot cut in the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.270 
sometimes because you cannot cut in the
center<00:02:31.440> layers<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.519> middle<00:02:33.150> layers<00:02:33.330> cannot

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
center layers the middle layers cannot

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.300 
center layers the middle layers cannot
cut<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.550> can't<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.420> cannot<00:02:36.930> cut<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.290> all<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:38.280> I

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
cut it can't it cannot cut it all so I

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.430 
cut it can't it cannot cut it all so I
get<00:02:38.610> lockups<00:02:39.060> because<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.900> it

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
get lockups because of that and it

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.900 
get lockups because of that and it
cannot<00:02:40.680> reverse<00:02:40.980> cut<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.430> get<00:02:41.580> locked<00:02:41.790> off

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
cannot reverse cut so I get locked off

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.780 
cannot reverse cut so I get locked off
because<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.420> now<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.410> outer<00:02:43.920> layers<00:02:44.310> can

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
because of that now the outer layers can

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.020 
because of that now the outer layers can
cut<00:02:45.209> out<00:02:46.110> there<00:02:46.519> may<00:02:47.519> be<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.670> little<00:02:47.760> bit<00:02:47.910> more

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
cut out there may be a little bit more

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:59.449 
cut out there may be a little bit more
like<00:02:48.540> there<00:02:49.550> but<00:02:50.550> you'd<00:02:50.760> have<00:02:50.879> to<00:02:50.940> force<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:58.459> so

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
like there but you'd have to force it so

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.850 
like there but you'd have to force it so
that<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.239> why<00:03:00.480> sometimes<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.200> do<00:03:01.260> get<00:03:01.500> lock<00:03:01.680> up

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
that is why sometimes I do get lock up

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.470 
that is why sometimes I do get lock up
on<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.370> because<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.760> center<00:03:03.030> late<00:03:03.239> the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
on this is because the center late the

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.570 
on this is because the center late the
middle<00:03:03.750> layers<00:03:03.930> will<00:03:04.200> not<00:03:04.349> cut<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.340> cube

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
middle layers will not cut and the cube

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.229 
middle layers will not cut and the cube
does<00:03:05.730> not<00:03:05.909> reverse<00:03:06.239> cut<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.900> all<00:03:08.090> I'm<00:03:09.090> very

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
does not reverse cut it all I'm very

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.430 
does not reverse cut it all I'm very
dependent<00:03:09.930> on<00:03:10.050> cutting<00:03:11.690> I'll<00:03:12.690> go<00:03:13.110> over<00:03:13.140> the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
dependent on cutting I'll go over the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.800 
dependent on cutting I'll go over the
mechanism<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.010> pieces<00:03:14.310> on<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:14.610> this<00:03:14.849> uses<00:03:15.780> a

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
mechanism and pieces on this this uses a

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.839 
mechanism and pieces on this this uses a
ball<00:03:16.260> core<00:03:16.650> mechanism<00:03:16.830> much<00:03:17.400> like<00:03:17.640> the

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
ball core mechanism much like the

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.229 
ball core mechanism much like the
Rubik's<00:03:18.810> 4<00:03:19.170> by<00:03:19.290> 4<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:20.430> will<00:03:20.670> show<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.940> the

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
Rubik's 4 by 4 and I will show you the

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:32.930 
Rubik's 4 by 4 and I will show you the
pieces<00:03:23.090> ok<00:03:28.909> this<00:03:29.909> is<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.209> ball<00:03:30.750> core<00:03:31.790> is<00:03:32.790> how

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
pieces ok this is the ball core is how

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:43.040 
pieces ok this is the ball core is how
it<00:03:33.060> looks<00:03:35.930> this<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.319> corner<00:03:37.890> piece

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:52.130 

and<00:03:43.740> this<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.460> an<00:03:44.580> edge<00:03:44.730> piece<00:03:50.870> this<00:03:51.870> ball

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
and this is an edge piece this ball

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.580 
and this is an edge piece this ball
court<00:03:52.410> does<00:03:52.560> not<00:03:52.590> have<00:03:52.770> screws<00:03:53.310> or<00:03:53.580> springs<00:03:54.120> or

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
court does not have screws or springs or

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.370 
court does not have screws or springs or
doesn't<00:03:55.590> have<00:03:55.680> screws<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.100> springs<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.760> it

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
doesn't have screws and springs in it

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.320 
doesn't have screws and springs in it
therefore<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:58.500> cannot<00:03:58.770> tension<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.430> if<00:03:59.580> you

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
therefore you cannot tension it if you

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.890 
therefore you cannot tension it if you
need<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.930> tighten<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.440> or<00:04:01.650> loosen<00:04:02.070> it<00:04:05.660> that<00:04:06.660> can

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
need to tighten it or loosen it that can

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.560 
need to tighten it or loosen it that can
be<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:07.140> flaw<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:07.710> this<00:04:07.800> cube<00:04:08.730> because<00:04:09.120> if<00:04:09.330> this

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
be a flaw of this cube because if this

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:15.880 
be a flaw of this cube because if this
cute<00:04:09.870> gets<00:04:10.650> too<00:04:10.890> loose<00:04:11.130> I'm<00:04:11.430> in<00:04:11.700> big<00:04:11.910> trouble

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.440 

overall<00:04:16.890> thoughts<00:04:17.100> of<00:04:17.370> this<00:04:17.519> cube<00:04:17.880> for<00:04:18.090> me<00:04:18.239> is

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
overall thoughts of this cube for me is

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.229 
overall thoughts of this cube for me is
I<00:04:19.290> have<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:19.950> breaking<00:04:20.220> it<00:04:20.340> in<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.820> lube<00:04:21.000> in<00:04:21.120> it

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
I have to breaking it in and lube in it

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.600 
I have to breaking it in and lube in it
this<00:04:21.870> cube<00:04:22.380> is<00:04:23.690> really<00:04:24.690> good<00:04:24.900> at<00:04:25.200> turning<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.890> I

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
this cube is really good at turning I I

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.640 
this cube is really good at turning I I
love<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.330> turn<00:04:27.510> in<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:27.810> i<00:04:27.840> love<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.170> speed<00:04:28.440> i

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
love to turn in and i love the speed i

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.160 
love to turn in and i love the speed i
love<00:04:28.920> it<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.070> lot<00:04:29.360> but<00:04:30.360> i<00:04:30.420> will<00:04:30.720> not<00:04:30.750> be<00:04:31.020> using

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
love it a lot but i will not be using

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.000 
love it a lot but i will not be using
this<00:04:31.470> as<00:04:31.740> a<00:04:31.770> main<00:04:32.040> speed<00:04:32.370> tube<00:04:33.230> because<00:04:34.230> it

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
this as a main speed tube because it

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.250 
this as a main speed tube because it
cannot<00:04:35.370> cut<00:04:35.670> in<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:35.940> centres<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:36.480> i<00:04:36.870> find<00:04:37.140> it

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
cannot cut in the centres and i find it

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.040 
cannot cut in the centres and i find it
i'm<00:04:37.380> solving<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.920> I<00:04:38.070> I<00:04:38.310> need<00:04:38.820> cut<00:04:39.120> in<00:04:39.300> I<00:04:39.480> just

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
i'm solving it I I need cut in I just

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.610 
i'm solving it I I need cut in I just
really<00:04:40.380> do<00:04:40.530> I'm<00:04:41.340> not<00:04:41.610> that<00:04:41.790> accurate<00:04:41.970> I<00:04:42.300> turn

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
really do I'm not that accurate I turn

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.310 
really do I'm not that accurate I turn
so<00:04:43.620> I<00:04:44.070> need<00:04:44.790> a<00:04:44.850> puzzle<00:04:45.210> that<00:04:45.240> can<00:04:45.510> cut<00:04:45.810> corners

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
so I need a puzzle that can cut corners

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.850 
so I need a puzzle that can cut corners
I<00:04:47.870> need<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:48.960> plug<00:04:49.110> that<00:04:49.140> cut<00:04:49.470> corners

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
I need to plug that cut corners

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.560 
I need to plug that cut corners
especially<00:04:49.980> in<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.640> middle<00:04:50.910> layers<00:04:51.090> I<00:04:51.360> need

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
especially in the middle layers I need

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.070 
especially in the middle layers I need
that<00:04:52.880> so<00:04:53.880> this<00:04:54.030> will<00:04:54.120> not<00:04:54.300> be<00:04:54.330> my<00:04:54.600> speed<00:04:54.840> cube

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
that so this will not be my speed cube

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.790 
that so this will not be my speed cube
it<00:04:55.260> isn't<00:04:55.590> it<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:56.340> a<00:04:56.370> pretty<00:04:56.669> good<00:04:56.880> cube<00:04:57.090> though

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
it isn't it is a pretty good cube though

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.110 
it isn't it is a pretty good cube though
like<00:04:58.800> I<00:04:58.919> said<00:04:58.980> I<00:04:59.160> just<00:04:59.430> don't<00:04:59.669> like<00:04:59.880> the<00:05:00.090> fact

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
like I said I just don't like the fact

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.870 
like I said I just don't like the fact
that<00:05:00.390> it<00:05:00.540> cannot<00:05:00.810> cut<00:05:02.780> ok<00:05:03.780> so<00:05:04.400> quickly<00:05:05.400> briefly

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
that it cannot cut ok so quickly briefly

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.000 
that it cannot cut ok so quickly briefly
go<00:05:06.090> over<00:05:06.120> everything<00:05:06.540> I<00:05:06.750> just<00:05:06.960> did<00:05:07.140> out<00:05:07.410> of<00:05:07.470> box

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010
