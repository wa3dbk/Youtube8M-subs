00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.700
 hello okay 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.240
 the subject of today's class notation 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.730
 scientific 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.599
 You will understand what is and for what 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.720
 it suits 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:23.070
 as well as some examples involving 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.480
 addition to subtraction the multiplication to 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.980
 division and the radiation of these 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.980
 good grade numbers 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.180
 Today we will study scientific notation 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.180
 which is scientific notation for what it serves 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.460
 because we use both the need to 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.199
 understand the world around them 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.140
 always part of the history of being 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.750
 human knowledge about the micro as 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.720
 for example the atoms and the makro 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.149
 galaxies was modified as the 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.760
 the man thought of new possibilities and 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.510
 found new models to explain the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.030
 world 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.759
 in this sense it became necessary 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.990
 express the very large numbers or 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.830
 very small 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.270
 through scientific notation or 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.149
 represent numbers with the help of 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.350
 base power 10 the standardized form 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:25.009
 of the scientific station is m times 10 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.399
 elevated to ii where m is a coefficient 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.259
 called mantissa and the exponent and 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:34.530
 represents the order of magnitude of the number 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.369
 that is to say the decimal places that were 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.490
 racing arpp lovers presented by a 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.600
 module value greater than or equal to 1 and 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.990
 less than 10 example 4 thousand equals 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.310
 four times 10 raised to cube 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.700
 but why use the notation 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.790
 Let's look at two examples 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.840
 the circumference of the earth is 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.450
 approximately 40 million meters 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:08.399
 while an atomic radius of hydrogen is 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.760
 of 0.1 followed by ten zeroes 25 meters 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.950
 of course it would be much more complicated 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.560
 perform mathematical operations with these 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.410
 values without the form of notation 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.720
 but how to transform a 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.450
 number in scientific notation 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.040
 we must first observe where 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.130
 find the comma 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.950
 if it is not seen it means that 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.380
 is after the last digit we can 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.290
 then move the comma to the left 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.840
 up to the first digit as in 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.079
 example 40 million 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.579
 note that the comma ran seven houses 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:49.290
 to the left 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:52.769
 then in scientific notation we write 4 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.939
 10 times high to seventh for numbers 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.730
 very small 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:03:00.180
 move the comma to the right and 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.049
 each advanced house decreases 1 of the order 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.680
 for example the magnitude and Guido 0.6 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:10.590
 of ten zeros 25 we have an advance of 11 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:15.260
 houses and the number in scientific notation 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.750
 gets 2.5 times 10 high minus 11 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.629
 to add or subtract two numbers from 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.239
 scientific notation it is necessary that the 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:27.150
 exponent is the same if the numbers 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.239
 have different exponents 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.150
 you have to transform one of them so that 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:38.329
 the exponent of base 10 is equal to that of 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:41.430
 another example 2 times 10 raised to cube 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:45.780
 plus five times 10 squared 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:48.959
 as the exponents are different 3 and 2 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.540
 we need to transform one of the numbers and 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:55.560
 find similar exponents 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:59.280
 let's turn five times high 10 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.129
 squared five times 10 raised to 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.650
 square is equal to zero point five 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.379
 times 10 raised to cube 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.319
 we went home to the left and 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.060
 we increased one in the order of magnitude was 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.280
 cry 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.019
 the lady had told the lover that 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.780
 shall be represented by a number 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.870
 equal to or greater than 1 100 less than 10 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.840
 but here is talking about 0.5 does not have 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.880
 no problem and elvis this notation is 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.159
 more advantageous to apply in the operation 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.020
 the issue is no problem at all 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.789
 write annotation with a number that 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.970
 belonged to another interval 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:41.340
 even if it is not between 1 and 10 for 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:45.889
 To facilitate the calculation facilitate then 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:50.970
 the sum gets 2 times 10 raised to the cube 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:53.009
 plus 0.5 times 10 raised to the cube that is 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.129
 equal to two and a half 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:05:00.119
 times 10 we add to the cube 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:03.479
 news we repeat the base 10 and the 

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:05.460
 three to solve calculations that 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.550
 involve multiplication 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.909
 We must multiply the news by adding the 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:15.779
 of each base 10 and to standardize the 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:19.229
 example result three times 10 high 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:23.159
 cube times five times 10 raised to 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:26.819
 square is equal to three times five 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:30.360
 times 10 to 3 plus two that is 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:33.779
 equal to 15 times 10 raised to fifth 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.360
 power that is equal to an email times 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:40.319
 ten times 10 raised to fifth power 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.409
 which is equal to a high 10 times email 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:46.529
 the 6th power we can still divide 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:49.770
 these numbers simply divide the 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:54.689
 coefficients and subtract the exponents of 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:57.509
 each example value 50 times 10 raised to 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:06:00.749
 fifth divided by four times 10 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:04.800
 squared is equal to 50 / 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:08.459
 four times 10 to 5 -2 which is 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:13.680
 equal to 12.5 times 10 raised to cube 

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:18.089
 which is equal to 1.25 times ten times 10 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.610
 cubed and equal to 1.25 times 10 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:23.789
 to the fourth in the 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.669
 news is raised to the external exponent and 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:30.089
 the exponent of base 10 is multiplied 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:32.490
 by external exponent example four 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:36.990
 times 10 raised to cube raised to cube 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:39.449
 equals 4 raised to cube times 10 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:43.259
 raised to the cube that is 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:47.939
 equal to 64 times 10 raised to ninth 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:52.399
 power which is equal to 6.4 times ten 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:56.490
 10 times the ninth power equal to 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:59.399
 6.4 times 10 raised to tenth power 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.319
 already in the radiation it is necessary to analyze 

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:03.899
 initially the exponent 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:05.910
 if it is not a multiple of the index of the 

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:09.690
 root it will be necessary 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:12.600
 so the operation is summed up to calculate 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:16.500
 the root of mantissa and multiply by 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:20.630
 The ratio between the exponent and the 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:24.240
 index of the radical example the squad of 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:28.530
 1.6 times 10 high to fifth equals 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:31.260
 square root of 1.6 times ten times 10 

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:34.980
 high to fourth that is equal to root 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:38.760
 square of 16 times 10 high to fourth 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:41.430
 which is equal to the square root of 16 times 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.530
 the square root of 10 raised to the fourth 

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.630
 which is equal to four 

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:48.950
 see the ten squared by today 

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.950
 It's only until the next meeting.
