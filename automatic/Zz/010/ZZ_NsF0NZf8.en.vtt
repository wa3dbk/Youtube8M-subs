00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:03.380
 welcome to the class in 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.590
 Alice and her traction of less 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.529
 negative 

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:11.390
 here we present you first of all the number line 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.429
 which will help us 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.429
 I showed the examples more clearly 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.419
 let's start with 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.520
 a simple example 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.520
 in this case we have 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.249
 - 5 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.640
 we are lending 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.540
 five galdos units which 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.550
 to the cpe in which hi-5 is greater than 2 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.309
 which means that we are going to have a negative number as a result 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.700
 to get the result 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.680
 dpa to understand especially at the beginning lomé the easiest way 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.130
 would be looking at the number line 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.180
 here we have the number 2 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.660
 i are going to subtract 5 units then the easiest way to merlo growing 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.660
 to the left 5 units 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.700
 from 5 to 1 goes one 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.290
 to the human being and so on 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.350
 pere he 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.770
 4 and 5 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.470
 Which means 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.010
 how well 2-5 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.010
 is equal to - pérez 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.710
 you're everything 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.299
 we can not der in daily life for example in the temperature 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.680
 if we say that we are in a place where the temperature is below zero 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.680
 it means that it is 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.660
 negative 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.520
 in this case if they tell us for example 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.740
 percent we are in a place where the temperature are two degrees centigrade 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.149
 i tell us that it will go down by 5 degrees 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.140
 the temperature in the coming days 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.840
 that would mean 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.380
 what the temperature is going to do to eat the three degrees centigrade 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.470
 is an example of everyday life for example 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.640
 now 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.780
 since we have to take into account something in 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.710
 when we work with negative numbers 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.509
 to for example if we have 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.629
 the number minus 6 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.629
 and the number - 3 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.799
 the number six 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.849
 greater the number three 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.749
 the magnitude is greater 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:25.529
 but if we buy both values ​​on -6 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.399
 and the -3 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.840
 this at least that the -6 is - ap 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.860
 that at least three 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.220
 the easiest way to see it is everything is new 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.789
 on the number line 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:37.040
 we have the 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.359
 - 6 40 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.359
 and we have such - 3 in this place 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.570
 if we want to see which of the two worlds is bigger 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.670
 we just have to see the number that is on the right side of the 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.949
 number line 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:56.160
 in this case 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.379
 Number 3 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.229
 this one to the right 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:00.579
 that the -6 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.529
 in the same way we could see that he 0 is greater than any way shot 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:09.089
 the xerez mallorca and -5 coca and -4 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:10.590
 i thus in general 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.340
 any number in the east part 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.689
 it does the right 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:15.669
 from another number 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:16.899
 it's going to be bigger 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.069
 automatically 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.770
 now let's practice a few examples 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.159
 to be clear 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.259
 the operation of the 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:28.899
 it comes with the negative numbers 

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:30.099
 for example 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.119
 others no other example a little more complicated would be for example 5 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.469
 I gave 5 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:46.259
 - 12 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:49.219
 which would be the same 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:54.069
 buck basically two masters reads the same technique we started with the 5 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.359
 that from here 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.359
 We went twelve months to the left 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:04.199
 which would be a car p 4 5 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:10.809
 7 8 very well he díez 11 and 2 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:13.049
 so 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.639
 5 - we would not be given 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.029
 - 7 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.909
 pa 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.980
 until then what is this for? 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.950
 the text I recommend to practice with the medical line until it is decided 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.599
 they say and then it's going to be much simpler 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.229
 this type of operations 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.409
 another example could be 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.409
 to 7-8 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.660
 one way to see this the problem for example would be that 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:46.240
 the poo is slightly larger than 7 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.620
 sigali 7 we subtract 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.759
 to 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:51.860
 7 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.199
 have and do it 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:59.130
 but the 8 is a unit higher efficiency then how to subtract 7 and subtract 1 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.300
 again with which we would have 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.580
 - one 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.879
 it would be a 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.589
 yield a number 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:09.699
 a unit to the left of the numerical larreta cerreta 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.529
 Now another type of operations with negative numbers 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.849
 nothing could do the way 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.849
 let's say nothing 3 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.779
 wants us to be now what we have 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:31.809
 a magazine of a negative number could take it as putting a 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:33.349
 parentheses and want 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:37.479
 The only thing that means is that at 3 we are lending you a negative number 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.449
 every time we do this 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.520
 in the pines a 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.819
 negative are eliminated says truck for a positive 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:48.969
 these from it the entity to 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:50.909
 do the sum of 3 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:54.499
 plus 7 in this case as we know fair 

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:59.369
 then remember that 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:00.530
 swim 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.849
 every time we pray a negative number 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:06.849
 it's equivalent to add those two worlds 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:09.520
 by 100 while 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.450
 Yes it is 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.300
 yes what we are doing is 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.879
 nothing 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:18.659
 add for example 4 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:21.659
 ma 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:26.360
 8 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.980
 to 4 and we are adding a world 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.039
 negative we are paying you 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:32.960
 a number that 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.330
 this 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.620
 that has value 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.900
 negative that this be the left 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.180
 n the table on the number line 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.039
 this would be the equivalent 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:45.200
 to single mind 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.159
 years ago 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:48.669
 the magazine of 4-8 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:52.099
 as we can see from the American region 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:59.060
 eight squares makes the left from 4 would be matched about 2 3 4 5 6 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.849
 7 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:03.680
 be matched - 4 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.690
 then 4-8 close the not less 4 

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:10.979
 so 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:12.300
 for 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.839
 to summarize the 

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:16.210
 class 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.160
 the anp 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.160
 when we subtract a negative number from a positive number 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:24.599
 if it is that the magnitude that we are subtracting is less than the first 

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:26.839
 to 

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:29.839
 it's going to be very positive as if we were saying 

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:31.469
 - two 

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:35.409
 would be a positive number because magnitude 2 is less than the magnitude of the 

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:36.119
 3 

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:39.569
 The positive part of the American region looks good 

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:43.949
 but if we make a network this a subtraction where 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.330
 6a subtracting a number 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.580
 of greater magnitude the first 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.949
 would happen for 

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:52.969
 the result could the part 

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:56.369
 negative of the america region to the left of 0 

00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:00.509
 and the only thing that we have to keep in mind 

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:02.990
 in these problems is when subtract 

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.520
 nothing a negative number 

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.849
 it is automatically the same as 

00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:09.389
 Add 

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:11.830
 and if a negative mode is added 

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.830
 percent just the same as the rest 

00:08:15.969 --> 00:08:17.219
 this is all iniesta
