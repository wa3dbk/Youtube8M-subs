00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
 photo no i'm happy with you 

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.810
 find today for a new 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.160
 video it with a city and got the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.990
 day so I know that's very 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.059
 for a long time that I did not actually 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.889
 of this type of video but I believe that 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.330
 it's bad weather maybe they're me 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.190
 were not ready not very want to 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.230
 do this type of video actually 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.369
 but there as it does a little bit like 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.420
 there is a little bit of sun so I 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.949
 do not know how long it has lasted in 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.000
 any case today there is sun of the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.010
 I wanted to show you a 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.789
 little bit an outfit that I like to wear 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.840
 for spring 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.060
 so without further ado I 'll go 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.349
 show what I wear a polo shirt I wear 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.490
 a jeans shirt so it's a 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.779
 young team that comes from 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.070
 stradivarius then it's still 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.910
 sometime I judgments 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.160
 that she is always available 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.129
 available in store and I took a 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.079
 blue a faded blue jeans finally puts in 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.190
 plus a sky blue party and I find 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.780
 that it really is we really 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.730
 very well it's perfect it's gone for 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.230
 the season is actually so it's a 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.309
 shirt that has sleeves but me 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.320
 every time I find it because 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.390
 I think it's easier to 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.649
 wear and you go there I like how I like 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.780
 to find that it is for my 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.129
 shirts that get dirty blazers page scared 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.170
 a year program that was one of 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.609
 so that's what it says in white then 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.510
 I'm not stopping 40 miles from this type of 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.859
 German accounts actually but I 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.750
 really wanted a white pants for 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.280
 the season because I think that's it 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.250
 right now for me who says spring 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.390
 or was necessarily called white and I 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.250
 really rather pretty 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.320
 he is really very very fine he 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.850
 is pretty comfortable to wear I think by 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.570
 against it will expand as and 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.040
 measure but that 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.750
 not eat too much the opposite 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.850
 that's how it would allow me to be 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.080
 even more comfortable and I find 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.700
 really very well and by the way that 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.250
 I really like it is that in general who 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.540
 says white said transparent and bayanne 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.460
 actually falls in comparison to others 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.320
 for an object that are really diamond 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.330
 much more transparent this one there is 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.680
 rather it is rather pretty at the level 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.360
 shoes I wear pumps 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.060
 so you see it's shoes with 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.160
 atalante to m sitting to his opponents 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.360
 and it's really not necessarily the kind 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.229
 of shoes that I wear every 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.210
 days but I find that when 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.990
 even having to have at least one 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.970
 pair actually 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.649
 and there I totally fell for 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.910
 the color of the shoes like you 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.229
 can you see it you have a heel that 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.610
 is still quite awesome but you 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.229
 have a small platform here 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.640
 so that's what allows 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.289
 reduce the height of the heel a little 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.330
 but I totally broke for the 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.310
 color the blue that is here and the lock 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.840
 which is right there I just find them 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.520
 beautiful is perfect for the season 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.470
 so this one I took them on the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.000
 lipstick style website and I took them 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.560
 in 36 but then against 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.730
 necessarily like it's shoes 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.140
 open I should have taken them a 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.110
 size at the top I liked it I think 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.340
 that in 37 it would have been a game that would have 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.350
 been perfect but it does not bother me too much 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.640
 in fact because that 's what I do not know 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.049
 not yet if they will expand so 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.150
 so I preferred to keep them when 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.280
 even in 36 since it's morning it's the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.019
 head I do in general but they are 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.450
 really super super pretty I find them 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.010
 just beautiful and frankly the term 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.170
 years at the beginning made me an offer a little 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.120
 little scared but actually but actually no 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.350
 I think that anyway nothing but the 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.459
 color makes that I cracked for his 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.690
 shoes and then I told myself by 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.220
 especially I'm going to do it anyway 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.269
 after that it's not necessarily the kind of 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.380
 shoes that I want to wear every 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.360
 days that's for sure and certain 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.070
 but I find them just super great 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.209
 pretty one at the level of accessories I 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.600
 wears a bracelet that from home time 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.790
 mung 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.170
 this is not necessarily the kind of 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.790
 store where I'm going to take my 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.739
 accessories but there he was in the room 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.610
 is really super super nice I'm going 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.050
 already worn in 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.280
 elsewhere in many of my videos 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.900
 but frankly I do not leave because 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.370
 that it's really the bracelet 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.600
 can wear on all occasions 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.830
 at the level of the earrings I 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.270
 wears earrings that have been 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.400
 made by a designer so that her 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.800
 mark zeop up and frankly they are 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.570
 super nice finally I really had a 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.970
 favorite for his creations in 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.010
 do I find them I find super pretty 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.300
 super subtle slightly the kind of 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.220
 earrings I like a lot 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.900
 carried in fact and finds them I found 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.300
 really perfect they are they are 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.340
 really super pretty super super 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.959
 practical and easy to wear france Ã§a va 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.160
 with everything I really like the idea 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.240
 of an e and I really like the color 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.040
 because I do not know if you're going 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.810
 to see it but it's not black in fact 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.160
 it's navy blue and I find that co 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.590
 that's fine with the 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.270
 held with the outfit I'm wearing at 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.100
 bag level I decided to take this 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.600
 little brown leather bag that comes from 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.520
 at monoprix and that is super convenient 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.010
 because besides being small he is 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.080
 super light I love her a lot in 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.709
 done this is one of my bags had one of my 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.060
 favorites 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.709
 do I really like that 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.050
 just as it is small that we and 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.600
 that I too am I am small 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.160
 here I find that it tends to do not 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.750
 not weigh down the silhouette in fact when 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.640
 we are small we take large bags 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.049
 Waiting for this game is not it gives everything 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.549
 immediately an effect a lift state is 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.959
 with this bag not at all it is really 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.850
 super convenient and I found he 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.209
 was doing rather well with 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.160
 this pretty springy outfit 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.690
 so we go hair I do not love me 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.799
 I just waved them with mister in 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.090
 I think it's a lot better 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.560
 than to have the hair all stiff and 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.180
 is all flat I find that everything from 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.150
 after its strong it carries a little bit of 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.800
 volume at the vermont level I wear the 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.150
 fermi from sega thing had already 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.460
 spoken but I will put you all in the bar 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.380
 info with the varnish of young people 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.090
 checchi that in fact I found that here 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.280
 the colors the colors it seemed 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.720
 rather pretty well so here is my opinion 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.040
 others 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.450
 of the day do not hesitate to tell me in 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.710
 comment you what are the outfits 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.180
 that you will see quickly worn in this 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.770
 moment I know it's not necessarily 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.780
 obvious because here we are with time 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.150
 goes from the sun to the rain in less 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.080
 less than 24 hours arguments so so 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.730
 here I know it's not necessarily 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.870
 obvious but do not hesitate to tell me in 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.730
 comment you what are the outfits 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.410

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.490
 these are the things you want 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.330
 to buy right now at the level at 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.190
 frag level 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.180
 do not hesitate to let me know if you 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.590
 have questions I ask myself in 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.550
 comments no matter the questions 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.620
