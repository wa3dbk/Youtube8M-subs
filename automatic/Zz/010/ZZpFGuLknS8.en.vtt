00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:29.310 
always been kind to AUSA bill yeah and
let's<00:00:14.130> let's<00:00:14.400> listen

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.070 

and<00:00:29.530> that<00:00:30.520> word<00:00:30.670> so<00:00:30.880> reminiscent<00:00:31.270> of<00:00:31.480> 1989

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
and that word so reminiscent of 1989

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.000 
and that word so reminiscent of 1989
down<00:00:32.439> here<00:00:32.590> bill

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
down here bill

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.010 
down here bill
cut<00:00:33.190> a<00:00:33.220> tire<00:00:33.490> down<00:00:33.520> going<00:00:34.240> into<00:00:34.390> corner<00:00:34.840> and

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
cut a tire down going into corner and

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.840 
cut a tire down going into corner and
hit<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:35.590> wall<00:00:35.770> so<00:00:35.920> hard<00:00:36.100> he<00:00:36.190> broke<00:00:36.310> his<00:00:36.520> wrist

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
hit the wall so hard he broke his wrist

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.250 
hit the wall so hard he broke his wrist
and<00:00:37.000> I<00:00:37.090> just<00:00:37.240> think<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:37.480> cars<00:00:37.780> are<00:00:38.020> so<00:00:38.110> much

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
and I just think the cars are so much

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.540 
and I just think the cars are so much
safer<00:00:38.620> in<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:38.770> wall<00:00:38.950> with<00:00:39.160> the<00:00:39.250> safer

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
safer in the wall with the safer

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.630 
safer in the wall with the safer
barriers<00:00:39.970> you<00:00:40.450> saw<00:00:40.630> bill<00:00:40.810> walk<00:00:41.020> away<00:00:41.320> now<00:00:42.190> here

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
barriers you saw bill walk away now here

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.820 
barriers you saw bill walk away now here
we<00:00:42.790> have<00:00:42.970> a<00:00:43.000> problem<00:00:43.300> you<00:00:44.260> have<00:00:44.470> to<00:00:44.590> be<00:00:44.710> running

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
we have a problem you have to be running

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.130 
we have a problem you have to be running
65<00:00:45.580> miles<00:00:45.879> an<00:00:46.030> hour<00:00:46.150> just<00:00:46.510> to<00:00:46.629> stay<00:00:46.840> up<00:00:46.989> on<00:00:47.080> the

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
65 miles an hour just to stay up on the

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.439 
65 miles an hour just to stay up on the
banking<00:00:47.559> so<00:00:47.739> when<00:00:47.890> a<00:00:47.920> car<00:00:48.129> stops<00:00:48.280> up<00:00:49.120> on<00:00:49.300> the

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
banking so when a car stops up on the

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.900 
banking so when a car stops up on the
banking<00:00:49.840> that's<00:00:50.559> a<00:00:50.739> 31<00:00:51.250> degree<00:00:51.550> banking

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
banking that's a 31 degree banking

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.310 
banking that's a 31 degree banking
that's<00:00:52.000> as<00:00:52.239> steep<00:00:52.480> as<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:52.809> roof<00:00:53.050> on<00:00:53.260> your

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
that's as steep as the roof on your

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.549 
that's as steep as the roof on your
house<00:00:53.830> so<00:00:54.520> recovering<00:00:55.090> that<00:00:55.330> car<00:00:55.629> is<00:00:56.260> going<00:00:56.470> to

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
house so recovering that car is going to

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.950 
house so recovering that car is going to
be<00:00:56.650> a<00:00:56.680> little<00:00:56.860> tricky<00:00:57.360> I'm<00:00:58.360> just<00:00:58.570> not<00:00:58.720> sure<00:00:58.780> how

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
be a little tricky I'm just not sure how

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.930 
be a little tricky I'm just not sure how
they're<00:00:59.260> going<00:00:59.350> to<00:00:59.410> go<00:00:59.530> about<00:00:59.770> that<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.250> just

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
they're going to go about that and just

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.030 
they're going to go about that and just
expand<00:01:01.600> on<00:01:01.690> this<00:01:01.839> safer<00:01:02.229> barrier<00:01:02.559> see<00:01:02.949> it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
expand on this safer barrier see it

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.130 
expand on this safer barrier see it
right<00:01:03.250> there<00:01:03.489> that<00:01:03.760> wall<00:01:04.089> that<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.900> cars

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
right there that wall that the cars

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.190 
right there that wall that the cars
against<00:01:05.530> it's<00:01:05.800> still<00:01:06.190> a<00:01:06.460> solid<00:01:07.030> wall<00:01:07.240> but<00:01:08.050> if

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
against it's still a solid wall but if

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.320 
against it's still a solid wall but if
you<00:01:08.320> see<00:01:08.620> the<00:01:08.830> pieces<00:01:09.130> between<00:01:09.460> that<00:01:09.940> wall<00:01:10.150> and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
you see the pieces between that wall and

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.110 
you see the pieces between that wall and
outer<00:01:10.570> wall<00:01:10.900> these<00:01:11.500> right<00:01:11.830> here<00:01:12.280> what<00:01:12.700> that<00:01:12.909> is

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
outer wall these right here what that is

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.420 
outer wall these right here what that is
that's<00:01:13.450> foam<00:01:13.840> it's<00:01:14.170> about<00:01:14.380> 30<00:01:14.799> inches<00:01:15.190> wide

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
that's foam it's about 30 inches wide

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.070 
that's foam it's about 30 inches wide
and<00:01:15.700> what<00:01:15.820> happens<00:01:16.210> when<00:01:16.299> the<00:01:16.450> car<00:01:16.630> hits<00:01:16.870> that

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
and what happens when the car hits that

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.350 
and what happens when the car hits that
wall<00:01:17.290> it<00:01:17.830> gives<00:01:18.280> a<00:01:18.490> little<00:01:18.640> bit<00:01:18.850> and<00:01:19.090> that

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
wall it gives a little bit and that

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.140 
wall it gives a little bit and that
dissipates<00:01:20.020> energy<00:01:20.229> that<00:01:21.040> just<00:01:21.070> otherwise<00:01:21.820> if

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
dissipates energy that just otherwise if

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.760 
dissipates energy that just otherwise if
you<00:01:22.240> just<00:01:22.270> hit<00:01:22.510> that<00:01:22.659> wall<00:01:22.870> solid<00:01:23.440> would

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
you just hit that wall solid would

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.039 
you just hit that wall solid would
transfer<00:01:24.310> back<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.549> the<00:01:24.820> driver<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:25.930> we're

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
transfer back to the driver so we're

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.170 
transfer back to the driver so we're

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
laps do count and we'll have the pit

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.190 
laps do count and we'll have the pit

well<00:01:40.990> I<00:01:41.020> think<00:01:41.110> that's<00:01:41.410> great<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:41.650> Dell

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
well I think that's great that Dell

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.440 
well I think that's great that Dell
juniors<00:01:42.340> out<00:01:42.460> front<00:01:42.760> just<00:01:42.970> for<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.150> fact<00:01:43.330> that

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
juniors out front just for the fact that

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.640 
juniors out front just for the fact that
making<00:01:43.690> a<00:01:43.840> big<00:01:43.990> change<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.410> how<00:01:44.470> much

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
making a big change and how much

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.560 
making a big change and how much
pressure<00:01:44.890> is<00:01:45.070> on<00:01:45.160> but<00:01:45.340> I<00:01:45.520> think<00:01:45.970> I<00:01:46.150> still<00:01:46.390> think

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
pressure is on but I think I still think

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.480 
pressure is on but I think I still think
the<00:01:46.660> big<00:01:46.840> story<00:01:47.110> is<00:01:47.290> just<00:01:47.530> what<00:01:48.010> a<00:01:48.040> bind<00:01:48.310> that

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
the big story is just what a bind that

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.190 
the big story is just what a bind that
puts<00:01:48.700> you<00:01:48.820> in<00:01:48.940> going<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.450> these<00:01:49.600> backup<00:01:49.960> cars

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
puts you in going to these backup cars

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.660 
puts you in going to these backup cars
and<00:01:50.410> reckoned<00:01:50.680> in<00:01:50.740> practice<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.340> that

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
and reckoned in practice and that that

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.120 
and reckoned in practice and that that
right<00:01:51.820> there<00:01:51.880> is<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.240> good<00:01:52.630> reason<00:01:52.960> that<00:01:53.170> they

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
right there is a good reason that they

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.860 
right there is a good reason that they
didn't<00:01:54.310> get<00:01:54.370> any<00:01:54.520> practice<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:55.240> they<00:01:55.630> had<00:01:55.780> to

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
didn't get any practice and they had to

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.240 
didn't get any practice and they had to
go<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.080> that<00:01:56.200> backup<00:01:56.410> car<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:56.920> they<00:01:56.980> wound<00:01:57.160> up

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
go to that backup car and they wound up

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.560 
go to that backup car and they wound up
pulling<00:01:57.490> a<00:01:57.550> right<00:01:57.700> front<00:01:57.880> tire<00:01:57.970> so<00:01:58.120> that's

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
pulling a right front tire so that's

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.240

and<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.209> tumbled<00:04:00.690> down<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.930> banking<00:04:01.379> so<00:04:01.500> you

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
and it tumbled down the banking so you

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.869 
and it tumbled down the banking so you
don't<00:04:01.680> want<00:04:01.799> that<00:04:01.829> to<00:04:02.010> happen<00:04:02.129> either<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.669> I
