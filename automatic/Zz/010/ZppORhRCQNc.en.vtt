00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
presses actually as 125 my first set of

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.170 
presses actually as 125 my first set of
three<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.859> three<00:00:23.160> week<00:00:23.369> for<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.000> log

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
three is this is three week for the log

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.330 
three is this is three week for the log
press<00:00:24.529> up<00:00:25.529> here<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.039> 145<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.439> I<00:00:28.439> just<00:00:29.189> noticed

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
press up here is 145 and I just noticed

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.010 
press up here is 145 and I just noticed
that<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.570> course<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.380> two<00:00:32.189> weeks<00:00:32.399> my

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
that in the course of just two weeks my

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.840 
that in the course of just two weeks my
my<00:00:34.020> technique<00:00:34.350> isn't<00:00:34.530> great<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.730> know

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
my technique isn't great but you know

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.389 
my technique isn't great but you know
I'm<00:00:36.059> I'm<00:00:36.899> strict<00:00:37.350> pressing<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.829> log<00:00:38.070> now<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
I'm I'm strict pressing this log now the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.819 
I'm I'm strict pressing this log now the
weights<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.120> was<00:00:39.390> push<00:00:40.110> pressing<00:00:40.500> before

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
weights that I was push pressing before

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.240 
weights that I was push pressing before
so<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:43.530> know<00:00:43.620> what's<00:00:43.800> getting<00:00:43.920> it's

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
so it's you know what's getting it's

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.880 
so it's you know what's getting it's
getting<00:00:44.309> easier<00:00:44.820> for<00:00:45.059> me<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.180> do<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.829> here's<00:00:46.829> my

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
getting easier for me to do it here's my

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.790 
getting easier for me to do it here's my
top<00:00:47.160> set<00:00:47.370> 160<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.360> only<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.600> 5<00:00:49.170> pound<00:00:49.379> increase

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
top set 160 it's only a 5 pound increase

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.229 
top set 160 it's only a 5 pound increase
from<00:00:50.129> last<00:00:50.430> week<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:52.160> I'm<00:00:53.160> strict<00:00:53.940> pressing

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
from last week but I'm strict pressing

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.420 
from last week but I'm strict pressing
now<00:00:54.360> where<00:00:54.660> before<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.140> was<00:00:55.410> really<00:00:55.860> relying<00:00:56.280> on

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
now where before I was really relying on

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.569 
now where before I was really relying on
the<00:00:56.520> push<00:00:56.699> press<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:57.840> I

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
the push press just to get it and so I

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.549 
the push press just to get it and so I
think<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.180> think<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.989> know<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.109> don't

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
think it I think it's you know I don't

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.439 
think it I think it's you know I don't
think<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.859> got<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> whole<00:01:02.219> lot<00:01:02.370> stronger<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:03.210> this

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
think I got a whole lot stronger in this

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.240 
think I got a whole lot stronger in this
week<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.229> think<00:01:04.530> my<00:01:04.650> technique<00:01:05.040> with<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
week but I think my technique with the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.480 
week but I think my technique with the
log<00:01:05.430> has<00:01:05.729> improved<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.860> I've<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:08.130> got<00:01:08.340> more

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
log has improved and I've just got more

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.679 
log has improved and I've just got more
comfortable<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:10.460> here<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.490> see<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.119> build

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
comfortable with it here you see I build

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.120 
comfortable with it here you see I build
up<00:01:12.840> all<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.140> leg<00:01:13.320> drive<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.799> didn't<00:01:14.040> even

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
up all that leg drive and I didn't even

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.679 
up all that leg drive and I didn't even
use<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.790> still<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.240> trick<00:01:15.390> press<00:01:15.540> it

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
use it I just still just trick press it

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.550 
use it I just still just trick press it
up<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.960> these<00:01:16.110> last<00:01:17.630> these<00:01:18.630> last<00:01:18.869> two<00:01:19.110> reps<00:01:19.350> I

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
up in these last these last two reps I

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.410 
up in these last these last two reps I
do<00:01:19.619> end<00:01:20.159> up<00:01:20.310> push<00:01:20.549> pressing<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:22.040> then<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.159> see

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
do end up push pressing it then you see

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.260 
do end up push pressing it then you see
it<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.630> goes<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:24.990> really<00:01:25.140> easy<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.270> don't

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
it just goes up really easy so I don't

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.550 
it just goes up really easy so I don't
know<00:01:27.330> overhead<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.840> becoming<00:01:28.110> less<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.500> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
know overhead is becoming less of a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:37.219 
know overhead is becoming less of a
weakness<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:29.070> I'm<00:01:29.759> excited<00:01:30.090> about<00:01:30.270> it

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.560 

yep<00:01:38.659> 160<00:01:40.310> for<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> pretty<00:01:41.549> solid<00:01:41.789> seven<00:01:42.360> and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
yep 160 for a pretty solid seven and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.480 
yep 160 for a pretty solid seven and
that's<00:01:43.409> actually<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.920> did<00:01:44.159> last<00:01:44.340> week

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that's actually what I did last week

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.310 
that's actually what I did last week
from<00:01:44.789> my<00:01:44.880> top<00:01:45.090> set<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.509> pushed<00:01:45.810> pressed<00:01:46.079> all

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
from my top set and I pushed pressed all

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.580 
from my top set and I pushed pressed all
of<00:01:46.619> those<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:48.329> gotten<00:01:48.539> better<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:49.409> what

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
of those so it's gotten better this what

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.690 
of those so it's gotten better this what
happens<00:01:49.799> when<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.070> clamps<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.549> don't

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
happens when you have clamps that don't

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.380 
happens when you have clamps that don't
work<00:01:50.880> well<00:01:51.509> BAM<00:01:52.070> yeah<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:54.030> could<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.329> been

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
work well BAM yeah that could have been

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.480 
work well BAM yeah that could have been
a<00:01:54.450> lot<00:01:54.569> worse<00:01:54.630> than<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.020> was

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
a lot worse than it was

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.539 
a lot worse than it was
ended<00:01:56.490> up<00:01:56.869> reloading<00:01:57.869> everything<00:01:58.200> back<00:01:58.350> on

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
ended up reloading everything back on

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.069 
ended up reloading everything back on
this<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> bit<00:02:00.000> more<00:02:00.179> of<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.360> jump<00:02:00.630> than<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.869> used

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
this is a bit more of a jump than I used

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.230 
this is a bit more of a jump than I used
last<00:02:01.409> week<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:02.039> was<00:02:02.579> planning<00:02:02.909> on<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.119> going

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
last week I was planning on just going

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.969 
last week I was planning on just going
ten<00:02:03.479> pounds<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.869> hand<00:02:04.079> every<00:02:04.319> week<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.710> doing

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
ten pounds a hand every week and doing

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.700 
ten pounds a hand every week and doing
kind<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.429> linear<00:02:05.579> progression<00:02:06.200> but<00:02:07.200> uh<00:02:07.259> I

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
kind of a linear progression but uh I

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.059 
kind of a linear progression but uh I
decided<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.789> throw<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.299> the<00:02:09.929> 25<00:02:10.319> today<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.920> see

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
decided to throw on the 25 today and see

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.640 
decided to throw on the 25 today and see
how<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.280> went<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.180> see<00:02:12.299> the<00:02:12.420> first<00:02:12.650> 150

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
how it went and you see the first 150

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.750 
how it went and you see the first 150
feet<00:02:13.890> are<00:02:15.019> not<00:02:16.019> bad<00:02:16.290> at<00:02:16.440> all<00:02:16.530> it's<00:02:17.069> pretty

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
feet are not bad at all it's pretty

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.339 
feet are not bad at all it's pretty
solid<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.299> momentum<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.810> then<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.019> hit<00:02:19.200> this

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
solid the momentum and then I hit this

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.670 
solid the momentum and then I hit this
turn<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:21.420> think<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.870> need<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.049> round<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.500> off

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
turn and I think I need to round it off

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.100 
turn and I think I need to round it off
more<00:02:23.010> because<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.790> just<00:02:24.000> slowed<00:02:24.840> me<00:02:24.959> down<00:02:24.989> I

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
more because it just slowed me down I

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.870 
more because it just slowed me down I
lost<00:02:25.380> all<00:02:25.560> my<00:02:25.650> momentum<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.640> started

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
lost all my momentum and I started

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.250 
lost all my momentum and I started
getting<00:02:27.000> lazy<00:02:27.269> my<00:02:27.510> core<00:02:27.720> started<00:02:28.049> going

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
getting lazy my core started going

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.850 
getting lazy my core started going
everything<00:02:29.569> bad<00:02:30.569> started<00:02:31.110> happening<00:02:31.410> after

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
everything bad started happening after

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.970 
everything bad started happening after
that<00:02:32.040> turn<00:02:32.989> and<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.170> see<00:02:34.319> my<00:02:34.440> shoulders<00:02:34.680> are

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
that turn and you see my shoulders are

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.839 
that turn and you see my shoulders are
dropping<00:02:35.190> forward<00:02:36.170> my<00:02:37.170> my<00:02:37.739> hips<00:02:38.010> are<00:02:38.250> starting

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
dropping forward my my hips are starting

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.789 
dropping forward my my hips are starting
to<00:02:39.030> go<00:02:39.299> side<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.569> side<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.049> then<00:02:40.380> I'm<00:02:40.739> just

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
to go side to side and then I'm just

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.699 
to go side to side and then I'm just
don't<00:02:41.099> have<00:02:41.250> as<00:02:41.400> much<00:02:41.549> of<00:02:41.609> a<00:02:41.790> core<00:02:42.000> support<00:02:42.389> and

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
don't have as much of a core support and

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.440 
don't have as much of a core support and
so<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:43.739> did<00:02:44.100> make<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.489> full<00:02:44.609> 300<00:02:45.150> feet

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
so I did make it the full 300 feet

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.240 
so I did make it the full 300 feet
without<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.810> drop<00:02:46.019> but<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.290> think<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:46.769> once

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
without the drop but I think that I once

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.280 
without the drop but I think that I once
I<00:02:47.370> get<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:47.639> turn<00:02:47.850> down<00:02:48.150> my<00:02:48.389> my<00:02:48.780> time<00:02:49.019> will<00:02:49.260> be

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
I get that turn down my my time will be

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.140 
I get that turn down my my time will be
a<00:02:49.380> lot<00:02:49.560> faster<00:02:49.590> I'll<00:02:50.010> be<00:02:50.130> able<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.310> move<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:51.030> lot

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
a lot faster I'll be able to move a lot

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.410 
a lot faster I'll be able to move a lot
more<00:02:51.299> effectively<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.650> with<00:02:52.799> less<00:02:53.069> energy

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
more effectively and with less energy

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.979 
more effectively and with less energy
back<00:02:54.420> over<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.959> some<00:02:55.709> more<00:02:55.859> log<00:02:56.100> work<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.840> put<00:02:57.840> on

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
back over to some more log work I put on

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.610 
back over to some more log work I put on
20<00:02:58.500> pounds<00:02:58.730> over<00:02:59.750> what<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.780> use<00:03:00.989> last<00:03:01.170> week<00:03:01.410> for

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
20 pounds over what I use last week for

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.090 
20 pounds over what I use last week for
my<00:03:01.739> 5<00:03:02.040> sets<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.400> 10<00:03:02.840> did<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.959> first<00:03:04.260> two<00:03:04.709> sets

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
my 5 sets of 10 did the first two sets

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.270 
my 5 sets of 10 did the first two sets
as<00:03:05.489> Viper<00:03:05.880> press<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:06.739> then<00:03:07.739> I<00:03:07.769> did<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.160> last

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
as Viper press and then I did the last

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.860 
as Viper press and then I did the last
three<00:03:08.609> sets<00:03:09.290> stopping<00:03:10.290> at<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.440> top<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.920> just

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
three sets stopping at the top and just

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.870 
three sets stopping at the top and just
doing<00:03:12.870> strict<00:03:13.290> overheads<00:03:13.709> with<00:03:13.889> it<00:03:14.069> so<00:03:14.760> this

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
doing strict overheads with it so this

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.319 
doing strict overheads with it so this
is<00:03:15.030> one<00:03:15.630> 10<00:03:15.989> log<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.440> believe<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.180> really<00:03:18.180> it's

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
is one 10 log I believe and really it's

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.470 
is one 10 log I believe and really it's
just<00:03:18.540> getting<00:03:18.750> easier<00:03:19.109> it's<00:03:20.090> these<00:03:21.090> sets<00:03:21.359> were

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
just getting easier it's these sets were

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.759 
just getting easier it's these sets were
easier<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:22.019> week<00:03:22.200> than<00:03:22.380> they<00:03:22.470> were<00:03:22.590> last

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
easier this week than they were last

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.839 
easier this week than they were last
week<00:03:24.560> my<00:03:25.560> conditioning<00:03:26.160> is<00:03:26.340> still<00:03:26.549> not<00:03:26.730> great

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
week my conditioning is still not great

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.240 
week my conditioning is still not great
but<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.269> getting<00:03:27.420> better<00:03:27.920> so<00:03:28.920> I'm<00:03:29.040> happy

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
but it is getting better so I'm happy

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.210 
but it is getting better so I'm happy
about<00:03:29.459> that<00:03:30.079> this<00:03:31.079> is<00:03:31.200> another<00:03:31.739> thing<00:03:31.980> today

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
about that this is another thing today

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.430 
about that this is another thing today
it<00:03:32.400> was<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.849> was<00:03:32.970> just<00:03:33.090> hard<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.329> do<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:34.139> was<00:03:34.200> hot

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
it was it was just hard to do it was hot

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.090 
it was it was just hard to do it was hot
out<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.889> was<00:03:35.040> 95<00:03:35.639> degrees<00:03:36.120> this<00:03:36.599> morning<00:03:36.660> and

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
out it was 95 degrees this morning and

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.890 
out it was 95 degrees this morning and
there<00:03:40.100> wasn't<00:03:40.370> any<00:03:40.670> shade<00:03:40.880> last<00:03:41.120> last<00:03:41.600> week<00:03:41.780> I

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
there wasn't any shade last last week I

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.570 
there wasn't any shade last last week I
had<00:03:42.050> a<00:03:42.080> little<00:03:42.230> bit<00:03:42.380> of<00:03:42.470> cloud<00:03:42.620> cover<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:43.190> so

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
had a little bit of cloud cover and so

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.300 
had a little bit of cloud cover and so
it<00:03:43.790> got<00:03:44.270> a<00:03:44.330> little<00:03:44.510> cooler<00:03:44.810> but<00:03:45.140> it<00:03:46.010> was<00:03:46.130> just

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
it got a little cooler but it was just

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.809 
it got a little cooler but it was just
hot<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.970> entire<00:03:47.270> session<00:03:47.750> out<00:03:47.870> here<00:03:48.610> so<00:03:49.610> hot

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
hot the entire session out here so hot

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.670 
hot the entire session out here so hot
in<00:03:49.970> fact<00:03:50.000> that<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:50.420> had<00:03:50.720> to<00:03:50.870> put<00:03:51.020> my<00:03:51.170> shirt<00:03:51.470> on

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
in fact that I had to put my shirt on

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.290 
in fact that I had to put my shirt on
the<00:03:51.770> middle<00:03:52.190> of<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:52.340> log<00:03:52.520> in<00:03:52.700> between<00:03:52.970> sets

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
the middle of the log in between sets

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.559 
the middle of the log in between sets
because<00:03:54.140> when<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.069> did<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.430> top<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:56.120> top<00:03:56.330> set

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
because when I did the top the top set

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.040 
because when I did the top the top set
at<00:03:56.870> 164<00:03:57.709> seven<00:03:58.130> reps<00:03:58.340> on<00:03:58.910> rep<00:03:59.300> five<00:03:59.569> or<00:03:59.780> six

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
at 164 seven reps on rep five or six
