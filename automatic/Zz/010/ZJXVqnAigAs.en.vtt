assume that hundreds or thousands of

why<00:00:42.960> was<00:00:43.200> Jason<00:00:43.710> Haines<00:00:44.010> called<00:00:44.370> out<00:00:44.520> by<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
why was Jason Haines called out by the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.770 
why was Jason Haines called out by the
FAA<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:46.920> think<00:00:47.039> Jason<00:00:47.610> was<00:00:47.940> probably<00:00:48.539> called

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
FAA so I think Jason was probably called

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.260 
FAA so I think Jason was probably called
out<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.200> he<00:00:49.680> was<00:00:49.860> flying<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.579> bit<00:00:50.789> unsafe

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
out because he was flying a bit unsafe

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.830 
out because he was flying a bit unsafe
he<00:00:52.260> was<00:00:52.350> fine<00:00:52.590> above<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.129> lot<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.399> people<00:00:53.840> and

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
he was fine above a lot of people and

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.959 
he was fine above a lot of people and
that<00:00:55.050> sort<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.379> thing<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.340> basically<00:00:56.670> what

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that sort of thing so basically what

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.180 
that sort of thing so basically what
happened<00:00:57.300> was<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.719> FAA<00:00:58.050> sent<00:00:58.469> him<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.920> letter

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
happened was the FAA sent him a letter

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.970 
happened was the FAA sent him a letter
from<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.820> safety<00:01:00.030> inspector<00:01:00.510> saying<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.739> his

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
from a safety inspector saying that his

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.060 
from a safety inspector saying that his
videos<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.609> been<00:01:02.730> monetized<00:01:03.270> which<00:01:03.719> is

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
videos have been monetized which is

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.679 
videos have been monetized which is
illegal<00:01:05.070> according<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> FAA<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.540> can

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
illegal according to the FAA you can

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.570 
illegal according to the FAA you can
kind<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.960> get<00:01:07.140> into<00:01:07.409> semantics<00:01:07.979> there<00:01:08.220> about

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
kind of get into semantics there about

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.950 
kind of get into semantics there about
whether<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.909> quote<00:01:09.210> would<00:01:09.330> agree<00:01:09.540> with<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.659> or

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
whether a quote would agree with that or

whether a quote would agree with that or
not<00:01:09.990> whether<00:01:10.409> there<00:01:10.680> are<00:01:10.710> actually

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
not whether there are actually

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.490 
not whether there are actually
regulations<00:01:11.700> but<00:01:12.090> what<00:01:12.689> happened<00:01:13.110> was<00:01:13.290> they

you<00:01:16.229> can't<00:01:16.439> do<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:18.270> he<00:01:18.780> says<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.439> he

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
you can't do this so he says that he

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.230

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.420 
posting these videos on youtube do you
think<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.780> FAA<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.409> essentially<00:01:26.009> using

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
think that the FAA is essentially using

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.130 
think that the FAA is essentially using
a<00:01:26.549> loophole<00:01:26.790> or<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.330> mean<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.600> there<00:01:27.810> letter

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
a loophole or I mean that there letter

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.920 
a loophole or I mean that there letter
seemed<00:01:28.500> pretty<00:01:28.880> clear<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:30.659> took<00:01:30.869> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
seemed pretty clear like we took a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.420 
seemed pretty clear like we took a
serious<00:01:31.290> look<00:01:31.380> at<00:01:31.470> your<00:01:31.619> website<00:01:31.799> there's

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
serious look at your website there's

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.120 
serious look at your website there's
advertising<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:34.170> feel<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:34.950> is

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
advertising on it we feel that this is

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.950 
advertising on it we feel that this is
commercial<00:01:35.400> do<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.390> think<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.659> that's<00:01:36.840> a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
commercial do you think that that's a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.539 
commercial do you think that that's a
ruse<00:01:37.229> or<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.770> think<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.009> they<00:01:38.189> really

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
ruse or do you think that they really

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.060 
ruse or do you think that they really
are<00:01:38.729> trying<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.180> keep<00:01:39.329> people<00:01:39.540> from<00:01:40.070> flying

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
are trying to keep people from flying

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.800 
are trying to keep people from flying
under<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.729> radar<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.329> speak<00:01:42.630> with

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
under the radar so to speak with

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.710 
under the radar so to speak with
commercial<00:01:43.259> operations<00:01:44.149> right<00:01:45.149> that's<00:01:45.570> why

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
commercial operations right that's why

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.990 
commercial operations right that's why
this<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.229> problematic<00:01:46.549> it's<00:01:47.549> been<00:01:47.790> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
this is so problematic it's been a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.359 
this is so problematic it's been a
smokescreen<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:49.200> idea<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.740> commercial

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
smokescreen this idea of commercial

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.090 
smokescreen this idea of commercial

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
of certain videos so I think that's why

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
I kind of struck a chord with a lot of

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.070 
I kind of struck a chord with a lot of
people<00:02:32.120> settle<00:02:33.120> on<00:02:33.210> a<00:02:33.240> report<00:02:33.600> any<00:02:33.750> sign<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
people settle on a report any sign the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.650 
people settle on a report any sign the
FAA<00:02:34.440> saying<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:34.950> have<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.250> take<00:02:35.460> down<00:02:35.660> videos

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
FAA saying you have to take down videos

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.690 
FAA saying you have to take down videos
on<00:02:36.900> YouTube<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.710> sort<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:37.980> thing<00:02:38.190> that's

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
on YouTube and that sort of thing that's

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.750 
on YouTube and that sort of thing that's
not<00:02:38.880> what's<00:02:39.060> happening<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:39.600> it's<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.200> think

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
not what's happening it's it's I think

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.150 
not what's happening it's it's I think
maybe<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.910> mistake<00:02:42.360> by<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.900> FAA<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.440> go<00:02:43.920> after

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
maybe a mistake by the FAA to go after

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.610 
maybe a mistake by the FAA to go after
this<00:02:44.550> guy<00:02:44.730> because<00:02:45.240> there<00:02:45.510> are<00:02:45.570> such<00:02:45.750> huge

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
this guy because there are such huge

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.040 
this guy because there are such huge
implications<00:02:47.310> but<00:02:47.610> they<00:02:48.450> should<00:02:48.660> have<00:02:48.690> if<00:02:48.900> it

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
implications but they should have if it

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.390 
implications but they should have if it
was<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.170> safety<00:02:49.440> concern<00:02:49.890> they<00:02:50.100> should<00:02:50.280> have

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
was a safety concern they should have

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.880 
was a safety concern they should have
made<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:50.610> clear<00:02:50.820> from<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.450> get-go<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.620> not

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
made that clear from the get-go and not

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.440 
made that clear from the get-go and not
mention<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.430> commercial<00:02:53.850> use<00:02:54.030> whatsoever

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
mention the commercial use whatsoever

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.630 
mention the commercial use whatsoever
now<00:02:55.050> you<00:02:55.110> talk<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.620> FAA<00:02:55.920> what<00:02:56.430> do<00:02:56.520> they

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
now you talk to the FAA what do they

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.380 
now you talk to the FAA what do they
tell<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:57.920> so<00:02:58.920> it's<00:02:59.040> very<00:02:59.130> hard<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.520> get<00:02:59.730> clear

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
tell you so it's very hard to get clear

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.020 
tell you so it's very hard to get clear
answers<00:03:00.630> from<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.110> FAA<00:03:01.380> but<00:03:02.030> surprisingly

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
answers from the FAA but surprisingly

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.220 
answers from the FAA but surprisingly
this<00:03:03.300> time<00:03:03.540> they<00:03:03.750> said<00:03:03.930> they're<00:03:04.110> gonna

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
this time they said they're gonna

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.870 
this time they said they're gonna
investigate<00:03:04.740> it<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.370> their<00:03:05.550> DC

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
investigate it that their DC

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.000 
investigate it that their DC
headquarters<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.720> with<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.709> kind<00:03:07.950> of

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
headquarters and with that kind of

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.449 
headquarters and with that kind of
signals<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.610> me<00:03:08.760> I'm<00:03:09.090> certainly<00:03:10.459> speculating

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
signals to me I'm certainly speculating

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.100 
signals to me I'm certainly speculating
here<00:03:11.610> but<00:03:11.820> I've<00:03:11.940> dealt<00:03:12.180> with<00:03:12.300> them<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.570> lot<00:03:12.780> and

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
here but I've dealt with them a lot and

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.920 
here but I've dealt with them a lot and
usually<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:14.160> answer<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.550> no<00:03:14.730> comment<00:03:15.180> we

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
usually the answer is no comment we

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.420 
usually the answer is no comment we
don't<00:03:16.050> want<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.230> talk<00:03:16.350> about<00:03:16.500> it

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
don't want to talk about it

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.370 
don't want to talk about it
the<00:03:17.760> answer<00:03:18.000> here<00:03:18.180> was<00:03:18.420> we're<00:03:18.780> investigating

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
the answer here was we're investigating

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.800 
the answer here was we're investigating
which<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:19.920> think<00:03:20.340> what<00:03:20.820> may<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.209> happened<00:03:21.239> was

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
which I think what may have happened was

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.640 
which I think what may have happened was
a<00:03:21.840> regional<00:03:22.560> safety<00:03:23.010> inspector<00:03:24.350> basically<00:03:25.350> I

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
a regional safety inspector basically I

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.830 
a regional safety inspector basically I
don't<00:03:26.370> wanna<00:03:26.550> say<00:03:26.700> overstepped<00:03:27.239> his<00:03:27.390> bounds

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
don't wanna say overstepped his bounds

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.620 
don't wanna say overstepped his bounds
but<00:03:27.989> perhaps<00:03:28.430> used<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.640> wrong<00:03:29.820> language<00:03:30.090> and

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
but perhaps used the wrong language and

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.930 
but perhaps used the wrong language and
in<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.410> letter<00:03:31.620> here<00:03:31.950> saying<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.459> know<00:03:32.700> there's

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
in a letter here saying you know there's

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.720 
in a letter here saying you know there's
commercial<00:03:33.680> concern<00:03:34.680> with<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.190> posting<00:03:35.610> on

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
commercial concern with you posting on

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.470 
commercial concern with you posting on
YouTube<00:03:37.220> which<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:39.090> know<00:03:39.209> as<00:03:39.330> I<00:03:39.450> mentioned

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
YouTube which you know as I mentioned

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.570 
YouTube which you know as I mentioned
you<00:03:40.019> can<00:03:40.200> that<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.790> thousands<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:41.850> other<00:03:42.030> people

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
you can that I thousands of other people

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.220 
you can that I thousands of other people
so<00:03:44.580> I<00:03:44.610> think<00:03:44.760> they're<00:03:45.600> gonna<00:03:45.720> look<00:03:45.900> into<00:03:46.080> it

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
so I think they're gonna look into it

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.690 
so I think they're gonna look into it

process<00:05:43.589> very<00:05:44.189> kind<00:05:45.000> of<00:05:45.800> frustrating<00:05:46.800> one<00:05:46.979> for

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
process very kind of frustrating one for

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.459 
process very kind of frustrating one for
the<00:05:47.789> FAA<00:05:48.089> because<00:05:48.389> there<00:05:48.839> was<00:05:48.960> a<00:05:48.990> period<00:05:49.349> there

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:49.469 
the FAA because there was a period there

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:51.740 
the FAA because there was a period there
where<00:05:49.860> a<00:05:50.189> precedent<00:05:50.969> was<00:05:51.089> that<00:05:51.330> where<00:05:51.539> all

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
where a precedent was that where all

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.559 
where a precedent was that where all
commercial<00:05:52.259> flights<00:05:52.529> were<00:05:52.740> legal<00:05:53.129> that<00:05:53.729> they

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
commercial flights were legal that they

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.050 
commercial flights were legal that they
didn't<00:05:54.810> really<00:05:55.139> enjoy<00:05:55.460> but<00:05:56.460> I<00:05:56.490> wouldn't

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
didn't really enjoy but I wouldn't

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.209 
didn't really enjoy but I wouldn't
expect<00:05:57.149> them<00:05:57.449> to<00:05:57.509> to<00:05:58.020> proceed<00:05:58.620> here<00:05:58.860> because

00:05:59.209 --> 00:05:59.219 
expect them to to proceed here because

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:01.579 
expect them to to proceed here because
as<00:06:00.029> I<00:06:00.210> mentioned<00:06:00.240> there's<00:06:00.779> serious<00:06:01.289> First

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:01.589 
as I mentioned there's serious First

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:03.769 
as I mentioned there's serious First
Amendment<00:06:02.069> implications<00:06:02.699> and<00:06:03.330> I<00:06:03.419> think<00:06:03.659> it's

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:03.779 
Amendment implications and I think it's

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:09.020 
Amendment implications and I think it's
a<00:06:03.870> fight<00:06:04.110> the<00:06:04.289> FAA<00:06:04.589> doesn't<00:06:04.949> want<00:06:05.370> to<00:06:06.020> fight
