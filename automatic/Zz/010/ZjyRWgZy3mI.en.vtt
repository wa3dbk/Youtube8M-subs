hey guys game geek here and in this
video<00:00:01.890> I'm<00:00:02.100> going<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.250> show<00:00:02.429> you<00:00:02.490> how<00:00:02.610> ghost

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
works in black ops 2 now the reason I'm

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.340 
works in black ops 2 now the reason I'm
doing<00:00:05.430> this<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:05.910> because<00:00:06.120> ghost<00:00:06.509> doesn't<00:00:07.080> work

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
doing this is because ghost doesn't work

doing this is because ghost doesn't work
the<00:00:07.710> way<00:00:07.740> it<00:00:07.950> did<00:00:08.069> in<00:00:08.130> black<00:00:08.400> ops<00:00:08.610> 1<00:00:08.670> it<00:00:09.030> isn't

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
the way it did in black ops 1 it isn't

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.390 
the way it did in black ops 1 it isn't

requirement<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.760> start<00:01:05.760> becoming<00:01:06.110> invisible

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
requirement I start becoming invisible

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.410 
requirement I start becoming invisible
Leo<00:01:07.470> I'm<00:01:07.680> completely<00:01:08.070> invisible<00:01:08.360> now<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
Leo I'm completely invisible now the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.120 
Leo I'm completely invisible now the
problem<00:01:09.689> with<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.200> could<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.950> standing

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
problem with this is I could be standing

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.480 
problem with this is I could be standing
here<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:12.330> back<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.110> forward<00:01:13.560> kind<00:01:14.400> of

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
here and going back and forward kind of

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.070 
here and going back and forward kind of
back<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.939> forth<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.240> bit<00:01:15.570> better<00:01:15.720> than<00:01:15.990> I'm

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
back and forth a bit better than I'm

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.690 
back and forth a bit better than I'm
doing<00:01:16.110> right<00:01:16.380> here<00:01:16.409> if<00:01:17.070> I'm<00:01:17.189> going<00:01:17.400> back<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
doing right here if I'm going back and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.770 
doing right here if I'm going back and
forward<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.060> moving<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.390> little<00:01:18.540> bit<00:01:18.630> like

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
forward and moving a little bit like

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.600 
forward and moving a little bit like
that<00:01:18.869> as<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.049> can<00:01:19.080> see<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.259> go<00:01:19.380> invisible<00:01:20.159> full

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
that as you can see I go invisible full

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.590 
that as you can see I go invisible full
up<00:01:20.700> at<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.880> time<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> could<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:21.390> moving

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
up at the time so I could be moving

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.940 
up at the time so I could be moving
around<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.200> see<00:01:22.290> here<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.590> circle

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
around as you can see here in a circle

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.620 
around as you can see here in a circle
run<00:01:23.520> around<00:01:23.820> around<00:01:24.060> around<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.540> then

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
run around around around and then

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.320 
run around around around and then
visible<00:01:25.080> no<00:01:25.170> one<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.560> me<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.250> yeah<00:01:26.850> theory

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
visible no one can see me so yeah theory

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.490 
visible no one can see me so yeah theory
if<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.509> keep<00:01:27.750> moving<00:01:27.960> around<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.880> get

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
if you keep moving around you can get

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.990 
if you keep moving around you can get
invisible<00:01:31.500> invisibility<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> time

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
invisible invisibility on all the time

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.999 
invisible invisibility on all the time
so<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.390> yeah<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.930> little<00:01:34.079> little

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
so it yeah it's a little little

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.069 
so it yeah it's a little little
imperfect<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.150> know<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.750> pretty<00:01:36.960> much

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
imperfect but you know it pretty much

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.210 
imperfect but you know it pretty much
works<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.619> was<00:01:37.740> sitting<00:01:37.979> here<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.159> this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
works if I was sitting here in this

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.859 
works if I was sitting here in this
corner<00:01:38.400> right<00:01:38.579> here<00:01:38.659> you<00:01:39.659> know<00:01:39.720> I'm

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
corner right here you know I'm

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.210 
corner right here you know I'm
everyone's<00:01:40.350> gonna<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.530> able<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.770> see<00:01:40.890> me<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
everyone's gonna be able to see me and

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.310 
everyone's gonna be able to see me and
take<00:01:41.640> me<00:01:41.729> out<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.119> there<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:42.750> go<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:42.990> I'm<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
take me out so there we go if I'm on the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.649 
take me out so there we go if I'm on the
floor<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.740> here<00:01:44.090> final<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> floor

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
floor but here final one on the floor

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.420 
floor but here final one on the floor
crawling<00:01:46.110> right<00:01:46.380> along<00:01:46.560> here<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.920> still

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
crawling right along here and still

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.520 
crawling right along here and still
visible<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.970> don't<00:01:48.810> think<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.290> actually

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
visible I don't think you can actually

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.170 
visible I don't think you can actually
get<00:01:49.860> invisible<00:01:50.280> by<00:01:50.549> crawling<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> floor

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
get invisible by crawling on the floor

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.630 
get invisible by crawling on the floor
nah<00:01:52.140> number<00:01:52.680> looks<00:01:52.770> about<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.399> full

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
nah number looks about this is like full

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.120 
nah number looks about this is like full
speed<00:01:53.909> right<00:01:53.939> now<00:01:54.320> is<00:01:55.320> usually<00:01:55.649> they<00:01:55.920> must

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
speed right now is usually they must

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.880 
speed right now is usually they must
have<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.670> game<00:01:56.820> program<00:01:57.299> code<00:01:58.049> that

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
have it in the game program code that

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.770 
have it in the game program code that
you<00:01:59.310> know<00:01:59.399> if<00:01:59.640> you're<00:01:59.969> not<00:02:00.090> equal<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.630> this

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
you know if you're not equal in this

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.230 
you know if you're not equal in this
speed<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.590> know<00:02:01.710> show<00:02:02.009> visible<00:02:02.369> once

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
speed then you know show visible once

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.020 
speed then you know show visible once
you<00:02:03.390> over<00:02:03.689> go<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:04.079> speed<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.740> then<00:02:05.640> show

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you over go this speed and then show

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.960 
you over go this speed and then show
invisible<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:07.229> there<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.409> go<00:02:07.610> that's<00:02:08.610> it's
