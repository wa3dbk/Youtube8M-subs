I start playing on the corner so every
corner<00:04:22.600> see<00:04:23.600> there<00:04:23.750> should<00:04:23.900> be<00:04:23.990> a<00:04:24.020> little<00:04:24.169> bit

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
corner see there should be a little bit

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.969 
corner see there should be a little bit
higher<00:04:24.590> than<00:04:24.979> the<00:04:25.160> middle<00:04:25.490> part<00:04:26.979> because

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
higher than the middle part because

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.100 
higher than the middle part because
after<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.729> I'm<00:04:29.150> gonna<00:04:29.300> put<00:04:29.510> their<00:04:29.660> outputs

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
after that I'm gonna put their outputs

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.170 
after that I'm gonna put their outputs
in<00:04:30.229> the<00:04:30.320> middle<00:04:30.590> and<00:04:31.280> I'm<00:04:31.460> gonna<00:04:31.550> have<00:04:31.880> to<00:04:32.060> go

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
in the middle and I'm gonna have to go

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.620 
in the middle and I'm gonna have to go
on<00:04:32.449> the<00:04:32.570> corners<00:04:32.900> now<00:04:34.150> for<00:04:35.150> me<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.360> middle

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
on the corners now for me the middle

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.590 
on the corners now for me the middle
part<00:04:35.900> should<00:04:36.199> be<00:04:36.229> this<00:04:36.949> much<00:04:37.250> not<00:04:38.120> much<00:04:38.150> of

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
part should be this much not much of

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.580 
part should be this much not much of
your<00:04:38.720> finger<00:04:39.080> so<00:04:40.039> that<00:04:40.280> it<00:04:40.460> doesn't<00:04:41.229> not<00:04:42.229> truth

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
your finger so that it doesn't not truth

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.279 
your finger so that it doesn't not truth

we're going to use the juice after once
it's<00:04:55.130> covered<00:04:55.370> look<00:04:56.240> at<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.479> apples

everywhere here

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.830 
everywhere here
so<00:04:58.490> we<00:04:58.610> squash<00:04:58.910> them<00:04:59.090> a<00:04:59.180> little<00:04:59.389> bit<00:04:59.539> but<00:04:59.720> make

so we squash them a little bit but make

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.920 
so we squash them a little bit but make

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
sure the corners they have a space in

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.650 
sure the corners they have a space in
the<00:05:03.260> corner<00:05:03.850> you<00:05:04.850> want<00:05:05.000> to<00:05:05.060> get<00:05:05.150> a<00:05:05.180> little<00:05:05.449> bit

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
the corner you want to get a little bit

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.659 
the corner you want to get a little bit
of<00:05:05.720> juice<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.199> just<00:05:06.380> cool<00:05:06.650> and<00:05:06.979> put<00:05:07.280> it<00:05:07.370> on<00:05:07.460> top

of juice and just cool and put it on top

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.129 
of juice and just cool and put it on top
everywhere<00:05:08.150> this<00:05:08.270> would<00:05:08.479> give<00:05:08.720> an<00:05:08.870> extra

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
everywhere this would give an extra

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.710 
everywhere this would give an extra
taste<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.889> Apple<00:05:10.220> but<00:05:10.669> not<00:05:10.880> too<00:05:11.120> much<00:05:11.300> or<00:05:11.600> the
