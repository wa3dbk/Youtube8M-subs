00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
their aggressiveness sounds like you

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.669 
their aggressiveness sounds like you
have<00:00:14.089> opinion<00:00:14.540> with<00:00:14.660> that<00:00:14.809> question<00:00:15.200> so<00:00:15.440> I

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
have opinion with that question so I

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.560 
have opinion with that question so I

would agree with you we think we got
work<00:00:17.840> to<00:00:17.869> do<00:00:19.689> was<00:00:20.689> not<00:00:20.960> an<00:00:21.140> inspiring

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
work to do was not an inspiring

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.979 
work to do was not an inspiring
performance<00:00:22.090> for<00:00:23.090> whatever<00:00:23.390> reason<00:00:25.989> the

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:26.989 
performance for whatever reason the

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:28.810 
performance for whatever reason the
stats<00:00:27.349> that<00:00:27.590> I<00:00:27.649> looked<00:00:28.009> at<00:00:28.189> I<00:00:28.219> don't<00:00:28.399> look<00:00:28.669> at

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
stats that I looked at I don't look at

stats that I looked at I don't look at
stats<00:00:29.090> much<00:00:29.419> but<00:00:30.610> wasn't<00:00:31.610> pretty<00:00:33.700> split<00:00:34.700> the

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
stats much but wasn't pretty split the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.660 
stats much but wasn't pretty split the
ranked<00:00:35.149> matches<00:00:35.390> and<00:00:36.020> a<00:00:36.170> lot<00:00:36.860> of<00:00:36.890> zero<00:00:37.219> zeros

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670
