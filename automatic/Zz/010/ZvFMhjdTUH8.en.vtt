pureed<00:01:45.719> cauliflower<00:01:46.719> I<00:01:47.439> think<00:01:47.979> that's<00:01:48.130> not

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
pureed cauliflower I think that's not

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.529 
pureed cauliflower I think that's not
really<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:48.490> idea<00:01:48.759> that<00:01:49.000> I'm<00:01:49.090> going<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.359> charge

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
really the idea that I'm going to charge

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.929 
really the idea that I'm going to charge
our<00:01:49.719> kids<00:01:50.020> because<00:01:50.439> our<00:01:50.770> older<00:01:51.069> son<00:01:51.310> is<00:01:51.340> really

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
our kids because our older son is really

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.279 
our kids because our older son is really
thinking<00:01:52.179> about<00:01:52.240> vegetables<00:01:52.899> I<00:01:53.020> think<00:01:53.200> he

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
thinking about vegetables I think he

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.910 
thinking about vegetables I think he
gets<00:01:53.409> it<00:01:53.590> for<00:01:53.740> me

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
gets it for me

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.190 
gets it for me
but<00:01:54.280> maybe<00:01:55.030> I<00:01:55.119> should<00:01:55.329> puree<00:01:55.599> some<00:01:55.719> for<00:01:56.079> myself

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
but maybe I should puree some for myself

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.309 
but maybe I should puree some for myself
too<00:01:57.060> all<00:01:58.060> right<00:01:58.209> so<00:01:58.390> we're<00:01:58.509> adding<00:01:58.659> our<00:01:58.929> banana

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
too all right so we're adding our banana

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.770 
too all right so we're adding our banana
puree<00:01:59.649> I<00:02:00.069> mean<00:02:00.250> I'm<00:02:00.429> just<00:02:00.520> 1<00:02:00.969> and<00:02:01.390> see<00:02:01.569> what<00:02:01.689> the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
puree I mean I'm just 1 and see what the

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.139 
puree I mean I'm just 1 and see what the
consistency<00:02:02.469> is<00:02:02.560> like<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:03.489> might<00:02:04.000> have

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
consistency is like and might have

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.990 
consistency is like and might have
another<00:02:04.709> to<00:02:05.709> get<00:02:06.099> some<00:02:06.280> more<00:02:06.369> nutrients<00:02:06.909> in

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
another to get some more nutrients in

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.690 
another to get some more nutrients in
there<00:02:07.209> so<00:02:07.689> I<00:02:07.750> could<00:02:07.929> see<00:02:07.959> that<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:09.160> banana

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
there so I could see that the banana

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.150 
there so I could see that the banana
puree<00:02:10.179> is<00:02:10.539> sitting<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.440> little<00:02:11.650> bit<00:02:11.739> on<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.950> top

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
puree is sitting a little bit on the top

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.330 
puree is sitting a little bit on the top

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.559 
I might've put the dry ingredients on
top<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.519> wet<00:02:24.670> ingredients<00:02:24.849> I'll<00:02:25.359> try<00:02:25.510> it

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
top of the wet ingredients I'll try it

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:32.949 
top of the wet ingredients I'll try it
out<00:02:25.690> next<00:02:25.870> time

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959

added<00:03:30.019> to<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.200> pancakes<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.739> thought<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.040> kids

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
added to the pancakes I thought the kids

added to the pancakes I thought the kids
even<00:03:31.519> realizing<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.690> you're<00:03:32.840> using<00:03:32.989> whole

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
even realizing it and you're using whole

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.470 
even realizing it and you're using whole
wheat<00:03:33.980> flour<00:03:34.129> in<00:03:34.580> these<00:03:34.790> so<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:35.150> adds

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
wheat flour in these so that adds

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.330 
wheat flour in these so that adds
another<00:03:35.599> level<00:03:36.290> of<00:03:36.560> healthiness<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:37.250> the
