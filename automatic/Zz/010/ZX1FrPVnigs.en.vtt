different<00:00:02.550> dresses<00:00:03.270> and<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.840> reason<00:00:04.140> I<00:00:04.200> want

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
different dresses and the reason I want

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.630 
different dresses and the reason I want

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
to show you these dresses is because

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.509 
to show you these dresses is because
they're<00:00:05.819> more<00:00:06.089> like<00:00:07.080> unlikely<00:00:07.859> dresses<00:00:08.280> that

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
they're more like unlikely dresses that

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.220 
they're more like unlikely dresses that
maybe<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:09.059> average<00:00:09.179> person<00:00:09.719> wouldn't<00:00:10.139> even

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
maybe the average person wouldn't even

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.830 
maybe the average person wouldn't even
look<00:00:10.469> twice<00:00:10.710> at<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:12.059> found<00:00:12.450> both<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.750> these

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
look twice at and I found both of these

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.070 
look twice at and I found both of these
dresses<00:00:13.230> on<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.410> sale<00:00:13.920> racks<00:00:14.480> but<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.690> really

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
dresses on the sale racks but I really

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.910 
dresses on the sale racks but I really
don't<00:00:16.170> think<00:00:16.260> they<00:00:16.470> should<00:00:16.650> have<00:00:16.740> been<00:00:16.859> there

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
don't think they should have been there

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.670 
don't think they should have been there
because<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.369> think<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:18.170> they're<00:00:19.170> really<00:00:19.470> cute

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
because I think that they're really cute

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.000 
because I think that they're really cute
dresses<00:00:19.890> but<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.850> did<00:00:21.060> get<00:00:21.210> them<00:00:21.390> both<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:22.529> couple

dresses but I did get them both a couple

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.560 
dresses but I did get them both a couple
sizes<00:00:23.220> too<00:00:23.519> big<00:00:23.550> because<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.150> was<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> last

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
sizes too big because it was the last

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.740 
sizes too big because it was the last
one<00:00:24.900> but<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.500> just<00:00:25.560> had<00:00:25.890> them<00:00:26.039> tailored<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.060> it

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
one but I just had them tailored so it

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.150 
one but I just had them tailored so it
always<00:00:27.930> works<00:00:28.230> out<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> lot<00:00:28.920> cheaper

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
and then fitting my body better than my

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.959 
and then fitting my body better than my
actual<00:00:31.500> size<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.250> store<00:00:32.520> would<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:32.730> been

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.809 
a size 14 which is I don't wear a size
14<00:04:11.879> so<00:04:12.689> I<00:04:12.719> had<00:04:13.109> it<00:04:13.260> tailored<00:04:13.889> down<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.430> my<00:04:14.549> size

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
14 so I had it tailored down to my size

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.080 
14 so I had it tailored down to my size
and<00:04:15.269> I<00:04:16.229> think<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.739> was<00:04:16.889> honestly<00:04:17.310> originally

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
and I think it was honestly originally

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.659 
and I think it was honestly originally
like<00:04:18.209> over<00:04:18.509> $100<00:04:19.109> I<00:04:19.169> think<00:04:19.259> got<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.590> for<00:04:19.739> 10<00:04:19.889> so

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
like over $100 I think got it for 10 so

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.820 
like over $100 I think got it for 10 so
I<00:04:20.699> also<00:04:21.060> had<00:04:21.299> it<00:04:21.329> shortened<00:04:21.810> too<00:04:22.049> because<00:04:22.530> it

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
I also had it shortened too because it

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.589 
I also had it shortened too because it
was<00:04:22.860> very<00:04:23.190> Banana<00:04:23.729> Republic<00:04:23.820> is<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.240> lot<00:04:24.449> more

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
was very Banana Republic is a lot more

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:25.870 
was very Banana Republic is a lot more
conservative<00:04:24.900> than<00:04:25.320> I<00:04:25.410> like<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.680> dress

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
conservative than I like to dress

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.990 
conservative than I like to dress
sometimes<00:04:26.880> so<00:04:27.419> I<00:04:27.449> had<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:27.660> shortened<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:28.229> a

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
sometimes so I had it shortened and a

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.159
