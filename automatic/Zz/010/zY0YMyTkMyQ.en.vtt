I felt a gust of wind and saw a quick
flash<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.970> blue<00:02:54.209> go<00:02:54.450> by<00:02:54.659> that<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.709> only<00:02:55.860> know

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
flash of blue go by that is only know

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.750 
flash of blue go by that is only know
that<00:02:56.819> it's<00:02:57.450> actually<00:02:57.900> great<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.980> can<00:02:59.159> go<00:02:59.459> I

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
that it's actually great you can go I

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.690 
that it's actually great you can go I

so<00:03:20.549> by<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.790> time<00:03:21.060> you'd<00:03:21.209> have<00:03:21.329> registered

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
so by the time you'd have registered

going ten times the speed of sound would

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.770 
going ten times the speed of sound would

him the air around him would be

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.039 
him the air around him would be
compressed<00:03:35.669> five<00:03:35.910> point<00:03:36.269> seven<00:03:36.450> times<00:03:36.840> and

compressed five point seven times and

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.449 
compressed five point seven times and

would heat up to seven hundred and

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.550 
would heat up to seven hundred and
fifty-two<00:03:38.970> degrees<00:03:39.090> Fahrenheit<00:03:39.930> almost

fifty-two degrees Fahrenheit almost
three<00:03:40.769> times<00:03:40.919> the<00:03:41.190> boiling<00:03:41.579> point<00:03:41.880> of<00:03:42.060> blood

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
three times the boiling point of blood

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.599 
three times the boiling point of blood
speaking<00:03:43.410> of<00:03:43.530> blood<00:03:43.769> at<00:03:43.980> that<00:03:44.010> temperature

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
speaking of blood at that temperature

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.789 
speaking of blood at that temperature
your<00:03:44.819> blood<00:03:45.120> would<00:03:45.299> become<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:46.019> supercritical

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
your blood would become a supercritical

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.949 
your blood would become a supercritical
fluid<00:03:46.859> having<00:03:47.579> properties<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.359> both<00:03:48.510> liquid

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
fluid having properties of both liquid

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.129 
fluid having properties of both liquid
and<00:03:49.129> gas<00:03:50.129> and<00:03:50.639> it<00:03:50.790> would<00:03:50.940> start<00:03:51.269> to<00:03:51.329> ooze<00:03:51.599> out

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
and gas and it would start to ooze out

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.309 
and gas and it would start to ooze out
of<00:03:52.560> your<00:03:52.919> body<00:03:53.700> now<00:03:54.389> this<00:03:54.629> would<00:03:54.780> only<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:55.049> curve

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
of your body now this would only a curve
