00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.420
 nice that you are back, yes me 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.100
 I thought I'll show you today 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.930
 how her face could hers 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.340
 can that be like your face 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.050
 make a little narrower makeup or 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.849
 a high brow a bit obscure 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.160
 nose a bit narrower and that can 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.250
 to make a very nice make up with 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.380
 dark and bright so the dark 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.750
 goes back as for example 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.910
 want to emphasize in the bones and everything 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.379
 something bright is coming forward, for example 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.679
 the eyes when you look under the eyes of the 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.760
 bright she makes these early chances 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.260
 I'll show you this now 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.859
 Step by step is not like that 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.839
 heavy 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.940
 and I hope everything works fine 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.719
 with the light and I wish you all 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.719
 have fun and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.070
 the rest with the account are also involved 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.010
 the shadow of the face needs it 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.780
 her a dark brown max over her 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.390
 can also use a cruel for it 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.490
 But there are also special kids such 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.800
 contours kids if you all that 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.869
 you can not have it at home 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.090
 just a brown nato eyeshadow 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.790
 I use and now I take too 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.619
 I always take one for contouring 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.710
 big brother blouses and skirts in the 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.150
 middle something together 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.550
 then I go with the tip in school 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:35.680
 rhine and take something of the colors 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.720
 you wear it below the cheekbone 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.750
 on the exact spot you see the best 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.979
 if you just wang hao even 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.570
 fresh so it's nice to associate with it 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.800
 looks pretty natural and you do not 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.800
 just another one with a new one 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.539
 I connect the whole face 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.690
 still to the sleeps and the child 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.690
 down 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.470
 So listen , you can remember 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.310
 simply to chauffeur a 3, so to speak 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.310
 to draw 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.299
 Hanover 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.299
 No 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.550
 I am free 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:28.120
 at 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:30.640
 so the choice are by shading 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.680
 Do years and years more if you are 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.020
 For example, you could have a high brow 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.090
 you also walk a little for this 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.620
 just wear the dark brown color 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.620
 something on the hairline 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.010
 You can narrow your nose too 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.840
 work best with very little 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.560
 start color and then gradually 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:06.040
 continue building paint for this you can 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.390
 use your eyeshadow brush and 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.620
 then with this just beside the 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.620
 nose bridge driving along 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.930
 lotte 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.690
 motto 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.810
 what we can do is yours 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.890
 face hey still direct your look 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.200
 to give more freshness 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.390
 in addition bright fair brother and 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.230
 this color sets you above the 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.230
 cheekbones 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.530
 because at this point the light hits 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.670
 on the face and then that reflects 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.670
 whole especially nice 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.780
 the 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.900
 that has even a bit out 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.269
 because everything that is bright will definitely get you 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.850
 the game forward and everything we do 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.709
 shading is reset and on 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.519
 the cheeks I think you may like one 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.519
 shimmer and shine a bit 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.220
 for the last freshness you can still 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.410
 rouge order that you carry on the 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.229
 middle of the apple wÃ¶rtchens on the 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.630
 means when your smile starts on the 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.020
 highest point and it dazzles 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.020
 Outside 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.360
 always smiling, I forget that 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.010
 makes it easier 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.970
 not only when swimming but 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.970
 generally lived 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.970

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.160
 and that's it 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.600
