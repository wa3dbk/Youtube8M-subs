00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 by now I think I would have said all that 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.609
 what was there to say except the thing more 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.970
 important 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.769
 but first let's make a summary if one 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.799
 night watchman in a pizzeria with gods 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.650
 robots trying to kill you 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.779
 but you practically don't quit the first one 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.699
 with more nasty stuff like this 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.580
 this is it but because it must be there 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.539
 always the fan and we arrive now 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.279
 it seems that this is the chapter 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.590
 conclusive of the series that has known 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.420
 fascinate all but for once 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.059
 instead of telling you more things 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.610
 secret of this game i will talk about it 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.399
 which has always been under everyone's nose 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.780
 but that didn't notice anybody anyway 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.120
 first of all, have you ever wondered why? 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.800
 this success so sudden because 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.510
 millions of fans are so much 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.559
 fond of this game, 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.559
 affectionate not in the sense 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.620
 but fond of it to the point of creating not 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.320
 just a fan art jersey of those 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.820
 dinners are a mess but even 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.409
 short films shot in a non-fashion 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.100
 certainly amateur 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.260
 you know why the answer is innovation 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.630
 let me explain better what you think about di Vico 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.520
 guy shooter with a rifle in 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.759
 hand that shoots anything you do 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.580
 moves and also to anything that does not 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.009
 move what you think if I tell you play 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.560
 action to a cool guy who does the 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.600
 ass everyone and invariably his 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.640
 parkour and if instead I tell you the game 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.070
 horror we go before getting me nights 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.869
 freddy's he knows you thought of someone 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.200
 spurs in a dark place with one 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.330
 torch in hand that instead of running away 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.399
 look for a home or hope you understand 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.259
 what i mean this series of 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.030
 video games in its small has 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.580
 revolutionized in order to see the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.100
 horror and although it is certainly not a 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.830
 title of triple that is demonstrated of how 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.890
 an idea although not developed to the maximum 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.050
 can exceed an all equal mass in 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.539
 every euro you respect or run away or 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.160
 you fight and no one would ever be 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.539
 it occurred to me to remain still 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.700
 unarmed 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.200
 until someone did it, that's it 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.450
 this choice has definitely been 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.459
 appreciated by a lot of gamers 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.140
 since it is still not easy 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.540
 invest in something that does not give you 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.040
 no assurance of success and that 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.890
 on the contrary it goes against every 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.959
 good standard for all people 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.520
 They say Secondly this title 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.420
 does not deserve all the success it has 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.770
 had since it is developed in a manner 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.989
 rough 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.150
 I say that in my country it was really 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.190
 the courage to try innovation 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.900
 which made it so famous and is for 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.670
 this deserves the success it has 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.290
 had talking about other things 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.959
 the story that clinton us to this game 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.370
 it's complicated but who would ever be slow 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.390
 mind to tell in such a way 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.190
 indirect ie no no no really 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.099
 some of you really understood it 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.010
 we all say no the story of 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.750
 this game is a simple outline 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.430
 beautiful and complete the picture but it is not there 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.040
 need you to know it to enjoy it 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.140
 full in this way to the ris game 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.030
 simple which is complicated depends on 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.430
 how wii take it and it's an idea 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.910
 ingenious or who before closing this 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.110
 video 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.720
 I want to answer the question now 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.360
 they make me a bit all or what is the 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.700
 fernet freddy's you prefer is that 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.920
 which I prefer is the first yes because a 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.910
 my opinion has created a nice atmosphere 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.530
 it was difficult and disturbing let's say 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.720
 that the 4 was almost at the level of 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.880
 first but in my opinion he has not achieved it 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.200
 okay, guys, today's video that's you 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.260
 I can ask here what you have 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.880
 seen it was things that probably already 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.200
 you knew and we will see each other next 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.200
