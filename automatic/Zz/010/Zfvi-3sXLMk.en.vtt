see the texture it's a little bit
different<00:02:16.000> than<00:02:16.630> your<00:02:16.840> regular<00:02:17.050> oatmeal<00:02:17.530> but

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
different than your regular oatmeal but

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.190 
different than your regular oatmeal but
I<00:02:18.520> love<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.090> texture<00:02:19.450> does<00:02:19.660> take<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.900> while<00:02:20.170> to

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
I love the texture does take a while to

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.620 
I love the texture does take a while to
cook<00:02:20.500> about<00:02:20.770> 15<00:02:21.130> 20<00:02:21.310> minutes<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.090> just<00:02:22.270> wrap

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630

are<00:04:06.190> after<00:04:06.609> fasted<00:04:07.060> cardio<00:04:07.090> and<00:04:08.940> my

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
are after fasted cardio and my

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.479 
are after fasted cardio and my
post-workout<00:04:10.410> 6<00:04:11.410> ounce<00:04:11.590> of<00:04:11.769> white<00:04:11.889> fish<00:04:12.190> I'm

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
post-workout 6 ounce of white fish I'm

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.460 
post-workout 6 ounce of white fish I'm
not<00:04:12.639> that<00:04:12.820> big<00:04:12.970> of<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.120> seafood<00:04:13.810> fan<00:04:14.049> which

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
not that big of a seafood fan which

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.870 
not that big of a seafood fan which
really<00:04:14.739> sucks

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
really sucks

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.730 
really sucks
because<00:04:16.090> it<00:04:16.420> pretty<00:04:16.570> much<00:04:16.630> limits<00:04:17.050> me<00:04:17.170> to<00:04:17.380> just

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:17.740 
because it pretty much limits me to just

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.340 
because it pretty much limits me to just
chicken<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:18.370> turkey<00:04:18.640> breasts<00:04:19.110> one<00:04:20.110> cup<00:04:20.320> of

spinach and then one and a half cups of

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.420 
spinach and then one and a half cups of
brown<00:04:23.320> rice<00:04:23.350> sometimes<00:04:23.920> I'll<00:04:24.220> substitute

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
brown rice sometimes I'll substitute

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.310 
brown rice sometimes I'll substitute
what<00:04:24.880> that<00:04:25.120> with<00:04:25.330> like<00:04:25.480> a<00:04:25.510> sweet<00:04:25.720> potato<00:04:25.840> or<00:04:26.290> a

what that with like a sweet potato or a

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.750 
what that with like a sweet potato or a
yam<00:04:28.620> not<00:04:29.620> much<00:04:29.920> else<00:04:30.160> there<00:04:30.340> I<00:04:30.400> pretty<00:04:30.670> much

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
yam not much else there I pretty much

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.980 
yam not much else there I pretty much
stick<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.540> this

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
stick to this

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.110
