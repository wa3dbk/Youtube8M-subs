00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.420 
be them I guess well they certainly
learn<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> lesson<00:00:45.329> also<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.829> making<00:00:47.280> peace

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430

have with the Germans so now attorneys

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.930 
have with the Germans so now attorneys
are<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.949> have<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> reputation<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.879> being

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
are going to have a reputation of being

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.630 
are going to have a reputation of being
a<00:00:54.570> treaty<00:00:54.840> breaker<00:00:56.960> but<00:00:57.960> honestly<00:00:58.260> most<00:00:59.219> AI

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
a treaty breaker but honestly most AI

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.750 
a treaty breaker but honestly most AI
breaks<00:01:00.570> treaties<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.140> each<00:01:01.289> other<00:01:01.500> over<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
breaks treaties with each other over the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.979 
breaks treaties with each other over the
course<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> game<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.809> not<00:01:03.930> really

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
course of the game so it's not really

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.270 
course of the game so it's not really
something<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:05.000> worry<00:01:06.000> too<00:01:06.060> much<00:01:06.210> about<00:01:06.360> and

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.590 

you<00:01:11.280> kind<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.640> expect<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> AI<00:01:12.390> to

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
you kind of have to expect the AI to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:23.910 
you kind of have to expect the AI to
break<00:01:12.900> trees<00:01:16.490> anyway<00:01:17.490> we're<00:01:17.640> fighting<00:01:18.150> the
