00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.350 

I<00:00:07.920> have<00:00:08.920> the<00:00:09.040> sopranos<00:00:09.610> loaded<00:00:09.940> and<00:00:10.090> I<00:00:10.150> want<00:00:10.300> to

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
I have the sopranos loaded and I want to

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.480 
I have the sopranos loaded and I want to
show<00:00:10.600> an<00:00:10.780> example<00:00:11.290> of<00:00:11.469> how<00:00:11.650> you<00:00:11.710> can<00:00:12.070> change

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
show an example of how you can change

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.420 
show an example of how you can change
the<00:00:12.790> speed<00:00:13.299> of<00:00:13.600> the<00:00:14.290> transitions<00:00:15.070> of<00:00:15.309> the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
the speed of the transitions of the

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.939 
the speed of the transitions of the
consonants<00:00:16.119> and<00:00:16.209> vowels<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:17.650> is<00:00:17.770> very

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:17.949 
consonants and vowels this is very

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.380 
consonants and vowels this is very
important<00:00:18.430> because<00:00:18.460> if<00:00:18.760> you're<00:00:18.880> doing<00:00:19.090> if

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
important because if you're doing if

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.150 
important because if you're doing if
you're<00:00:19.539> working<00:00:19.810> with<00:00:19.930> a<00:00:20.050> very<00:00:20.110> slow<00:00:20.590> piece<00:00:20.890> or

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
you're working with a very slow piece or

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.670 
you're working with a very slow piece or
a<00:00:21.220> fast<00:00:21.490> piece<00:00:21.820> you<00:00:22.510> need<00:00:22.690> to<00:00:22.810> have<00:00:23.199> different

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
a fast piece you need to have different

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.370 
a fast piece you need to have different
speeds<00:00:24.580> of<00:00:24.820> transitions<00:00:25.359> now<00:00:25.960> we've<00:00:26.140> spent<00:00:26.349> a

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
speeds of transitions now we've spent a

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.279 
speeds of transitions now we've spent a
lot<00:00:26.500> of<00:00:26.529> time<00:00:26.890> making<00:00:27.640> defaults<00:00:28.419> of<00:00:28.599> the<00:00:28.869> speed

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
lot of time making defaults of the speed

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.280 
lot of time making defaults of the speed
of<00:00:29.589> constants<00:00:30.369> and<00:00:30.759> vowels<00:00:31.269> so<00:00:31.900> I<00:00:31.929> want<00:00:32.140> to<00:00:32.169> you

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
of constants and vowels so I want to you

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.920 
of constants and vowels so I want to you
type<00:00:32.800> in<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:33.010> word<00:00:33.040> dream<00:00:33.520> D<00:00:33.880> are<00:00:34.090> capital<00:00:34.660> e

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
type in the word dream D are capital e

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.850 
type in the word dream D are capital e
and<00:00:35.460> dream<00:00:39.690> okay<00:00:40.690> so<00:00:40.750> that<00:00:41.140> sounds<00:00:41.440> fine<00:00:41.800> but

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
and dream okay so that sounds fine but

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.730 
and dream okay so that sounds fine but
let's<00:00:42.250> say<00:00:42.430> I'm<00:00:42.700> I'm<00:00:43.510> doing<00:00:43.810> a<00:00:43.990> piece<00:00:44.470> that's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
let's say I'm I'm doing a piece that's

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.940 
let's say I'm I'm doing a piece that's
very<00:00:44.980> very<00:00:45.160> slow<00:00:45.580> I<00:00:45.880> can<00:00:46.660> go<00:00:46.960> into<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.350> adjust

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
very very slow I can go into the adjust

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.260 
very very slow I can go into the adjust
speed<00:00:48.330> menu<00:00:49.330> and<00:00:49.540> I<00:00:50.470> want<00:00:51.310> to<00:00:51.370> make<00:00:51.520> it<00:00:51.760> two

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
speed menu and I want to make it two

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.410 
speed menu and I want to make it two
hundred<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:52.750> fifty<00:00:53.200> percent<00:00:53.380> of<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:55.120> speed

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
hundred and fifty percent of the speed

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.400 
hundred and fifty percent of the speed
so<00:00:55.720> what'll<00:00:55.990> happen<00:00:56.140> meaning<00:00:58.140> another<00:00:59.140> way<00:00:59.350> to

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
so what'll happen meaning another way to

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.710 
so what'll happen meaning another way to
say<00:00:59.650> it<00:00:59.680> would<00:00:59.800> be<00:00:59.890> multiplying<00:01:00.700> that<00:01:01.180> value

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
say it would be multiplying that value

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.720 
say it would be multiplying that value
by<00:01:02.140> two<00:01:02.200> point<00:01:02.590> five<00:01:02.740> but<00:01:03.040> two<00:01:03.250> hundred<00:01:03.520> fifty

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
by two point five but two hundred fifty

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.580 
by two point five but two hundred fifty
percent<00:01:04.059> of<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:04.869> length<00:01:05.049> of<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.409> original

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
percent of the length of the original

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:17.550 
percent of the length of the original
one<00:01:05.979> so<00:01:06.900> now<00:01:07.900> I<00:01:07.930> have<00:01:15.630> drawn<00:01:16.630> out<00:01:16.869> longer<00:01:17.320> one

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
one so now I have drawn out longer one

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.560 
one so now I have drawn out longer one
now<00:01:18.009> let's<00:01:18.490> say<00:01:18.609> I<00:01:18.640> take<00:01:18.880> it<00:01:18.999> even<00:01:19.090> further<00:01:19.240> I

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
now let's say I take it even further I

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.149 
now let's say I take it even further I
can<00:01:19.780> say<00:01:19.929> you<00:01:19.990> know<00:01:20.079> what<00:01:20.289> let's<00:01:20.560> make<00:01:21.009> it<00:01:21.039> a

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
can say you know what let's make it a

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.069 
can say you know what let's make it a
rolling<00:01:21.549> art<00:01:21.789> and<00:01:22.079> let's<00:01:23.079> make<00:01:23.560> it<00:01:23.590> very<00:01:24.009> long

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
rolling art and let's make it very long

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.800 
rolling art and let's make it very long
let's<00:01:26.079> take<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.499> speed<00:01:26.859> and<00:01:27.159> now<00:01:28.060> let's

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
let's take the speed and now let's

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.690 
let's take the speed and now let's
multiply<00:01:29.170> what<00:01:29.740> we<00:01:29.829> already<00:01:30.159> had

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
multiply what we already had

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.999 
multiply what we already had
make<00:01:31.329> that<00:01:31.479> two<00:01:31.869> hundred<00:01:31.990> percent<00:01:32.229> even<00:01:32.649> more

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
make that two hundred percent even more

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:43.559 
make that two hundred percent even more
now<00:01:33.999> we've<00:01:34.210> got<00:01:41.850> or<00:01:42.850> I<00:01:42.909> could<00:01:43.179> just<00:01:43.299> come<00:01:43.450> back

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
now we've got or I could just come back

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.690 
now we've got or I could just come back
and<00:01:43.810> say<00:01:43.929> oh<00:01:43.960> you<00:01:44.229> know<00:01:44.350> what<00:01:44.499> and<00:01:44.799> this<00:01:45.520> is

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
and say oh you know what and this is

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.370 
and say oh you know what and this is
actually<00:01:46.179> the<00:01:46.389> paint<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:46.960> can<00:01:47.049> actually

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
actually the paint you can actually

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.309 
actually the paint you can actually
select<00:01:47.619> a<00:01:48.609> section<00:01:49.299> of<00:01:49.420> text<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:49.810> if<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:50.109> had<00:01:50.229> the

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
select a section of text so if I had the

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:51.840 
select a section of text so if I had the
word<00:01:50.469> dream<00:01:50.740> three<00:01:51.039> times<00:01:51.310> I<00:01:51.520> could<00:01:51.700> actually

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
word dream three times I could actually

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.639 
word dream three times I could actually
select<00:01:52.149> different<00:01:52.780> speeds<00:01:53.229> for<00:01:53.409> different

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
select different speeds for different

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.559 
select different speeds for different
sections<00:01:53.859> so<00:01:54.219> but<00:01:54.909> if<00:01:54.999> I<00:01:55.060> just<00:01:55.240> wanted<00:01:55.389> to<00:01:55.509> go

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
sections so but if I just wanted to go

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.260 
sections so but if I just wanted to go
back<00:01:55.719> and<00:01:56.380> make<00:01:56.530> this<00:01:56.709> fast<00:01:57.039> again<00:01:57.520> I<00:01:57.700> can<00:01:58.240> just

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
back and make this fast again I can just

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.590 
back and make this fast again I can just
simply<00:01:58.749> go<00:01:58.929> into<00:01:59.319> the<00:01:59.439> speed<00:01:59.829> menu<00:02:00.159> and<00:02:00.600> now

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
simply go into the speed menu and now

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.440 
simply go into the speed menu and now
make<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.229> you<00:02:03.100> know<00:02:03.219> 10%<00:02:04.209> of<00:02:04.659> what<00:02:04.779> it<00:02:04.869> was<00:02:05.219> and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
make it you know 10% of what it was and

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.550 
make it you know 10% of what it was and
this<00:02:07.450> is<00:02:07.600> just<00:02:07.689> a<00:02:07.779> quick<00:02:07.929> way<00:02:08.140> instead<00:02:08.470> of

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
this is just a quick way instead of

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.350 
this is just a quick way instead of
actually<00:02:08.890> having<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:09.429> go<00:02:09.580> in<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:09.910> adjust<00:02:10.000> the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
actually having to go in and adjust the

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.600 
actually having to go in and adjust the
level<00:02:10.539> of<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.380> length<00:02:11.590> of<00:02:11.770> each<00:02:11.860> constant<00:02:12.459> you

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
level of the length of each constant you

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.510 
level of the length of each constant you
can<00:02:12.730> just<00:02:12.880> do<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.090> all<00:02:13.740> very<00:02:14.740> quickly<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.310> this

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
can just do it all very quickly in this

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.920 
can just do it all very quickly in this
way

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.070 

now<00:02:19.930> I've<00:02:20.050> got<00:02:20.230> fast<00:02:20.770> transitions<00:02:21.990> that's<00:02:22.990> a

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
now I've got fast transitions that's a

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.240 
now I've got fast transitions that's a
very<00:02:23.260> important<00:02:23.680> feature

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.310 

you
