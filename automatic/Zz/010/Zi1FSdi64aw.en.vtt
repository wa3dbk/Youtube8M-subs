00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
applies and so I pretty much get like a

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.720 
applies and so I pretty much get like a
little<00:00:49.050> bit<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.710> little<00:00:51.079> bit<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.730> pencil

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
little bit a little bit of the pencil

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.689 
little bit a little bit of the pencil

start going like a little little marks

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.060
