correctly<00:02:28.480> why<00:02:29.290> we<00:02:29.590> have<00:02:29.769> that<00:02:30.040> for<00:02:30.400> example

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
correctly why we have that for example

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.720 
correctly why we have that for example
that<00:02:31.360> aluminium<00:02:32.019> bag<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.010> romanian<00:02:33.519> bag

55%<00:02:38.530> humidity<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:39.220> what<00:02:39.519> you<00:02:39.670> have<00:02:39.849> inside<00:02:40.209> the

55% humidity is what you have inside the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.570 
55% humidity is what you have inside the
spring<00:02:40.630> then<00:02:40.989> we<00:02:41.230> cover<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.739> string<00:02:42.040> with<00:02:42.280> a

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
spring then we cover the string with a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.190 
spring then we cover the string with a
two<00:02:43.269> hundred<00:02:43.299> of<00:02:43.720> millimetres<00:02:44.170> of

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
polyurethane coop for your thing and

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.150 
polyurethane coop for your thing and
also<00:02:47.470> don't<00:02:48.360> don't<00:02:49.360> let<00:02:49.660> your<00:02:49.959> gut<00:02:50.230> on<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.890> Sun

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
also don't don't let your gut on the Sun

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.670 
also don't don't let your gut on the Sun
it<00:02:51.850> will<00:02:52.060> like<00:02:52.299> you<00:02:52.600> sometimes<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:53.530> would<00:02:53.650> be

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
it will like you sometimes it would be

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.090 
it will like you sometimes it would be
