the violet and indigo realm and we've

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.650 
the violet and indigo realm and we've
encouraged<00:06:06.980> them<00:06:07.070> to<00:06:07.130> just<00:06:07.580> stay<00:06:08.450> there

encouraged them to just stay there

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.140 
encouraged them to just stay there
because<00:06:09.560> I<00:06:09.740> think<00:06:09.890> a<00:06:09.950> lot<00:06:10.100> of<00:06:10.130> kids<00:06:10.400> have<00:06:10.850> that

because I think a lot of kids have that

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.370 
because I think a lot of kids have that
as<00:06:11.570> well<00:06:12.080> as<00:06:12.530> part<00:06:13.040> of<00:06:13.160> their<00:06:13.310> their<00:06:13.850> colors

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
but we turn that off and so we've

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.990 
but we turn that off and so we've
encouraged<00:06:18.170> him<00:06:18.290> to<00:06:18.320> stay<00:06:18.890> there<00:06:19.160> stay<00:06:19.700> very

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
an it's an excellent book and yeah we we

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.650 
an it's an excellent book and yeah we we
actually<00:07:06.980> both<00:07:07.520> my<00:07:07.670> wife<00:07:07.850> and<00:07:07.940> I<00:07:08.030> have<00:07:08.240> bread

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660 
actually both my wife and I have bread

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.200 
actually both my wife and I have bread
that<00:07:08.840> just<00:07:09.110> because<00:07:09.860> of<00:07:09.980> her<00:07:10.070> son<00:07:10.250> so<00:07:10.730> behavior

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210 
that just because of her son so behavior

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.700 
that just because of her son so behavior
wise<00:07:11.390> the<00:07:11.600> color<00:07:11.780> can<00:07:11.990> affect<00:07:12.320> someone's

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710 
wise the color can affect someone's

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.860 
wise the color can affect someone's
behavior<00:07:12.830> as<00:07:13.250> well<00:07:13.430> well<00:07:13.970> for<00:07:14.240> sure<00:07:14.390> it's

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:14.870 
behavior as well well for sure it's

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.510 
behavior as well well for sure it's
mainly<00:07:15.080> because<00:07:15.320> their<00:07:15.620> frequencies<00:07:16.130> so<00:07:16.280> high

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 
mainly because their frequencies so high

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.160 
mainly because their frequencies so high
they're<00:07:16.850> not<00:07:16.970> grounded<00:07:17.420> into<00:07:17.570> this<00:07:17.720> physical

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.170 
they're not grounded into this physical

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.630 
they're not grounded into this physical
world<00:07:18.200> then<00:07:18.650> the<00:07:18.770> school<00:07:18.980> system<00:07:19.430> really

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:19.640 
world then the school system really

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.640 
world then the school system really
focuses<00:07:20.180> around<00:07:20.330> the<00:07:20.690> the<00:07:21.020> yellow<00:07:21.290> and<00:07:21.530> the
