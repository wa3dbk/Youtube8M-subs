00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 the sleep how much west 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.460
 Training camp is already rum I believe 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.350
 the amenities are here in Belek 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.210
 are very good what is your previous one 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.639
 interim conclusion before the training camp in 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.759
 Belek I believe that we are very good 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.529
 We worked with the new one 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.180
 trainers now have a clear target 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.650
 whatever you have to do with the player 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.720
 and we try that in every training 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.850
 We have put a lot of the ball 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.410
 there and so I think do that 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.750
 although it is very exhausting too 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.510
 lots of fun and yes we try 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.460
 overall, of course, to work towards that 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.440
 that we have a better second half than in 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.450
 round play after which it is to say 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.629
 I now first the focus in the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.820
 training work in the training camp yes 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.809
 First of all we try again, of course 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.579
 to get a little self-confidence 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.020
 that we know that we are better football 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.250
 can play like in the round the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.690
 I believe everyone is clear but the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.070
 trainer keeps asking us for that 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.350
 also try to play flat that we 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.820
 try to combine with each other and 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.379
 Of course, do not forget 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.550
 that we need to work together to 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.170
 you have to shift that with us 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.000
 compact we are good against the ball 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.949
 work and that's why I think so 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.670
 there are many things that we also good 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.619
 can use 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.840
 Of course, a training camp is also 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.189
 a good opportunity for the team and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.869
 the new trainers team a bit 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.340
 they will be able to grow together 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.159
 this process is already over 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.210
 progressed 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.420
 yes I think it's always a bit 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.439
 it is easier if you have 24 hours 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.150
 is together and therefore I believe 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.520
 we used that very well 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.780
 many many conversations we have had 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.460
 Of course, it will become a lot known 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.170
 also some things made new and from 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.360
 So I think the coach could do one 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.770
 Already take a lot of us and how 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.850
 Also a lot of the trainers team and me 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.340
 believe that we are on a good 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.360
 What are you personally away from? 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.030
 made for the second half 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.200
 yes well first, of course I hope that 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.250
 the team not only outside the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.840
 place but also in the square 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.369
 can help a bit again and me 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.170
 will try again to mine 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.590
 performance to find the last year 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.930
 was not good and of course I hope so too 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.649
 that I then the team offensively 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.810
 can help again 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.850
 What would you say is aside now 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.320
 the goal of a personal goal 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.899
 team what do we want to achieve in 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.100
 the second half 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.280
 I think we want to try one 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.300
 to play quiet season and we have to 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.280
 at the very very serious 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.470
 kick-off program what we have to try 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.690
 to be fully there that we 100 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.060
 and then we will too 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.390
 certainly someday our points 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.750
 pick up 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.420
 now the conclusion is yes 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.860
 two test games are even on first 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.810
 tomorrow evening against fenerbahce 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.840
 istanbul is certainly a very good one 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.160
 very strong opponent is already a good one 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.600
 Location or yes would 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.800
 say but I think that one the 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.450
 test games should not hang too high 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.860
 I think if you have ours 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.209
 test results looks the last 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.800
 four five years since I came here 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.720
 vannini so intoxicating and we have 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.310
 nevertheless almost three years very 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.810
 of course it is successful 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.519
 so important for us and for the trainer 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.890
 to see that we are what he is from us 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.560
 demands to implement and us 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.750
 want to evolve constantly and everyone 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.280
 knows that fenerbahce a top team 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.300
 has and there we will try tomorrow 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.380
 good against it 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.380
 We hope that's done
