among and some of the places was the
Sinclair<00:01:35.650> research<00:01:36.369> facility<00:01:37.300> I<00:01:38.520> had<00:01:39.750> decided

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
Sinclair research facility I had decided

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.660 
Sinclair research facility I had decided
rightly<00:01:41.320> so<00:01:41.560> that<00:01:41.590> they<00:01:42.160> wanted<00:01:42.490> to

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
rightly so that they wanted to

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.690 
rightly so that they wanted to
incorporate<00:01:43.090> some<00:01:43.810> enrichment<00:01:44.580> into<00:01:45.580> the

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
incorporate some enrichment into the

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
life span multiple in fareham so they

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.590 
life span multiple in fareham so they
hired<00:01:47.800> someone<00:01:48.160> whose<00:01:48.550> job<00:01:48.640> was<00:01:49.000> specifically

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
we call it a just Oryx state so it's not

problems that that people had with that

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.789 
problems that that people had with that
in<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.030> last<00:03:23.480> 10<00:03:23.750> years<00:03:23.900> they<00:03:24.319> have<00:03:24.530> really

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
in the last 10 years they have really

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.390 
in the last 10 years they have really
taken<00:03:25.639> the<00:03:26.120> whole<00:03:26.329> idea<00:03:26.569> and

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
taken the whole idea and

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.830 
taken the whole idea and
for<00:03:27.579> Joe<00:03:27.730> Hart<00:03:27.879> and<00:03:28.120> made<00:03:28.299> leaps<00:03:28.599> and<00:03:28.780> bounds

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
for Joe Hart and made leaps and bounds

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.860 
for Joe Hart and made leaps and bounds
in<00:03:29.230> terms<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:29.620> how<00:03:29.799> they<00:03:30.040> they<00:03:30.640> use<00:03:30.939> animals

and<00:03:32.110> research<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.769> I<00:03:32.829> think<00:03:33.040> it's<00:03:33.159> something

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
and research and I think it's something

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.069 
and research and I think it's something
that<00:03:33.700> they<00:03:33.909> really<00:03:34.030> should<00:03:34.329> be<00:03:34.420> proud<00:03:34.689> of<00:03:34.720> I
