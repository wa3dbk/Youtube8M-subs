00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.150
 hitherto lived abandoned susanne hello 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.619
 Today I show you this half negative 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.869
 lures here an extended version 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.820
 the halftime looks of band aid this 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.590
 make up is needed here for whole 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.090
 bring a template is a bit 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.050
 get stuck so do your best 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.850
 a before 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.260
 I have the normal side of my 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.820
 Facial already done and the other 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.320
 released on one side 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.030
 just completely normal or make up 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.399
 Otherwise they would do it 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.870
 well we start with tape and that 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.670
 Now I'm completely on my own 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.260
 face where the ridge between the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.770
 normal and the negative side 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.050
 should 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.930
 yes I'm not normal spiders 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.820
 totally stupid maybe now 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.320
 sometimes the complete free side of the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.329
 Facial blue how was that again with 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.219
 normal and hey if you want you can 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.910
 you quit after that, then be halfway 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.500
 smurf great 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.840
 so I started eyeshadow 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.640
 to shock but the special about it 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.140
 everything is on the right now 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.300
 bright side is now on the other side 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.280
 side must be darker and everything 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.870
 of course I have to be great 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.880
 contoured for example as usual 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.310
 but also with white city something 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.560
 darker looks funny but should be so 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.720
 his and i have broken the brush 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.350
 always great as if nothing 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.570
 been 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.340
 the eyebrows now know that 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.170
 on the right side we are now 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.390
 but after exactly how exactly 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.130
 reversed so everything is darker 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.899
 first becomes cellar and vice versa 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.759
 pay close attention to the shading and 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.649
 conversely, she tries to look up 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.240
 by the way , the eyelashes are almost painted 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:47.869
 always with my agfacolor palette that 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:49.490
 works very well as you can see so 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.920
 my lips are now loud 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.869
 template so greenish the color I wear 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.149
 on as normal lipstick so nothing 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.280
 special but also the lips shadow 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.259
 we also a bit or that 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.880
 opposite of what the shade 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.009
 Contrary to city I know it 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.780
 now the time has come 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.429
 Adhesive tape is becoming increasingly simple 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.530
 that everything went well and 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.300
 pull it off carefully where that 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.680
 took away tape makeup wear 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.060
 I've got a little something up now 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.160
 so I do not streak in the red 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.450
 face way and on the right side 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.830
 the lips are coming in now 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.830
 pink lipstick 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.670
 Now you can walk around like one 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.769
