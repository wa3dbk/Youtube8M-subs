the<00:00:13.910> lights<00:00:14.090> have<00:00:14.240> changed<00:00:14.269> a<00:00:14.599> lot<00:00:14.719> since<00:00:14.900> we

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
the lights have changed a lot since we

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.810 
the lights have changed a lot since we
did<00:00:15.200> the<00:00:15.290> headshot<00:00:15.679> video<00:00:15.980> I<00:00:16.189> moved<00:00:16.670> all

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
did the headshot video I moved all

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.700 
did the headshot video I moved all
lights<00:00:17.150> behind<00:00:17.599> her<00:00:17.779> we're<00:00:18.349> pointing

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
lights behind her we're pointing

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.499 
lights behind her we're pointing
directly<00:00:18.860> at<00:00:19.189> the<00:00:19.279> wall<00:00:19.520> we've<00:00:19.849> got<00:00:20.060> this<00:00:20.270> one

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509 
directly at the wall we've got this one

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.450 
directly at the wall we've got this one
pointed<00:00:21.259> a<00:00:21.410> little<00:00:21.649> bit<00:00:21.770> inward<00:00:22.130> so<00:00:22.310> it's

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
pointed a little bit inward so it's

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.800 
pointed a little bit inward so it's
kinda<00:00:22.669> cross<00:00:22.910> lighting<00:00:23.300> because<00:00:23.540> we<00:00:23.599> want<00:00:23.750> to

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
kinda cross lighting because we want to

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.120 
kinda cross lighting because we want to
try<00:00:23.899> to<00:00:23.960> get<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.140> lighting<00:00:24.290> nice<00:00:24.529> and<00:00:24.739> even<00:00:25.009> so

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
try to get the lighting nice and even so

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.950 
try to get the lighting nice and even so
we've<00:00:25.250> got<00:00:25.369> both<00:00:25.579> these<00:00:25.759> at<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.119> same<00:00:26.329> power

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
we've got both these at the same power

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.569 
we've got both these at the same power
we're<00:00:27.349> shooting<00:00:27.649> them<00:00:27.770> across<00:00:27.980> directly<00:00:28.520> at

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:28.579 
we're shooting them across directly at

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.700 
we're shooting them across directly at
the<00:00:28.669> wall<00:00:28.700> down<00:00:29.329> below<00:00:29.750> on<00:00:29.989> both<00:00:30.169> sides<00:00:30.470> I<00:00:30.680> have

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
the wall down below on both sides I have

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.400 
the wall down below on both sides I have
speed<00:00:31.099> lights<00:00:31.430> also<00:00:31.730> both<00:00:32.480> set<00:00:32.840> at<00:00:32.960> full<00:00:33.200> one

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
speed lights also both set at full one

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.040 
speed lights also both set at full one
over<00:00:33.649> one<00:00:33.800> power<00:00:34.130> and<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:34.730> idea<00:00:35.149> is<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:35.420> blow

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
over one power and the idea is to blow

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.990 
over one power and the idea is to blow
out<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:36.440> background<00:00:36.680> as<00:00:37.220> much<00:00:37.430> as<00:00:37.580> you<00:00:37.700> can

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
out the background as much as you can

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.390 
out the background as much as you can
and<00:00:38.300> to<00:00:39.290> have<00:00:39.470> her<00:00:39.680> in<00:00:39.890> front<00:00:40.100> of<00:00:40.160> all<00:00:40.310> those

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
and to have her in front of all those

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.430 
and to have her in front of all those
lights<00:00:40.670> up<00:00:40.880> when<00:00:40.970> the<00:00:41.090> lights<00:00:41.300> fire<00:00:41.900> behind

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
lights up when the lights fire behind

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.470 
lights up when the lights fire behind
her<00:00:42.680> she's<00:00:43.220> as<00:00:43.430> dark<00:00:43.670> as<00:00:43.790> can<00:00:43.940> be<00:00:44.060> because<00:00:44.210> on

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
her she's as dark as can be because on

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.850 
her she's as dark as can be because on
on<00:00:44.720> the<00:00:44.840> lights<00:00:45.020> lighting<00:00:45.290> the<00:00:45.470> front<00:00:45.710> of<00:00:45.770> her

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
on the lights lighting the front of her

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.650 
on the lights lighting the front of her
and<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.310> whole<00:00:46.490> background<00:00:46.730> brightest<00:00:47.480> can

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
and the whole background brightest can

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.340 
and the whole background brightest can
be<00:00:47.810> a<00:00:47.840> nice<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:48.230> evenly<00:00:48.500> lit<00:00:48.770> so<00:00:49.370> we<00:00:49.610> got<00:00:49.790> the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
be a nice and evenly lit so we got the

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.569 
be a nice and evenly lit so we got the
mono<00:00:51.350> lights<00:00:51.620> set<00:00:51.800> really<00:00:52.100> high<00:00:52.130> we've<00:00:52.460> got

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
mono lights set really high we've got

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.580 
mono lights set really high we've got
the<00:00:52.820> speed<00:00:53.420> like<00:00:53.630> step<00:00:53.900> one<00:00:53.930> over<00:00:54.290> one<00:00:54.380> I'm

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
the speed like step one over one I'm

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.310 
the speed like step one over one I'm
shooting<00:00:54.950> 250th<00:00:55.670> of<00:00:55.790> a<00:00:55.910> second<00:00:56.329> on<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:57.020> speed

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
shooting 250th of a second on the speed

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.800 
shooting 250th of a second on the speed
around<00:00:57.560> the<00:00:57.829> camera<00:00:58.250> I'm<00:00:58.430> shooting<00:00:58.850> an<00:00:58.910> f-16

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
around the camera I'm shooting an f-16

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.590 
around the camera I'm shooting an f-16
to<00:01:00.050> really<00:01:00.560> kind<00:01:00.739> of<00:01:00.829> narrow<00:01:01.010> down<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:02.030> f-stop

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
to really kind of narrow down the f-stop

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.060 
to really kind of narrow down the f-stop
and<00:01:02.630> really<00:01:03.020> try<00:01:03.200> to<00:01:03.230> make<00:01:03.350> it<00:01:03.560> so<00:01:03.680> that

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
and really try to make it so that

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.010 
and really try to make it so that
it's<00:01:04.309> nice<00:01:04.699> and<00:01:04.970> dark<00:01:05.119> in<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:05.329> front<00:01:05.600> nice<00:01:05.810> and

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
it's nice and dark in the front nice and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.080 
it's nice and dark in the front nice and
lit<00:01:06.619> in<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.829> back<00:01:07.009> now<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.430> trick<00:01:07.670> here<00:01:07.700> is<00:01:07.880> to

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
lit in the back now the trick here is to

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.610 
lit in the back now the trick here is to
mess<00:01:08.270> with<00:01:08.420> your<00:01:08.600> f-stop<00:01:08.750> a<00:01:09.020> little<00:01:09.470> bit

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
mess with your f-stop a little bit

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.590 
mess with your f-stop a little bit
because<00:01:09.740> you<00:01:10.280> don't<00:01:10.490> want<00:01:10.640> her<00:01:10.729> to<00:01:10.850> be<00:01:10.970> 100%

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
because you don't want her to be 100%

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.170 
because you don't want her to be 100%
completely<00:01:12.440> black<00:01:12.770> on<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.700> side<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.090> it'll

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
completely black on the side so it'll

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.730 
completely black on the side so it'll
look<00:01:14.330> like<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:14.690> photoshopped<00:01:15.290> it<00:01:15.440> you<00:01:15.560> want

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
look like you photoshopped it you want

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.930 
look like you photoshopped it you want
to<00:01:15.800> have<00:01:15.830> just<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:16.190> little<00:01:16.400> bit<00:01:16.520> of<00:01:16.670> spillover

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
to have just a little bit of spillover

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.550 
to have just a little bit of spillover
light<00:01:17.300> a<00:01:17.510> little<00:01:17.810> bit<00:01:17.960> of<00:01:18.110> highlight<00:01:18.260> you're

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
light a little bit of highlight you're

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.899 
light a little bit of highlight you're
going<00:01:18.680> to<00:01:18.740> see<00:01:18.830> as<00:01:18.920> I<00:01:19.010> think<00:01:19.220> picture<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:19.729> as<00:01:19.820> I

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
going to see as I think picture and as I

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.490 
going to see as I think picture and as I
come<00:01:20.120> on<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.330> screen<00:01:20.570> that<00:01:21.049> there's<00:01:21.290> just<00:01:21.440> a

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
come on the screen that there's just a

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.660 
come on the screen that there's just a
little<00:01:21.680> bit<00:01:21.830> of<00:01:21.920> light<00:01:22.040> coming<00:01:22.280> around<00:01:22.580> her

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
little bit of light coming around her

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.890 
little bit of light coming around her
and<00:01:22.760> showing<00:01:23.060> off<00:01:23.180> some<00:01:23.390> of<00:01:23.420> our<00:01:23.479> features<00:01:23.870> a

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
and showing off some of our features a

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.990 
and showing off some of our features a
little<00:01:24.229> bit<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:24.650> it's<00:01:25.220> a<00:01:25.250> good<00:01:25.400> idea<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:25.850> let's

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000

interesting to think the other way to do

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.890 
interesting to think the other way to do
is<00:03:07.190> go<00:03:07.280> in<00:03:07.370> turn<00:03:07.580> sideways<00:03:08.060> for<00:03:08.240> me<00:03:08.360> if<00:03:08.420> you<00:03:08.480> can

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
is go in turn sideways for me if you can

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.690 
is go in turn sideways for me if you can
the<00:03:09.560> other<00:03:09.680> thing<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.040> go<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:10.280> look<00:03:10.400> straight

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
the other thing to go and look straight

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.030 
the other thing to go and look straight
that<00:03:10.880> way<00:03:10.940> is<00:03:11.269> to<00:03:12.260> shoot<00:03:12.470> them<00:03:12.590> straight<00:03:12.890> on

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
that way is to shoot them straight on

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.160 
that way is to shoot them straight on
this<00:03:13.220> way<00:03:13.459> also<00:03:13.730> we'll<00:03:14.150> try<00:03:14.300> to<00:03:14.360> get<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.959> nice
