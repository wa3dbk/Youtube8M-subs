00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.170

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:37.520

 pizza vacuum sucker is enough 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:55.739
 firmly put down here capacity for berries 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:58.800
 and fall asleep berries . give good cherries 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.609
 the berry is large but nonetheless very 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.010
 good on her 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:08.970
 what good is this method of extraction of course 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.689
 sit a toothpick for a very long time and here 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.640
 everything is pretty fast like a machine gun 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.640
 when there is such a song at all 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:33.119
 very comfortable very fast right here 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:35.960
 automaton and me when the whole flesh remains 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:41.399
 not damaged on the bone very well 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.079
 Removing the device is very convenient and 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.240
 of course quickly allows you to delete 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.890
 bones and very neat here is the flesh 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.530
 practically intact 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.479
 here you can see here and so 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.039
 neatly extracted bone but 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.380
 your questions for what to extract in 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.210
 bones the fact is that everyone knows 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.500
 what in 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.460
 no cherry seed contained 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.860
 hydrocyanic acid of course if it 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.409
 is that we made jam or 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.810
 compote and he will stand with us for a few 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.180
 months then no danger to 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.640
 no person but because we have very often 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.709
 cherry comfort jam and cost by year 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.650
 and more here then begin 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.260
 danger but generally to remove the bones 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.000
 excess of sweet cherries if you are very comfortable 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.800
 to brew various jams 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.310
 in order to do refueling would 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.470
 pie fillings can make comfort 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.900
 jam and so on in general then this is very 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.410
 comfortable and very interestingly adapted 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.540
