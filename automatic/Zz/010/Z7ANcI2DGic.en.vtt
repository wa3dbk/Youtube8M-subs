00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:04.730
 Welcome back to us can tell is that we are still looking for that 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:08.139
 one very big talent where the whole of the Netherlands makes a profit 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.039
 no i am alone and 13 years old 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.249
 yes but for the whole family 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:20.800
 he has released a new CD 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.630
 it promises to keep a bit of peace 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.829
 The former owner can take a few weeks and even when he resisted 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.829
 intense 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.940
 one of many in his hind legs 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.250
 it's just not nervous on a Thursday 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.120
 and even twice 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.120
 analyst jan hein de vroe 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.790
 that's what the publisher has 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.980
 moreover, it has already been indicated that none have been included 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.359
 call you in particular 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.830
 may i hope 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.310
 I am going to do that but I am not going to see how this has all changed 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.310
 is 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.340
 not all 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.140
 routine 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.420
 don't have to 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.100
 we did not do that service 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.240
 via a so-called 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.240
 it was a new one 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.920
 it's a we go to 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.510
 it they have first year 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.510
 knowing more 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.919
 in Nijmegen 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.779
 who here 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:55.519
 around heaven 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.519
 not anymore 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.459
 unfortunately this was 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.659
 I have you got the advice and certainly for someone of thirteen years 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.659
 and you have a new future 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:34.359
 I think it's incredible to know via e-mail 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.359
 this song also sings with such a full motion 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.239
 they played the elevator emotionally 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.019
 a 13 year old boy 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.039
 who knows what you are about Sint Maarten 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:49.589
 then people are taken seriously because I believe that it is not expected 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:03:59.769
 I'm crazy now
