00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:31.089 
explain exactly what the limitation we

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.790 
explain exactly what the limitation we
are<00:00:31.210> going<00:00:31.570> to<00:00:31.720> put<00:00:31.960> well<00:00:32.169> I'm<00:00:32.349> going<00:00:32.590> to<00:00:32.649> put

are going to put well I'm going to put

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.450 
are going to put well I'm going to put
on<00:00:32.890> myself<00:00:33.070> is<00:00:35.010> I'm<00:00:36.010> going<00:00:36.160> to<00:00:36.219> be<00:00:36.309> playing

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
on myself is I'm going to be playing

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.250 
on myself is I'm going to be playing
over<00:00:36.700> a<00:00:36.760> backing<00:00:37.059> track<00:00:37.090> it's<00:00:37.570> a<00:00:37.629> static<00:00:38.079> one

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
over a backing track it's a static one

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.740 
over a backing track it's a static one
in<00:00:38.440> G<00:00:38.680> Dorian

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.420 

okay<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.990> the<00:00:43.500> focus<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.220> minor

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
okay and the focus is on the minor

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.890 
okay and the focus is on the minor
pentatonic<00:00:44.640> scale<00:00:45.240> so<00:00:45.480> we're<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:45.870> to

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
pentatonic scale so we're just going to

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.960 
pentatonic scale so we're just going to
keep<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.290> literally<00:00:46.770> mine<00:00:47.040> and<00:00:47.340> then<00:00:47.460> coming

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
keep it literally mine and then coming

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.220 
keep it literally mine and then coming
our<00:00:48.180> way

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 

the<00:00:53.100> limitation<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:53.940> we're<00:00:54.150> going<00:00:54.240> to<00:00:54.300> put

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
the limitation that we're going to put

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.550 
the limitation that we're going to put
on<00:00:54.660> ourselves<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.290> we<00:00:55.650> when<00:00:56.130> I<00:00:56.250> shift<00:00:56.670> position

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
on ourselves is we when I shift position

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.340 
on ourselves is we when I shift position
I<00:00:58.910> can't<00:00:59.910> go<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.240> the<00:01:00.480> next<00:01:00.510> available

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
I can't go to the next available

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.890 
I can't go to the next available
position<00:01:01.670> either<00:01:02.670> side<00:01:03.150> of<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.450> position<00:01:03.810> I'm

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
position either side of the position I'm

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.480 
position either side of the position I'm
in<00:01:04.020> so<00:01:04.530> let's<00:01:04.710> say<00:01:04.860> I'm<00:01:04.980> playing<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.340> phrase

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.350 

something<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.820> not<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> move

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
something like that not on a move

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.100 
something like that not on a move
position<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.049> can't<00:01:13.439> eat<00:01:13.710> go<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:13.950> either<00:01:14.360> two<00:01:15.360> or

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
position I can't eat go to either two or

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.550 
position I can't eat go to either two or
five<00:01:16.970> because<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.150> right<00:01:18.869> next<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.350> what

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
five because it's right next to it what

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.620 
five because it's right next to it what
if<00:01:19.650> they<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.130> jump<00:01:20.369> up<00:01:20.549> three<00:01:20.850> or<00:01:21.090> move<00:01:21.360> back

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
if they do is jump up three or move back

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.749 
if they do is jump up three or move back
three<00:01:23.869> positions<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.200> mean<00:01:25.440> so<00:01:26.070> finally<00:01:26.700> in

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
three positions I mean so finally in

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:35.500 
three positions I mean so finally in
position<00:01:26.850> one

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.380 

then<00:01:35.750> position<00:01:35.930> 5<00:01:36.470> from<00:01:36.800> their<00:01:37.010> thoughts<00:01:40.390> you

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
then position 5 from their thoughts you

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.090 
then position 5 from their thoughts you
get<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:41.660> idea<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.050> I<00:01:42.290> can't<00:01:42.590> go<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:42.950> next

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
get the idea so I can't go to the next

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.560 
get the idea so I can't go to the next
one<00:01:43.250> what<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.790> will<00:01:43.940> do<00:01:44.090> when<00:01:44.210> you're<00:01:44.360> doing

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
one what you will do when you're doing

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.030 
one what you will do when you're doing
this<00:01:44.660> is<00:01:44.870> you<00:01:44.960> will<00:01:45.110> find<00:01:45.410> that<00:01:45.620> you<00:01:45.770> will<00:01:45.860> do

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
this is you will find that you will do

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.830 
this is you will find that you will do
it<00:01:46.220> you'll<00:01:46.490> fall<00:01:46.910> into<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.330> trap<00:01:47.540> of<00:01:47.570> eggs

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
it you'll fall into the trap of eggs

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.830 
it you'll fall into the trap of eggs
it's<00:01:48.020> pretty<00:01:48.290> demanding<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:48.980> one<00:01:49.720> but<00:01:50.720> it's

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
it's pretty demanding this one but it's

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.540 
it's pretty demanding this one but it's
brave<00:01:51.200> for<00:01:51.440> creative<00:01:51.890> phrasing<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.370> no

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
brave for creative phrasing and no

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.180 
brave for creative phrasing and no
choice<00:01:53.050> you've<00:01:54.050> really<00:01:54.380> got<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.620> think<00:01:54.650> on

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
choice you've really got to think on

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.610 
choice you've really got to think on
your<00:01:55.250> feet<00:01:55.550> here<00:01:56.180> you<00:01:56.600> know<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:57.320> can't<00:01:57.560> just

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
your feet here you know you can't just

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.080 
your feet here you know you can't just
let<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:57.950> finger<00:01:58.190> movements<00:01:58.610> take<00:01:58.760> over

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
let the finger movements take over

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.420 
let the finger movements take over
because<00:01:59.330> that's<00:01:59.510> what<00:01:59.690> mistakes<00:02:00.110> will<00:02:00.350> happen

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
because that's what mistakes will happen

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.680 
because that's what mistakes will happen
so<00:02:01.430> you've<00:02:01.610> really<00:02:01.850> forces<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:02.510> to<00:02:02.540> really

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
so you've really forces you to really

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.780 
so you've really forces you to really
Zone<00:02:03.320> into<00:02:03.740> what<00:02:03.920> you're<00:02:04.070> playing<00:02:04.250> which<00:02:04.670> is

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
Zone into what you're playing which is

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.930 
Zone into what you're playing which is
what<00:02:04.940> we<00:02:05.030> want<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.270> do<00:02:05.360> when<00:02:05.510> we're<00:02:05.690> revising

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
what we want to do when we're revising

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.490 
what we want to do when we're revising
or<00:02:07.940> at<00:02:08.210> least<00:02:08.420> we<00:02:08.750> want<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:08.960> have<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.140> control

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
was going to say before is if you if you

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.180 
was going to say before is if you if you
find<00:02:17.870> yourself<00:02:18.020> doing<00:02:18.410> it<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.710> you<00:02:18.770> slip<00:02:19.010> into

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
find yourself doing it and you slip into

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.380 
find yourself doing it and you slip into
it<00:02:19.340> then<00:02:20.800> carry<00:02:21.800> on<00:02:21.920> with<00:02:22.460> with<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.210> same

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
it then carry on with with the same

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.000 
it then carry on with with the same
limitation<00:02:23.990> from<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.380> position<00:02:24.740> that<00:02:24.770> you're

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
limitation from the position that you're

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.850 
limitation from the position that you're
in<00:02:25.040> so<00:02:25.430> if<00:02:25.490> you<00:02:25.550> go<00:02:25.790> for<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.000> position<00:02:26.330> where<00:02:26.860> you

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
in so if you go for a position where you

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.770 
in so if you go for a position where you
accidentally<00:02:28.400> go<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:28.580> positions<00:02:29.320> then<00:02:30.320> go

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
accidentally go to positions then go

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.630 
accidentally go to positions then go
stop<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.900> limitation<00:02:33.440> from<00:02:33.680> there<00:02:34.070> usually

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
stop the limitation from there usually

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.550 
stop the limitation from there usually
Contra<00:02:35.209> back<00:02:35.390> into<00:02:35.690> one<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.230> can't<00:02:36.470> go
