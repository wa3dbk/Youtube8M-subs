 [Music] 

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:12.070
 calm I come alone and without arms 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:26.500
 I would not go back to someone with glasses or if 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.500
 you gave someone with glasses is very clever 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.090
 Quiet, I just want to chat with you, 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.450
 I'm not interested in anything you tell me yet 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.950
 you do not listen to me you are not interested in this 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:43.390

 I just beg you to hear me hear 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.820
 that you have no idea what the part is 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.220
 harder to be king is to do what 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.410
 correct no matter how direct the 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.590
 point the point is that you have to 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:06.340
 help me even if it's sad, it's worth lÃ³pez 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.590
 you can never run because everyone 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.890
 it's against you I'm not against you 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.710
 he sought to protect her if they go on the stick to the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.229
 career will be added to the list of 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.730
 runners the gamers will be able to 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.190
 choose as your avatar 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.890
 when the farm arriving and blinking 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.280
 being 'how she is will believe that the 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.590
 game is broken 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.590
 and they will put us out of service 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.850
 subjects will be left homeless 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.180
 [Applause] 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.360
 and that you can not escape because it's a 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.360
 failure 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.479
 and when I unplug in the game 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.750
 and I am me with him 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:58.180
 Maybe that will never happen. 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.180
 players and what if not 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:10.110
 yes it is hard but the heroes sometimes 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.710
 they make hard decisions, it's not like that, she does not 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.950
 can run run but do not want 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.940
 listen to me so I'm counting on you to 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.940
 make him come to his senses 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.240
 very well now I think they should talk to 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.240
 alone 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.989
