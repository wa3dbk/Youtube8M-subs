00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289 
totally casual sporty shirt that I would

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:38.689 
totally casual sporty shirt that I would
worry<00:00:37.500> if<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.829> would<00:00:37.949> go<00:00:38.070> read<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:38.430> when<00:00:38.579> it

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
worry if I would go read it but when it

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.250 
worry if I would go read it but when it
comes<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.030> foundation<00:00:39.149> consider<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.050> can't

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
comes to foundation consider you can't

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.509 
comes to foundation consider you can't
apply<00:00:40.440> if<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.859> sweat<00:00:41.100> proof

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519

apply if it is sweat proof
I<00:00:41.550> don't<00:00:42.239> think<00:00:42.269> -<00:00:42.539> sweat<00:00:42.809> proof<00:00:43.019> it<00:00:43.230> it's

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
I don't think - sweat proof it it's

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.020 
I don't think - sweat proof it it's
probably<00:00:43.949> gonna<00:00:44.039> come<00:00:44.219> off<00:00:44.370> anyway<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:45.000> just

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
probably gonna come off anyway but just

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.639 
probably gonna come off anyway but just
to<00:00:45.239> make<00:00:45.359> yourself<00:00:45.449> feel<00:00:45.870> better<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.559> go

to<00:02:16.050> be<00:02:16.170> using<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.530> brown<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:16.890> because<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.160> feel

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
to be using the brown one because I feel

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.890 
to be using the brown one because I feel
this<00:02:17.760> one<00:02:17.940> adds<00:02:18.090> more<00:02:18.210> color<00:02:18.420> than<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.750> white

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
this one adds more color than the white

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.690 
this one adds more color than the white
one<00:02:19.080> especially<00:02:19.380> when<00:02:19.650> you're<00:02:20.340> going<00:02:20.460> for<00:02:20.640> a

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
one especially when you're going for a

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.010 
one especially when you're going for a
run<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:20.880> guess<00:02:21.060> light<00:02:21.270> would<00:02:21.390> be<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.540> little<00:02:21.900> bit

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
run I guess light would be a little bit

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.020 
run I guess light would be a little bit
stranger<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.800> wear<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.520> was<00:02:23.700> just<00:02:23.910> more

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
stranger to wear and this was just more

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.000 
stranger to wear and this was just more
natural<00:02:24.240> so<00:02:24.630> it's<00:02:24.810> called<00:02:25.050> 25<00:02:25.500> bad<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.920> the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
natural so it's called 25 bad to the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.130 
natural so it's called 25 bad to the
bronze<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:27.120> just<00:02:27.510> looks<00:02:27.660> like<00:02:27.690> this<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:30.140> I'm

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
bronze and just looks like this so I'm

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.270 
bronze and just looks like this so I'm
just<00:02:31.290> going<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.500> apply<00:02:31.590> this

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.430 

so<00:02:36.640> like<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.240> and<00:02:37.540> as<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:37.900> guys<00:02:38.020> can<00:02:38.140> see<00:02:38.290> it's

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
so like so and as you guys can see it's

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.140 
so like so and as you guys can see it's
very<00:02:38.500> nice<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.070> just<00:02:39.220> blends<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:39.580> nicely<00:02:39.610> with

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
very nice and just blends in nicely with

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.730

a little bit more of a shimmer this is

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.820 
a little bit more of a shimmer this is
the<00:02:42.970> way<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.120> go<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:43.600> it's<00:02:44.500> up<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.650> you

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
I'm going to go heat up mine and then I

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.460 
I'm going to go heat up mine and then I
come<00:03:01.090> up<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:01.810> now<00:03:01.900> I'm<00:03:01.990> just<00:03:02.020> going<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.320> curl

my<00:03:02.590> lashes<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:04.390> what<00:03:04.990> why<00:03:05.320> I<00:03:05.350> do<00:03:05.740> this<00:03:05.950> is

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
my lashes and what why I do this is

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.950 
my lashes and what why I do this is
because<00:03:06.190> um<00:03:06.730> when<00:03:07.150> your<00:03:07.300> eyelash<00:03:07.630> curlers

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
because um when your eyelash curlers

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.690 
because um when your eyelash curlers
heated<00:03:08.230> up<00:03:08.350> it<00:03:08.500> actually<00:03:08.830> holds<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.220> curls<00:03:09.490> on

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
easiest to apply it like this because

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.550 
easiest to apply it like this because
you<00:05:04.180> actually<00:05:04.509> get<00:05:04.750> it<00:05:04.870> on<00:05:05.020> your<00:05:05.139> face<00:05:05.320> so<00:05:07.560> yeah

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
and then I'm just going to blend this in

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.939 
and then I'm just going to blend this in
a<00:05:09.729> little<00:05:10.000> slightly<00:05:10.419> and<00:05:11.110> again<00:05:11.590> if<00:05:11.710> you<00:05:11.800> want

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949
