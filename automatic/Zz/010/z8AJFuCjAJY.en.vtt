00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.340
 to 3d printers are already a reality 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.460
 even though they have not interacted with 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.889
 one directly perhaps indirectly 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.390
 have manipulated objects printed in three 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.640
 of what we are seeing is the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.050
 evolution of the oil and it was thanks to a 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.880
 third dimension printing 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.500
 originally came up for the 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.239
 architecture because they wanted to take some 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.610
 objects something beyond that two 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.470
 dimensions however the cost of the 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.029
 technology was so high that it did not 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.220
 allowed to reach the entire public 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.800
 There are equipment that can print in 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.480
 plastic others in metal there are some that 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.179
 print food however the most 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.039
 important are the impression of prosthesis 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:46.250
 medical there is a person's case 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.440
 that could scan her ear mirroring the and 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.570
 then print a prosthesis of his 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.399
 same ear on the opposite side with the 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.690
 evolution of processors in the 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.100
 smart phone is no longer 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.769
 necessary to have a very software 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.899
 Sophisticated to do the scan now 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.850
 with a camera on a smartphone and a 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.100
 application is possible to do it without a doubt 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.500
 the 3d printers will be accompanied by 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.630
 Much controversy exists in the case of someone 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.850
 that printed a weapon totally of 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.220
 plastic could pass through 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.930
 of metals we are going to make a 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.970
 side that and we're going to print objects that 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.380
 be useful in Mexico, you can already 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.659
 find printers in third 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.430
 Dimension prices range from 15 to 20 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.799
 thousand much more and you can find 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.710
 also in stationery I have seen them 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.030
 for promotional items 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.770
 Customs that have printed or also 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.140
 this taste that with a mold could be 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.390
 make several sizes that you would like 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.830
 print then write us the email that 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.090
 is appearing on screen or also 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.520
 they can follow us in our networks 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.159
 social through facebook or twitter 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.970
 of youtube I used and this was 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.970
 login 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.040
