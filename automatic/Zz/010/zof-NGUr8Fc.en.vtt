00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.110
 today you are going to learn how to make a blackboard 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.760
 to make the blackboard we are going to need 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.430
 black gum paste 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.310
 you can use to stretch it a 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.590
 little vegetable fat on the countertop 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.570
 but in this case how are we going to make a 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.170
 blackboard if you do not have vegetable fat 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.180
 you can pour icing sugar a little 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.000
 because even if it is stained with pebbles 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.699
 white as it is a blackboard can 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.309
 give it even a cooler look like 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:50.060
 if it were chalk dust but good I've 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:54.940
 used vegetable fat so it does not stick 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.940
 so we stretch the rubber paste well 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.960
 let's say finite 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.480
 and to make this blackboard that is what 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.830
 let's teach how to do today 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.390
 we cut 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.390
 as if it were a board 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.840
 approximately that big and 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.840
 rectangular 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.869
 and it's more rectangular than before 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.439
 we already have the first part to do 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.409
 the planks we need fondant 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.909
 brown color of wood color and in this 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.490
 case already used a little sugar 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:49.350
 because vegetable fat always 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.020
 We put in more intense colors for the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.890
 rest of colors the best a little bit of 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.250
 sugar more 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.480
 and to do 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.080
 the boards we are going to take off this 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.890
 cautious 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:10.069
 to show you how to measure 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.660
 the planks and I bring it more here 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.660
 everything that you see is well worth 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.250
 then we are going to measure 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.090
 the length of each plank first we go to 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.280
 put two here and then inside of 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:34.160
 the blackboard 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:38.210
 you will see now seen is much easier 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.180
 let's measure more or less than this thickness 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:45.730
 this is already as much as you think it's worth 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.730
 but they have to be as thick 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.910
 same 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.480
 I'm going to repeat it 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.480
 again 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.220
 so that they are just as fat and 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.390
 let's start a third you say that as 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.810
 moves to see if the third goes the 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.430
 defeated you will see 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.430
 to see a third 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:29.620
 now it is not going to move now yes no 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:34.110
 I knew it was good to close with water or 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.110
 edible glue here 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.560
 and here 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.080
 not much 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.080
 and we put on this board 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.160
 and the one above 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.910
 and that's it and now we measure if in the 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.880
 inside gives us I think if it gives us 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:05.150
 for both sides d 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.550
 from the sides we repeat the 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.870
 operation we throw a little water or 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:15.230
 of edible glue let's fit 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.730
 from the top and with the cutter 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.160
 we cut 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.220
 to 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:28.170
 and we put it inwards so that 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:32.310
 It fits well like this and this piece that I think 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:35.280
 that will give us exact for the part 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.160
 that hits me for the part of the 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.580
 right 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.580
 if we have a bit left over, we cut it 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:49.909
 and we do not push in with your own 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:52.639
 cutter like this and now to give it aspect of 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:54.860
 wood with a punch that this what 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:05:00.430
 we explain ourselves in a very 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:03.940
 easy to mark with a punch stake 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:07.020
 well doing as ripples for 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.000
 imitate the wood that looks very nice 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.740
 now he moved it a little bit so that 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.940
 see what I tell you 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:20.550
 of the way of making wood that we have 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.069
 we are very easy very fast and 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:27.240
 it is very natural you will see there is no need 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:29.970
 that is accurate because the wood is never 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.440
 same so the more irregular the more 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.490
 pretty and more believable we surround all the 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.770
 Board 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.889
 with the explain remember to do it when 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.800
 the gum paste an inn in this be 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:47.069
 still soft so you do not rage 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.580
 It's okay to break it and once we have it 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:52.410
 so with white royal frosting you can 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.349
 write then in this case numbers 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.550
 whatever you want me in this case 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.550
 Well, I'm going to put a 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.550
 two 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.590
 as lyon 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.900
 Oh 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:14.110
 end and end and I hope that I have 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.110
 liked
