00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.069 

so<00:00:27.699> they've<00:00:27.849> done<00:00:27.970> a<00:00:28.029> really<00:00:28.300> nice<00:00:28.480> job<00:00:28.539> here

pinstripe effect rather than carbon

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.170 
pinstripe effect rather than carbon
fiber<00:00:32.710> and<00:00:33.010> it's<00:00:33.579> well<00:00:33.790> it's<00:00:33.940> not<00:00:34.090> to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
fiber and it's well it's not to

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.910 
fiber and it's well it's not to
everyone's<00:00:34.480> tastes<00:00:34.930> it's<00:00:35.530> actually

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920

relatively classy the great thing too is

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.189 
relatively classy the great thing too is
it<00:00:38.739> really<00:00:39.160> feels<00:00:39.370> like<00:00:39.489> a<00:00:39.610> sports<00:00:39.910> car

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
it really feels like a sports car

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.240 
it really feels like a sports car
basically<00:00:41.199> unless<00:00:41.680> you<00:00:41.920> look<00:00:42.070> in<00:00:42.190> the

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
basically unless you look in the

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.470 
basically unless you look in the
rearview<00:00:42.370> mirror<00:00:42.519> you've<00:00:43.089> got<00:00:43.269> no<00:00:43.449> idea

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
rearview mirror you've got no idea

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.380 
rearview mirror you've got no idea
you're<00:00:43.870> driving<00:00:44.170> a<00:00:44.260> wagon<00:00:44.970> so<00:00:45.970> about<00:00:46.149> to<00:00:46.269> hit

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
you're driving a wagon so about to hit

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.210 
you're driving a wagon so about to hit
the<00:00:46.479> track<00:00:46.720> it's<00:00:47.350> been<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.559> little<00:00:47.860> bit<00:00:47.949> of<00:00:48.040> rain

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
the track it's been a little bit of rain

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.149 
the track it's been a little bit of rain
so<00:00:48.729> mixed<00:00:49.420> conditions<00:00:49.839> are<00:00:50.110> probably<00:00:50.409> the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
so mixed conditions are probably the

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:52.469 
so mixed conditions are probably the
most<00:00:51.339> dangerous<00:00:51.519> that<00:00:51.940> you<00:00:52.059> can<00:00:52.180> get<00:00:52.329> out

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
most dangerous that you can get out

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:57.110 
most dangerous that you can get out
there<00:00:52.659> but<00:00:52.930> we'll<00:00:53.350> see<00:00:53.530> how<00:00:53.559> it<00:00:53.710> goes

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
this is our that exhaust there's just

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.009 
this is our that exhaust there's just
plenty<00:01:00.460> equipment<00:01:01.059> just<00:01:01.210> really<00:01:01.600> digs<00:01:01.809> in<00:01:01.989> the

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
plenty equipment just really digs in the

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:03.840 
plenty equipment just really digs in the
track<00:01:02.350> despite<00:01:03.009> the<00:01:03.129> fact<00:01:03.309> it's<00:01:03.460> getting<00:01:03.580> wet
