00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.919
 all the good building today I want 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.740
 conduct a metal cutting test or 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:16.770
 composite material is he not 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:20.000
 presented means ordinary crown with 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.720
 replaceable plate rub the blueberries it 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.160
 focus does not catch the task metal ceramics 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.760
 new composite material 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:36.809
 excellent production wanted you 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:41.700
 show that all new facets a bit 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:46.890
 erased in the work he was not something not 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:51.110
 caught focus wants tried because 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:55.800
 To show that is before processing 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:58.710
 after processing we will work here 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.190
 such an even roller is rather a finger from 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.780
 a car with a piston group 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.270
 as you know a little hardness and 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.670
 wear resistance and upper layer 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.820
 Oriented but I think the order is firm 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.810
 60 units also to this to the scientist 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:21.509
 This material requires that he 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:25.530
 hitting the rack that's not 4 types of gear on 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.380
 scene found so that there will be such 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.049
 chapter 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:35.100
 I will roll to the last while 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:38.750
 places and allows to process and we will 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.750
 see how the cutting edge changes 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:32.480
 made one pass took about ten scores 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:35.410
 the surface is very smooth there is still 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.410
 nothing sang us 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.410
 continued 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:52.880
 feed values believe processing 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:04:01.260
 getting worse cutting edges 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:04.540
 no visible wear and no schools and well 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.819
 he made another pass 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:12.390
 stand fishing line part of the parent 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:17.829
 after processing because on the lid 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:20.949
 characteristic brilliance somewhere after 3 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:25.120
 passage gone it's about 3 millimeter i 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:29.650
 took three passes deep i think mascara 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.780
 the platform itself details because 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.030
 as far as I know they are fingers 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.849
 just cementation is cemented 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.360
 something about a millimeter in some cases 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:43.270
 3 can not reach and here in some places 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:53.560
 the edge still firmly can 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:05:00.150
 check the details of the cutter if you can see 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.150
 you can see the cutter in perfect condition 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.330
 did some more dust 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:24.259
 to as much as possible 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:28.789
 reload the cutter here are the passages to visible 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:30.620
 roughness let 's say 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:36.590
 the most important thing that interests us 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:40.409
 reflected sees mean not worn 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:43.050
 wear visible marks I have not noticed any of 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:47.159
 the rear is not on the front to have steep 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:55.259
 tackle we work for a few hours of course 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:57.000
 No, but it looks like the cutter will stand in 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:06:00.150
 principle all all conclusions 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.449
 like who put like who need 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.289
 This cutter please help with 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.289
 the acquisition
