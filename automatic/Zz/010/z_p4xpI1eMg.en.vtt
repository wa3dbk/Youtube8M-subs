 activity created by rockstar careers and 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.150
 we are going to have to look for the career that 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.040
 it's called peak performance voucher is the 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.260
 which is on the mountain above in all the 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.479
 highest mountain where is the map of 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.280
 they light up and so on, you see 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:56.580
 Peak performance is what you have 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.400
 what to look for 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.840
 one is the initials are going to start and not 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.809
 It takes invitational and you can 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.150
 make your beige eyes we're going to 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.670
 ensure that classes are bikes worth 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.630
 it has to be bikes if not no no no 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.410
 there is a trick worth it you are going to play 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.510
 initials the initials all 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:21.730
 completely the initial several meters 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:24.130
 you choose the bmx confirm play and everything 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.710
 this is worth to get in and you have to 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.020
 get in people online to find the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.270
 Peak performance activity is a 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.990
 race make sure you're with the bike 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.970
 and play then once we are in the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.920
 mission we are already in we must 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.150
 stay around to come for the 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.540
 left to climb the path is set 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.580
 all right 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.950
 will make opposite sense because normal 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.759
 come on let's go backwards we let ourselves fall 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.470
 for this hill that is quite steep 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.490
 we go straight we notice that we have 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.860
 have to follow the same path that followed 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.080
 worth and throw us with this hillside is worth 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.850
 once we throw ourselves away we have to give it a 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.470
 time to the joystick down or not 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.300
 leave it kept down not 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.390
 once a little touch down to the 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.119
 joystick left flag and will stay the 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.150
 bike in this way if you notice you start 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.030
 to plan with a bestiality a madness 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.530
 in pÃ©rez you will start to fly and if you give 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.480
 taps to the right then 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.250
 we will start to turn to the right 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.659
 nine hundred years tim did towards the 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.879
 left then we will start to grow 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.640
 left to notice me at this moment and 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.260
 I was freaking I was planning and 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.379
 I started to turn in a curve to the right 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.220
 you can one pass is a pass and 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.930
 then it falls into the sea and money is worth it but 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.819
 what I tell you to notice here this takes 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.230
 that I did it again the island is a 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.720
 tap up and then 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.269
 they started planning an authentic pass 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.849
 in us that is worth nothing useful 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.010
 will be useful for series for 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.200
 flipar a little the colleagues I who 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.299
 serves in what is a very funny trick 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.849
 and all these things I like a lot 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.099
 and nothing he wanted me to know and if only 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.620
 it would be if it is some colleague of yours who was 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:06.970
 to flip then remember is to get into 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.920
 gta online activities are site of a 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.709
 activity created by ross is career 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.580
 we seek the dismissal of performance the 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.220
 we started we are not sure that this 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.110
 if we do not choose the mx when the 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.240
 we start we turn around already what 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.920
 crazy and already pulling the trick so nothing 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.110
