00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
designed it's actually one of its key

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.800 
designed it's actually one of its key
features<00:00:27.529> you<00:00:28.529> see<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.920> has<00:00:29.160> rather<00:00:29.910> boxy

screws<00:00:34.550> here<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> edges<00:00:36.239> which<00:00:36.630> are

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
screws here on the edges which are

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.500 
screws here on the edges which are
practically<00:00:37.230> holding<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.010> phone<00:00:38.160> together

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
practically holding the phone together

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.940 
practically holding the phone together
but<00:00:39.510> they<00:00:39.660> are<00:00:39.719> not<00:00:39.930> holding<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.379> back<00:00:40.680> cover

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
but they are not holding the back cover

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.170 
but they are not holding the back cover
it<00:00:41.160> can<00:00:41.399> be<00:00:41.550> easily<00:00:42.000> removed<00:00:43.610> so<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.850> screen

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
it can be easily removed so the screen

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.850 
it can be easily removed so the screen
of<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.719> HD<00:00:46.680> Mini<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:48.030> as<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.930> said<00:00:49.140> capacitive

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
of the HD Mini is as we said capacitive

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.049 
of the HD Mini is as we said capacitive
it<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.850> 3.2<00:00:51.539> inch<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.170> yes<00:00:52.739> multi-touch<00:00:53.489> its

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
it is 3.2 inch and yes multi-touch its

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.760 
it is 3.2 inch and yes multi-touch its
resolution<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:55.110> hvga<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.760> delivers<00:00:57.770> pretty

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
resolution is hvga and delivers pretty

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.529 
resolution is hvga and delivers pretty
decent<00:00:59.280> image<00:00:59.550> quality<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:02.239> let's<00:01:03.239> take<00:01:03.510> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
we have these capacitive keys which are

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.130 
we have these capacitive keys which are
pretty<00:01:31.350> easy<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.890> use<00:01:32.130> but<00:01:32.729> still<00:01:33.299> it's

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
pretty easy to use but still it's

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.200 
pretty easy to use but still it's
annoying<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.100> sometimes<00:01:35.610> press

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
annoying that you can sometimes press

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.780

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
them accidentally

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.450 
them accidentally
that's<00:01:38.790> who<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.299> think<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.259> HTC<00:01:40.740> HD

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
that's who we think that that the HTC HD

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.020 
that's who we think that that the HTC HD
Mini<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.390> very<00:01:43.380> nicely<00:01:43.710> designed<00:01:44.070> phone<00:01:44.579> it

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
Mini is a very nicely designed phone it

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.639 
Mini is a very nicely designed phone it
feels<00:01:45.390> incredibly<00:01:45.930> well<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.500> hand

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
feels incredibly well in the hand

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.910 
feels incredibly well in the hand
because<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.250> has<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.810> soft<00:01:48.810> edge<00:01:49.049> coating<00:01:49.649> on

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
because it has this soft edge coating on

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.450 
because it has this soft edge coating on
the<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.210> backside<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.189> it's<00:01:53.189> pretty

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
the on the backside and it's pretty

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.940 
the on the backside and it's pretty
natural<00:01:53.759> actually<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.450> work<00:01:54.689> with<00:01:55.200> with<00:01:55.710> this

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
natural actually to work with with this

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.910 
natural actually to work with with this
device<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:57.119> now<00:01:57.719> let's<00:01:58.020> take<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> look<00:01:58.590> at<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
device so now let's take a look at the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.030 
device so now let's take a look at the
interface<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:02.189> HTC<00:02:02.850> HD<00:02:03.390> Mini<00:02:03.420> runs<00:02:04.229> Windows

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
interface the HTC HD Mini runs Windows

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.510 
interface the HTC HD Mini runs Windows
Mobile<00:02:05.250> 6<00:02:05.700> point<00:02:06.030> 5<00:02:06.270> point<00:02:06.659> 3<00:02:07.099> but<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.310> top<00:02:08.459> of

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
Mobile 6 point 5 point 3 but on top of

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.359 
Mobile 6 point 5 point 3 but on top of
it

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
it

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.509 
it
is<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.580> HTC<00:02:10.179> Sense<00:02:10.450> user<00:02:10.659> interface<00:02:11.519> which

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
is the HTC Sense user interface which

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.390 
is the HTC Sense user interface which
does<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:12.909> really<00:02:13.330> good<00:02:13.720> job<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:14.400> personalizing

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
does a really good job in personalizing

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.940 
does a really good job in personalizing
the<00:02:15.519> operating<00:02:16.000> system<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.750> making<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.650> more

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
the operating system and making it more

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.080 
the operating system and making it more
user<00:02:18.310> friendly<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.040> idea<00:02:21.430> behind<00:02:21.580> the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
user friendly so the idea behind the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.509 
user friendly so the idea behind the
sense<00:02:22.720> for<00:02:23.080> Windows<00:02:23.470> Mobile<00:02:23.650> because<00:02:24.190> it's

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
sense for Windows Mobile because it's
