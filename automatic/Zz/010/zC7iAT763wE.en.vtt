00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
let's now look at a smaller one and go

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.400 
let's now look at a smaller one and go
site-to-site<00:00:36.920> so<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.250> we<00:00:38.340> are<00:00:38.399> at<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.579> end

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
site-to-site so here we are at this end

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.660 
site-to-site so here we are at this end
as<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.680> see<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:42.210> bubble<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> left

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
as you can see the bubble is to the left

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.490 
as you can see the bubble is to the left
don't<00:00:44.670> move<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.469> damn<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:48.110> as<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.350> see

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
don't move this damn it as you can see

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.799 
don't move this damn it as you can see
again<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:50.100> still<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.610> left

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.229 

again<00:00:56.680> still<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.520> leftover<00:00:57.969> in<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.090> black

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
again still the leftover in the black

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.439

outside so now if we just move that

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.620 
outside so now if we just move that
straight<00:01:14.110> across<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.149> other<00:01:16.240> side<00:01:16.509> the
