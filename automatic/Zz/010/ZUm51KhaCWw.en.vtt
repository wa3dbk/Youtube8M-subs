00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
to at least move the pin so just like

00:02:36.290 --> 00:03:12.120 
to at least move the pin so just like
that<00:02:36.819> it<00:02:37.819> doesn't<00:02:38.000> do

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.190 

so<00:03:13.130> now<00:03:13.310> we<00:03:13.370> have<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.060> line<00:03:14.300> chameleon<00:03:15.050> two

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
so now we have the line chameleon two

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.810 
so now we have the line chameleon two
though<00:03:15.230> with<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.620> jungle<00:03:15.920> Friday<00:03:16.130> kab

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
though with the jungle Friday kab

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.030 
though with the jungle Friday kab
actually<00:03:17.480> we're<00:03:17.660> in<00:03:17.780> Georgia<00:03:18.320> this<00:03:18.740> actually

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
actually we're in Georgia this actually

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.520 
actually we're in Georgia this actually
is<00:03:19.580> one<00:03:19.970> of<00:03:20.390> my<00:03:20.480> favorite<00:03:20.840> formation<00:03:21.230> stage

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
is one of my favorite formation stage

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.560 
is one of my favorite formation stage
although<00:03:21.950> I'm<00:03:22.250> not<00:03:22.490> mechanically<00:03:23.120> Avenger

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
although I'm not mechanically Avenger

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.450 
although I'm not mechanically Avenger
this<00:03:24.080> was<00:03:24.230> actually<00:03:24.380> my<00:03:24.590> favorite<00:03:25.130> in<00:03:25.340> the

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
this was actually my favorite in the

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.950 
this was actually my favorite in the
whole<00:03:25.490> series<00:03:25.760> just<00:03:26.300> because<00:03:26.540> it<00:03:26.780> looks

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
whole series just because it looks

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.930 
whole series just because it looks
really<00:03:27.080> cool<00:03:28.360> ahead<00:03:30.400> yeah<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.490> only<00:03:31.670> thing<00:03:31.850> I

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
really cool ahead yeah the only thing I

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.460 
really cool ahead yeah the only thing I
did<00:03:32.120> like<00:03:32.240> of<00:03:32.390> course<00:03:32.630> is<00:03:32.780> this<00:03:32.930> again<00:03:33.320> the

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
did like of course is this again the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.260 
did like of course is this again the
chameleon<00:03:33.950> is<00:03:34.040> absolutely<00:03:34.640> nothing<00:03:35.120> it's

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
chameleon is absolutely nothing it's

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.350 
chameleon is absolutely nothing it's
just<00:03:35.480> attached<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.590> pan<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.850> then<00:03:37.910> sticks

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
just attached to the pan and then sticks

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.540 
just attached to the pan and then sticks
out<00:03:38.510> its<00:03:38.720> tongue<00:03:38.959> that's<00:03:39.860> you<00:03:40.250> know<00:03:40.340> that's

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
out its tongue that's you know that's

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.310 
out its tongue that's you know that's
the<00:03:40.730> only<00:03:40.880> downside<00:03:41.060> this<00:03:41.480> but<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:41.990> actually

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
the only downside this but I actually

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.780 
the only downside this but I actually
like<00:03:42.680> this<00:03:42.770> one<00:03:42.830> machine<00:03:43.190> because<00:03:43.490> of<00:03:43.610> how<00:03:43.730> the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
like this one machine because of how the

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.880 
like this one machine because of how the
locust<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.420> know<00:03:44.990> that<00:03:45.230> it's<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.440> rare<00:03:45.590> case

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
locust I know that it's a rare case

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.560 
locust I know that it's a rare case
where<00:03:46.130> we<00:03:46.250> have<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.430> villain<00:03:46.910> as<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.240> combine

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
where we have a villain as you combine

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.699 
where we have a villain as you combine
them<00:03:47.720> to<00:03:47.810> hero<00:03:48.050> that<00:03:48.200> usually<00:03:48.440> doesn't<00:03:48.590> happen

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
them to hero that usually doesn't happen

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.280 
them to hero that usually doesn't happen
but<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.489> only<00:03:49.760> downsides<00:03:50.330> I<00:03:50.600> have<00:03:50.840> about<00:03:51.110> it

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
but the only downsides I have about it

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.250 
but the only downsides I have about it
is<00:03:51.320> that<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:52.100> can't<00:03:52.370> do<00:03:52.550> much<00:03:52.870> yeah<00:03:53.870> it's<00:03:54.170> a

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
is that you can't do much yeah it's a

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.020 
is that you can't do much yeah it's a
good<00:03:54.410> as<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.560> display<00:03:55.010> piece<00:03:55.040> but<00:03:55.489> that's

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
good as a display piece but that's

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.260 
good as a display piece but that's
functionality<00:03:56.810> is<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:57.110> do<00:03:57.260> much<00:03:57.500> like<00:03:58.459> it's<00:03:59.150> a

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
functionality is to do much like it's a

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.710 
functionality is to do much like it's a
really<00:03:59.630> good<00:03:59.810> especially<00:04:00.280> wise<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:02.540> other

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
really good especially wise the other

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.260 
really good especially wise the other
facilities<00:04:03.200> ones<00:04:03.440> do<00:04:03.620> have<00:04:03.860> a<00:04:03.890> better<00:04:04.270> you

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
facilities ones do have a better you

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.570 
facilities ones do have a better you
know<00:04:05.390> capability<00:04:06.200> than<00:04:06.410> this<00:04:06.590> because<00:04:06.980> this

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
know capability than this because this

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.630 
know capability than this because this
is<00:04:07.640> all<00:04:08.600> that<00:04:08.720> this<00:04:08.810> is<00:04:08.989> just<00:04:09.320> I<00:04:09.530> had<00:04:09.800> two<00:04:10.220> hours

yeah is the movie provisionally
combination<00:04:35.930> but<00:04:36.500> you<00:04:36.950> could<00:04:37.100> also<00:04:37.310> do<00:04:37.730> like

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
combination but you could also do like

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.700 
combination but you could also do like
for<00:04:38.330> example<00:04:38.390> take<00:04:38.870> one<00:04:39.050> of<00:04:39.140> the<00:04:39.230> feet<00:04:39.440> from

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
cook up either the the back with the

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.820 
cook up either the the back with the
wing<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.510> head<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:47.870> can<00:04:47.900> put<00:04:48.200> on<00:04:48.350> it'll

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
wing and the head you can put on it'll

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.640 
wing and the head you can put on it'll
be<00:04:49.010> like<00:04:49.220> because<00:04:49.570> Gehrke<00:04:50.600> ring<00:04:51.110> told<00:04:51.440> your

from Japan they didn't alter any of the
paint<00:05:40.490> job<00:05:40.580> but<00:05:41.330> it's<00:05:41.540> actually<00:05:41.900> a<00:05:41.960> Japanese

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140

importer<00:05:43.130> that's<00:05:43.310> probably<00:05:43.670> why<00:05:43.880> they

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
importer that's probably why they

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.340 
importer that's probably why they
originally<00:05:44.450> wanted<00:05:44.600> to<00:05:44.870> sell<00:05:45.080> it<00:05:45.170> for<00:05:45.290> a

originally wanted to sell it for a
hundred<00:05:45.440> dollars<00:05:45.920> because<00:05:46.130> this<00:05:46.610> is<00:05:46.790> actually

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
hundred dollars because this is actually

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.430 
hundred dollars because this is actually
important<00:05:47.600> because<00:05:47.630> they<00:05:47.840> have<00:05:47.960> the<00:05:48.110> original

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
important because they have the original

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.080 
important because they have the original
Japanese<00:05:48.800> writing<00:05:49.220> the<00:05:49.430> Japanese<00:05:49.790> weddings

in Thailand

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.910 
in Thailand

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920

so yeah it's the original Japanese mold
they<00:05:55.100> didn't<00:05:55.430> reissue<00:05:55.910> it<00:05:56.210> for<00:05:56.420> America<00:05:56.600> they

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
they didn't reissue it for America they

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.440 
they didn't reissue it for America they
just<00:05:57.110> took<00:05:57.260> stuff<00:05:57.830> from<00:05:57.890> just<00:05:58.400> toys<00:05:58.670> stock<00:05:59.120> and

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
just took stuff from just toys stock and

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.220 
just took stuff from just toys stock and
then<00:05:59.540> brought<00:05:59.750> it<00:05:59.870> over

that's probably why well we can get away
with<00:06:02.120> selling<00:06:02.360> it<00:06:02.570> for<00:06:02.690> hundred<00:06:02.960> dollars<00:06:03.260> you

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.640 
for the I know what you did you make any
sense<00:06:52.390> because<00:06:52.480> there's<00:06:52.780> five<00:06:53.050> George<00:06:53.410> that

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
sense because there's five George that

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.830 
sense because there's five George that
we've<00:06:53.800> had<00:06:54.100> five<00:06:54.460> Zords<00:06:54.940> and<00:06:55.090> many<00:06:55.240> seasons

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 
we've had five Zords and many seasons

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.050 
we've had five Zords and many seasons
where<00:06:55.990> it's<00:06:56.410> a<00:06:56.470> hundred<00:06:56.500> bucks<00:06:56.980> and<00:06:57.280> it<00:06:57.760> didn't

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
where it's a hundred bucks and it didn't

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.330 
where it's a hundred bucks and it didn't
really<00:06:58.120> make<00:06:58.360> sense<00:06:58.419> because<00:06:58.930> it's<00:06:59.800> just<00:06:59.980> this

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340 
really make sense because it's just this

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.270 
really make sense because it's just this
one<00:07:00.610> and<00:07:00.940> this<00:07:01.150> one<00:07:01.210> I<00:07:01.900> would<00:07:02.440> say<00:07:02.470> the<00:07:02.770> match

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 
one and this one I would say the match

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.909 
one and this one I would say the match
would<00:07:03.490> be<00:07:03.550> thirty<00:07:04.180> flip<00:07:04.540> them<00:07:04.750> but<00:07:04.990> Disney

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 
would be thirty flip them but Disney

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:07.890 
would be thirty flip them but Disney
just<00:07:06.190> doesn't<00:07:06.730> really<00:07:07.000> stand<00:07:07.330> up<00:07:07.510> stuff<00:07:07.750> and

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900
