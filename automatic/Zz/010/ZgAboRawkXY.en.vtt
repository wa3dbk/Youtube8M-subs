 present you but it's in nimes 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.120
 instinctual quite a lurch not 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.740
 the machine 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.379
 it is a shareholder and missionary to 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.990
 brand DSLR study swore exactly 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.939
 so who says marc jura says quality of 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.900
 finish exactly once there we go 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.220
 to be on a product that still 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.740
 rather classy they find 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.449
 really want really well finished and 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.519
 we think of everyone we think of all here of 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.990
 small loving supports and so here for 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.669
 brew the letting foam make are 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.190
 quite a hot chocolate are mus 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.050
 here for the mousseur exactly we have 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.640
 already replaced here and besides that 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.220
 to put his son in their 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.170
 learner see exactly and watch if 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.350
 it's very interesting then go super 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.590
 induction thunder actually here we are 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.270
 put the diesel container on top of 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.310
 editors and it's going to heat exactly 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.260
 so I show as the inside of 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.940
 teflon and yes yes it was good we are 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.680
 still in a pan but it's on 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.330
 a frying pan or even room to do 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.190
 not tread hung not to say of 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.520
 mark a name especially going to go I was 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.799
 not far away 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.900
 so he threw himself on it but a little 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.520
 little milk we will do a little by little 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.890
 the cemac to go with pleasure 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.380
 so I'm going a little bit here 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.520
 will be enough go i'll do but if and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.440
 if I have three positions 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.760
 she just comes anthony just to show 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.040
 a position that will light at the bottom 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.210
 it's for brewing without heating 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.680
 okay position 2 it will heat 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.140
 normally counting of course in 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.810
 creating foam yes and third 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.020
 positions so it will be very hot very 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.310
 hot 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.450
 then we will make available two 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.100
 because otherwise it takes too much holding 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.840
 it's true that the video here are the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.940
 first positions that brews and did 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.310
 of the foam law of cold swing version 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.100
 gypsy cold so this is Europe has 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.729
 the sails at 11.0 gas I like 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.229
 well then 17th place and his voice to 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.490
 those excellent for me even added 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.200
 a dash of hazelnut syrup in and 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.110
 we will put it in the tanned skin 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.690
 think swords showed two months to 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.510
 every year but only hazelnuts 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.720
 with the canopy so I'm going to put a 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.420
 small line of hazelnut syrup 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.159
 it was small history on jura 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.530
 hold during this offer let's go 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:14.870
 come back it's a brand of machines to 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.700
 Swiss automatic coffee ah good 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.230
 so this is one of the most 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.230
 quality of the market this is the most 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.670
 qualitative the most upscale 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.659
 what is the relation with milk actually 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.280
 very simple because it was 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.959
 they always manufacture machines 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.549
 which also had a management of the 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.640
 milk ip milk either be no more zappers 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.519
 a car cappuccino or other auto nozzle 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.959
 yes be other systems in fact the 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.430
 famous system one touch my car I want 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.930
 but there are models of course they 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.730
 do not have it such as the micro vitro to 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.140
 again the famous microban croats 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.750
 who are afraid of the management system 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.489
 tri66 milk the mistake but these devices 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.190
 exactly and there we see you already so 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.410
 they just pulled out what are we going 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.430
 to say sparkling moan it's beautiful 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.620
 this is super nice is beautiful 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.670
 looks like whipped cream or move 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.099
 the web is beautiful 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.900
 so since the last one the 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.730
 last machine output which is called in 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.980
 effect the microarn has no bus fear 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.500
 yes they necessarily took out the foamer 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.480
 next to let the possibility if 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.000
 we were wrong model initially if 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.829
 we did not think about making drinks 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.739
 milky yes to be able to do it with 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.829
 simplicity and especially with efficiency 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.540
 because we will see that it is amazing 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:29.660
 this is beautiful I think there 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.160
 it's going to be that very hot 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.959
 as you want to be there in the sahara and 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.030
 eon the series was going to stop i'm going 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.349
 just opened his voice super visually 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.930
 it is superb to have the good 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.910
 picture to show the quality because 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.669
 it's bluffing and I have a lot if the 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.840
 stainless steel container the wii with the 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.519
 maintaining if I encounter reports in 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.169
 rubber and weird shapes 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.150
 really heat the form like 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.620
 this could well have been well versed 5.8 to practice 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.720
 what is your beak 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.669
 there is however cons see that it showers 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.859
 very easily stop one can see 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:03.139
 still beautiful it's good I'll 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.699
 very very very up-to-date 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:07.940
 olhain looks at this wave instead 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:09.379
 oulala it is superb it is superb 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.079
 go ahead fills ben azzouz again 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.940
 visible here we stop here and there we go 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.829
 make an espresso tread over 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.329
 to do some tma ketou go see 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.930
 on the court maybe on the point 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.160
 Thursday on the project to go on the court 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.130
 and the thickness of the cream but when 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.969
 even we would eat the spoon 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:33.050
 maybe had to wait a little bit of 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:33.530
 maroua look nine years it's a 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.830
 movement 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.870
 wow then we should have waited for everything 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.219
 going on to grease the possibility to the 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.260
 foam to go up and this is one of those 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:44.300
 monsters themselves namely the attention 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.010
 teaspoon la wii is it you 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.020
 love the man to annoy me all the 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.729
 designer I think about these games breaks 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.280
 I show my customers it's huge 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.760
 it shows the gorgeous gorgeous standard 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.130
 superb texture 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.510
 Come on I tell you it's like 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.070
 if you had waited a little is 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.719
 it's a little bit of our fault then 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.030
 what we have we think about waiting 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.200
 but obviously we see that the level 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.030
 go back the others a little bit 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.360
 obviously expect the foam to 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:16.990
 up sees the same here 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:18.520
 this is the theme what jerome yomtov ski and 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.050
 lange and in the background it's great 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.509
 really very very beautiful good results 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.750
 fast and you really want to 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:28.270
 to taste 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.030
 yes go to bastien not one who 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:35.080

 empty the rest yes you always pass it 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.069
 just under the water then after me

 I use asus prevention mixed on 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:51.520
 the master of syrup to the enormous ones we know 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.169
 not necessarily recommended if you you m 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.870
 after the master after we will see his wing 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.669
 it simply if we see that it is a 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.279
 little bit attached to the bottom yeah to 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.349

 this way there and that the roofs the 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.939
 container of quickly at all in fact 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.460
 that nothing alas and the stores with me 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:15.460
 sitting but thank you 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.099
 such a pair the finish is superb 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:21.909
 very pretty very very very happy with this 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:23.560
 Product is convinced that it will be 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:26.409
 nice benefits of two bogeys 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.270
 piccino of bolat and macchiato with a 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:29.349
 hot chocolate mouth harry because I 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.080
 prefer a hot chocolate and obviously 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:34.089
 with that ensures with this little machine 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.560
 who is sensational not afraid 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:38.139
 words because a milk froth 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.219
 like that it's not true at all is this 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.960
 that she practices is only a machine to 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:42.240
 capsules of this type or other and we did not 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.990
 no goal is afraid we do not have 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.939
 Assisted obviously we can start 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.790
 it's okay to take a frother 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:54.200
 swears on is a capsule machine 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:55.280
 of his choice ok good side it annoys me 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.080
 you can withdraw when you want 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.320
 there you go there is no guts there is no 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.590
 of ergo it's just to ask products 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.170
 top of the line 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.550
 totally I'm wrong so damien for 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.940
 this discovery was very nice 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.940
 going
