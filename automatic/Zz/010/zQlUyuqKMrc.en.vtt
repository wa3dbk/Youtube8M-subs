00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
now this winter here was really brutal

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.450 
now this winter here was really brutal
cold<00:00:39.760> wise<00:00:40.090> and<00:00:40.620> although<00:00:41.620> it<00:00:41.860> doesn't<00:00:41.890> affect

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
cold wise and although it doesn't affect

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.790 
cold wise and although it doesn't affect
the<00:00:42.610> rabbits<00:00:43.059> I<00:00:43.270> do<00:00:43.420> think<00:00:43.930> that<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:44.770> fact

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
the rabbits I do think that the fact

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.340 
the rabbits I do think that the fact
that<00:00:45.130> these<00:00:45.340> best<00:00:45.790> boxes<00:00:46.360> don't<00:00:47.110> have<00:00:47.320> a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
that these best boxes don't have a

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.380 
that these best boxes don't have a
bottom<00:00:47.800> in<00:00:47.920> it<00:00:48.010> pay<00:00:48.399> to<00:00:48.460> play<00:00:48.850> Department<00:00:49.360> I

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
bottom in it pay to play Department I

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.479 
bottom in it pay to play Department I
think<00:00:49.450> they<00:00:49.629> just<00:00:49.660> got<00:00:49.930> too<00:00:50.110> cold<00:00:50.440> and<00:00:51.309> there

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
think they just got too cold and there

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.130 
think they just got too cold and there
were<00:00:51.640> some<00:00:51.820> nice<00:00:51.940> comments<00:00:52.329> from<00:00:52.690> people<00:00:53.020> that

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
were some nice comments from people that

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.889 
were some nice comments from people that
raised<00:00:53.739> lots<00:00:54.190> of<00:00:54.399> rabbits<00:00:54.640> saying<00:00:55.570> how<00:00:55.780> they

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
raised lots of rabbits saying how they

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.299 
raised lots of rabbits saying how they
have<00:00:56.020> to<00:00:56.140> go<00:00:56.260> out<00:00:56.379> and<00:00:56.559> check<00:00:56.739> those<00:00:56.920> around<00:00:57.129> us

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
have to go out and check those around us

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.330 
have to go out and check those around us
to<00:00:57.399> make<00:00:57.550> sure<00:00:57.760> they<00:00:57.879> don't<00:00:58.000> get<00:00:58.180> too<00:00:58.360> cold<00:00:58.629> so

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
to make sure they don't get too cold so

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.889 
to make sure they don't get too cold so
anyway<00:01:00.340> it<00:01:00.820> was<00:01:01.000> a<00:01:01.030> lesson<00:01:01.239> learned<00:01:01.420> on<00:01:01.719> that

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
anyway it was a lesson learned on that

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.529 
anyway it was a lesson learned on that
one<00:01:02.110> here<00:01:02.920> in<00:01:03.039> Minnesota<00:01:03.489> but<00:01:03.760> you<00:01:03.879> watch<00:01:04.089> all

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:04.539 
one here in Minnesota but you watch all

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.289 
one here in Minnesota but you watch all
these<00:01:04.930> being<00:01:05.229> made<00:01:05.500> or<00:01:05.799> you<00:01:05.890> buy<00:01:06.149> bottoms<00:01:07.149> like

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
these being made or you buy bottoms like

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.809 
these being made or you buy bottoms like
that<00:01:07.539> but<00:01:08.109> at<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.319> same<00:01:08.529> time<00:01:08.829> a<00:01:09.279> lot<00:01:09.579> of<00:01:09.609> the

00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:09.819 
that but at the same time a lot of the

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:12.690 
that but at the same time a lot of the
country<00:01:10.270> it<00:01:11.139> isn't<00:01:11.289> this<00:01:11.529> cold<00:01:11.799> so<00:01:12.399> I<00:01:12.459> think<00:01:12.549> a

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
country it isn't this cold so I think a

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.129 
country it isn't this cold so I think a
piece<00:01:12.880> of<00:01:12.999> cardboard<00:01:13.299> on<00:01:13.569> the<00:01:13.630> bottom<00:01:13.929> of<00:01:14.020> this

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:14.139 
piece of cardboard on the bottom of this

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:15.660 
piece of cardboard on the bottom of this
along<00:01:14.499> with<00:01:14.679> the<00:01:14.799> straw<00:01:15.039> wouldn't<00:01:15.459> help<00:01:15.609> that

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
along with the straw wouldn't help that

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.749 
along with the straw wouldn't help that
cold<00:01:16.119> air<00:01:16.240> going<00:01:16.749> up<00:01:16.929> inside<00:01:17.459> that's<00:01:18.459> nothing

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
cold air going up inside that's nothing

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.969 
cold air going up inside that's nothing
to<00:01:18.819> do<00:01:18.880> next<00:01:19.060> time<00:01:19.349> anyway<00:01:20.349> so<00:01:20.380> then<00:01:20.829> what<00:01:20.950> I

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
to do next time anyway so then what I

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.609 
to do next time anyway so then what I
did<00:01:21.069> this<00:01:22.060> girl<00:01:22.420> here<00:01:22.869> I<00:01:23.049> bred<00:01:24.029> about<00:01:25.029> that<00:01:25.240> I

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
did this girl here I bred about that I

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.709 
did this girl here I bred about that I
bred<00:01:26.619> her<00:01:26.920> when<00:01:27.759> this<00:01:27.939> one<00:01:28.149> had<00:01:28.359> little<00:01:28.599> ones

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
bred her when this one had little ones

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:30.719 
bred her when this one had little ones
because<00:01:29.170> she<00:01:29.590> did<00:01:29.829> not<00:01:29.859> have<00:01:30.159> any<00:01:30.219> that<00:01:30.490> time

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
because she did not have any that time

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.589 
because she did not have any that time
so<00:01:31.679> now<00:01:32.679> it'll<00:01:33.009> be<00:01:33.369> four<00:01:33.789> days<00:01:33.969> until<00:01:34.240> I<00:01:34.419> put

00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:34.599 
so now it'll be four days until I put

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:36.269 
so now it'll be four days until I put
the<00:01:34.689> nest<00:01:34.899> box<00:01:35.079> in<00:01:35.409> and<00:01:35.649> it<00:01:35.740> should<00:01:35.889> be<00:01:36.009> six

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:36.279 
the nest box in and it should be six

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:38.580 
the nest box in and it should be six
more<00:01:36.520> days<00:01:36.759> until<00:01:36.939> she<00:01:37.270> has<00:01:37.479> little<00:01:37.779> ones<00:01:37.929> and

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
more days until she has little ones and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.050 
more days until she has little ones and
when<00:01:38.799> I<00:01:38.829> put<00:01:39.069> the<00:01:39.159> mail<00:01:39.310> in<00:01:39.340> there<00:01:39.729> I<00:01:39.759> left<00:01:39.939> a

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
when I put the mail in there I left a

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.480 
when I put the mail in there I left a
minute<00:01:40.270> for<00:01:40.389> 24<00:01:40.779> hours<00:01:41.109> and<00:01:41.770> I<00:01:42.009> can<00:01:42.159> see<00:01:42.340> within

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
minute for 24 hours and I can see within

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.339 
minute for 24 hours and I can see within
the<00:01:42.639> first<00:01:42.849> couple<00:01:43.029> of<00:01:43.240> minutes<00:01:43.359> she<00:01:43.749> sat<00:01:44.020> way

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:44.349 
the first couple of minutes she sat way

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:46.649 
the first couple of minutes she sat way
better<00:01:44.649> than<00:01:44.829> she<00:01:45.009> did<00:01:45.159> before<00:01:45.459> and<00:01:46.239> I<00:01:46.419> really

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
better than she did before and I really

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.839 
better than she did before and I really
do<00:01:46.749> think<00:01:46.989> that<00:01:47.020> she's<00:01:47.229> pregnant<00:01:47.609> when<00:01:48.609> I<00:01:48.639> did

00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:48.849 
do think that she's pregnant when I did

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:51.899 
do think that she's pregnant when I did
them<00:01:49.119> as<00:01:49.359> I<00:01:49.479> waited<00:01:49.810> two<00:01:50.020> more<00:01:50.259> weeks<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:51.399> I

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
them as I waited two more weeks and I

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.409 
them as I waited two more weeks and I
read<00:01:52.149> her<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:52.950> she<00:01:53.950> sat<00:01:54.219> real<00:01:54.429> well<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:55.239> I

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:55.419 
read her and she sat real well and I

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:57.629 
read her and she sat real well and I
think<00:01:55.479> that<00:01:55.719> she's<00:01:55.899> pregnant<00:01:56.139> too<00:01:56.529> so<00:01:57.189> anyway

00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:57.639 
think that she's pregnant too so anyway
