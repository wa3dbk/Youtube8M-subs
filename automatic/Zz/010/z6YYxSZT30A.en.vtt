00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.940
 contradictory statements no

 allow to establish clearly who or 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.750
 who were responsible for the

 Juan Gonzalez Gonzalez

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:56.680
 from the right on the right side

 [Music] 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:12.390
 on the right side and where did the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:14.820
 car went off the track 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.830
 other versions that the light rail was going to 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.840
 speeding and did not have time to 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.850
 brake when you get to the known cruise 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.800
 like the orchard the experts of the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.659
 capital procurator's office analyze the 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.060
 trajectory of the vehicles the type of 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.580
 impact and speed we have that the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.410
 Light Rail 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.240
 moves a vehicle over 40 meters 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.430
 finds me on the train tracks 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.690
 light and behind my back is the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.190
 place of impact 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.290
 I want you to watch carefully 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.310
 my who finds this sign that 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.040
 the operator has the responsibility 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.840
 observe and realize that he has to go 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.119
 in its speed at 20 kilometers per hour 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.550
 but he also realizes back 20 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.530
 there is another pickpocket meters behind him 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.630
 Tell the operator what care they have 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.360
 that decrease to 20 kilometers per hour 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.789
 the question is how fast was the 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.560
 operator of that lightweight that was impacted on 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.880
 the cruise with a vehicle and dragged it 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.880
 40 meters back 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.560
 in that span of eight degrees 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.970
 in the next few hours it will be determined 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.170
 who or who are responsible for 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.910
 this accident 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.910
 televisions santos mondragÃ³n 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:30.959
 at 50 kilometers per hour but the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.359
 explanation is that the speakers that you have 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.430
 the train is 8 and that's why I do not know 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.920
 they hear from the six wounded there is someone 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.569
 which will be fundamental in the investigation 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.400
 It is Miguel de Caballero the policeman who 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.709
 was on the cruise assigned as 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.109
 banderero is to say the brand man the 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.019
 stop and the way to train cars 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:53.150
 they said buses like that of an accident their 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.150
 statement will certainly be flat
