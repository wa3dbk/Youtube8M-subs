00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
be a summary so this should be

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.620

following the summary we want to give
Restatement<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.869> thesis<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:12.190> basically<00:02:12.850> this

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
Restatement of thesis so basically this

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.270 
Restatement of thesis so basically this
is<00:02:13.240> just<00:02:13.630> saying<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.050> thesis<00:02:15.570> in<00:02:17.280> different

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
is just saying the thesis in different

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.460 
is just saying the thesis in different
words

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.770 

you

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.730 

okay<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:28.950> finally<00:02:31.110> we<00:02:32.110> want<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.500> include

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
okay and finally we want to include

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.760 
okay and finally we want to include
either<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.490> prediction<00:02:34.300> or<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.650> recommendation

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
either a prediction or a recommendation

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.190 
either a prediction or a recommendation
so<00:02:38.770> our<00:02:38.950> last<00:02:39.160> sentence<00:02:39.990> should<00:02:40.990> say

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
so our last sentence should say

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.050 
so our last sentence should say
something<00:02:41.710> about<00:02:41.860> what<00:02:42.459> we<00:02:42.610> believe<00:02:43.030> the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
something about what we believe the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.860 
something about what we believe the
