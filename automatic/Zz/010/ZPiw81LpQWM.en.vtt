for<00:00:23.310> sure<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:24.600> have<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:24.990> rasp<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.070> back

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250

it's<00:00:26.519> actually<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> kind<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.269> tool<00:00:27.510> used<00:00:27.810> by

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
it's actually the kind of tool used by

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.130 
it's actually the kind of tool used by
ice<00:00:28.289> carvers<00:00:28.920> ice<00:00:29.730> sculptors<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.840> make<00:00:31.019> the

ice carvers ice sculptors to make the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.290 
ice carvers ice sculptors to make the
fine<00:00:31.380> details<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.099> it'll<00:00:32.579> cut<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.940> hardest

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
fine details so it'll cut the hardest

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.840 
fine details so it'll cut the hardest
ice<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.710> throws<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.010> chips<00:00:35.460> into<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
ice and it throws the chips into the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.340 
ice and it throws the chips into the
back<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.329> scoop<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.870> don't<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.170> to

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
back of the scoop so you don't have to

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.709 
back of the scoop so you don't have to
go<00:00:37.500> around<00:00:37.649> trying<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.250> pick<00:00:39.030> them<00:00:39.180> up<00:00:39.300> off<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
go around trying to pick them up off the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.770 
go around trying to pick them up off the
ground<00:00:39.890> so<00:00:40.890> what<00:00:41.219> we<00:00:41.370> practiced<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.690> we

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
ground so what we practiced this and we

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.680 
ground so what we practiced this and we
know<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.200> do<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.430> what<00:00:44.700> what

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
know we can do it and and what what

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.380 
know we can do it and and what what
happens<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.860> those<00:00:47.280> fragments<00:00:47.969> of

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
happens to that that those fragments of

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.290 
happens to that that those fragments of
ice<00:00:48.680> will<00:00:49.680> they<00:00:49.860> go<00:00:50.129> into<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.520> ovens<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.180> be

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
ice will they go into the ovens to be

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.180 
ice will they go into the ovens to be
bacon<00:00:51.840> they<00:00:51.989> go<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.410> ovens<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:52.920> baked

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
bacon they go to the ovens to be baked

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.069 
bacon they go to the ovens to be baked
and<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.670> if<00:00:54.180> there's<00:00:54.390> any<00:00:54.539> organic<00:00:54.899> material

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
and and if there's any organic material

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.099 
and and if there's any organic material
in<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.860> will<00:00:55.920> come<00:00:56.160> out<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.899> vapor<00:00:57.899> that

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
in it that will come out as a vapor that

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.039 
in it that will come out as a vapor that
we<00:00:58.440> analyze<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.010> vapor<00:01:01.789> okay<00:01:02.789> we<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.149> time

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
we analyze the vapor okay we have time

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.539 
we analyze the vapor okay we have time
for<00:01:04.260> about<00:01:04.409> two<00:01:04.559> more<00:01:04.680> questions<00:01:04.920> we'll<00:01:05.189> start

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
for about two more questions we'll start

magazine<00:01:35.610> Peter<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.540> found<00:01:36.810> mentioned<00:01:37.200> a

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
magazine Peter you found mentioned a

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.929 
magazine Peter you found mentioned a
couple<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.560> times<00:01:37.770> as<00:01:37.950> construction<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.790> the

couple of times as construction of the

couple of times as construction of the
3d<00:01:39.810> space<00:01:40.110> because<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.799> arm<00:01:41.490> isn't<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.970> smart

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
3d space because the arm isn't so smart

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.120 
3d space because the arm isn't so smart
can<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.869> explain<00:01:43.140> what<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.500> process<00:01:43.860> is

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
can you explain what that process is

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.630 
can you explain what that process is
actually<00:01:44.509> like<00:01:45.740> I've<00:01:46.740> been<00:01:46.890> cautioned<00:01:47.460> not<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
actually like I've been cautioned not to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.850 
actually like I've been cautioned not to
say<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.149> arms<00:01:48.360> not<00:01:48.570> smart<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.200> very

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
say that the arms not smart it's very

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.340 
say that the arms not smart it's very
smart<00:01:50.450> just<00:01:51.450> doesn't<00:01:51.750> quite<00:01:51.899> know<00:01:51.960> where<00:01:52.259> it

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
smart just doesn't quite know where it

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.300 
smart just doesn't quite know where it
is<00:01:52.500> yet<00:01:53.840> he's<00:01:54.840> very<00:01:55.079> smart<00:01:55.380> for<00:01:55.619> an<00:01:55.710> arm<00:01:55.860> it

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
is yet he's very smart for an arm it

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.480 
is yet he's very smart for an arm it
doesn't<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.729> any<00:01:56.969> lies

the<00:02:05.200> stereo<00:02:05.619> vision<00:02:05.859> we<00:02:06.189> use<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:06.909> that<00:02:07.840> way<00:02:08.019> we

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
the stereo vision we use and that way we

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.440 
the stereo vision we use and that way we
can<00:02:08.379> measure<00:02:08.800> distance<00:02:09.429> and<00:02:09.640> we<00:02:10.090> can<00:02:10.269> make<00:02:10.420> a

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
can measure distance and we can make a

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.229 
can measure distance and we can make a
3d<00:02:10.959> terrain<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.650> then<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.459> arm<00:02:12.670> knows<00:02:13.000> where

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
3d terrain and then the arm knows where

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.150 
3d terrain and then the arm knows where
to<00:02:13.269> go<00:02:13.510> within<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:13.959> 3d<00:02:14.410> terrain<00:02:14.650> that's<00:02:14.980> all

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
to go within that 3d terrain that's all

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.830 
to go within that 3d terrain that's all
referenced<00:02:15.910> together<00:02:16.209> into<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.599> same

referenced together into the same
reference<00:02:17.080> frame<00:02:17.590> but<00:02:18.549> before<00:02:18.730> we<00:02:19.000> do<00:02:19.330> that

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
reference frame but before we do that

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.900 
reference frame but before we do that
you're<00:02:20.140> not<00:02:20.290> quite<00:02:20.530> sure<00:02:20.560> how<00:02:21.220> far<00:02:21.489> away<00:02:21.610> that

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
you're not quite sure how far away that

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.000 
you're not quite sure how far away that
surface<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.569> and<00:02:22.840> if<00:02:23.379> you<00:02:23.470> think<00:02:23.500> it's<00:02:23.860> one

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
surface is and if you think it's one

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.680 
surface is and if you think it's one
distance<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:24.790> isn't<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.180> can<00:02:25.330> try<00:02:25.629> and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
distance and it isn't you can try and

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.869 
distance and it isn't you can try and
push<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.080> through<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.410> surface<00:02:26.650> or<00:02:27.040> scrape

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
push it through the surface or scrape

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.460 
push it through the surface or scrape
above<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.360> surface<00:02:28.599> you<00:02:28.900> really<00:02:29.110> have<00:02:29.290> to

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
above the surface you really have to

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.380 
above the surface you really have to
kind<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.340> go<00:02:32.130> stepwise<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.670> be<00:02:33.819> sure<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.239> know

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
kind of go stepwise to be sure you know

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.539 
kind of go stepwise to be sure you know
exactly<00:02:34.540> where<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.349> surfaces<00:02:35.890> respect<00:02:36.459> to

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
exactly where the surfaces respect to

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.490 
exactly where the surfaces respect to
the<00:02:36.640> arm<00:02:36.790> coordinates<00:02:37.360> so<00:02:37.810> when<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.200> say<00:02:38.349> it's

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
the arm coordinates so when you say it's

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.660 
the arm coordinates so when you say it's
not<00:02:38.620> smart<00:02:38.860> you<00:02:39.010> mean<00:02:39.130> it<00:02:39.220> doesn't<00:02:39.310> have<00:02:39.549> any

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
not smart you mean it doesn't have any

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.729 
not smart you mean it doesn't have any
range-finding<00:02:40.239> capabilities<00:02:41.049> right<00:02:41.260> okay

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
range-finding capabilities right okay

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.830 
range-finding capabilities right okay
that's<00:02:42.069> right<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.760> arm<00:02:42.940> we<00:02:43.150> call<00:02:43.510> them<00:02:43.599> teach

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
that's right the arm we call them teach

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.190 
that's right the arm we call them teach
points<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.709> have<00:02:44.829> to<00:02:45.010> give<00:02:45.129> it<00:02:45.280> teach<00:02:45.459> points

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
points you have to give it teach points

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.690 
points you have to give it teach points
so<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.230> knows<00:02:47.620> where<00:02:47.829> it's<00:02:47.950> been<00:02:48.129> it's<00:02:48.280> got<00:02:48.610> an

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
so it knows where it's been it's got an

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.199 
so it knows where it's been it's got an
excellent<00:02:49.030> memory<00:02:49.379> right<00:02:50.519> but<00:02:51.519> you<00:02:51.970> have<00:02:52.090> to

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
excellent memory right but you have to

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.280 
excellent memory right but you have to
tell<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.540> where<00:02:52.660> it's<00:02:52.810> been<00:02:52.989> then<00:02:53.200> it

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
tell it where it's been then it

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.960 
tell it where it's been then it
remembers<00:02:53.709> really<00:02:54.010> well<00:02:55.140> that's<00:02:56.140> right<00:02:56.970> okay

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
remembers really well that's right okay

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.539 
remembers really well that's right okay
that's<00:02:58.840> going<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.260> be<00:02:59.349> it<00:02:59.470> for<00:02:59.500> tonight's<00:03:00.040> news
