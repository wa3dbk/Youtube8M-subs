the<00:00:42.329> front<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.200> example<00:00:43.649> as<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.219> see<00:00:44.399> is

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
the front for example as you can see is

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.990 
the front for example as you can see is
immediately<00:00:45.629> recognizable<00:00:46.559> thanks<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
immediately recognizable thanks to the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.900 
immediately recognizable thanks to the
perfect<00:00:48.510> integration<00:00:48.780> between<00:00:49.469> from<00:00:50.430> lamps

perfect integration between from lamps

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.209 
perfect integration between from lamps
and<00:00:51.090> front<00:00:51.480> grille<00:00:51.750> which<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.739> at<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.920> end<00:00:53.129> is

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
and front grille which is at the end is

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.450 
and front grille which is at the end is
one<00:00:53.579> element<00:00:53.760> 1<00:00:54.270> strong<00:00:54.780> sign<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:56.340> other

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
one element 1 strong sign and the other

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.389 
one element 1 strong sign and the other
part<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.270> lower<00:00:57.690> air<00:00:58.109> intake<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.100> both

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
part is the lower air intake so both

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.459 
part is the lower air intake so both
elements<00:00:59.760> are<00:00:59.940> immediately<00:01:00.570> recognizable

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
elements are immediately recognizable

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.310 
elements are immediately recognizable

technological<00:02:21.270> improvements<00:02:22.320> well<00:02:23.320> I<00:02:23.560> think

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
technological improvements well I think

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.620 
technological improvements well I think
this<00:02:24.910> is<00:02:25.890> among<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.130> specialists<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:28.270> the
