00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.160
 second year sophie pic and for the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.140
 first time at the controls of his 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.240
 restaurant all part of a meeting 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.240
 with his associate wine sommelier 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.700
 I enter a step so innovative very 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.340
 fresh and very current cooking that is 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.770
 recycle very quickly work from 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.690
 fresh seasonal produce a card hyper 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.550
 changing the pleasure what to be able 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.580
 to have fun for me too with 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.900
 the kidneys the to be able to make abutments 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.489
 quite quickly the map according to 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.410
 seasons manly game and his universe 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.970
 much more expensive to wear a lot more 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.180
 of holding 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.860
 it is 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.050
 well what to try to get people on 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.070
 what I love me certainly is not much 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.360
 Bordeaux because it's not 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.070
 inevitably something that I appreciate 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.900
 that people laugh at putting forward 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.580
 a few wines from the Wales coast that 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.280
 may be trying to fatten up the 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.840
 card meant the name of burgundy 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.760
 pushes you down gasoline on 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.400
 ribs of rhône and leather and more 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.810
 it's a bit higher and I think 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.570
 people who otherwise say we 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.500
 We are here to put forward and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.060
 leathers or and the idea of classic comics and that 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.040
 mounts a bistro around the kitchen 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.840
 focused on product work and the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.360
 pleasure of the wine me I cook 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.720
 who look like all religions 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.380
 live something yesterday I have no 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.220
 g20 specialties introduces to put in 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.990
 before our favorite, that is to say 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.380
 whoever you install that 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.420
 the meat is not written as 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.060
 goals of their Swiss struggle fc all 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.290
 a set a meal it's the entrance to 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.729
 dessert to be interested by all 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.360
 that's what's important it's 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.360
 Transnet 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.509
 do what I love is the affection 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.150
 who to jean pushes me to eat the most 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.270
 greedy 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.040
 that's where it is beautiful and good 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.370
 but good above all like that of his 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:14.040
 release of textures that tumbles into the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.590
 city that produces tonight to work 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.220
 proving to them that it is in room and in 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.780
 cooked 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.330
 this young team only starts 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.870
 have fun their inventiveness is not near 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.060
 to stop 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.830
