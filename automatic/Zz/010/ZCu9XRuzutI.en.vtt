00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
you think both about college sports

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.110 
you think both about college sports
being<00:03:36.230> as<00:03:36.440> professional<00:03:37.160> as<00:03:37.370> they<00:03:37.610> are<00:03:37.820> and

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
being as professional as they are and

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.000 
being as professional as they are and
also<00:03:38.240> about<00:03:38.540> Cardale<00:03:38.900> Jones<00:03:38.930> first<00:03:39.470> should<00:03:39.950> he

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
also about Cardale Jones first should he

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.160 
also about Cardale Jones first should he
be<00:03:40.160> taken<00:03:40.490> off<00:03:40.610> of<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.820> team<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.390> think<00:03:41.960> that

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
be taken off of the team I think that

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.150 
be taken off of the team I think that
they<00:03:42.320> might<00:03:42.500> have<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.710> problem<00:03:43.010> with<00:03:43.100> it

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
they might have a problem with it

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.230 
they might have a problem with it
because<00:03:43.220> he's<00:03:43.460> making<00:03:43.640> them<00:03:43.700> look<00:03:43.850> bad<00:03:44.000> and

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
because he's making them look bad and

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.000 
because he's making them look bad and
secondly<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:45.170> does<00:03:45.350> he<00:03:45.440> does<00:03:45.830> he<00:03:45.860> have<00:03:45.980> a

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
secondly the does he does he have a

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.530 
secondly the does he does he have a
point<00:03:46.160> do<00:03:46.370> any<00:03:46.520> of<00:03:46.610> you<00:03:46.760> think<00:03:47.000> that<00:03:47.090> the

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
point do any of you think that the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.330 
point do any of you think that the
people<00:03:47.870> who<00:03:48.080> are<00:03:48.110> contributing<00:03:48.620> so<00:03:48.890> much<00:03:48.920> on

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
people who are contributing so much on

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.860 
people who are contributing so much on
the<00:03:49.430> field<00:03:49.670> shouldn't<00:03:50.330> have<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:50.510> contribute

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870
