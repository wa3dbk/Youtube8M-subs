for me on the back of each cup is a
piece<00:03:12.280> of<00:03:12.430> paper<00:03:12.549> that<00:03:12.939> says<00:03:13.629> what<00:03:14.199> kind<00:03:14.379> of

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
sauce is on each one and again we only

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.720

sauces we made sure to keep anything

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.159 
sauces we made sure to keep anything
that<00:03:20.849> would<00:03:21.849> be<00:03:21.939> crunchy<00:03:22.449> like<00:03:22.569> the<00:03:22.780> the

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
that would be crunchy like the the

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.530 
that would be crunchy like the the
relish<00:03:23.859> from<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.250> tartar<00:03:24.760> sauce<00:03:24.790> out<00:03:25.209> of<00:03:25.269> it

relish from the tartar sauce out of it

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.689 
relish from the tartar sauce out of it
it's<00:03:26.290> purely<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.829> mayonnaise<00:03:26.949> base<00:03:27.400> and

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:27.699 
it's purely the mayonnaise base and

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.789 
it's purely the mayonnaise base and
again<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.329> point<00:03:28.959> here<00:03:29.169> is<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.319> you<00:03:29.500> want<00:03:29.709> to

again the point here is that you want to

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.050 
again the point here is that you want to
I<00:03:29.980> want<00:03:30.069> to<00:03:30.189> see<00:03:30.310> if<00:03:30.430> I<00:03:30.489> can<00:03:30.669> actually<00:03:30.790> tell

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060

so each time I grab a fried of hair I'm

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.429 
so each time I grab a fried of hair I'm
going<00:03:40.389> to<00:03:40.449> close<00:03:40.569> my<00:03:40.750> eyes<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:41.079> I<00:03:41.139> can't<00:03:41.379> see

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
this is tartar sauce I'm having a hard

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.170 
this is tartar sauce I'm having a hard
time<00:04:41.720> between<00:04:42.170> blue<00:04:42.410> and<00:04:42.790> pink<00:04:43.790> annoying

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.780 
time between blue and pink annoying
which<00:04:44.390> one<00:04:44.570> is<00:04:44.690> home<00:04:44.900> free<00:04:45.110> if<00:04:45.860> I<00:04:46.100> had<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.580> guess

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
which one is home free if I had to guess

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.280 
which one is home free if I had to guess
I<00:04:47.650> would<00:04:48.650> say<00:04:49.330> that<00:04:50.330> this<00:04:50.570> one<00:04:50.840> is<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:51.110> poem

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
I would say that this one is the poem

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.410 
I would say that this one is the poem
free<00:04:51.560> because<00:04:51.800> this<00:04:52.040> one<00:04:52.190> had<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.340> slight<00:04:52.970> bit

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
free because this one had a slight bit

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.180 
free because this one had a slight bit
more<00:04:53.690> tartar<00:04:54.140> so<00:04:54.560> we're<00:04:54.680> gonna<00:04:54.770> find<00:04:55.010> out

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
more tartar so we're gonna find out

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.680 
more tartar so we're gonna find out
let's<00:04:55.370> turn<00:04:55.550> this<00:04:55.640> around<00:04:55.700> see<00:04:56.060> what<00:04:56.210> we<00:04:56.300> got

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
let's turn this around see what we got

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.860 
let's turn this around see what we got
sure<00:04:57.620> enough<00:04:57.740> that's<00:04:58.040> the<00:04:58.190> palm<00:04:58.370> tree<00:04:58.640> so<00:04:59.030> I<00:04:59.270> am

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
sure enough that's the palm tree so I am

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.050 
sure enough that's the palm tree so I am
be<00:05:00.020> able<00:05:00.170> to<00:05:00.230> tell<00:05:00.410> the<00:05:00.500> difference<00:05:00.920> so<00:05:01.550> from

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
be able to tell the difference so from

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.770 
be able to tell the difference so from
this<00:05:02.920> non-scientific<00:05:03.920> test<00:05:04.280> if<00:05:04.520> you<00:05:04.610> will<00:05:04.780> it

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
this non-scientific test if you will it

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.810 
this non-scientific test if you will it
seems<00:05:06.230> that<00:05:06.470> an<00:05:06.770> American<00:05:07.400> that's<00:05:07.520> not<00:05:07.640> used

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
seems that an American that's not used

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.150 
seems that an American that's not used
to<00:05:07.910> eating<00:05:07.940> this<00:05:08.390> can<00:05:09.350> definitely<00:05:09.500> tell<00:05:09.950> them

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
to eating this can definitely tell them

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.440 
to eating this can definitely tell them
the<00:05:10.250> difference<00:05:10.550> between<00:05:10.670> this<00:05:10.970> and<00:05:11.030> tartar

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
the difference between this and tartar

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.540 
the difference between this and tartar
sauce<00:05:11.480> so<00:05:11.840> again<00:05:12.110> when<00:05:12.320> I<00:05:12.350> had<00:05:13.040> no<00:05:13.250> tartar

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
sauce so again when I had no tartar

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.610 
sauce so again when I had no tartar
sauce<00:05:13.580> to<00:05:13.880> compare<00:05:14.180> this<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.480> when<00:05:15.140> I<00:05:15.170> first

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
sauce to compare this to when I first

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.320 
sauce to compare this to when I first
tried<00:05:15.890> this<00:05:16.160> on<00:05:16.310> a<00:05:16.340> fry<00:05:16.610> I<00:05:16.850> thought<00:05:17.120> hey<00:05:17.300> you

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
tried this on a fry I thought hey you

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.400 
tried this on a fry I thought hey you
know<00:05:17.510> what<00:05:17.660> this<00:05:17.810> is<00:05:17.930> no<00:05:18.080> different<00:05:18.260> than

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
know what this is no different than

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.270 
know what this is no different than
tartar<00:05:18.680> sauce<00:05:18.710> it<00:05:19.490> actually<00:05:19.880> is<00:05:20.060> palm<00:05:20.930> tree

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
tartar sauce it actually is palm tree

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.320 
tartar sauce it actually is palm tree
and<00:05:22.280> again<00:05:22.520> I'm<00:05:22.640> not<00:05:22.670> pronouncing<00:05:23.180> it

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
and again I'm not pronouncing it

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.030 
and again I'm not pronouncing it
correctly<00:05:23.390> but<00:05:24.050> this<00:05:24.230> dressing

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
correctly but this dressing

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.160 
correctly but this dressing
he<00:05:25.790> is<00:05:25.970> definitely<00:05:26.210> different<00:05:26.750> than<00:05:26.840> tartar

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
he is definitely different than tartar

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.710 
he is definitely different than tartar
sauce<00:05:27.200> that<00:05:27.980> was<00:05:28.100> pretty<00:05:28.550> similar<00:05:28.790> so<00:05:29.090> that's
