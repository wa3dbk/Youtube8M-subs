I am placing the waves pretty high up on
those<00:02:27.600> squares<00:02:28.110> because<00:02:28.530> most<00:02:29.070> of<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.520> scene

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
those squares because most of this scene

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.720 
those squares because most of this scene
is<00:02:30.030> water<00:02:30.690> very<00:02:31.530> little<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.100> is<00:02:32.220> going<00:02:32.490> to

the<00:02:52.800> jellyfish<00:02:55.250> Thanks<00:02:56.310> set<00:02:56.490> those<00:02:56.670> over<00:02:56.730> to

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
the jellyfish Thanks set those over to

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.120 
the jellyfish Thanks set those over to
the<00:02:57.240> side<00:02:57.420> while<00:02:57.660> that<00:02:57.840> dries<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.620> little<00:02:58.770> bit

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
the side while that dries a little bit

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.090 
the side while that dries a little bit
now<00:02:59.640> I'm<00:02:59.850> using<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.450> frame<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:01.110> find<00:03:01.440> up<00:03:01.710> the

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
now I'm using the frame to find up the

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.910 
now I'm using the frame to find up the
line<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.250> up<00:03:05.340> with<00:03:05.490> my<00:03:05.790> card<00:03:06.090> base<00:03:06.300> and<00:03:06.920> adhere

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
line it up with my card base and adhere

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.300 
line it up with my card base and adhere
that<00:03:08.070> square<00:03:09.060> with<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.690> waves<00:03:09.990> the<00:03:10.890> problem

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
that square with the waves the problem

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.400 
that square with the waves the problem
with<00:03:11.460> that<00:03:11.490> is<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:12.180> shaker<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.780> smaller<00:03:13.110> than

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
with that is the shaker is smaller than

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.820 
with that is the shaker is smaller than
the<00:03:13.560> size<00:03:13.800> of<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.100> card<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:15.690> that's<00:03:16.590> why<00:03:16.800> I

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
the size of the card and so that's why I

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.380 
the size of the card and so that's why I
had<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.130> backer<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.550> I<00:03:17.700> kind<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:17.940> had<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.180> pull

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
had a backer and I kind of had to pull

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.640 
had a backer and I kind of had to pull
it<00:03:18.480> apart<00:03:18.570> when<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:18.900> was<00:03:19.110> done<00:03:19.260> because<00:03:19.500> it's

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
it apart when I was done because it's

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.890 
it apart when I was done because it's
hard<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:19.980> line<00:03:20.160> up<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.430> shaker<00:03:20.700> then<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.600> if

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
hard to line up the shaker then so if

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.780 
hard to line up the shaker then so if
you<00:03:22.140> have<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.560> backer<00:03:22.980> for<00:03:23.310> your<00:03:23.430> shaker<00:03:23.640> it

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
you have a backer for your shaker it

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.880 
you have a backer for your shaker it
makes<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.120> much<00:03:24.330> easier<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:25.110> went<00:03:25.680> ahead<00:03:25.740> and

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
makes it much easier I went ahead and

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.890 
makes it much easier I went ahead and
adhered<00:03:26.370> my<00:03:26.520> jellyfish<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.360> then<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.630> am

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
adhered my jellyfish and then I am

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.050 
adhered my jellyfish and then I am
stamping<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.710> greeting<00:03:29.160> from<00:03:29.490> the<00:03:29.550> so<00:03:29.820> jelly

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
stamping a greeting from the so jelly

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.900 
stamping a greeting from the so jelly
stamp<00:03:30.450> set<00:03:30.690> with<00:03:30.960> white<00:03:31.260> stays<00:03:31.650> on<00:03:31.860> right<00:03:32.640> to

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
stamp set with white stays on right to

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.940 
stamp set with white stays on right to
the<00:03:33.060> transparency<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:34.140> need<00:03:34.710> to<00:03:34.830> use

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
the transparency you need to use

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.260 
the transparency you need to use
something<00:03:35.340> like<00:03:35.370> stays<00:03:35.790> on<00:03:35.970> with<00:03:36.150> the

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
something like stays on with the

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.360 
something like stays on with the
transparency<00:03:36.870> otherwise<00:03:37.380> it<00:03:37.710> will<00:03:37.890> never<00:03:38.070> dry

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
transparency otherwise it will never dry

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.030 
transparency otherwise it will never dry
and<00:03:38.580> it<00:03:38.670> will<00:03:38.700> smear<00:03:39.290> this<00:03:40.290> also<00:03:40.710> works<00:03:40.890> great

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
and it will smear this also works great

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.920 
and it will smear this also works great
for<00:03:41.220> stamping<00:03:41.730> on<00:03:41.880> vellum<00:03:42.120> I'm<00:03:42.390> stamping<00:03:42.690> the

that ink I went ahead and used it for

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.500 
that ink I went ahead and used it for
all<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.680> my<00:03:49.860> bubble<00:03:50.190> stamping<00:03:50.670> even<00:03:51.000> though<00:03:51.150> it

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
all of my bubble stamping even though it

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.050 
all of my bubble stamping even though it
wasn't<00:03:51.840> really<00:03:52.080> necessary<00:03:52.650> for<00:03:52.920> stamping<00:03:53.910> on

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
wasn't really necessary for stamping on

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.470 
wasn't really necessary for stamping on
the<00:03:54.180> cardstock<00:03:55.070> just<00:03:56.070> for<00:03:56.250> consistency

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
the cardstock just for consistency

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.430 
the cardstock just for consistency
purposes<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.600> went<00:03:57.780> ahead<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:57.990> used<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:58.500> here

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
purposes I went ahead and used it here

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.840 
purposes I went ahead and used it here
I'll<00:04:01.440> go<00:04:01.620> ahead<00:04:01.710> and<00:04:01.920> stamp<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.400> one<00:04:02.670> more

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
I'll go ahead and stamp that one more

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.780 
I'll go ahead and stamp that one more
time

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
time

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.640 
time
done<00:04:05.790> with<00:04:05.940> my<00:04:06.000> stays<00:04:06.600> on<00:04:06.780> ink<00:04:06.990> so<00:04:07.200> I<00:04:07.230> can<00:04:07.410> set

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
done with my stays on ink so I can set

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.300 
done with my stays on ink so I can set
that<00:04:07.800> to<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:07.950> side

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
that to the side

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.070 
that to the side
I<00:04:09.890> went<00:04:10.890> ahead<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.250> added<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.820> third<00:04:12.240> jellyfish

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
I went ahead and added a third jellyfish

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.210 
I went ahead and added a third jellyfish
I<00:04:14.150> originally<00:04:15.150> had<00:04:15.330> two<00:04:15.360> and<00:04:15.960> when<00:04:16.920> I<00:04:16.950> was

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
I originally had two and when I was

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.710 
I originally had two and when I was
looking<00:04:17.489> at<00:04:17.640> it<00:04:17.790> I<00:04:17.880> thought<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.210> really<00:04:18.239> needed

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
looking at it I thought it really needed

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.570 
looking at it I thought it really needed
one<00:04:18.989> more<00:04:19.020> so<00:04:19.470> I'll<00:04:20.010> go<00:04:20.190> ahead<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.489> add

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
one more so I'll go ahead and add

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.310 
one more so I'll go ahead and add
definition<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.359> eyes<00:04:21.480> with<00:04:21.690> my<00:04:21.810> black<00:04:22.049> gel

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
definition to the eyes with my black gel

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.740 
definition to the eyes with my black gel
pen<00:04:22.350> and<00:04:22.800> then<00:04:23.700> I'm<00:04:23.820> going<00:04:23.970> to<00:04:24.030> take<00:04:24.240> some

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
pen and then I'm going to take some

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.830 
pen and then I'm going to take some
glossy<00:04:24.990> accents<00:04:25.890> and

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
glossy accents and

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.140 
glossy accents and
add<00:04:26.930> those<00:04:27.169> to<00:04:27.530> those<00:04:27.800> stamped<00:04:28.340> bubbles<00:04:28.730> to

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
add those to those stamped bubbles to

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.879 
add those to those stamped bubbles to
give<00:04:29.300> them<00:04:29.510> some<00:04:29.750> subtle<00:04:30.139> dimension<00:04:30.710> and

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
give them some subtle dimension and

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.600 
give them some subtle dimension and
shine<00:04:31.250> I<00:04:31.550> think<00:04:32.330> they<00:04:32.480> really<00:04:32.780> add<00:04:32.960> to<00:04:32.990> the

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
shine I think they really add to the

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.700 
shine I think they really add to the
stamped<00:04:34.610> bubble<00:04:35.000> look<00:04:35.150> there<00:04:35.449> I'm<00:04:36.350> going<00:04:36.650> to

projects like this and then my jellyfish
wasn't<00:05:33.110> secured<00:05:33.530> very<00:05:33.710> well<00:05:33.889> so<00:05:34.039> I'll<00:05:34.130> go

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
wasn't secured very well so I'll go

ahead and glue that a little bit better
I'm<00:05:36.289> going<00:05:36.470> to<00:05:36.530> take<00:05:36.740> some<00:05:36.979> foam<00:05:37.190> adhesive<00:05:37.220> now

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
I'm going to take some foam adhesive now

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.020 
I'm going to take some foam adhesive now
and<00:05:38.440> I'm<00:05:39.440> doubling<00:05:40.100> it<00:05:40.220> up<00:05:40.400> because<00:05:40.639> I<00:05:40.789> want<00:05:41.000> it

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.290 
and I'm doubling it up because I want it
to<00:05:41.120> be<00:05:41.330> a<00:05:41.570> little<00:05:41.930> higher<00:05:42.260> profile<00:05:43.150> so<00:05:44.150> I'm

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
to be a little higher profile so I'm

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.600 
to be a little higher profile so I'm
cutting<00:05:44.539> my<00:05:44.870> strips<00:05:45.349> in<00:05:45.560> half<00:05:45.590> to<00:05:46.340> get<00:05:46.490> the

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
most from them and then doubling them up

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.629 
most from them and then doubling them up
all<00:05:49.789> the<00:05:49.849> way<00:05:50.450> around<00:05:50.930> my<00:05:51.320> frame<00:05:51.740> making<00:05:52.400> sure

all the way around my frame making sure

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.029
