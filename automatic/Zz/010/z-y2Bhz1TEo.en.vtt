00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.300
 Hello everyone, today I will show you how 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.840
 make such a very trendy and stylish 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.640
 bundle decorated weaving you can 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.840
 pick up different pigtails to 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.000
 decorate your bun 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.130
 wait and generally omit this step and 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.320
 just create a large volumetric bunch 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.400
 I really like this hairstyle in 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.450
 combined with a large bow pin style 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.730
 today it's you taking advantage of mine 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.300
 false hair straps 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.120
 I already showed you the glam time stamps 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.890
 how to fix their high tail for this 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.350
 they need to be fixed differently than for 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.629
 other hairstyles on loose hair 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.510
 so if you missed this video then 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.399
 I invite you to watch it recently I 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.629
 showed you how to decorate such a tail 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.570
 lateral whip not 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.190
 and that's where we left off as you 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.920
 see I have such a pigtail 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.289
 spikelet sideways another pigtail spikelet 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.839
 from the tail it is useful to us 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.900
 subsequently to decorate our beam 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.330
 but again this stage is optional 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.190
 and you can omit it to create 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.680
 volumetric beautiful bunch literally 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.020
 a few minutes I grab my tail 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.180
 and threading it halfway through the gum 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.940
 it should be such a loop 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.910
 then i scrolled this gum once 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.850
 and thread the ends of my tail again 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.080
 through the gum 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.560
 should get 2 so big 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.649
 eyelets 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.240
 resembling a bar now to create 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.110
 my bulk sloppy bunch 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.180
 I pick a strand from the right eyelet 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.960
 I will transfer it to the left and fix it with 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.970
 invisible being 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.060
 as a result, the hair will take this 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.409
 careless form by themselves new need 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.869
 lock in the most winning 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.450
 position so that the beam itself is so 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.350
 round symmetrical they are skewed 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.350
 one way 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.650
 for the first version of this hairstyle itself 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.290
 I won't need a pigtail so for now 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.510
 that I will hide it inside my beam as 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.980
 as if she was not there if you 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.140
 gum visible 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.600
 then pick it up on one side 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.000
 beam transfer to the other side so 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.080
 to close the gum and lock when 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.450
 help invisible 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.340
 then secure your bundle throughout 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.050
 circumference 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.690
 what is the most interesting using this 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.300
 the technique of creating a beam every time he 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.310
 will look slightly different here 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.160
 almost impossible to get two identical 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.410
 beam for example the case of this beam 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.510
 I fastened less hair on my hairpins and 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.240
 I myself got a bunch more 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.480
 Air and the openwork beams like 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.610
 less hair and more air 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.580
 today my bunch turned out like this if 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.670
 I would like to dwell on this point, I 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.010
 would fix his varnish for the second 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.260
 version of this hairstyle will not need my 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.900
 little pigtail so I 'll get her out 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.330
 back from my handful of her i just 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.630
 wrapped around the circumference and fixed under 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.630
 hair 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.190
 Now this hairstyle is ready and you can 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.730
 additionally decorate with a bow or 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.220
 other accessories at your discretion 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.989

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.299
