00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
drone type thingy this time this one

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.060 
drone type thingy this time this one
will<00:00:12.150> be<00:00:12.240> able<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.480> fly<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.080> move<00:00:13.469> around<00:00:13.620> as

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
will be able to fly and move around as

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.039 
will be able to fly and move around as
well<00:00:14.400> as<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.610> can<00:00:14.730> take<00:00:14.940> like<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.389> know<00:00:15.480> move

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
well as you can take like you know move

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.800 
well as you can take like you know move
and<00:00:16.350> view<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.890> area<00:00:17.220> while<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.390> objects

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
and view the area while the objects

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.840 
and view the area while the objects
still<00:00:19.050> moving<00:00:19.410> across<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:20.220> it'll<00:00:20.580> pretty<00:00:20.760> much

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
still moving across so it'll pretty much

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.460 
still moving across so it'll pretty much
have<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> rotating<00:00:21.510> camera<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> bottom<00:00:22.350> of

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
have a rotating camera on the bottom of

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.509 
have a rotating camera on the bottom of
it<00:00:22.910> now<00:00:23.910> let's<00:00:24.090> get<00:00:24.210> started<00:00:24.720> with<00:00:24.840> this

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
it now let's get started with this

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.040 
it now let's get started with this
pretty<00:00:26.519> much<00:00:26.640> as<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> same<00:00:27.119> concept<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
pretty much as the same concept as the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.929 
pretty much as the same concept as the
other<00:00:28.619> one<00:00:28.800> except<00:00:29.070> without<00:00:29.310> wheels<00:00:29.550> but

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
other one except without wheels but

V<00:00:43.020> up<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.440> down<00:00:43.590> now<00:00:44.370> I've<00:00:44.820> set<00:00:45.000> my<00:00:45.090> movement

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
V up and down now I've set my movement

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.600 
V up and down now I've set my movement
speed<00:00:45.660> 2.5<00:00:46.289> because<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.860> prefer<00:00:47.160> having<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.579> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
speed 2.5 because I prefer having like a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.580 
speed 2.5 because I prefer having like a
slower-moving<00:00:48.329> thing<00:00:49.230> that's<00:00:49.410> more

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
slower-moving thing that's more

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.200 
slower-moving thing that's more
controllable<00:00:50.129> other<00:00:50.370> than<00:00:50.670> something<00:00:50.969> that

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
controllable other than something that

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.110 
controllable other than something that
will<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.480> go<00:00:51.600> completely<00:00:51.960> spastic<00:00:53.120> so

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
will just go completely spastic so

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.700 
will just go completely spastic so
that's<00:00:54.270> pretty<00:00:54.420> much<00:00:54.539> point<00:00:54.899> 5<00:00:55.110> for<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.469> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that's pretty much point 5 for that and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.510 
that's pretty much point 5 for that and
the<00:00:56.219> strength<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.149> 10<00:00:58.039> so<00:00:59.039> I'm<00:00:59.370> just

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the strength of it is 10 so I'm just

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.760 
the strength of it is 10 so I'm just
going<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.760> place<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.899> these<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.379> every

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
going to place one of these on every

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.100 
going to place one of these on every
corner<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.879> oh<00:01:04.700> shit<00:01:05.700> nevermind<00:01:06.600> there

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
corner of the oh shit nevermind there

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.250 
corner of the oh shit nevermind there
you<00:01:07.200> go<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.420> now<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.600> use<00:01:09.689> my<00:01:09.840> plus<00:01:10.080> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
you go and now if you use my plus and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.850 
you go and now if you use my plus and
minus<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.950> go<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.700> down<00:01:12.710> now<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.770> next

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
minus it can go up and down now the next

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.780 
minus it can go up and down now the next
thing<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.340> want<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.580> add<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.390> thrusters

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
thing that we want to add is thrusters

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.420 
thing that we want to add is thrusters
everything<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.000> better<00:01:18.479> with<00:01:18.780> thrusters<00:01:19.430> set

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
everything is better with thrusters set

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.570 
everything is better with thrusters set
your<00:01:20.520> push<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.880> pull<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.740> eight<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.070> five

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
your push and pull to eight and five

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.940 
your push and pull to eight and five
this<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.119> what<00:01:24.270> I've<00:01:24.390> done<00:01:24.590> thruster<00:01:25.590> force<00:01:25.799> is

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
this is what I've done thruster force is

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.440 
this is what I've done thruster force is
500<00:01:26.640> i'm<00:01:27.180> using<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> little<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:28.619> pop<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.729> 01

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
500 i'm using the little can pop can 01

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.100 
500 i'm using the little can pop can 01
a<00:01:31.729> using<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:32.970> using<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> rings<00:01:33.960> and

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
a using that one using the rings and

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.429 
a using that one using the rings and
energy<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.280> my<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> presets<00:01:36.509> i'm<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.229> going

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
energy as my to presets i'm just going

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.069 
energy as my to presets i'm just going
to<00:01:37.470> pop<00:01:37.590> one<00:01:37.650> here<00:01:37.860> pop<00:01:38.549> one<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:38.930> allows<00:01:39.930> me

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
to pop one here pop one here allows me

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.960 
to pop one here pop one here allows me
to<00:01:40.170> move<00:01:40.320> forward<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.920> back<00:01:41.130> really<00:01:41.700> slowly

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
to move forward and back really slowly

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.319 
to move forward and back really slowly
but<00:01:42.479> effectively<00:01:43.820> now<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.880> next<00:01:45.060> thing<00:01:45.180> you

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
but effectively now the next thing you

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.630 
but effectively now the next thing you
want<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.780> set<00:01:46.320> your<00:01:46.350> side<00:01:47.009> thrusters<00:01:47.490> so

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
want to do is set your side thrusters so

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.850 
want to do is set your side thrusters so
that<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:47.970> turn<00:01:48.119> now<00:01:48.750> upset<00:01:49.200> six<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.680> my

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
that you can turn now upset six is my

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.230 
that you can turn now upset six is my
push<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.369> one<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.939> means<00:01:51.090> it's

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
push for this one so that means it's

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.719 
push for this one so that means it's
going<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.810> side<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.460> just<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.610> it

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
going to be on this side I just so it

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.810 
going to be on this side I just so it
pushes<00:01:53.939> itself<00:01:54.390> right<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.610> I'm<00:01:56.610> going<00:01:56.759> to

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
pushes itself right and I'm going to

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.139 
pushes itself right and I'm going to
make<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.780> here<00:01:58.049> turns<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.490> then

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
make it so this here turns it and then

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.690 
make it so this here turns it and then
I'm<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.329> reversing<00:02:00.930> those<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.500> 4<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.490> now<00:02:02.670> I

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
I'm just reversing those so 4 is now I

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.440 
I'm just reversing those so 4 is now I
push<00:02:03.110> six<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.259> now<00:02:04.380> my<00:02:04.590> pool<00:02:04.939> just<00:02:05.939> click<00:02:06.420> it

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
push six is now my pool just click it

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.479 
push six is now my pool just click it
basically<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.229> same<00:02:07.409> areas<00:02:07.860> as<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.369> other

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
basically the same areas as the other

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.710 
basically the same areas as the other
ones<00:02:08.780> click<00:02:09.780> click

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
ones click click

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.770 
ones click click
it's<00:02:11.720> not<00:02:11.840> sick<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.830> allows<00:02:13.070> you<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.280> rotate

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
it's not sick that allows you to rotate

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.360 
it's not sick that allows you to rotate
your<00:02:14.780> bot<00:02:15.740> type<00:02:16.070> thingy<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:17.480> yeah<00:02:18.470> also<00:02:18.740> very

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
your bot type thingy and yeah also very

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.890 
your bot type thingy and yeah also very
slowly<00:02:19.670> but<00:02:20.630> doesn't<00:02:21.230> bother<00:02:21.350> me<00:02:22.060> yeah<00:02:23.060> so

there now what we're going to do is weld
it<00:03:44.420> straight<00:03:45.110> to<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:46.160> clock<00:03:46.610> that<00:03:46.820> we've<00:03:46.970> made

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
it straight to the clock that we've made

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.390 
it straight to the clock that we've made
yep<00:03:49.910> so<00:03:50.360> that<00:03:50.540> that's<00:03:51.290> that<00:03:51.380> there<00:03:51.709> that's

pretty<00:03:52.549> much<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.790> whole<00:03:52.940> bot<00:03:53.299> done<00:03:53.540> at<00:03:53.930> the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
pretty much the whole bot done at the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.289 
pretty much the whole bot done at the
moment<00:03:54.470> but<00:03:55.340> what<00:03:55.580> you<00:03:55.670> also<00:03:55.790> might<00:03:56.060> want<00:03:56.120> to

yep<00:04:14.090> I<00:04:14.239> get<00:04:14.720> a<00:04:14.750> sign<00:04:15.019> pole<00:04:15.320> now<00:04:15.799> explain<00:04:16.250> this<00:04:16.340> a

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
yep I get a sign pole now explain this a

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.089 
yep I get a sign pole now explain this a
bit<00:04:16.579> better<00:04:16.780> once<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:17.930> finished<00:04:18.290> it<00:04:18.470> I<00:04:18.650> get<00:04:19.070> a

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
bit better once it finished it I get a

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.590 
bit better once it finished it I get a
no<00:04:19.310> collide<00:04:19.669> on

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
no collide on

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.470 
no collide on
itself<00:04:21.170> and<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:22.310> plate<00:04:22.580> as<00:04:22.820> well<00:04:22.940> as<00:04:23.120> itself

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
itself and the plate as well as itself

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.290 
itself and the plate as well as itself
and<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:24.080> call<00:04:24.700> now<00:04:25.700> what<00:04:25.850> you<00:04:25.910> want<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:26.090> do<00:04:26.180> is

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
and the call now what you want to do is

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.180 
and the call now what you want to do is
grab<00:04:26.450> this<00:04:26.980> position<00:04:27.980> it<00:04:28.100> in<00:04:28.220> there<00:04:28.900> so<00:04:29.900> it's

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
grab this position it in there so it's

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.000 
grab this position it in there so it's
roughly<00:04:31.190> right<00:04:31.370> in<00:04:31.520> front<00:04:31.670> of<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.820> camera<00:04:32.120> and

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
roughly right in front of the camera and

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.110 
roughly right in front of the camera and
what<00:04:34.010> that<00:04:34.160> does<00:04:34.250> is<00:04:34.310> pretty<00:04:34.670> much<00:04:34.760> gives<00:04:35.030> you

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
what that does is pretty much gives you

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.810 
what that does is pretty much gives you
a<00:04:35.180> bearing<00:04:35.660> of<00:04:35.810> where<00:04:36.400> straight<00:04:37.400> ahead<00:04:37.520> is

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
a bearing of where straight ahead is

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.200 
a bearing of where straight ahead is
when<00:04:38.750> say<00:04:39.260> when<00:04:39.410> you've<00:04:39.560> turned<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:40.190> turn<00:04:41.120> the

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
when say when you've turned the turn the

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.540 
when say when you've turned the turn the
camera<00:04:41.510> you<00:04:42.260> still<00:04:42.530> know<00:04:42.680> where<00:04:42.710> in<00:04:43.400> Australia

pretty much in a straight dead in the

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.290 
pretty much in a straight dead in the
center<00:05:11.330> of<00:05:11.480> it<00:05:11.860> as<00:05:12.860> well<00:05:13.100> as<00:05:13.250> yeah<00:05:13.610> that's<00:05:14.030> um

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
center of it as well as yeah that's um

center of it as well as yeah that's um
we're<00:05:14.840> just<00:05:14.960> going<00:05:15.080> to<00:05:15.110> weld<00:05:15.320> that<00:05:15.470> to<00:05:15.650> it<00:05:16.510> this

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
we're just going to weld that to it this

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.540 
we're just going to weld that to it this
one<00:05:17.690> to<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:17.900> plate<00:05:18.170> and<00:05:18.380> do<00:05:18.770> not<00:05:19.010> robust<00:05:19.400> to

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
one to the plate and do not robust to

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.740 
one to the plate and do not robust to
the<00:05:19.640> COG<00:05:21.340> unfroze<00:05:22.340> all<00:05:22.490> objects<00:05:22.880> all<00:05:23.330> lucky<00:05:23.630> it

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
the COG unfroze all objects all lucky it

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.990 
the COG unfroze all objects all lucky it
didn't<00:05:23.960> increase<00:05:24.260> the<00:05:24.470> hottie<00:05:24.650> monitor<00:05:25.040> all

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
didn't increase the hottie monitor all

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.520 
didn't increase the hottie monitor all
right<00:05:26.180> now<00:05:26.540> we<00:05:26.600> can<00:05:26.750> move<00:05:26.840> that<00:05:27.020> around<00:05:27.080> as

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
right now we can move that around as

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.960 
right now we can move that around as
well<00:05:27.770> as<00:05:27.920> we<00:05:28.010> can<00:05:28.160> move<00:05:28.310> our<00:05:28.430> camera<00:05:28.760> around

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
well as we can move our camera around

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.740 
well as we can move our camera around
and<00:05:29.960> you<00:05:30.020> know<00:05:30.170> roughly<00:05:30.410> that's<00:05:30.740> center<00:05:31.750> so

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
and you know roughly that's center so

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.390 
and you know roughly that's center so
you<00:05:32.840> can<00:05:32.960> still<00:05:33.200> push<00:05:33.590> on<00:05:33.740> forward<00:05:34.100> with<00:05:34.250> it

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
you can still push on forward with it

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.670 
you can still push on forward with it
and<00:05:35.090> let's<00:05:35.930> just<00:05:36.080> play<00:05:36.230> around<00:05:36.350> with<00:05:36.560> this

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
and let's just play around with this

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.170 
and let's just play around with this
here<00:05:37.930> we<00:05:38.930> can<00:05:39.020> go<00:05:39.050> backwards<00:05:39.380> forwards<00:05:40.250> all

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
here we can go backwards forwards all

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.470 
here we can go backwards forwards all
the<00:05:41.390> jazz<00:05:41.630> and<00:05:42.640> also<00:05:43.640> we<00:05:43.730> can<00:05:43.760> increase

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 
the jazz and also we can increase

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.700 
the jazz and also we can increase
altitude<00:05:45.790> slightly<00:05:46.790> but<00:05:46.940> surely<00:05:47.350> you<00:05:48.350> can

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
altitude slightly but surely you can

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.230 
altitude slightly but surely you can
look<00:05:48.830> around<00:05:48.920> the<00:05:49.130> room<00:05:49.280> with<00:05:49.820> it<00:05:49.940> and<00:05:51.100> yeah<00:05:52.100> oh

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.870 

pardon<00:05:56.240> me<00:05:56.440> uh<00:05:57.440> yeah<00:05:58.010> you<00:05:58.070> can<00:05:58.280> just<00:05:58.400> lift<00:05:58.730> up

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
pardon me uh yeah you can just lift up

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.700 
pardon me uh yeah you can just lift up
as<00:05:59.390> high<00:05:59.450> as<00:05:59.570> you<00:05:59.750> feel<00:05:59.810> like<00:06:00.140> always<00:06:00.440> hides

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
with it I think there's an issue with

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.940 
with it I think there's an issue with
the<00:06:05.540> arm<00:06:05.660> pole<00:06:06.080> being<00:06:06.320> in<00:06:06.410> the<00:06:06.470> road<00:06:06.650> of<00:06:06.890> the

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
the arm pole being in the road of the

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.240 
the arm pole being in the road of the
camera<00:06:07.430> but<00:06:07.640> all<00:06:08.570> not<00:06:08.810> my<00:06:09.380> problem<00:06:09.830> at<00:06:10.190> the

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
camera but all not my problem at the

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.100 
camera but all not my problem at the
moment<00:06:10.280> I'd<00:06:10.730> say<00:06:11.150> just<00:06:11.330> put<00:06:11.480> an<00:06:11.570> OPA<00:06:11.840> light<00:06:11.990> on

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
moment I'd say just put an OPA light on

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.430 
moment I'd say just put an OPA light on
the<00:06:12.200> on<00:06:12.500> the<00:06:12.530> camera<00:06:12.890> to<00:06:13.580> the<00:06:13.610> pole<00:06:13.880> and<00:06:14.440> yeah

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
the on the camera to the pole and yeah
