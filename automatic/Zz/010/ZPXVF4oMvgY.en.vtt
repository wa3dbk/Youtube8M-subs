something my mom shared was right but my
ship<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.830> wasn't<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.430> needed<00:01:14.760> something<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.090> bit

lighter<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.290> guess<00:01:16.650> he<00:01:16.740> didn't<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.220> so

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
lighter and I guess he didn't have it so

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.340 
lighter and I guess he didn't have it so
anyway<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.240> ended<00:01:18.270> up<00:01:18.509> getting<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.810> one<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.789 
anyway I ended up getting that one and
back<00:01:19.740> then<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.520> was<00:01:21.090> fine<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.390> mean<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:22.080> wore<00:01:22.560> of

the occasions when I had a function so I

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.590 
the occasions when I had a function so I
call<00:01:26.070> ready<00:01:26.220> go<00:01:26.640> special<00:01:26.970> occasion<00:01:27.390> then<00:01:27.570> I

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
call ready go special occasion then I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.120 
call ready go special occasion then I
would<00:01:27.840> wear<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.259> wasn't<00:01:28.619> something<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.950> bought

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
all the time and back then I guess I

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.499 
all the time and back then I guess I
didn't<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.100> any<00:01:32.280> problems<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.299> back

didn't have any problems but then back

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.870 
didn't have any problems but then back
then<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.110> guess<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.680> wasn't<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.310> concerned<00:01:35.549> about

then I guess I wasn't so concerned about

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.600 
then I guess I wasn't so concerned about
what<00:01:36.180> was<00:01:36.299> going<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.659> my<00:01:36.810> skin<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.409> now<00:01:38.400> it's

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
was like try it I didn't actually

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.149

actually<00:01:56.399> trying<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.790> foundation<00:01:57.270> again

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
actually trying that foundation again

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.550 
actually trying that foundation again
just<00:01:57.689> because<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.930> last<00:01:58.079> time<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.350> tried<00:01:58.530> it

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
just because the last time I tried it

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.319 
just because the last time I tried it
was<00:01:58.829> quite<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> few<00:01:59.640> years<00:01:59.820> ago<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.149> I'd<00:02:00.210> love

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
was quite a few years ago and I'd love

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.880 
was quite a few years ago and I'd love
to<00:02:00.390> try<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.659> again<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.079> just<00:02:01.350> guessed<00:02:01.649> my

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
to try it again so I just guessed my

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.679 
to try it again so I just guessed my
 I<00:02:02.280> didn't<00:02:02.640> go<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.969> counter<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.390> try

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
 I didn't go to the counter to try

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.069 
 I didn't go to the counter to try
this

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
this

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.950 
this
I<00:02:04.110> guess<00:02:04.619> my<00:02:04.770> shade<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.719> 2w<00:02:06.719> -

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
I guess my shade and this is in 2w -

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.449 
I guess my shade and this is in 2w -
Ratan<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.190> think<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.030> Ratan<00:02:09.360> 84<00:02:09.989> or<00:02:10.259> Ratan<00:02:11.190> and

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
Ratan I think it's Ratan 84 or Ratan and

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.990 
Ratan I think it's Ratan 84 or Ratan and
but<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.300> children

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
but it is children

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.830 
but it is children
so<00:02:13.120> it's<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.480> bit<00:02:13.630> more<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:14.110> a<00:02:14.470> yellow<00:02:14.890> undertone

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
so it's a bit more of a yellow undertone

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.120 
so it's a bit more of a yellow undertone
I'll<00:02:16.840> just<00:02:17.140> watch<00:02:17.350> on<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.590> back<00:02:17.710> of<00:02:17.830> my<00:02:17.920> hand

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
I'll just watch on the back of my hand

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.700 
I'll just watch on the back of my hand
so<00:02:18.460> so<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.030> can<00:02:19.300> actually<00:02:19.420> see<00:02:19.870> what<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.560> is

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
so so you can actually see what it is

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.400 
so so you can actually see what it is
like<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.820> is<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:21.940> bit<00:02:22.150> more<00:02:22.360> yellowy<00:02:22.750> but<00:02:23.200> I

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
like so it is a bit more yellowy but I

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.160 
like so it is a bit more yellowy but I
guess<00:02:23.710> if<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.190> powder<00:02:24.520> up<00:02:24.910> so<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:25.420> have<00:02:25.900> tried

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
guess if you powder up so I have tried

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.900 
guess if you powder up so I have tried
this<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:28.150> did<00:02:28.510> powder<00:02:28.810> upon<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.910> it

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
this and I did powder upon it and it

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.450 
this and I did powder upon it and it
worked<00:02:31.270> more<00:02:31.810> or<00:02:31.990> less<00:02:32.170> fine<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.860> was<00:02:33.070> okay<00:02:33.430> so

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
worked more or less fine it was okay so

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.240 
worked more or less fine it was okay so
this<00:02:33.820> is<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.240> swatch<00:02:34.600> of<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:34.990> it<00:02:35.470> went<00:02:35.860> more<00:02:36.100> or

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
this is the swatch of it it went more or

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.430 
this is the swatch of it it went more or
less<00:02:36.400> fine<00:02:36.640> with<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.240> powder<00:02:37.510> so<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.260> could

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
less fine with the powder so you could

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.990 
less fine with the powder so you could
see<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.770> difference<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.490> could<00:02:39.640> well<00:02:39.820> you

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
see the difference you could well you

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.670 
see the difference you could well you
care<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.300> see<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.480> big<00:02:40.690> difference<00:02:40.720> where<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.500> put

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
care to see a big difference where I put

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.010 
care to see a big difference where I put
the<00:02:41.770> foundation<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:43.360> natural<00:02:43.810> color<00:02:43.990> of

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
the foundation and the natural color of

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.040 
the foundation and the natural color of
my<00:02:44.380> skin<00:02:44.610> so<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.970> would<00:02:46.150> have<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.390> be<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.570> tad<00:02:46.840> bit

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
my skin so it would have to be a tad bit

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.940 
my skin so it would have to be a tad bit
darker<00:02:47.500> but<00:02:48.160> otherwise<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.850> was<00:02:49.000> fine<00:02:49.890> when<00:02:50.890> I

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
darker but otherwise it was fine when I

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.220 
darker but otherwise it was fine when I
paired<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.459> up<00:02:51.550> with<00:02:51.610> a<00:02:51.760> powder<00:02:52.060> now<00:02:52.870> let<00:02:53.110> me

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
paired it up with a powder now let me

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.690

tell<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.440> my<00:02:53.709> little<00:02:53.890> story<00:02:54.250> about<00:02:54.310> when<00:02:54.670> I

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
tell you my little story about when I

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.110 
tell you my little story about when I
worn<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.330> I<00:02:55.540> did<00:02:56.200> not<00:02:56.470> like<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:57.340> feel<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:57.700> it

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
worn it I did not like the feel of it

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.870 
worn it I did not like the feel of it
the<00:02:58.360> feel<00:02:59.050> of<00:02:59.080> it<00:02:59.350> for<00:02:59.620> me<00:02:59.800> it<00:03:00.010> really<00:03:00.310> felt<00:03:00.730> as

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
the feel of it for me it really felt as

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.560 
the feel of it for me it really felt as
if<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.240> could<00:03:01.480> not<00:03:01.630> smile<00:03:02.050> and<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:03.550> felt<00:03:03.820> as<00:03:03.940> if<00:03:04.060> I

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
if I could not smile and it felt as if I

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.650 
if I could not smile and it felt as if I
was<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.900> smile<00:03:05.260> hysterically<00:03:06.010> laugh<00:03:06.340> or

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
was to smile hysterically laugh or

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.030 
was to smile hysterically laugh or
express<00:03:07.660> any<00:03:07.690> sort<00:03:08.350> of<00:03:08.380> expression<00:03:08.890> like

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
express any sort of expression like

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.250 
express any sort of expression like
facial<00:03:09.250> expressions<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:10.090> felt<00:03:10.630> as<00:03:10.750> if<00:03:10.870> lines

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
facial expressions I felt as if lines

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.760 
facial expressions I felt as if lines
would<00:03:11.620> remain<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:13.630> just<00:03:14.290> did<00:03:14.410> not<00:03:14.560> feel

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
would remain and I just did not feel

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.670 
would remain and I just did not feel
comfortable<00:03:15.580> in<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.850> my<00:03:16.780> husband<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.470> I

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
comfortable in it my husband and I

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.290 
comfortable in it my husband and I
decided<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.250> go<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.640> movies<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.180> I

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
decided to go to the movies and I

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.520 
decided to go to the movies and I
thought<00:03:19.450> that<00:03:19.630> this<00:03:19.780> is<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:19.989> best<00:03:20.200> time<00:03:20.500> to

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
thought that this is the best time to

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.370 
thought that this is the best time to
try<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.190> just<00:03:21.370> because<00:03:21.940> one<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:22.930> were<00:03:23.140> going

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
try it just because one I were going

of my like the darker sky ring so I've

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.180 
of my like the darker sky ring so I've
got<00:04:28.000> on<00:04:28.150> this<00:04:28.360> side<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:28.840> let's<00:04:29.650> just<00:04:29.830> say<00:04:29.950> the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
got on this side and let's just say the

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.520 
got on this side and let's just say the
red<00:04:30.639> dots<00:04:30.910> that<00:04:31.030> I've<00:04:31.180> got<00:04:31.419> as<00:04:31.540> well<00:04:31.720> I<00:04:31.990> had<00:04:32.380> to

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
red dots that I've got as well I had to

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.170 
red dots that I've got as well I had to
build<00:04:32.650> up<00:04:32.860> on<00:04:33.040> it<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.220> bit<00:04:33.400> more<00:04:33.639> in<00:04:33.820> order<00:04:33.910> to

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
build up on it a bit more in order to

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.830 
build up on it a bit more in order to
cover<00:04:34.389> that<00:04:34.650> so<00:04:35.650> I<00:04:35.710> guess<00:04:35.919> I<00:04:35.950> did<00:04:36.250> one<00:04:36.550> lock<00:04:36.840> not

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.629 
cover that so I guess I did one lock not
using<00:04:38.290> a<00:04:38.440> lot<00:04:38.590> of<00:04:38.650> foundation<00:04:39.280> just<00:04:39.400> cooked

all of my face and I just concentrated

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.540 
all of my face and I just concentrated
round<00:04:41.950> here

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
round here

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.120 
round here
I<00:04:42.580> set<00:04:43.090> it<00:04:43.210> with<00:04:43.360> powder<00:04:43.389> as<00:04:43.930> well<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:45.010> then

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
I set it with powder as well and then

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.000 
I set it with powder as well and then
that<00:04:45.160> was<00:04:45.490> it<00:04:45.520> but<00:04:46.360> I<00:04:46.540> just<00:04:46.750> felt<00:04:47.020> like<00:04:47.200> for<00:04:47.800> me

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
that was it but I just felt like for me

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.240 
that was it but I just felt like for me
it<00:04:48.340> was<00:04:48.700> too<00:04:49.090> heavy<00:04:49.720> I<00:04:50.050> did<00:04:50.230> not<00:04:50.530> like<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:51.010> feel

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.909 
it was too heavy I did not like the feel
of<00:04:51.280> it<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:51.760> I<00:04:52.300> know<00:04:52.419> I<00:04:52.930> did<00:04:53.169> a<00:04:53.230> triple<00:04:53.560> estate

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
of it and I know I did a triple estate

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.010 
of it and I know I did a triple estate
so<00:04:54.160> a<00:04:54.550> lot<00:04:54.730> of<00:04:54.760> girls<00:04:55.060> were<00:04:55.150> saying<00:04:55.360> that<00:04:55.630> is<00:04:55.810> my
