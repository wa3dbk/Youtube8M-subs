the photo and the People Hub so it's

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.640 
the photo and the People Hub so it's
worth<00:00:12.150> noting<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.599> Windows<00:00:12.960> 8<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.139> still<00:00:13.559> in

worth noting that Windows 8 is still in

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.049 
worth noting that Windows 8 is still in
beta<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:13.980> anything<00:00:14.460> could<00:00:14.580> change<00:00:14.639> by<00:00:15.000> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
beta and anything could change by the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.849 
beta and anything could change by the
time<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.330> Microsoft<00:00:15.960> finally<00:00:16.230> releases<00:00:16.710> it

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
time that Microsoft finally releases it

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.740 
time that Microsoft finally releases it
