which<00:00:02.480> is<00:00:03.480> pretty<00:00:03.659> crap<00:00:04.250> i'm<00:00:05.250> going<00:00:05.640> to

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
which is pretty crap i'm going to

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.960 
which is pretty crap i'm going to
explain<00:00:06.060> me<00:00:06.299> because<00:00:07.020> they're<00:00:07.290> i<00:00:07.799> don't<00:00:08.760> use

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
explain me because they're i don't use

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.339 
explain me because they're i don't use
them<00:00:09.240> so<00:00:09.420> i'm<00:00:09.510> not<00:00:09.630> actually<00:00:09.750> show<00:00:10.080> what<00:00:10.260> they

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
them so i'm not actually show what they

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.759 
them so i'm not actually show what they
do<00:00:10.580> i<00:00:11.580> only<00:00:12.450> use<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.750> random<00:00:13.019> 3d<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.500> pivot

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
do i only use the random 3d in the pivot

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.160 
do i only use the random 3d in the pivot
one<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.340> random<00:00:14.549> 3d<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:14.940> good<00:00:15.150> for<00:00:15.389> explosions

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
one the random 3d is good for explosions

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.930 
one the random 3d is good for explosions
and<00:00:16.350> things<00:00:16.470> like<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.619> if<00:00:17.130> you're<00:00:17.340> not<00:00:17.460> rent

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
and things like that if you're not rent

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.849 
and things like that if you're not rent
if<00:00:18.119> you're<00:00:18.270> not<00:00:18.359> emitting<00:00:19.140> from<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.439> geometry

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
if you're not emitting from a geometry

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.800 
if you're not emitting from a geometry
but<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:21.000> kinda<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.560> random<00:00:22.560> 3d<00:00:26.630> so<00:00:27.630> that's

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
but it kinda just random 3d so that's

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.999 
but it kinda just random 3d so that's
basically<00:00:27.930> speed<00:00:28.529> now<00:00:28.830> shape<00:00:29.269> shape<00:00:30.949> with<00:00:31.949> a

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
basically speed now shape shape with a

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.920 
basically speed now shape shape with a
big<00:00:32.130> on<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.759> end<00:00:33.020> and<00:00:35.120> shape<00:00:38.450> okay<00:00:39.450> now<00:00:39.629> shape

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
big on the end and shape okay now shape

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.190 
big on the end and shape okay now shape
is<00:00:41.000> what<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> want<00:00:42.329> them<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.540> be<00:00:42.629> rendered<00:00:42.809> ours

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
is what I want them to be rendered ours

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.180 
is what I want them to be rendered ours
so<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:43.950> i<00:00:44.040> render<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:45.000> my<00:00:45.210> f9<00:00:45.739> and<00:00:46.739> you'll<00:00:47.010> see

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
so if i render as my f9 and you'll see

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.240 
so if i render as my f9 and you'll see
that<00:00:47.309> they<00:00:47.489> are<00:00:47.520> spheres<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:49.379> then<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> quite

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
that they are spheres and then the quite

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.119 
that they are spheres and then the quite
big<00:00:50.430> spheres<00:00:50.700> as<00:00:50.850> well<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.289> kind<00:00:52.920> of

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
big spheres as well and so I kind of

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.770 
big spheres as well and so I kind of
cubes<00:00:54.320> lies<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.370> Tetris<00:00:57.030> which<00:00:57.600> is

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
cubes lies I can have Tetris which is

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.520 
cubes lies I can have Tetris which is
like<00:00:58.680> pyramids<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.899> efforts<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.320> you're<00:01:01.440> not

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
like pyramids and efforts but you're not

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.349 
like pyramids and efforts but you're not
going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:01.940> because<00:01:02.940> if<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.239> not

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
going to see because if it's not

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.750 
going to see because if it's not
renderable<00:01:03.719> at<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> minute<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.309> i'll<00:01:05.400> keep<00:01:05.640> it

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
renderable at the minute so i'll keep it

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.090 
renderable at the minute so i'll keep it
on<00:01:05.850> spheres<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.330> i'll<00:01:06.420> put<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.659> down<00:01:07.100> that's

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
on spheres and i'll put that down that's

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.390 
on spheres and i'll put that down that's
hard<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:09.470> don't<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.560> afraid<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.010> just<00:01:11.250> spin

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
hard I don't be afraid to you just spin

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.899 
hard I don't be afraid to you just spin
as<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:12.049> using<00:01:13.049> spinners<00:01:13.380> all<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> time<00:01:13.850> okay<00:01:14.850> so

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
as I using spinners all the time okay so

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.960 
as I using spinners all the time okay so
we<00:01:15.150> want<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:16.259> tough<00:01:16.470> part<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.700> we've<00:01:17.850> got

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
we want it's tough part so we've got

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.270 
we want it's tough part so we've got
some<00:01:18.150> nice<00:01:18.299> little<00:01:18.659> spheres<00:01:19.049> that's<00:01:20.040> all<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
some nice little spheres that's all the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.999 
some nice little spheres that's all the
shape<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.080> they<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.290> swap<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.799> with

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
shape is and they can swap this out with

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.859 
shape is and they can swap this out with
shape<00:01:23.280> instance<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.450> that's<00:01:24.600> if<00:01:24.750> you've

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
shape instance and that's if you've

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.380 
shape instance and that's if you've
created<00:01:25.140> your<00:01:25.320> own<00:01:25.439> Pikul<00:01:26.009> shapes<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.729> but

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
created your own Pikul shapes and but

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.149 
created your own Pikul shapes and but
we'll<00:01:27.509> go<00:01:27.869> into<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.080> further<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:29.210> um<00:01:30.210> okay

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
we'll go into that further on um okay

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.010 
we'll go into that further on um okay
force<00:01:32.159> now<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.030> where<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.479> said<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.840> don't

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
force now this is where I said you don't

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.960 
force now this is where I said you don't
need<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.320> use<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.530> bone<00:01:34.829> space<00:01:35.280> warp<00:01:35.579> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
need to use the bone space warp and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.870 
need to use the bone space warp and
stuff<00:01:36.540> all<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.799> do<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.189> put<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> force

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
stuff all you have to do is put a force

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.380 
stuff all you have to do is put a force
operator<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.049> I'd<00:01:41.040> buy<00:01:41.250> list<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.939> just

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
operator in and I'd buy list and just

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.490 
operator in and I'd buy list and just
add<00:01:42.600> your<00:01:42.990> forces<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.070> if<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.250> didn't<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:45.500> these

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
add your forces so if I didn't of these

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.969 
add your forces so if I didn't of these
i<00:01:47.060> just<00:01:48.060> i<00:01:48.119> buy<00:01:48.390> list<00:01:48.600> add<00:01:49.170> my<00:01:49.380> drag<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.799> my

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
i just i buy list add my drag on my

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.210 
i just i buy list add my drag on my
gravitic<00:01:51.049> they<00:01:52.049> get<00:01:52.229> put<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.530> automatically

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
gravitic they get put in automatically

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.770 
gravitic they get put in automatically
which<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.360> pretty<00:01:54.750> great<00:01:55.610> display<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.850> how<00:01:57.360> we

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
which is pretty great display is how we

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.480 
which is pretty great display is how we
want<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.049> see<00:01:58.229> them<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.770> viewport<00:01:58.979> only

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
want to see them in the viewport only

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.600 
want to see them in the viewport only
not<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.149> render<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.899> I've<00:02:01.020> got<00:02:01.259> green<00:02:02.189> I'll<00:02:02.430> set

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
not in render so I've got green I'll set

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.770 
not in render so I've got green I'll set
that<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:03.350> blue

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
that to blue

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.660 
that to blue
and<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.810> want<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.079> display<00:02:07.530> buy<00:02:07.770> tix<00:02:08.039> now<00:02:08.280> you

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
and I want to display buy tix now you

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.370 
and I want to display buy tix now you
can<00:02:08.819> split<00:02:09.030> by<00:02:09.360> dots<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.190> take<00:02:11.190> circles<00:02:12.380> so

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
can split by dots and take circles so

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.510 
can split by dots and take circles so
because<00:02:13.560> if<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:13.950> render<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.280> out<00:02:14.340> with

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
because if you render it out with

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.309 
because if you render it out with
spheres<00:02:14.760> circles<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.300> might<00:02:15.599> be<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.750> bit<00:02:15.959> bit

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
spheres circles it might be a bit bit

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
be shown by nothing but C and so you can

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.170 
be shown by nothing but C and so you can
actually<00:02:35.130> see<00:02:35.310> where<00:02:35.610> they're<00:02:35.790> going<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.030> it

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
actually see where they're going and it

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.690 
actually see where they're going and it
looks<00:02:36.540> quite<00:02:36.780> good<00:02:36.840> as<00:02:37.110> well<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.489> can't

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
looks quite good as well and you can't

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.400 
looks quite good as well and you can't
create<00:02:38.910> this<00:02:39.030> effect<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.630> give<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.260> few

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
create this effect and give it a few

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.940 
create this effect and give it a few
tweaks<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.640> put<00:02:42.150> on<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.480> stick<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.870> on<00:02:43.019> circles

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
tweaks and put on to stick it on circles

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.870 
tweaks and put on to stick it on circles
for<00:02:44.160> now<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:45.600> then<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.280> collision<00:02:47.280> the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
for now and then the collision the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.479 
for now and then the collision the
collision<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.569> just<00:02:48.870> basically<00:02:49.400> just<00:02:50.400> like

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
collision is just basically just like

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.990 
collision is just basically just like
force<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.680> but<00:02:52.680> collision<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.370> obviously<00:02:53.760> the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
force and but collision is obviously the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.650 
force and but collision is obviously the
deflector<00:02:54.569> so<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.140> add<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.709> collision<00:02:56.660> and

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
deflector so you add a collision and

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.570 
deflector so you add a collision and
then<00:02:57.840> we'll<00:02:58.019> add<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.319> deflector<00:02:58.769> by<00:02:58.890> list<00:02:59.160> and

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
then we'll add the deflector by list and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.120 
then we'll add the deflector by list and
then<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.510> can<00:03:00.690> just<00:03:00.840> tweak<00:03:01.019> settings<00:03:01.290> but<00:03:01.709> by

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
then you can just tweak settings but by

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.640 
then you can just tweak settings but by
default<00:03:02.310> it's<00:03:02.910> set<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.180> just<00:03:03.599> bounce<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.560> if

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
default it's set to just bounce so if

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.229 
default it's set to just bounce so if
you<00:03:04.769> just<00:03:04.920> do<00:03:05.220> this<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.640> they<00:03:05.970> will<00:03:06.120> just

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
you just do this and they will just

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.670 
you just do this and they will just
bounce<00:03:06.420> bounce<00:03:06.750> bounce<00:03:06.930> pass<00:03:07.200> on<00:03:07.349> little<00:03:07.560> key

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
bounce bounce bounce pass on little key

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.870 
bounce bounce bounce pass on little key
bolts<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.099> depending<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.459> much<00:03:08.609> friction

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
bolts and depending on much friction

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.420 
bolts and depending on much friction
you've<00:03:09.150> got<00:03:09.269> on<00:03:09.620> those<00:03:10.620> key<00:03:10.920> balancing<00:03:11.310> I

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
you've got on those key balancing I

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.610 
you've got on those key balancing I
actually<00:03:12.000> use<00:03:12.390> collide<00:03:12.780> multiple<00:03:13.200> times<00:03:13.440> so

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
actually use collide multiple times so

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.500 
actually use collide multiple times so
I've<00:03:13.709> got<00:03:13.859> them<00:03:13.980> colliding<00:03:14.430> seven<00:03:14.910> times<00:03:15.239> and

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
I've got them colliding seven times and

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.630 
I've got them colliding seven times and
then<00:03:16.049> then<00:03:16.650> when<00:03:16.920> they've<00:03:17.100> collided<00:03:17.280> seven

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
then then when they've collided seven

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.050 
then then when they've collided seven
times<00:03:17.820> they<00:03:18.030> will<00:03:18.150> stop<00:03:18.769> so<00:03:19.769> did<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.489> do<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.910> do

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
times they will stop so did you do to do

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.479 
times they will stop so did you do to do
it<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.329> they<00:03:21.450> stop<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:22.590> if<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.040> do<00:03:23.359> get<00:03:24.359> to<00:03:24.510> New

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
it and they stop and if I do get to New

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.780 
it and they stop and if I do get to New
about<00:03:26.489> seven<00:03:26.910> times<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.420> then<00:03:27.600> lawful<00:03:28.790> and

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
about seven times and then lawful and

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.090 
about seven times and then lawful and
for<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.780> bounce<00:03:31.049> to<00:03:31.319> just<00:03:31.500> keep<00:03:31.590> on<00:03:31.739> balancing

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100

it's<00:03:40.680> just<00:03:40.859> mad<00:03:41.069> look<00:03:41.549> ed<00:03:42.950> so<00:03:43.950> you<00:03:44.130> stop

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
it's just mad look ed so you stop

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.390 
it's just mad look ed so you stop
something<00:03:45.870> we<00:03:46.139> get<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:46.410> little<00:03:46.620> type<00:03:47.310> of

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
something we get this little type of

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.460 
something we get this little type of
thing<00:03:47.519> and<00:03:47.940> that's<00:03:48.180> basically<00:03:48.389> the<00:03:48.780> first

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
thing and that's basically the first

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.670 
thing and that's basically the first
view<00:03:49.889> of<00:03:49.920> particle<00:03:50.519> flow<00:03:50.790> now<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.560> realize<00:03:52.560> I'm

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
view of particle flow now I realize I'm

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.530 
view of particle flow now I realize I'm
not<00:03:52.709> gone<00:03:52.980> very<00:03:53.400> very<00:03:53.549> much<00:03:53.880> into<00:03:54.150> detail<00:03:54.510> but

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
not gone very very much into detail but

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.720 
not gone very very much into detail but
I'd<00:03:55.440> rather<00:03:55.620> people<00:03:55.829> get<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.190> hang<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.519> just

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
I'd rather people get the hang of just

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.330 
I'd rather people get the hang of just
this<00:03:56.970> first<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.139> if<00:03:58.829> you<00:03:58.950> want<00:03:59.069> to<00:03:59.130> create

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
this first and if you want to create

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.520 
this first and if you want to create
your<00:03:59.430> own<00:03:59.549> particle<00:04:00.060> system<00:04:00.470> from<00:04:01.470> scratch

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
your own particle system from scratch

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.289 
your own particle system from scratch
without<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.310> they're<00:04:02.549> all<00:04:02.850> you<00:04:03.030> have<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.209> do

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
without that they're all you have to do

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.690 
without that they're all you have to do
is<00:04:03.480> press<00:04:03.660> number<00:04:03.900> six<00:04:04.190> to<00:04:05.190> get<00:04:05.310> rid<00:04:05.519> of<00:04:05.549> these

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
is press number six to get rid of these

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.870 
is press number six to get rid of these
and<00:04:06.510> you'll<00:04:06.690> have<00:04:06.900> this<00:04:07.109> blank<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:08.010> what<00:04:08.819> you

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
and you'll have this blank and what you

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.619 
and you'll have this blank and what you
can<00:04:08.970> do<00:04:09.060> is<00:04:09.209> just<00:04:09.319> work<00:04:10.319> off<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.829> standard<00:04:11.280> floor

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
can do is just work off a standard floor

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.729 
can do is just work off a standard floor
and<00:04:12.629> when<00:04:12.750> you've<00:04:12.870> done<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:13.080> you'll<00:04:13.439> see<00:04:13.620> it

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
and when you've done that you'll see it

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:14.869 
and when you've done that you'll see it
appear<00:04:14.099> in<00:04:14.220> here

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879

and<00:04:15.879> then<00:04:16.239> if<00:04:16.959> you're<00:04:17.139> missing<00:04:17.470> ones<00:04:17.709> just

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
and then if you're missing ones just

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.800 
and then if you're missing ones just
look<00:04:18.549> back<00:04:18.699> on<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:18.910> tutorial<00:04:19.389> if<00:04:19.510> you<00:04:19.540> want

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
look back on the tutorial if you want

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.920 
look back on the tutorial if you want
stuff<00:04:20.260> like<00:04:20.440> force<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:21.970> collision<00:04:22.389> you<00:04:22.750> just

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
stuff like force and collision you just

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.689 
stuff like force and collision you just
drag<00:04:23.110> them<00:04:23.229> in<00:04:23.350> from<00:04:23.560> here<00:04:23.770> now<00:04:24.280> you<00:04:24.340> can<00:04:24.490> mess

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
drag them in from here now you can mess

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.490 
drag them in from here now you can mess
around<00:04:24.729> with<00:04:25.419> the<00:04:25.780> others<00:04:25.990> that's<00:04:26.169> in<00:04:26.290> here

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
around with the others that's in here

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.500 
around with the others that's in here
and<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:27.130> other<00:04:27.310> little<00:04:27.550> description<00:04:27.940> here<00:04:28.270> so

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
and the other little description here so

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.909 
and the other little description here so
which<00:04:29.080> I<00:04:29.320> don't<00:04:29.620> really<00:04:29.800> find<00:04:29.949> helpful<00:04:30.250> but

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
which I don't really find helpful but

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.400 
which I don't really find helpful but
you<00:04:32.919> can<00:04:33.130> read<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.180> my<00:04:34.570> element<00:04:34.930> spin<00:04:35.229> is

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
you can read that and my element spin is

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.129 
you can read that and my element spin is
spinners<00:04:35.860> another<00:04:36.130> good<00:04:36.280> one<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:37.050> you've<00:04:38.050> got

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
spinners another good one and you've got

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.070 
spinners another good one and you've got
rotation<00:04:38.740> force<00:04:39.310> is<00:04:39.520> an<00:04:39.610> important<00:04:40.030> one<00:04:40.150> and

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
rotation force is an important one and

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.080 
rotation force is an important one and
then<00:04:41.320> once<00:04:41.590> you<00:04:41.770> get<00:04:42.370> into<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.639> whole<00:04:42.880> thing

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
then once you get into the whole thing

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.270 
then once you get into the whole thing
and<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.270> understand<00:04:43.780> how<00:04:43.930> flow<00:04:44.380> works<00:04:44.740> you

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
and you understand how flow works you

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.710 
and you understand how flow works you
can<00:04:45.400> start<00:04:45.669> looking<00:04:45.790> at<00:04:46.090> different<00:04:46.479> things

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
can start looking at different things

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.379 
can start looking at different things
and<00:04:47.190> add<00:04:48.190> in<00:04:48.460> different<00:04:48.820> operators<00:04:49.270> and

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
and add in different operators and

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.760 
and add in different operators and
adding<00:04:49.810> different<00:04:49.960> events<00:04:50.470> so<00:04:50.620> you've<00:04:50.740> got

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
adding different events so you've got

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.909 
adding different events so you've got
like<00:04:51.039> two<00:04:51.970> three<00:04:52.270> four<00:04:52.510> events<00:04:52.960> in<00:04:53.289> one<00:04:53.620> floor

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
like two three four events in one floor

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.439 
like two three four events in one floor
and<00:04:54.610> i'll<00:04:54.760> show<00:04:54.789> you<00:04:54.910> how<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.120> do<00:04:55.270> that<00:04:55.389> in

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
and i'll show you how to do that in

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.750 
and i'll show you how to do that in
another<00:04:55.630> video<00:04:55.900> so<00:04:56.800> thanks<00:04:57.130> for<00:04:57.190> watching<00:04:57.490> and
