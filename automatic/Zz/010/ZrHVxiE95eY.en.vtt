00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.750
 This is the portal and multimedia magazine. 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.190
 meccano you know the novelty 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.470
 which adopts presents for the market 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.320
 Brazilian is that we have new corn 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.930
 Good talking about the new man, right? 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.740
 is a new generation of this crossover that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.440
 is on the market since 91 of 2008 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.170
 it has a series of innovations 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.460
 the engine is 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.180
 big star of this car engine and exchange 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.250
 very modern engineering engine 280 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.800
 horsepower combined with the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.070
 six-speed automatic transmission 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.600
 with interactive function autostick who 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.340
 is on the street will look and will tell me 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.140
 I think I've seen this car sometime. 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.330
 in freemont is that he has to different 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.369
 have differentials for the consumer 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.550
 power to debut instead of freemont I go 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.020
 here on journey 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.759
 are two brand placements 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.070
 different to the newspaper today is a car 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.220
 which relies exclusively on this engine 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.770
 v6 dual exhaust outlet bring some 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.910
 some comfort items and 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.130
 more convenience in the r / t version some 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.830
 aesthetic items also such as 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.990
 the 19-inch alloy wheels the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.050
 sunroof leather seats series 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.229
 which are of sesi and in the case of roni 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.800
 seven seater setup is series to 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.869
 both the sxt version is our input 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.119
 as for rt version 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.100
 so let's talk more about mechanics 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.319
 online is the really good news of 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.960
 Dodge launch is the engine the engine 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:13.050
 which arrives quite successfully without the pt 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.709
 being is already a sales success here is 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.690
 with grand cherokee is right and now 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.600
 we are applying this engine in the newspaper and 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.170
 is also the all-aluminum motor motor 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.560
 very light with the valve control 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.330
 variable is the motor that has a 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.790
 of fuel - 15% more efficient than 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.780
 the previous engine that equipped jhonny 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.349
 plus a torque of almost 35 pounds 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.040
 is is a very compact engine 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.750
 with reactions 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.349
 It's very interesting to fix it with 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.519
 car loaded but safety 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.909
 overtaking when you need it 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.950
 the motor torque actually observes that 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.810
 the two external features 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.209
 are very similar but the differential 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.620
 really is in the internal aspect 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:09.090
 yes yes the buyer of johnny is the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.939
 target audience joniel is the buyer 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.790
 extremely demanding and so the house 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:19.659
 has as a rule to maintain the aesthetic part 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.299
 of vehicles and very external and internal 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:25.810
 very similar that changes are the details 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:29.109
 are items of the equipment package and 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.079
 few external variations for example the 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:34.450
 projevem these journey sxt prt you 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.189
 It has chrome-plated items and has 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.889
 19 inch alloy 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:40.180
 basically this externally 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.639
 internally you have others 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.709
 equipment such as the 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:47.560
 sound to father nick is a sound system 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.470
 with a case with 16 speakers 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.739
 rose was six simone speakers 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:57.159
 fix more than upload with amplifier 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.930
 350 watt talking security one 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:02.139
 car that offers enough technology 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.780
 this aspect of safety is paramount for 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.790
 a car that is focused on 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.349
 main family 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.030
 we are talking about a product today 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.790
 which has electronic control of 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.810
 anti-rollover control stability 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:20.500
 it also has latest generation abs sp 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.690
 control of traction among others as 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.610
 the trailer oscillator in case of 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.060
 it corrects the vehicle's trajectory 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.310
 in case you are towing any item 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.870
 behind the car that could suffer a blow 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.289
 wind something 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.990
 for this are a front air bags of 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:40.389
 multiple front lateral stages 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.479
 protection for the head and thorax 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.969
 also curtain type will see what kind 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.329
 curtain beyond 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:50.819
 to work by impact also works 

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:53.159
 by scroll sensor or not 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:55.469
 need lateral impact to be able to 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:57.089
 open is only the central computer of the 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:05:00.419
 vehicle has noticed that the car has a 

00:04:57.089 --> 00:05:01.559
 higher than acceptable slope and hence 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.069
 you will have airbag activation 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:06.509
 through a multimedia aspect what 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.819
 have these cars that we can 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:11.449
 still expect that it will reach great 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:15.419
 that package that you 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.219
 concentrates several items in a central one 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.169
 multimedia 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:24.029
 this car for example controls ipod 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:27.689
 ipad ipod and iphone completely is enough 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:30.599
 you have a usb 2.0 cable connect on the 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:32.159
 entry in the center console and 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.309
 you will have full control of the hand 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:38.969
 plus you have the uconnect bluetooth 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:41.339
 is a voice communication system is and 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:45.589
 can stop and up to seven devices 

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:48.479
 phone compatible with Bluetooth and 

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:50.399
 When you make the payment you already have 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:54.029
 for example automatically your 

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:55.619
 recent phone book you can 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:57.509
 make the phone call either by 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:06:00.119
 as using the screen all including the 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:03.029
 multimedia system that also integrates the 

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:04.649
 programming of vehicle items as per 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:06.360
 example the time of energizing the 

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:11.369
 equipment after you turn off the power 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:13.289
 motor or comfort system which through the 

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:14.459
 the external temperature sensor is 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.619
 too cold it already turns on automatically 

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:19.979
 the benches heated for you in the 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:22.439
 first first row guaranteed 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.759
 network availability and appearance of 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:25.679
 price how do you stay 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:28.589
 the concessionaire network already has a new 

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:32.939
 three-year warranty free of charge. 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:38.069
 mileage and the price of the 

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:42.689
 sxt entry is 97 thousand and five hundred 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:44.610
 real and in the r / t version 107,900 goal 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:48.719
 these values â€‹â€‹without applying this new 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:50.420
 ipv6 in yet we have no exact idea 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:53.090
 impact 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.790
 is that of this new ipi in the price of 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.820
 cars but today is the current price 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.710
 without the long-term impact of preparing 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.690
 even more news for the consumer 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.010
 during the minutes in 2002 will be a 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.900
 hectic year 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:11.110
 We're going to have news, yes we will. 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:11.110
 have a new compartment 329
