00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
will work you also want to leave a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.670 
will work you also want to leave a
little<00:01:36.270> bit<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.600> room<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.930> between<00:01:37.170> these

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
little bit of room in between these

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.490 
little bit of room in between these
because<00:01:38.130> that's<00:01:38.430> where<00:01:38.790> your<00:01:39.299> t-shirt<00:01:40.259> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
because that's where your t-shirt is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.370 
because that's where your t-shirt is
going<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.950> hold<00:01:41.130> together

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.560 

so<00:01:45.460> you<00:01:46.460> may<00:01:46.550> want<00:01:46.760> to<00:01:46.790> just<00:01:46.940> snip<00:01:47.240> in<00:01:47.480> the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
so you may want to just snip in the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.930 
so you may want to just snip in the
middle<00:01:47.840> just<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.200> start<00:01:48.500> off<00:01:48.640> because<00:01:49.640> you're

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
middle just to start off because you're

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.430 
middle just to start off because you're
going<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.210> be<00:01:50.300> cutting<00:01:50.480> around<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:50.990> anyways

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
going to be cutting around it anyways

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.070 
going to be cutting around it anyways
and<00:01:51.470> that<00:01:51.740> way<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:51.950> won't<00:01:52.190> be<00:01:52.990> cutting<00:01:53.990> in

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
and that way you won't be cutting in

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.920 
and that way you won't be cutting in
parts<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:54.470> don't<00:01:54.620> want<00:01:54.830> to<00:01:54.920> cut<00:01:55.780> anyone<00:01:56.780> got

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
parts you don't want to cut anyone got

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.410 
parts you don't want to cut anyone got
anything<00:01:57.290> funny<00:01:57.470> to<00:01:57.590> say

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.789 

after<00:02:05.420> you're<00:02:05.539> done<00:02:05.570> cutting<00:02:06.079> your<00:02:06.259> triangles

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
after you're done cutting your triangles

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.729 
after you're done cutting your triangles
