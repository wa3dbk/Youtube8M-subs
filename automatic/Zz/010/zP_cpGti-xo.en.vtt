of<00:00:27.320> video<00:00:27.470> game<00:00:27.679> names<00:00:27.919> because<00:00:28.640> that's<00:00:28.820> cool

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
of video game names because that's cool

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.450 
of video game names because that's cool
you<00:00:29.419> know<00:00:29.539> so<00:00:30.079> this<00:00:30.560> one<00:00:30.740> is<00:00:30.829> from<00:00:30.949> the<00:00:31.189> song

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
you know so this one is from the song

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.890 
you know so this one is from the song
through<00:00:31.609> the<00:00:31.699> fire<00:00:31.849> and<00:00:31.880> flames<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:32.509> just

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
through the fire and flames and just

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.200 
through the fire and flames and just
before<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:33.200> solo<00:00:33.470> kicks<00:00:33.800> in<00:00:33.980> we<00:00:34.789> make<00:00:34.969> what<00:00:35.120> we

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
before the solo kicks in we make what we

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.880 
before the solo kicks in we make what we
call<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:35.449> pattern<00:00:35.690> air<00:00:35.809> noise<00:00:35.930> so<00:00:36.469> let's<00:00:36.800> have

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
call the pattern air noise so let's have

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.979 
call the pattern air noise so let's have
a<00:00:36.949> look<00:00:37.010> at<00:00:37.129> that<00:00:40.210> it's<00:00:41.210> actually<00:00:41.539> cool<00:00:41.719> if<00:00:41.840> you

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
a look at that it's actually cool if you

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.290 
a look at that it's actually cool if you
combine<00:00:42.199> it<00:00:42.469> with<00:00:42.680> a<00:00:43.039> golden<00:00:43.850> eye<00:00:43.940> since

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
combine it with a golden eye since

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.299 
combine it with a golden eye since
pac-man<00:00:44.960> it's<00:00:45.320> a<00:00:45.379> bit<00:00:45.590> pointless<00:00:45.920> having<00:00:46.219> him

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
pac-man it's a bit pointless having him

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.369 
pac-man it's a bit pointless having him
on<00:00:46.370> his<00:00:46.519> own<00:00:49.600> we're<00:00:50.600> going<00:00:50.719> to<00:00:50.780> try<00:00:50.989> to<00:00:51.050> put

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
on his own we're going to try to put

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.430 
on his own we're going to try to put
pac-man<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.160> it<00:00:52.340> goes<00:00:52.640> together<00:00:53.350> just<00:00:54.350> like

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
pac-man and it goes together just like

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:07.940 
pac-man and it goes together just like
the<00:00:54.649> video<00:00:54.739> game

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:40.459 

I'm<00:02:19.730> going<00:02:19.880> through<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.060> motor<00:02:20.240> body<00:02:20.420> noise

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.959 

all<00:02:41.469> right<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:41.709> that<00:02:41.859> was<00:02:41.950> them<00:02:42.099> changing<00:02:42.670> gear

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:42.969 
all right so that was them changing gear

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:50.119 
all right so that was them changing gear
and<00:02:43.299> I<00:02:43.810> guess<00:02:44.769> skidding<00:02:45.129> and<00:02:45.250> crash<00:02:45.609> and<00:02:45.790> burn

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.440 

one<00:02:51.129> of<00:02:51.219> my<00:02:51.340> favorite<00:02:51.760> that<00:02:51.879> I<00:02:51.939> like<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.269> do<00:02:52.359> on

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
one of my favorite that I like to do on

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.289 
one of my favorite that I like to do on
stage<00:02:52.599> and<00:02:53.049> we've<00:02:53.590> got<00:02:53.769> it<00:02:53.890> in<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.189> in<00:02:55.120> the

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
stage and we've got it in the in the

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.759 
stage and we've got it in the in the
song<00:02:55.480> for<00:02:55.659> the<00:02:55.719> farm<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:55.989> flames<00:02:56.200> at<00:02:56.409> the<00:02:56.620> end

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
song for the farm the flames at the end

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.770 
song for the farm the flames at the end
of<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.370> song<00:02:57.609> we<00:02:57.760> actually<00:02:58.030> break<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.480> string

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
of the song we actually break the string

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.119 
of the song we actually break the string
I<00:02:58.840> broke<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.230> string<00:02:59.409> on<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.650> album<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.069> we

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
I broke the string on the album and we

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.780 
I broke the string on the album and we
left<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:00.489> there

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
left it there

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.580 
left it there
so<00:03:01.150> let's<00:03:01.359> see<00:03:01.450> how<00:03:01.569> I<00:03:01.599> did<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:02.290> don't

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
so let's see how I did that I don't

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.839 
so let's see how I did that I don't
think<00:03:02.799> I<00:03:02.829> can<00:03:02.889> break<00:03:03.099> the<00:03:03.219> string<00:03:03.459> now<00:03:03.609> but

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
think I can break the string now but

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:10.470 
think I can break the string now but
let's<00:03:04.000> try<00:03:04.090> it

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480
