00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.230
 Hello 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:14.769
 and here is another magic on demand think 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.930
 the magic already requested helps iarc and us 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.320
 requested the man from new york that 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.800
 a game of terry lager holmes appeared 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.539
 on the book password presentation is 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.490
 known in Italy often with the name 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.840
 of the opinionating spectator from 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.920
 version of raul cremona 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.909
 we see the game one evening during one 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.309
 work evening 

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:38.379
 I met a former card player 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.389
 gambler that for a short 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.579
 period he made the cheater and then started 

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:45.159
 to do the magician too and me 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.499
 he said that the cheaters must be in 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:50.319
 grade one of the main things you don't 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:52.329
 do you know cheaters is to find the 

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:55.319
 cards they want inside a 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.690
 shuffled deck and mixed 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:01:01.239
 Italian style and mixed 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.399
 in the American style they must anyway 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.230
 be able to find the cards 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.170
 what they want and to show me this 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.900
 what mixed the bunch one way 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.020
 really absurd he took half cards and 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.409
 the vaccinated turn the other half has it 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.770
 left face down 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.710
 then remembering that the deck was mine 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.380
 he looked at the cards by chance 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.609
 were marked somewhere not 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.459
 I assured you 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:33.520
 after which he cut a couple of times e 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:35.649
 shuffled the face up cards 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.090
 face down i do high do in 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.250
 low this way 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.229
 now to speed up the muscle 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.829
 so ok so he ended up with a 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:51.369
 back-to-back card deck 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.170
 face against normal back against 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.929
 back with what a bunch completely 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.270
 mixed and showed me that he was in 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:02.649
 able to find the cards he wanted 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:06.759
 in fact taken the deck gave a cut a 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:11.560
 one lapse gave another cut to the other 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:14.230
 ace gave a third cut to an ace on 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.480
 The third constant hassle of them is a lot 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.400
 interesting, however, there is no real e 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.980
 own magical application for i 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.750
 magicians do things that 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.730
 they also satisfy the eye, Europe is waiting 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.480
 when at the last make it appear in 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.480
 different way 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.820
 voila she obviously told me that she feeds 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.910
 wait is said in a magical way 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.710
 this is just an mi card 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.710
 he says I must count to three then 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.160
 123 because I told her vabbeh is 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.050
 interesting, however, this is not great 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.270
 great big magic does not have this big 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.070
 magic application 2003 no 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.560
 in fact the magic was not to find again 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:00.270
 four aces but pass the hand over 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:03.830
 deck and let her go back all this 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.830
 it was the man from new york
