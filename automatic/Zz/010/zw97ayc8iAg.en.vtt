this tech is still amazing now I know
this<00:00:29.190> is<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.430> top<00:00:30.240> tank<00:00:30.660> gameplay<00:00:32.210> so<00:00:33.440> there

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
this is a top tank gameplay so there

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.149 
this is a top tank gameplay so there
aren't<00:00:35.030> incredible<00:00:36.030> players<00:00:36.269> on<00:00:36.569> the<00:00:36.659> team

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
but they were decent and I'm getting a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.800 
but they were decent and I'm getting a
little<00:00:42.179> bit<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.510> lag<00:00:42.690> here

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.520 

as<00:00:50.350> a<00:00:50.410> heavy<00:00:50.860> tank<00:00:51.160> I'm<00:00:51.750> proceeding<00:00:52.750> into<00:00:53.140> the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
as a heavy tank I'm proceeding into the

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.010 
as a heavy tank I'm proceeding into the
city<00:00:53.980> or<00:00:54.280> town<00:00:54.610> or<00:00:55.030> whatever<00:00:55.360> this<00:00:55.540> is<00:00:57.990> so<00:00:58.990> I

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
city or town or whatever this is so I

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.480 
city or town or whatever this is so I
can<00:00:59.350> use<00:00:59.860> the<00:01:00.310> cover<00:01:01.440> appropriately<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:02.650> that

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
can use the cover appropriately and that

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.030 
can use the cover appropriately and that
pastor<00:01:03.850> 38<00:01:04.210> na<00:01:04.540> decided<00:01:05.380> to<00:01:05.530> Remy<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:06.900> cause

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040

pastor 38 na decided to Remy and cause
damage<00:01:09.040> to<00:01:09.310> himself<00:01:09.610> which<00:01:10.090> I<00:01:10.210> had<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:10.420> pay<00:01:10.540> for

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.500 

so<00:01:16.660> there<00:01:16.810> was<00:01:16.930> that<00:01:16.960> t-50<00:01:17.710> and<00:01:18.070> I<00:01:18.270> almost<00:01:19.270> get

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
so there was that t-50 and I almost get

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.620 
so there was that t-50 and I almost get
a<00:01:19.540> shot<00:01:19.810> on<00:01:19.840> him<00:01:20.160> but<00:01:21.160> because<00:01:21.310> of<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.760> huge

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630

a shot on him but because of the huge
reload<00:01:23.050> time<00:01:23.380> on<00:01:23.680> this<00:01:23.860> I<00:01:24.720> decide<00:01:25.720> it's<00:01:25.960> not

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
reload time on this I decide it's not

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.310 
reload time on this I decide it's not
worth<00:01:26.170> taking<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.830> shot<00:01:27.300> it<00:01:28.300> takes<00:01:28.630> about<00:01:28.810> 13

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
worth taking a shot it takes about 13

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.510 
worth taking a shot it takes about 13

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
now here's a stoop three he can

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.300 
now here's a stoop three he can
penetrate<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.550> fun<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.910> my<00:02:51.060> are<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.300> tank

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
penetrate the fun of my are a tank

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.450 
penetrate the fun of my are a tank
but<00:02:54.030> not<00:02:54.150> when<00:02:54.239> he's<00:02:54.330> dead

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.120 

aren't<00:03:01.150> or<00:03:01.270> five<00:03:01.480> TD<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:02.290> doing<00:03:02.590> pretty<00:03:02.710> well<00:03:02.860> I

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
aren't or five TD is doing pretty well I

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.660 
aren't or five TD is doing pretty well I
guess<00:03:03.310> it's<00:03:03.460> this<00:03:03.580> su-85

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.690 

so<00:03:10.670> since<00:03:10.910> most<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.239> our<00:03:11.390> tanks<00:03:11.690> over<00:03:11.840> here<00:03:12.260> I'm

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
so since most of our tanks over here I'm

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.370 
so since most of our tanks over here I'm
going<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.790> stay<00:03:13.970> on<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.390> cap<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.050> see<00:03:15.200> if<00:03:15.260> we

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
going to stay on the cap and see if we

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.640 
going to stay on the cap and see if we
can't<00:03:15.790> capture<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:17.060> fast<00:03:17.270> enough<00:03:17.390> before<00:03:18.230> the

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
can't capture it fast enough before the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.650 
can't capture it fast enough before the
enemy<00:03:18.860> team<00:03:19.160> who<00:03:19.430> surrounded<00:03:19.910> us<00:03:20.030> this<00:03:20.480> is

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
enemy team who surrounded us this is

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.360 
enemy team who surrounded us this is
usually<00:03:20.959> not<00:03:21.380> a<00:03:21.440> good<00:03:21.530> idea<00:03:21.709> but<00:03:23.920> I'm<00:03:24.920> hoping

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
usually not a good idea but I'm hoping

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.210 
usually not a good idea but I'm hoping
that<00:03:25.430> we<00:03:25.940> can<00:03:26.030> catch<00:03:26.360> them<00:03:26.510> by<00:03:26.690> surprise<00:03:28.269> or<00:03:30.220> in

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
that we can catch them by surprise or in

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.850 
that we can catch them by surprise or in
some<00:03:31.610> sort<00:03:31.910> of<00:03:32.000> ambush<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:33.140> I'm<00:03:33.290> staying<00:03:33.620> over

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
some sort of ambush so I'm staying over

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.620 
some sort of ambush so I'm staying over
here<00:03:33.890> just<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.459> make<00:03:34.610> sure<00:03:34.640> that<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:38.209> rest<00:03:38.420> of

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
here just to make sure that the rest of

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.880 
here just to make sure that the rest of
my<00:03:38.780> team<00:03:38.840> can<00:03:39.290> cover<00:03:39.530> me

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.540 

our<00:03:46.270> m8a1<00:03:47.270> decides<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:48.200> go<00:03:48.319> out<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:48.800> do<00:03:49.310> battle

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
our m8a1 decides to go out and do battle

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.890 
our m8a1 decides to go out and do battle
with<00:03:49.910> a<00:03:50.180> head<00:03:50.990> sir<00:03:52.569> probably<00:03:53.569> not<00:03:53.690> a<00:03:53.720> good<00:03:53.840> idea

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
with a head sir probably not a good idea

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.130 
with a head sir probably not a good idea
here's<00:03:54.410> a<00:03:54.560> t25<00:03:55.040> who<00:03:55.940> decides<00:03:56.300> not<00:03:56.569> to<00:03:56.810> shoot<00:03:56.959> at

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
here's a t25 who decides not to shoot at

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.080 
here's a t25 who decides not to shoot at
me<00:03:57.170> I<00:03:57.319> don't<00:03:57.620> know<00:03:57.680> why<00:03:59.230> but<00:04:00.230> he's<00:04:00.709> gone<00:04:00.860> now

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
me I don't know why but he's gone now

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.460 
me I don't know why but he's gone now
and<00:04:02.830> there's<00:04:03.830> there<00:04:04.070> kv-1s<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:05.470> most

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
and there's there kv-1s the most

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.210 
and there's there kv-1s the most
troublesome<00:04:06.980> tank<00:04:07.780> on<00:04:08.780> their<00:04:09.020> team<00:04:09.290> I<00:04:09.560> believe

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
troublesome tank on their team I believe

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.380 
troublesome tank on their team I believe
but<00:04:13.220> you<00:04:13.370> can<00:04:13.489> see<00:04:13.700> here<00:04:13.880> I'm<00:04:14.000> getting<00:04:14.239> really

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
but you can see here I'm getting really

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.560 
but you can see here I'm getting really
lucky<00:04:14.870> that<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:16.100> enemy<00:04:16.430> team<00:04:16.820> isn't<00:04:17.150> shooting

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
lucky that the enemy team isn't shooting

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.140 
lucky that the enemy team isn't shooting
at<00:04:17.840> me<00:04:18.070> in<00:04:19.070> fact<00:04:19.310> they're<00:04:19.489> driving<00:04:19.850> right<00:04:20.030> in

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
at me in fact they're driving right in

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.810 
at me in fact they're driving right in
here<00:04:20.390> and<00:04:20.510> shooting<00:04:20.780> at<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:20.989> easy<00:04:21.169> targets<00:04:24.820> so

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
here and shooting at the easy targets so

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.159 
here and shooting at the easy targets so
I'm<00:04:25.910> kind<00:04:26.120> of<00:04:26.180> hoping<00:04:26.419> that<00:04:26.570> these<00:04:26.750> guys<00:04:26.960> would

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
I'm kind of hoping that these guys would

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.320 
I'm kind of hoping that these guys would
start<00:04:27.410> moving<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:28.730> get<00:04:28.850> out<00:04:29.000> of<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.150> line<00:04:29.300> of

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
start moving to get out of the line of

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.570 
start moving to get out of the line of
fire<00:04:29.890> apparently<00:04:30.890> not

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.020 

but<00:04:34.259> right<00:04:35.259> there<00:04:35.530> it's<00:04:35.710> you<00:04:36.189> see<00:04:36.370> that<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.879> was

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
but right there it's you see that it was

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.140 
but right there it's you see that it was
we<00:04:37.780> got<00:04:37.930> a<00:04:37.960> base<00:04:38.139> capture<00:04:38.379> 100<00:04:39.159> and<00:04:39.370> then

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
we got a base capture 100 and then

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.110 
we got a base capture 100 and then
somebody<00:04:40.360> got<00:04:40.599> taken<00:04:40.810> out<00:04:42.360> so<00:04:44.849> it<00:04:45.849> would<00:04:46.030> have

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
somebody got taken out so it would have

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.679 
somebody got taken out so it would have
worked<00:04:46.270> if<00:04:46.689> we<00:04:47.500> got<00:04:50.819> the<00:04:51.819> base<00:04:52.000> capture<00:04:52.300> off

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:52.689 
worked if we got the base capture off

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:56.760 
worked if we got the base capture off
like<00:04:53.169> a<00:04:53.199> second<00:04:53.770> sooner<00:04:53.949> in<00:04:54.219> a<00:04:54.280> sample<00:04:55.770> but

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
like a second sooner in a sample but

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.490 
like a second sooner in a sample but
here<00:04:56.949> you<00:04:57.069> can<00:04:57.099> see<00:04:57.430> that<00:04:58.259> pretty<00:04:59.259> much

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
here you can see that pretty much

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.959 
here you can see that pretty much
nobody's<00:04:59.889> taking<00:05:00.159> a<00:05:00.219> shot<00:05:00.370> at<00:05:00.430> me<00:05:00.639> except<00:05:00.849> for

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:00.969 
nobody's taking a shot at me except for

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:03.779 
nobody's taking a shot at me except for
this<00:05:01.030> m6<00:05:01.569> was<00:05:01.810> decided<00:05:02.259> to<00:05:02.349> shoot<00:05:02.530> at<00:05:02.789> somebody

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
this m6 was decided to shoot at somebody

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:12.209 
this m6 was decided to shoot at somebody
else<00:05:04.090> and<00:05:04.360> then<00:05:04.659> the<00:05:04.840> last<00:05:05.020> time<00:05:10.919> yes<00:05:11.919> I

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 
else and then the last time yes I

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:14.520 
else and then the last time yes I
believe<00:05:12.460> that<00:05:12.669> kv-1s<00:05:13.060> is<00:05:13.419> shooting<00:05:13.780> high
