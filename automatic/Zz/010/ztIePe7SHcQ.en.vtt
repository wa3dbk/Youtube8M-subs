00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello and welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.569
 played a good role for a long time. 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.269
 does not talk here on the robotics 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.679
 actually I decided little back the roots and 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.900
 talk about a competition that I still 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.269
 I did not speak on the channel and the Olympiad 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.049
 robotics is known with 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.049
 br 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.960
 such as in physics olympiads 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.180
 chemistry you have one of 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.179
 Robotics are well that has two types of 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.949
 theoretical proof and the practical time 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.980
 she's like any other Olympics you 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.140
 makes a test in the school and proof 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.660
 It has different levels you were teaching 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.940
 key among high school tests 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.370
 another book proves more legal is that 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.680
 top honors earn medals beyond 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.140
 beautiful medals and boots on the wall too 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.460
 Speak, my God, my son is a genius. 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.809
 these medals 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.610
 if you want to know how the partner 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.680
 More or less, I have not put this 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.390
 sound of the video link to the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.609
 previous years but as I said it has 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.340
 several different levels then we end up 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.470
 to find several proofs already proven 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.689
 practice is that I think it's cooler than 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.939
 you can build and program a robot 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.010
 to compete with other teams and 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.890
 begins to compete in the state stage and 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.509
 you are very good you will need 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.090
 national if you are very very very 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.880
 good you can compete in the world such 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.070
 as top also the medal in several 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.770
 award categories is the most 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.890
 beautiful the most composed robot is the medal 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.380
 obviously of the champions plus 800 schools 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.299
 In Brazil , they participate if you 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.090
 think it 's a thing only the southeast is 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.310
 much deceived to brÃª pernambuco is a 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.710
 of the largest in Brazil and the bay has 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.960
 grown in the last few years the test 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.030
 It's not too difficult to understand, it can be 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.189
 hard to do but it is not too difficult 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.130
 to understand is based on the category of 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.750
 robocup rescue then what you do 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.509
 use an arena full of obstacles 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.759
 following a black band on the floor and 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.080
 able to use the whole arena you go to 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.910
 the next 21 already with the situations 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.620
 the garages you are competing in 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.230
 level is the level of education 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.170
 fundamental and need only identify 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.180
 victims you have proof if you are the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.550
 book 2 that high school and technical 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.530
 besides identifying the victim you 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.360
 need to bring it to a place of 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.650
 security that gives complexity a 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.780
 little greater proof 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.790
 we will need to have a handler with the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.960
 same brat and how do you do it 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.060
 to participate 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.310
 Good if you are between 99 and still 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.890
 it's in school, it's elementary school 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.170
 technical average whether you are eligible 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.970
 To participate, just look for your school. 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.520
 find the teacher who is responsible 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.040
 and this has reformed its staff and 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.080
 teacher signs up you help 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.720
 you a little the process then only 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.180
 sport compact the rest will flow 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.890
 now if the school does not participate in the br 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.840
 You'll have much more work to do. 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.880
 instead of school, it has to be structured in 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.410
 around this then this school does not 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.260
 to participate you will have a little bit 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.660
 more convincing work but not 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.820
 I gave up looking for your school and see if they 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.269
 have an interest in participating and if you 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.000
 is no longer at school yesterday so and 19 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.269
 years are paulo voluntary, it's just that 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.430
 legal I treat everyone I'll leave
