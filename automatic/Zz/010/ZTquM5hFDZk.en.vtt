cool<00:00:38.250> stuff<00:00:38.309> under<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> hood<00:00:39.210> here<00:00:39.350> we've<00:00:40.350> got

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
cool stuff under the hood here we've got

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.680 
cool stuff under the hood here we've got
a<00:00:40.530> quad-core<00:00:40.860> exynos<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.090> that's<00:00:42.210> samsung

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
a quad-core exynos for so that's samsung

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.810 
a quad-core exynos for so that's samsung
samsung<00:00:43.140> own<00:00:43.559> processor<00:00:44.129> running<00:00:44.399> at<00:00:44.640> one

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
samsung own processor running at one

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.290 
samsung own processor running at one
point<00:00:44.969> 4<00:00:45.180> gigahertz<00:00:45.530> so<00:00:46.530> super<00:00:47.190> fast<00:00:47.430> allows

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
point 4 gigahertz so super fast allows

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.700 
point 4 gigahertz so super fast allows
you<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.570> lots<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.870> cool<00:00:49.050> stuff<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.590> do

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
you to do lots of cool stuff you can do

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.540 
you to do lots of cool stuff you can do
things<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:50.070> video<00:00:50.250> picture<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.789> picture

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
things like video picture and picture

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.650 
things like video picture and picture
obviously<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.910> multitasking<00:00:54.480> that's

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
obviously the multitasking that's

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.470 
obviously the multitasking that's
inherent<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> OS<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:56.280> bunch<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.090> cool<00:00:57.270> stuff

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
inherent in the OS a bunch of cool stuff

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.040 
inherent in the OS a bunch of cool stuff
like<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.670> we've<00:00:59.670> really<00:01:00.030> focused<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.780> lot

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
like that and we've really focused a lot

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.959 
like that and we've really focused a lot
on<00:01:01.109> two<00:01:01.920> sets<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.250> features<00:01:02.550> one<00:01:02.760> around

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
on two sets of features one around

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.030 
on two sets of features one around
sharing<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:04.049> example<00:01:04.140> that's<00:01:04.589> being<00:01:04.799> with

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
sharing so for example that's being with

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.710 
sharing so for example that's being with
two<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.339> these<00:01:05.430> devices<00:01:05.790> what<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.420> actually

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
two of these devices what I can actually

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.039 
two of these devices what I can actually
do<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.200> quickly<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.280> easily<00:01:08.689> share<00:01:09.689> photo

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
do is quickly and easily share photo

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.469 
do is quickly and easily share photo
video<00:01:10.470> or<00:01:11.369> anything<00:01:11.790> else<00:01:11.909> between<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.330> two

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
video or anything else between the two

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.880 
video or anything else between the two
devices<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.049> what<00:01:13.229> I'm<00:01:13.320> actually<00:01:13.530> gonna<00:01:13.770> do

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
devices so what I'm actually gonna do

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.410 
devices so what I'm actually gonna do
here<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.250> jump<00:01:14.580> into<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> gallery<00:01:15.000> real

quick for example show the video I
started<00:01:22.229> playing<00:01:22.640> bump<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.030> we're<00:01:24.180> Android

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
started playing bump it so we're Android

being so lots of really cool stuff like
that<00:01:43.290> where<00:01:43.590> we've<00:01:43.740> tried<00:01:43.980> to<00:01:44.660> build<00:01:45.660> on<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
that where we've tried to build on the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.090 
that where we've tried to build on the
best<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.260> Android<00:01:46.560> experience<00:01:46.740> and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
best of the Android experience and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.170 
best of the Android experience and
extend<00:01:47.400> it<00:01:47.490> for<00:01:47.640> what<00:01:47.730> people<00:01:48.000> are<00:01:48.060> really

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
extend it for what people are really

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.960 
extend it for what people are really
looking<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.410> mean<00:01:49.890> look<00:01:50.700> at<00:01:50.790> them

looking for so I mean look at them

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.120 
looking for so I mean look at them
physically<00:01:51.660> pretty<00:01:51.870> different<00:01:52.130> obviously

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
physically pretty different obviously

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.550 
physically pretty different obviously
from<00:01:53.760> an<00:01:54.000> experience<00:01:54.510> perspective<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.500> is
