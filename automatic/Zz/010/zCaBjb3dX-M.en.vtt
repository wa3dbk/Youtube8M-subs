00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.090
 hello here for rolf müller from the channel 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.750
 fit 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.950
 and it works 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.740
 why learn boxing at home part 31 and 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.290
 This time, of course, in nice weather 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.420
 file and I'll show you now 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.770
 few things like that can shape that 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.590
 is not that hard we have to 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.930
 just want 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.570
 So what is the most important thing in the boxer 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.879
 has to be flexible and above all things 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.730
 Also in the head must be flexible because of that 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.390
 This time we train outdoors 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.559
 I took a rope to it 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.930
 fortified tree searched with the 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.180
 matching the area should be halfway 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.850
 be flat so he does not click around then 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.010
 I have my girlfriend big berta 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.719
 long and I will now women 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.440
 and show you what you are all about 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.440
 can make off 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:11.890
 then carry 123 123 open again so 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:18.390
 the first technique you will show me 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.390
 you get a bit faster and mouse 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:32.979
 and indeed 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:37.030
 123 long 123 head hooks so 123 long 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:42.180
 be for a three step out and 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:46.229
 again one two three and out on boxing 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.229
 could have gotten faster now 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.790
 We are working on the river again 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:08.060
 flexible try everything was so 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:08.060
 we can always move with it 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.690
 a story we must give it an ear 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.580
 we should hit on our 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.640
 Christmas we protect ours 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.640
 master stage and then just go 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.420
 so before that the steps 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.990
 Watch out when it's slow again 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.990
 are thrust 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:57.330
 very good for the leg work more beautiful 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.460
 and then it still works 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.990

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.480
