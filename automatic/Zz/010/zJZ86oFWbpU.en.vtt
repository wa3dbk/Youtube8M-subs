00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.840
 So and welcome to one 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.000
 new video I'll show you today 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:12.179
 small pocket knife in the name 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.039
 pistol that the citizen magnum 1911 gives 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.119
 on amazon costs 14 euro 95 free 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.400
 currently there is only one left in stock 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.840
 but it's more on the way 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.869
 in the description linked at such 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.109
 the product is so interesting first 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.130
 away with that one comes this chic 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.680
 hello box to the fore is one 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.910
 Can like all brands product so 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:48.420
 something most of the ones I have a lot 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:51.960
 nicely then guaranteed the knife here 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.360
 was again a plastic film which have 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.430
 but I already agreed because I have it 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.000
 ever looked at this unboxing 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.960
 yes that something you can do yesterday 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.359
 Give it good as you can 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.850
 of course take the ostrich guests 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.640
 walls are always cool 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.310
 as somewhere a loveless cardboard and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.610
 Here we have the good thing 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.659
 it is very small 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.890
 ok why is so small 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.360
 yes the blade is error supported 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.530
 That's why you can not spend much longer 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.409
 its really nice thing is 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.040
 relatively heavy seems really high quality 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.280
 processed 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.960
 I would wish for something like that in size 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.590
 from real pistol with such a blade 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.420
 but that does not matter which one we are 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.799
 with this size butterfly knife 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.430
 dortmund who are happy on own but 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:49.110
 then it is somehow important that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.399
 definitely cool for pants pocket 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.009
 for the back pocket 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.590
 always a knife it is not enough 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:01.649
 Trim anything with him 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:05.450
 just did not want to cut like that now 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.450
 Viewed from that I play to say 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.860
 I cut the paper but it is 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.190
 not comparable to for example the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.450
 Swiss pocket knife so if you have 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.959
 really in a very sharp knife 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:25.910
 I want to write about these three 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:31.739
 screws hold the whole thing together 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:37.500
 then you can see here is notes and here 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:40.350
 the front of the lever of the brakes is triggered 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.610
 here you can not join in as well 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.390
 to stick through a small mistake 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.340
 anyway, that's a nice thing 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.980
 thing here so a sound sound 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.040
 must suppress the whole thing after 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.849
 left to read the blade again 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.599
 the whole thing is really fixed 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.950
 very good so only high quality that works 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.110
 if you press on it just so 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.760
 it expresses itself already on 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.810
 but must be relatively goldring so the 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.340
 Probably that somehow 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.030
 So a pair of pants is very low 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.700
 but this a few more times than there 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.109
 fair supports her already 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.150
 nice if you do not hold it tight 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.260
 then so slip out of hand but 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.430
 Yes 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.560
 it should also pay it but 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.600
 on the other side of course and yes so 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.340
 cool in any case 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.650
 yes it could be a bit bigger but then 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.819
 was not so with the reality 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.989
 risky to take this with you now 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.569
 Write me in the comments if you 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.989
 you know better by saying I am 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:46.670
 just to imagine that more 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:49.620
 the blade next to the lever on me 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:54.299
 magnum came at baker's very small chamber 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:57.510
 read that down then a hole in the 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.160
 fingering is both sides 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.920
 honed and pretty nice 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.870
 actually very small 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.160
 The pistol looks good too 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.200
 but really like his 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.550
 pistol 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.350
 next to really small 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.900
 but the whole makes the whole even 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.680
 Learn how cool that is 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:22.300
 really no one is what it really is 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.740
 cool ag in any case really the 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.150
 fair function you can do that 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.710
 regrind but in any case it is 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.360
 a knife so no club stingers with it 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.790
 start would can what do you do 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.700
 actually 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:41.320
 I am my specialist 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:45.240
 for all announce this is good piece 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.240
 also suitable 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:54.460
 [Music] 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:05:00.490
 the exact dimensions and that is it 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:06.100
 I folded so about 65 cm long 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:10.600
 So exactly 615 you then extended eleven 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:16.450
 for centimeters not the blade is 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:18.400
 the emissions are exactly 4 cm long 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.590
 is really a very small knife me 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.350
 take it as gag it is in the 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:31.360
 your pocket and always there 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:33.940
 It's really hot, it's cool 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.350
 not so cheap so 14 90 is now 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.120
 not much money but it is now 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:41.350
 not so that one says yes it is 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.900
 one in five euros is not that cheap 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.560
 his means away but 50 already money and 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.260
 that's definitely worth it so it will 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.860
 really as if you could it as 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.810
 high quality makes a few times 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.730
 on as you also mist if you 50 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.050
 times had opened then everything 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.080
 The screws will be loose 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.919
 or so but that really works 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.570
 Saline is really a cool team 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:11.440
 I would not stop the purchase 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:14.370
 So yes if you wanted it and 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.529
 do not expect too much as you just enter 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.599
 pistols knife 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:22.119
 Thank you for looking and I hope you soon 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:24.839
 again in a new videos euromax 

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:24.839
