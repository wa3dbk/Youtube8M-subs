00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
they did you know it's going to be

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.609 
they did you know it's going to be
easier<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:30.000> us<00:00:30.119> later<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:30.840> if<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.199> go<00:00:31.320> at<00:00:31.410> 10

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
was crucial so never says such a big

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.270 
was crucial so never says such a big

total<00:01:05.909> they<00:01:06.030> put<00:01:06.210> up<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:07.170> always<00:01:07.439> had<00:01:07.590> in

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
total they put up so we always had in

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.960 
total they put up so we always had in
mind<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.010> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.280> difficult<00:01:08.460> gripping

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
mind it's going to be difficult gripping

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.399 
mind it's going to be difficult gripping
the<00:01:09.030> ball<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> second<00:01:09.720> half<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> game

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the ball in the second half of the game

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.260 
the ball in the second half of the game
it<00:01:10.560> was<00:01:10.710> difficult<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.280> first<00:01:11.490> half<00:01:11.700> when

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it was difficult in the first half when

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.149 
it was difficult in the first half when
we<00:01:12.420> were<00:01:12.479> bowling<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:12.869> well<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.830> had<00:01:13.979> that

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
we were bowling as well so we had that

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.460 
we were bowling as well so we had that
at<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> back<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.850> our<00:01:14.939> mind<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.110> know<00:01:16.140> we

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
at the back of our mind and you know we

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.230 
at the back of our mind and you know we
wanted<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.770> bowl<00:01:16.950> first<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.340> well<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.799> it<00:01:19.799> was

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
wanted to bowl first as well so it was

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.149 
wanted to bowl first as well so it was
probably<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:22.170> know<00:01:22.439> one<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.680> those<00:01:22.860> days

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
probably you know one of those days

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.580 
probably you know one of those days
where<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.720> just<00:01:24.720> did<00:01:24.840> everything<00:01:25.080> right<00:01:25.350> when

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
where we just did everything right when

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.530 
where we just did everything right when
we<00:01:25.680> were<00:01:25.710> batting<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.970> know<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.270> just

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
we were batting and you know just just

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.030 
we were batting and you know just just
kept<00:01:27.780> finding<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.409> boundaries<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
kept finding the boundaries and the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.280 
kept finding the boundaries and the
sixes<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.210> wonderful<00:01:30.689> experience<00:01:31.170> out

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
sixes so it was wonderful experience out

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.249 
sixes so it was wonderful experience out
there<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.650> honestly<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:33.000> stopped<00:01:33.900> thinking

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
there I honestly I just stopped thinking

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.830 
there I honestly I just stopped thinking
after<00:01:34.590> 17<00:01:35.189> hours<00:01:35.280> because<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:36.509> know<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> knew

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
after 17 hours because you know I knew

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.210 
after 17 hours because you know I knew
it<00:01:36.960> was<00:01:37.110> difficult<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.500> grip<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> ball<00:01:38.009> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
it was difficult to grip the ball and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.950 
it was difficult to grip the ball and
there's<00:01:38.700> no<00:01:38.820> point<00:01:39.000> getting<00:01:39.180> frustrated<00:01:39.840> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
there's no point getting frustrated and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.649 
there's no point getting frustrated and
you<00:01:40.259> know<00:01:40.350> angry<00:01:40.650> about<00:01:40.860> what's<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.659> all

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
about just giving one hundred percent

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.429 
about just giving one hundred percent
when<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> come<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.909> as<00:01:45.060> well<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.439> it
