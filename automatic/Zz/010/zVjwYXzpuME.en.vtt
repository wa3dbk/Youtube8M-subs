00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.490
 with the arrival of autumn begins a 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.720
 new fertilization campaign in the 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.070
 fields of spain 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.710
 today we are going to talk about the importance 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.140
 of a quality subscriber in comparison 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.180
 the use of fertilizers 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.070
 dubious origin with the beginning of the year 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.349
 agricultural comes the time of shopping 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.359
 and decision-making for this reason 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.460
 the national association of manufacturers of 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.960
 fertilizers launches a campaign 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.810
 for the promotion of quality subscriber 11 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.000
 among its activities performs a very 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.090
 important that is the promotion of a 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.680
 proper use of fertilizers 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.620
 the right product at the time 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.940
 adequate and within that line of 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.620
 activities so we have launched 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.470
 this campaign is basically for 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.590
 remind the farmer of the importance 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.949
 that you pay with fertilizers 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.199
 chemical and physical quality that 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.790
 nutrients are assimilable and that they have 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.190
 been manufactured with the best 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.379
 technologies and that raw materials 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.390
 be of quality they want to avoid 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.460
 any coast that is put on the market 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.430
 Fraudulent products that do not comply 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.590
 with the current legislation that yes its use 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.240
 it has negative consequences 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.680
 every year they look at certain 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.470
 fertilizer areas of dubious origin 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.780
 fertilizers with very low quality and really 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.060
 they are in the market and you have your audience 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.740
 that are really public are 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.270
 farmers that throw it a year and not 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.610
 they repeat to the next one but good they go 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.899
 these are being handled 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.490
 fertilizers with the difference 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.490
 agronomic could be in the 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.360
 in the waste that can leave the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.960
 product on the ground with content of 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.880
 heavy metals and so on and then the 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.510
 plant growth logically not 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.450
 is equal a subscriber with the products of 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.610
 quality 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.130
 with a certain solubility and so on 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.140
 Etcetera, it shows a lot, it shows 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.509
 a lot in the field but how to differentiate 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.909
 a credit quality other than the 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.520
 have a quality subscription is a product 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.649
 that has a minimum of nutrients 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.619
 nutrients that guarantee a contribution 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.769
 suitable to the plant and guarantee its 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.090
 adequate growth on the other hand the 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.260
 raw materials are are raw materials 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.569
 known quality of sources of 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.319
 quality and whose traceability is 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.530
 Guaranteed 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.780
 physically it shows in the grains are 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.350
 all uniforms come all with 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.360
 complexes and also bring little dust 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.220
 physically it shows up later when you go 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.569
 being with the fertilizer because it is a 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.390
 bad fertilizer coming from poor quality 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.209
 first comes a lot of dust does not come well 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.490
 well granulated the fertilizer then this 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.160
 call good then if you want these are 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.700
 age you get the eyes give you the face the 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.340
 dust and second 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.200
 being well being canceled the 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.349
 fertilizer fertilizer and much better because 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.090
 that dust does not stop thinking and goes away then 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.769
 where it goes and then really what 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.780
 we have to see is to identify your file 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.090
 technique and really see where it comes from 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.150
 his provenance what has been his gift of his 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.280
 manufacturing that the factory has been and 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.560
 technical characteristics of what is coming 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.560
 formulated in the fertilizer see a little 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.090
 the quantity and quality of those of 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.920
 fertilizer elements in addition 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.450
 In general the products of poor quality 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.190
 always tend to be cheaper in 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.129
 general everywhere then you have to 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.870
 suspect that he is not a producer of 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.420
 quality also when paid with 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.180
 quality products notice it so much the 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.680
 cultivation as the farmer's pocket 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.410
 The main benefit of using a 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.180
 quality fertilizer profitability is the 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.220
 good fertilizer really is the most profitable 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.340
 when we throw a fertilizer of that 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.450
 dubious origin or formulation as 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.340
 we really do not know the consequences 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.319
 what can you bring in our in our 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.980
 I have worked with everything 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.950
 specific fertilizers 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.709
 a good assimilation in all matters 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.870
 and with almost everything with micro elements to 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.450
 our farms are all well is 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.760
 stubborn the gas but in the end what is 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.640
 note a lot in quality the quality of 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.180
 Product especially onions 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:16.230
 Wheat and barley that gives better in the end 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.760
 grain and better quality 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.290
 and the production is good because although 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.090
 they are fine until red so 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.040
 it is noted that they have good production have 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.220
 have better quality for profitability 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.800
 the fertilizer is well granulated well 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.170
 distribute that is already quality to have the 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.060
 same the same fertilizer the whole farm 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.500
 positive but maybe a site 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.480
 there were more fertilizer than maybe what 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.220
 it harms in cereal very very dark to 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.860
 mucus harms him and in another he would miss 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.170
 would have a lack on the other hand the 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.480
 quality subscriber must go beyond 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.310
 the choice of the product as it is 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.800
 the market the same to produce 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.930
 quality products you have to use 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.240
 quality raw materials then then 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.250
 at least know what you already buy 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.120
 who buys what is fundamental and what 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.460
 first you have to do each 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.170
 farmer is to analyze more or less his 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.880
 land to know what we have 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.950
 having already the result of the analytical 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.480
 of the land we can calculate 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.160
 perfectly that has subscribed goes to 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.110
 need and must be taken into account 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.880
 always the main macro elements 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.010
 which are nitrogen phosphorus and 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.540
 potassium but we can not forget about 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.150
 the macro elements as they are 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.830
 the calcium the magnesium and the sulfur and for 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.210
 not to mention the micro elements that 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.650
 they are also indispensable for 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.900
 any quality crop 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.150
 all these elements add up to the time of 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.150
 get healthy and profitable crops
