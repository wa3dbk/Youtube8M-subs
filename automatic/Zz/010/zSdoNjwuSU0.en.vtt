00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.040
 hello today we are going to learn how to put a 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.790
 towel rack in our tile bathroom 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.790
 I hope you like it 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:19.040
 to learn how to put our towel rack 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.350
 We are going to obviously need everything that 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.540
 we have chosen and as you can see 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.460
 marked then the holes to put 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.880
 the screws in this case are two one 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.520
 each end so we'll need two 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.910
 screws and for each screw always a 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.910
 Taco 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.289
 to choose the site we want to make 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.719
 the drills to place our 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:43.359
 towel rack first is we advise that 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:46.149
 try to see if the tile is in 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.010
 willingness to do it for 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.979
 example simply touching as no longer 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.019
 we make a door we will see that it sounds 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.089
 well with which we could place it in 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:59.739
 excel but for example this one would be 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:01.390
 hollow louis and if we take this one very 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.540
 probably thought some crack 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.570
 in the tile 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.150
 once we have chosen and have to 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.760
 let's put our towel rack in 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.620
 the holes we will mark where we are going to 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.060
 have to do the drill with a pencil 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.100
 for example 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.110
 when we have done the holes with 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.409
 the drill we have to introduce inside 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.909
 the tacos that we can help with a 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.909
 hammer fist 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.630
 when we have already made the hole 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.659
 put the cue now let's put the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.479
 screws we put it and with 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.080
 screwdrivers we will help us to 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.080
 put it to the bottom 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.810
 before tightening them all we put 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.100
 our towel rack and that's it 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.080
 squeezing to the bottom 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.939
 well, we already have our state 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.440
 yesterday and we could start hanging them 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.549
