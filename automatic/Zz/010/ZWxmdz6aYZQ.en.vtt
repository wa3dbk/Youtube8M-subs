00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.470
 hello you love here is nicole of 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.040
 charity and I would like to be here today 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.380
 with you a cool stopper and indeed 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.869
 you need the following things her 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.430
 needs foam look forward 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.939
 I have now decided for 4 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:28.310
 You can also take two big ones then 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:33.020
 a piece of fabric measuring 89 cm x 39 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:37.460
 cm I already have the hems and 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.430
 The almost gang with one expects so that 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.870
 first thing you have to do is to 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:50.179
 short sides the hems that is you 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:52.760
 battle the short sides 1.5 cm 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.120
 inside so we have the left side 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.589
 above 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.710
 I laugh at the 15 cm and then 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.949
 another 15 cm and then you just barely 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.610
 edged here on this inner knew 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.090
 along 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.930
 you do that on both sides if you 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.650
 We'll see each other again like that 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.150
 Now we have sewn all the pages now 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.079
 is it about having that one 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.290
 tunnel for the rollers and you can do that 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.780
 a real fabric on the right 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.100
 that because the right side is down 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:35.020
 and works the two longer edges 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:38.770
 We have to go now 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.770
 seven centimeters 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:50.850
 and put that once complete long 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:55.590
 edge off after both sides now 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.180
 Stuck with the 7 cm he sews now 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.479
 Once I knew just about both 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:05.250
 I can walk along the inner edges 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.259
 you can see each other again then 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.850
 small tip I try as an 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.709
 the inner edge of the foot too 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.790
 orient the edge there creates 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.770
 I do not know if this is the way it is here 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.870
 good to see 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:25.680
 but this edge closes with this 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:30.170
 up here you will see if 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.209
 you sewed the hoses if you are 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:40.500
 exactly loads because now you can 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:42.690
 Real estate but foam roll 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.570
 push in great and you have already 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.640
 your air stoppers ready and the 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.150
 would have to look the same with you then 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.410
 as with me in the middle now has a 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.290
 area and that will be under the door 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.920
 I'll show you soon 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.920
 also a picture
