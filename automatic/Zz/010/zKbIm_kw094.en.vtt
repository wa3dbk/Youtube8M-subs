00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
see in the trailer where he snaps up one

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.830 
see in the trailer where he snaps up one
of<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.769> ACU<00:02:56.160> soldiers<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.569> head<00:02:57.720> is

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
articulated so you can move that up and

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.879 
articulated so you can move that up and
down<00:02:59.730> you<00:03:00.239> can<00:03:00.269> spin<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.900> from<00:03:01.109> side<00:03:01.319> to<00:03:01.380> side

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
down you can spin it from side to side

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.979 
down you can spin it from side to side
and<00:03:02.160> it's<00:03:02.280> ratcheted<00:03:02.850> as<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.090> can<00:03:03.239> hear<00:03:03.630> the

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
and it's ratcheted as you can hear the

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.289 
and it's ratcheted as you can hear the

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.180 
arms are articulated the hands are made
of<00:03:06.450> rubber<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:07.079> suppose<00:03:07.620> because<00:03:07.829> they're

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
of rubber I suppose because they're

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.699 
of rubber I suppose because they're
sharp<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:09.269> legs<00:03:09.480> do<00:03:09.690> move<00:03:09.720> forward<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:10.500> back

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
sharp the legs do move forward and back

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.589 
sharp the legs do move forward and back
then<00:03:10.980> they're<00:03:11.130> ratcheted<00:03:11.639> as<00:03:11.819> well<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.299> the

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
then they're ratcheted as well and the

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.140 
then they're ratcheted as well and the
tail<00:03:12.840> up<00:03:13.109> until<00:03:13.440> this<00:03:13.650> end<00:03:13.889> part<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.670> part<00:03:14.730> is

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
tail up until this end part this part is

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.059 
tail up until this end part this part is
rubber<00:03:15.480> here<00:03:15.870> but<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.079> rest<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.530> hard<00:03:16.859> plastic

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
rubber here but the rest is hard plastic

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.729 
rubber here but the rest is hard plastic
and<00:03:17.549> you<00:03:18.060> can<00:03:18.239> twist<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.690> tail<00:03:18.930> like<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.319> I

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
and you can twist the tail like that I

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.379 
and you can twist the tail like that I
also<00:03:19.980> like<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.310> detailing<00:03:20.730> on<00:03:21.000> this<00:03:21.120> guy<00:03:21.329> the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.849 
sculpt is particularly impressive for a
Lego<00:03:23.880> figure<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.900> also<00:03:25.169> I<00:03:25.319> really<00:03:25.380> like<00:03:25.620> these

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
Lego figure and also I really like these

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.159 
Lego figure and also I really like these
grey<00:03:26.130> decals<00:03:26.639> with<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:26.970> scales<00:03:27.269> all<00:03:27.569> over<00:03:28.049> the

the yellow painted teeth and the way

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.009 
the yellow painted teeth and the way
that<00:03:31.889> they<00:03:32.040> marry<00:03:32.370> up<00:03:32.819> when<00:03:33.209> you<00:03:33.329> close<00:03:33.630> the

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
that they marry up when you close the

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.470 
that they marry up when you close the
jaw<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:34.799> let's<00:03:35.160> take<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.400> closer<00:03:35.700> look<00:03:35.849> first

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
jaw so let's take a closer look first

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.240 
jaw so let's take a closer look first
off<00:03:36.660> there's<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.109> gyrosphere<00:03:37.560> launcher

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
off there's the gyrosphere launcher

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.339 
off there's the gyrosphere launcher
which<00:03:38.400> comes<00:03:38.730> with<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:38.940> Zac<00:03:39.299> minifigure<00:03:40.079> and

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
which comes with the Zac minifigure and

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.319 
which comes with the Zac minifigure and
this<00:03:40.739> is<00:03:40.919> really<00:03:41.370> cool<00:03:41.639> the<00:03:41.940> gyrosphere

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
this is really cool the gyrosphere

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.170 
this is really cool the gyrosphere
itself<00:03:43.049> is<00:03:43.290> self<00:03:43.620> balancing<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:44.609> that<00:03:44.849> stays

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
itself is self balancing so that stays

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.360 
itself is self balancing so that stays
upright<00:03:45.630> in<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.079> gyrosphere<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:47.130> if<00:03:47.250> that

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
upright in the gyrosphere and if that

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.520 
upright in the gyrosphere and if that
weren't<00:03:47.700> cool<00:03:47.880> enough<00:03:48.329> this<00:03:48.870> thing<00:03:49.139> actually

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
weren't cool enough this thing actually

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.530 
weren't cool enough this thing actually
