00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
the application to this device so let's

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.819 
the application to this device so let's
just<00:02:53.689> launch<00:02:54.689> the<00:02:54.780> application<00:02:55.379> which<00:02:55.590> like<00:02:55.799> I

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
just launch the application which like I

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.369 
just launch the application which like I
said<00:02:55.919> is<00:02:56.220> gum<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.700> free<00:02:57.329> from<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.230> App<00:02:58.349> Store

right now and as you can see it's just

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.319 
right now and as you can see it's just
going<00:03:55.829> through<00:03:55.979> the<00:03:56.250> steps<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:57.090> make<00:03:57.299> it

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
going through the steps to make it

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.399 
going through the steps to make it
everything<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.829> it<00:03:58.949> needs<00:03:58.979> to<00:03:59.340> be<00:04:00.259> so<00:04:01.259> once

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
everything that it needs to be so once

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.240 
everything that it needs to be so once
it's<00:04:01.620> done<00:04:01.769> that<00:04:01.949> we<00:04:02.099> can<00:04:02.250> go<00:04:03.590> into<00:04:04.590> the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
it's done that we can go into the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.270 
it's done that we can go into the
picture<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.849> as<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.120> can<00:04:06.269> see<00:04:06.329> I<00:04:07.040> can<00:04:08.040> zoom

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
picture and as you can see I can zoom

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.439 
picture and as you can see I can zoom
around<00:04:09.949> my<00:04:10.949> picture<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:11.549> you<00:04:11.879> can<00:04:11.909> see<00:04:12.060> this

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
around my picture and you can see this

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:15.550 
around my picture and you can see this
is<00:04:12.659> a<00:04:13.129> 3d<00:04:14.129> kind<00:04:14.400> of<00:04:14.549> model<00:04:14.849> so<00:04:15.000> you<00:04:15.060> can<00:04:15.150> go<00:04:15.359> up

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
is a 3d kind of model so you can go up

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.319 
is a 3d kind of model so you can go up
and<00:04:16.560> go<00:04:16.739> down<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.340> you<00:04:17.519> can<00:04:17.549> luckily<00:04:18.060> right

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
and go down and you can luckily right

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.899 
and go down and you can luckily right
you<00:04:18.599> can<00:04:18.750> do<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:19.049> 2d<00:04:19.470> version<00:04:19.650> which<00:04:20.579> just

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
you can do a 2d version which just

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.270 
you can do a 2d version which just
allows<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:21.389> to<00:04:21.509> go<00:04:21.630> left<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.650> right<00:04:22.860> you<00:04:23.070> can't

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
allows you to go left to right you can't

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.820 
allows you to go left to right you can't
go<00:04:23.430> up<00:04:23.639> or<00:04:23.820> down<00:04:23.849> or<00:04:24.180> so<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.320> think<00:04:25.440> it<00:04:25.680> takes

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
go up or down or so I think it takes

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.980 
go up or down or so I think it takes
pretty<00:04:26.159> pretty<00:04:27.060> decent<00:04:27.450> pictures<00:04:27.750> to<00:04:27.870> be

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
pretty pretty decent pictures to be

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.690 
pretty pretty decent pictures to be
honest<00:04:28.200> with<00:04:28.380> you

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700

now<00:04:30.540> let's<00:04:30.870> have<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.050> look<00:04:31.200> at<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.500> 360<00:04:31.800> and

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
now let's have a look at the 360 and

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.100 
now let's have a look at the 360 and
this<00:04:32.580> is<00:04:32.760> where<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.030> application<00:04:33.540> comes<00:04:33.810> into

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
this is where the application comes into

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.290 
this is where the application comes into
its<00:04:34.260> own<00:04:35.510> so<00:04:36.510> if<00:04:36.570> we<00:04:36.720> just<00:04:37.670> move<00:04:38.670> this<00:04:38.910> up<00:04:39.120> so

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
its own so if we just move this up so

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.570 
its own so if we just move this up so
you<00:04:39.420> can<00:04:39.630> see<00:04:40.100> so<00:04:41.100> you<00:04:41.190> can<00:04:41.340> see<00:04:41.490> the

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
you can see so you can see the

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.640 
you can see so you can see the
crosshairs<00:04:42.060> at<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.300> front<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:43.170> once<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:43.530> get

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
crosshairs at the front and once you get

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.670 
crosshairs at the front and once you get
that<00:04:43.710> lined<00:04:43.980> up<00:04:44.190> it<00:04:44.370> will<00:04:44.490> automatically<00:04:45.680> take

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680
