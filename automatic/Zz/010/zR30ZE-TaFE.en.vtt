price<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.060> as<00:00:18.210> far<00:00:18.779> as<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.019> shaft

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
price to it as far as the shaft

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.690 
price to it as far as the shaft
dimensions<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.860> it<00:00:19.890> has<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.370> little<00:00:20.580> more

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:20.700 
dimensions to it has a little more

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.250 
dimensions to it has a little more
rounded<00:00:21.180> edges<00:00:21.570> than<00:00:21.660> what<00:00:21.870> you<00:00:21.990> saw<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
rounded edges than what you saw in the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260 
rounded edges than what you saw in the
Vandal<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.860> little<00:00:23.550> more<00:00:23.670> double<00:00:24.060> concave

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
Vandal a little more double concave

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.910 
Vandal a little more double concave
walls<00:00:24.630> as<00:00:24.869> well<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.260> think<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.560> has<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> little

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
walls as well so I think it has a little

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.710 
walls as well so I think it has a little
bit<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.280> more<00:00:26.490> comfortable<00:00:26.880> more<00:00:27.210> natural

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
bit of a more comfortable more natural

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.689 
bit of a more comfortable more natural
grip<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.050> your<00:00:28.140> hands<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:29.190> really<00:00:29.400> like<00:00:29.550> that

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
grip in your hands so I really like that

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.209 
grip in your hands so I really like that
also<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.690> six<00:00:30.930> going<00:00:31.110> to<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.410> warriors

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
also the six going to have warriors

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.979 
also the six going to have warriors
nipple<00:00:32.609> grip<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.480> basically<00:00:33.780> what<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:33.899> is

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
nipple grip so basically what that is

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.870 
nipple grip so basically what that is
give<00:00:34.260> me<00:00:34.289> a<00:00:34.379> slightly<00:00:34.710> rubberized<00:00:35.550> coating

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
give me a slightly rubberized coating

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.370 
give me a slightly rubberized coating
that's<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.510> stick<00:00:36.720> as<00:00:36.870> well<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.170> little

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
that's on the stick as well as a little

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.020 
that's on the stick as well as a little
bit<00:00:37.470> of<00:00:37.530> texture<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.370> texture<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.970> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
bit of texture that texture is going to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.510 
bit of texture that texture is going to
run<00:00:39.149> from<00:00:39.360> about<00:00:39.600> my<00:00:39.750> top<00:00:39.989> hand<00:00:40.260> here<00:00:40.590> down<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
run from about my top hand here down to

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.370 
run from about my top hand here down to
about<00:00:41.670> my<00:00:41.850> bottom<00:00:42.059> hand<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.050> that's<00:00:43.170> gonna<00:00:43.260> be

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
about my bottom hand so that's gonna be

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.930 
about my bottom hand so that's gonna be
really<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.770> area<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.220> your<00:00:44.370> lower<00:00:44.579> hands

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
really the area that your lower hands

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.250 
really the area that your lower hands
give<00:00:45.180> me<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.360> giving<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.660> little<00:00:45.840> more<00:00:46.020> stick

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
give me in giving a little more stick

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.950 
give me in giving a little more stick
control<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:46.940> far<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.030> materials<00:00:48.540> used<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.870> this

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
control as far as materials used on this

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.840 
control as far as materials used on this
stick<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.380> this<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.890> using<00:00:50.190> warriors<00:00:50.489> carbon

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
stick and this is using warriors carbon

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.420 
stick and this is using warriors carbon
deluxe<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.870> nice<00:00:51.960> add<00:00:52.230> next<00:00:53.219> kind<00:00:53.370> of

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
deluxe so it's a nice add next kind of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.889 
deluxe so it's a nice add next kind of
high<00:00:53.579> grade<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:54.120> not<00:00:54.239> their<00:00:54.390> highest<00:00:54.719> grade

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
high grade it's not their highest grade

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.959 
high grade it's not their highest grade
of<00:00:54.930> carbon<00:00:55.379> but<00:00:56.040> it's<00:00:56.399> definitely<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.790> nice

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
of carbon but it's definitely a nice

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.810 
of carbon but it's definitely a nice
grade<00:00:57.300> carbon<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.870> are<00:00:57.930> using<00:00:58.110> on<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.820> also

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
grade carbon that are using on this also

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.180 
grade carbon that are using on this also
this<00:01:00.360> stick<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.750> using<00:01:01.200> the<00:01:01.379> precision<00:01:01.950> taper

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
this stick is using the precision taper

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.279 
this stick is using the precision taper
so<00:01:03.030> instead<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.510> linear<00:01:03.780> taper<00:01:04.019> which

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:04.289 
so instead of the linear taper which

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:05.959 
so instead of the linear taper which
focuses<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> flex<00:01:05.159> higher<00:01:05.399> up<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.759> shaft

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:05.969 
focuses the flex higher up on the shaft

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:07.609 
focuses the flex higher up on the shaft
this<00:01:06.240> one<00:01:06.390> focuses<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.840> little<00:01:07.260> bit<00:01:07.350> lower

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
this one focuses a little bit lower

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.590 
this one focuses a little bit lower
closer<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> blade<00:01:08.610> offering<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.330> quicker

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
closer to the blade offering a quicker

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.570 
closer to the blade offering a quicker
release<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.229> also<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.830> may<00:01:11.010> be<00:01:11.159> an<00:01:11.250> easier

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
release and also this may be an easier

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.670 
release and also this may be an easier
loading<00:01:12.090> stick<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.690> don't<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.140> link

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
loading stick so you don't have to link

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.920 
loading stick so you don't have to link
quite<00:01:14.130> as<00:01:14.310> hard<00:01:14.520> into<00:01:14.790> your<00:01:14.880> sticks<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.869> if

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
quite as hard into your sticks so if

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.210 
quite as hard into your sticks so if
you're<00:01:16.020> kind<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.290> player<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.560> maybe<00:01:16.950> shoots

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
you're kind of player that maybe shoots

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.649 
you're kind of player that maybe shoots
a<00:01:17.280> little<00:01:17.490> more<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:17.670> your<00:01:17.729> arms<00:01:18.210> instead<00:01:18.450> of

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
a little more with your arms instead of

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.810 
a little more with your arms instead of
instead<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.140> your<00:01:19.290> entire<00:01:19.530> body<00:01:19.820> definitely

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
instead of your entire body definitely

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.940 
instead of your entire body definitely
the<00:01:20.939> precision<00:01:21.450> taper<00:01:21.689> from<00:01:22.049> warrior<00:01:22.890> is

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the precision taper from warrior is

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.590 
the precision taper from warrior is
going<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> be<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.400> go<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:23.820> going

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
going to be the one to go with going

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.760 
going to be the one to go with going
onto<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.840> blade<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.260> see<00:01:25.380> they're<00:01:25.500> using

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
onto the blade you can see they're using

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.070 
onto the blade you can see they're using
a<00:01:25.830> nice<00:01:26.010> grade<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.909> carbon<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:28.020> to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
a nice grade of carbon this is going to

a nice grade of carbon this is going to
be<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.229> little<00:01:28.409> bit<00:01:28.560> nicer<00:01:28.740> carbonyl<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.460> just

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
be a little bit nicer carbonyl and just

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.250 
be a little bit nicer carbonyl and just

fiberglass<00:01:32.159> disease<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.509> is

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
fiberglass disease on that but it is

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.010 
fiberglass disease on that but it is
using<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.140> same<00:01:34.470> soft<00:01:34.950> core<00:01:35.280> blade<00:01:36.270> so

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
using the same soft core blade so

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.510 
using the same soft core blade so
basically<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.439> soft<00:01:37.770> core<00:01:38.009> would<00:01:38.159> does<00:01:38.369> is

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
basically that soft core would does is

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.100 
basically that soft core would does is
offers<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> little<00:01:39.060> bit<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.330> softer<00:01:39.810> feel<00:01:39.960> in

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
offers a little bit of a softer feel in

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.690 
offers a little bit of a softer feel in
your<00:01:40.170> puck<00:01:40.380> handling<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.950> especially<00:01:41.520> when

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
your puck handling and especially when

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.580 
your puck handling and especially when
we<00:01:41.790> receiving<00:01:42.150> passes<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.900> kind<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.110> absorbs

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
we receiving passes it kind of absorbs

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.320 
we receiving passes it kind of absorbs
that<00:01:43.740> energy<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> little<00:01:44.400> bit<00:01:44.490> more<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:45.150> from

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
that energy a little bit more but from

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.450 
that energy a little bit more but from
the<00:01:45.450> rigid<00:01:45.810> outer<00:01:46.020> layer<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.890> carbon<00:01:47.220> on

the rigid outer layer of that carbon on

the rigid outer layer of that carbon on
this<00:01:47.579> plate<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:48.000> still<00:01:48.150> going<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.329> offer<00:01:48.479> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
this plate it's still going to offer a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.840 
this plate it's still going to offer a
nice<00:01:48.780> crisp<00:01:49.290> release<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.189> those<00:01:50.340> shots<00:01:50.610> and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
nice crisp release to those shots and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.630 
nice crisp release to those shots and
passes<00:01:51.350> going<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> overall<00:01:53.130> feel<00:01:53.430> this

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
passes going on to the overall feel this

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.760 
passes going on to the overall feel this
dick<00:01:53.850> i<00:01:54.090> think<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> nice<00:01:54.960> comfortable<00:01:55.380> feel

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
dick i think is a nice comfortable feel

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.319 
dick i think is a nice comfortable feel
because<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> shaft<00:01:56.610> dimensions<00:01:57.119> it's

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
because of the shaft dimensions it's

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.240 
because of the shaft dimensions it's
very<00:01:57.509> similar<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.110> what<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.920> saw<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
very similar to what you saw in the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.380 
very similar to what you saw in the
dolomites<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.820> if<00:01:59.880> you're<00:02:00.000> familiar<00:02:00.149> with

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
dolomites so if you're familiar with

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.899 
dolomites so if you're familiar with
those<00:02:00.600> shaft<00:02:00.930> dimensions<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:02.250> pretty<00:02:02.729> nice

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
those shaft dimensions but pretty nice

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.300 
those shaft dimensions but pretty nice
feel<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.329> little<00:02:03.840> blade<00:02:04.170> heavy<00:02:04.470> but<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.220> is

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
feel to it little blade heavy but it is

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.980 
feel to it little blade heavy but it is
a<00:02:05.340> lightweight<00:02:05.640> stick<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.659> some<00:02:06.810> nice

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
a lightweight stick and some nice

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.289 
a lightweight stick and some nice
looking<00:02:07.140> graphics<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.860> as<00:02:08.069> well<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.519> once

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
looking graphics on it as well so once

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:10.880 
looking graphics on it as well so once
again<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.629> finished<00:02:09.989> quick<00:02:10.349> look<00:02:10.619> at<00:02:10.829> the
