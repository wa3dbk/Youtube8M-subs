big azúcar is a whole lot different than

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.360 
big azúcar is a whole lot different than
jumping<00:00:13.440> with<00:00:13.559> other<00:00:13.799> normal<00:00:14.099> rocket

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
launchers plus rocket jumping with the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.080 
launchers plus rocket jumping with the
beggars<00:00:16.890> bazooka<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.310> really<00:00:17.640> important

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
beggars bazooka is really important

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
lot of mobility and being really

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.009 
lot of mobility and being really
aggressive<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.330> weapon<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.750> really

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
aggressive with this weapon is really

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.689 
aggressive with this weapon is really
important<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:29.039> I'm<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.220> going<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.429> go<00:00:29.550> over

important so I'm just going to go over
the<00:00:29.789> different<00:00:30.060> jump<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.390> can<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.570> with

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
the different jump so you can do with

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.359 
the different jump so you can do with
Biggers<00:00:30.960> bazooka<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.560> what<00:00:31.830> actually<00:00:32.040> kind

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
Biggers bazooka and what actually kind

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.790 
Biggers bazooka and what actually kind
of<00:00:32.460> Handy<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.820> actual<00:00:33.090> games<00:00:33.380> now<00:00:34.380> first<00:00:34.620> off

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
of Handy in actual games now first off

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.470 
of Handy in actual games now first off
it's<00:00:35.010> really<00:00:35.100> important<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.790> know<00:00:35.910> some<00:00:36.210> basic

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
it's really important to know some basic

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.940 
it's really important to know some basic
rocket<00:00:36.780> jumping<00:00:37.020> skills<00:00:37.290> before<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.649> do<00:00:37.770> this

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
rocket jumping skills before you do this

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.830 
rocket jumping skills before you do this
because<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:39.000> you're<00:00:39.120> new<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.360> rocket<00:00:39.629> jumping

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
because if you're new to rocket jumping

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.060 
because if you're new to rocket jumping
this<00:00:39.989> might<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> little<00:00:40.559> bit<00:00:40.649> trickier<00:00:41.010> than

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
this might be a little bit trickier than

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.799 
this might be a little bit trickier than
you<00:00:41.219> would<00:00:41.370> think<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.390> would<00:00:42.480> like<00:00:42.600> to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
you would think so if you would like to

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.180 
you would think so if you would like to
you<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.170> check<00:00:43.320> out<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.590> basic<00:00:43.920> rocket

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
you can check out this basic rocket

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.400 
you can check out this basic rocket
jumping<00:00:44.430> tutorial<00:00:44.910> here<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:46.110> will<00:00:46.200> kind

of help you be more prepared for beggars
bazooka<00:00:47.850> jumping<00:00:48.469> then<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.590> start<00:00:49.800> off<00:00:49.950> you

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
bazooka jumping then to start off you

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.290 
bazooka jumping then to start off you
just<00:00:50.250> want<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.489> practice<00:00:50.640> doing<00:00:51.000> normal

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
just want to practice doing normal

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.119 
just want to practice doing normal
rocket<00:00:51.600> jumps<00:00:51.870> because<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.980> load<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
rocket jumps because you have to load a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.950 
rocket jumps because you have to load a
rocket<00:00:53.520> first<00:00:53.699> before<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.030> shoot<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.780> gets

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
rocket first before you shoot it it gets

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.029 
rocket first before you shoot it it gets
kind<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.199> awkward<00:00:55.500> when<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.680> want<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> try<00:00:55.980> to

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
kind of awkward when you want to try to

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.529 
kind of awkward when you want to try to
get<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.219> timing<00:00:56.430> right<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.390> practice

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
get the timing right so just practice

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.119 
get the timing right so just practice
this<00:00:57.750> loading<00:00:58.079> one<00:00:58.199> rocket<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.710> shoot<00:00:58.859> off

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
this loading one rocket and shoot off

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.439 
this loading one rocket and shoot off
the<00:00:59.370> ground<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.730> launching<00:01:00.030> yourself<00:01:00.090> into

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
the ground and launching yourself into

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.810 
the ground and launching yourself into
the<00:01:00.539> air<00:01:00.710> now<00:01:01.710> doing<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.309> basically<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the air now doing this is basically the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.280 
the air now doing this is basically the
same<00:01:02.969> as<00:01:03.030> using<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.480> normal<00:01:03.600> rocket<00:01:03.989> launcher

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
same as using a normal rocket launcher

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.929 
same as using a normal rocket launcher
which<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.040> kind<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.250> awkward<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.700> weird<00:01:05.820> I

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
which is kind of awkward and weird I

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.399 
which is kind of awkward and weird I
first<00:01:06.180> load<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.450> rocket<00:01:06.689> before<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.229> shoot

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
first load the rocket before you shoot

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.560 
first load the rocket before you shoot
so<00:01:08.280> again<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.549> down<00:01:08.760> won't<00:01:08.939> be<00:01:09.030> important<00:01:09.450> to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
so again this down won't be important to

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.080 
so again this down won't be important to
go<00:01:09.689> into<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.930> more<00:01:10.080> advanced<00:01:10.320> stuff<00:01:10.560> later

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
go into the more advanced stuff later

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.399 
go into the more advanced stuff later
now<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.150> one<00:01:12.420> thing<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.810> makes<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> beggars

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
now the one thing that makes the beggars

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.660 
now the one thing that makes the beggars
bazooka<00:01:13.560> really<00:01:14.010> stand<00:01:14.250> out<00:01:14.340> from<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.520> other

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
bazooka really stand out from the other

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.700 
bazooka really stand out from the other
rocket<00:01:15.030> launchers<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.930> overload<00:01:16.320> rocket

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
rocket launchers is the overload rocket

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.070 
rocket launchers is the overload rocket
and<00:01:16.939> the<00:01:17.939> overload<00:01:18.299> rocket<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.780> basically

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
and the overload rocket is basically

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.480 
and the overload rocket is basically
when<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.320> load<00:01:19.500> too<00:01:19.680> many<00:01:19.830> rockets<00:01:20.189> into<00:01:20.340> your

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
when you load too many rockets into your

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.399 
when you load too many rockets into your
biggest<00:01:20.700> bazooka<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.750> rocket<00:01:21.990> explodes

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
biggest bazooka and the rocket explodes

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.469 
biggest bazooka and the rocket explodes
and<00:01:22.530> does<00:01:22.650> damage<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:24.119> because<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
and does damage to you now because the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.330 
and does damage to you now because the
overload<00:01:24.900> rocket<00:01:25.200> does<00:01:25.320> damage<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
overload rocket does damage to you you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.770 
overload rocket does damage to you you
can<00:01:26.490> basically<00:01:26.640> use<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.090> as<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> normal<00:01:27.479> rocket

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
can basically use it as a normal rocket

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.600 
can basically use it as a normal rocket
jump<00:01:27.960> now<00:01:28.650> what's<00:01:28.799> really<00:01:28.890> great<00:01:29.159> about<00:01:29.369> this

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
jump now what's really great about this

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.609 
jump now what's really great about this
is<00:01:29.850> they<00:01:30.180> can<00:01:30.329> pretty<00:01:30.509> much<00:01:30.600> aim<00:01:30.930> anywhere<00:01:31.409> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
is they can pretty much aim anywhere and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.840 
is they can pretty much aim anywhere and
the<00:01:31.890> rocket<00:01:32.159> will<00:01:32.250> send<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.490> off<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the rocket will send you off in the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.090 
the rocket will send you off in the
opposite<00:01:33.180> direction<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.799> even<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.979> was

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
opposite direction so even if I was

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.440 
opposite direction so even if I was
aiming<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.369> my<00:01:35.520> site<00:01:35.759> where<00:01:35.970> there's<00:01:36.090> no<00:01:36.210> wall

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
aiming to my site where there's no wall

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.420 
aiming to my site where there's no wall
or<00:01:36.570> anything<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.500> still<00:01:37.680> do<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> normal<00:01:38.189> jump

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
or anything I can still do a normal jump

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.490 
or anything I can still do a normal jump
like<00:01:38.670> there<00:01:38.850> was<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> wall<00:01:39.240> there<00:01:39.439> now<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
like there was a wall there now the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.200 
like there was a wall there now the
overload<00:01:40.950> rocket<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.340> used<00:01:41.520> especially<00:01:42.060> when

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
overload rocket is used especially when

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.630 
overload rocket is used especially when
you<00:01:42.299> want<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.509> jump<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> group<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.380> people

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
you want to jump in on a group of people

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.679 
you want to jump in on a group of people
because<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:44.850> use<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.090> third<00:01:45.270> rocket

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
because it can use that third rocket

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.569 
because it can use that third rocket
they<00:01:45.780> use<00:01:45.930> as<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> overload<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:47.009> jump<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
they use as the overload to jump in and

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.980 
they use as the overload to jump in and
then<00:01:47.640> release<00:01:47.939> two<00:01:48.149> Rockets<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.659> people

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
then release two Rockets on the people

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.749 
then release two Rockets on the people
you're<00:01:49.170> aiming<00:01:49.470> at<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.520> really

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
you're aiming at so it's a really

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.210 
you're aiming at so it's a really
aggressive<00:01:51.000> way<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.540> using<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.899> weapon<00:01:52.290> now

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
aggressive way of using this weapon now

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.710 
aggressive way of using this weapon now
once<00:01:53.399> you've<00:01:53.520> overloaded<00:01:53.850> your<00:01:54.119> third<00:01:54.299> rocket

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
once you've overloaded your third rocket

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.389 
once you've overloaded your third rocket
you<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.350> basically<00:01:55.530> do<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> same<00:01:56.070> thing<00:01:56.280> with

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
you can basically do the same thing with

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.830 
you can basically do the same thing with
your<00:01:56.520> other<00:01:56.729> two<00:01:56.969> rockets<00:01:57.360> if<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.659> keep

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
your other two rockets if you keep

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.020 
your other two rockets if you keep
reloading<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.610> here's<00:01:59.610> why<00:01:59.759> this<00:01:59.820> is

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
reloading and here's why this is

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.030 
reloading and here's why this is
actually<00:02:00.390> really<00:02:00.600> useful<00:02:00.719> when<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> overload

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
actually really useful when you overload

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.200 
actually really useful when you overload
your<00:02:02.250> third<00:02:02.369> rocket<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.909> do<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> normal

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
your third rocket and you do a normal

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.209 
your third rocket and you do a normal
rocket<00:02:03.600> jump<00:02:03.780> into<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.079> air<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:05.009> use<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
rocket jump into the air you can use the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.859 
rocket jump into the air you can use the
other<00:02:05.340> two<00:02:05.640> rockets<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.240> overload<00:02:06.630> while

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
other two rockets to overload while

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.630 
other two rockets to overload while
you're<00:02:06.990> still<00:02:07.229> floating<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> air

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
you're still floating in the air

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.340 
you're still floating in the air
and<00:02:09.270> you're<00:02:09.390> basically<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.720> building<00:02:09.990> speed<00:02:10.200> on

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
and you're basically a building speed on

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.600 
and you're basically a building speed on
top<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.590> one<00:02:10.710> another<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.310> flying

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
top of one another and just flying

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.610 
top of one another and just flying
across<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.150> map<00:02:12.330> if<00:02:13.080> you're<00:02:13.230> touching<00:02:13.500> no

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
across the map if you're touching no

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.320 
across the map if you're touching no
surfaces<00:02:14.100> at<00:02:14.250> all<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.910> you're<00:02:15.060> still<00:02:15.240> doing

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
surfaces at all and you're still doing

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.850 
surfaces at all and you're still doing
like<00:02:15.570> normal<00:02:15.900> rocket<00:02:16.140> jumps<00:02:16.350> across<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.680> map

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
like normal rocket jumps across the map

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.750 
like normal rocket jumps across the map
it's<00:02:17.040> really<00:02:17.340> cool

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
it's really cool

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.670 
it's really cool
this<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.720> really<00:02:18.990> great<00:02:19.110> way<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.320> just<00:02:19.560> get

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
this is a really great way to just get

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.020 
this is a really great way to just get
behind<00:02:19.830> people<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.460> flank<00:02:20.730> them<00:02:20.790> on<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
behind people and flank them on the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.880 
behind people and flank them on the
other<00:02:21.120> side<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:22.290> you're<00:02:22.440> going<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.650> use<00:02:22.740> this

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
other side and you're going to use this

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.880 
other side and you're going to use this
a<00:02:22.920> ton<00:02:23.250> when<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.490> get<00:02:23.640> into<00:02:23.850> really<00:02:24.000> open<00:02:24.360> maps

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
a ton when you get into really open maps

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.110 
a ton when you get into really open maps
but<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:25.980> course<00:02:26.160> getting<00:02:26.370> this<00:02:26.460> damage<00:02:26.760> tricky

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
but of course getting this damage tricky

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.670 
but of course getting this damage tricky
because<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.720> have<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.900> make<00:02:28.020> sure<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.260> aim<00:02:28.470> in

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
because you have to make sure to aim in

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.780 
because you have to make sure to aim in
the<00:02:28.740> opposite<00:02:29.040> direction<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.580> want<00:02:29.700> to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
the opposite direction that you want to

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.850 
the opposite direction that you want to
go<00:02:29.910> because<00:02:30.660> my<00:02:30.840> accident<00:02:31.290> like<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.560> front<00:02:31.740> of

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
go because my accident like in front of

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.080 
go because my accident like in front of
you<00:02:31.950> are<00:02:32.100> off<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.250> your<00:02:32.430> side<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:32.940> might

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
you are off to your side and you might

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.820 
you are off to your side and you might
do<00:02:33.240> damage<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.660> yourself<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.590> won't<00:02:34.740> go

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
do damage to yourself and you won't go

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.980 
do damage to yourself and you won't go
find<00:02:35.100> in<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.310> direction<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.700> want<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.910> go<00:02:36.090> so

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
find in the direction you want to go so

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.570 
find in the direction you want to go so
practicing<00:02:37.470> aiming<00:02:37.830> behind<00:02:37.950> yourself<00:02:38.459> is

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
practicing aiming behind yourself is

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.670 
practicing aiming behind yourself is
really<00:02:38.820> important<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:40.170> next<00:02:40.410> step<00:02:40.560> we're

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
really important the next step we're

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.900 
really important the next step we're
going<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.830> talk<00:02:41.010> about<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.310> wall<00:02:41.459> jump<00:02:41.700> and

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
going to talk about the wall jump and

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.310 
going to talk about the wall jump and
this<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.209> really<00:02:42.690> important<00:02:43.110> thing<00:02:43.140> you

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
this is a really important thing you

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.620 
this is a really important thing you
need<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.560> know<00:02:44.000> wall<00:02:45.000> jump<00:02:45.209> is<00:02:45.330> done<00:02:45.480> by

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
need to know wall jump is done by

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.910 
need to know wall jump is done by
loading<00:02:45.810> two<00:02:46.080> Rockets<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.500> tear<00:02:46.620> beggars

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
loading two Rockets of tear beggars

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.830 
loading two Rockets of tear beggars
bazooka<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.850> then<00:02:47.940> using<00:02:48.209> one<00:02:48.390> rocket<00:02:48.750> to

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
bazooka and then using one rocket to

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.180 
bazooka and then using one rocket to
shoot<00:02:48.989> off<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.350> ground<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.800> another

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
shoot off of the ground and another

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.580 
shoot off of the ground and another
rocket<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.640> shoot<00:02:50.790> off<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.180> wall<00:02:51.470> if<00:02:52.470> you

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
rocket to shoot off of the wall if you

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.930 
rocket to shoot off of the wall if you
do<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.800> right<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.100> can<00:02:53.250> gain<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.520> ton<00:02:53.910> of

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
do this right you can gain a ton of

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.020 
do this right you can gain a ton of
speed<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.810> actually<00:02:55.110> go<00:02:55.200> really<00:02:55.530> high<00:02:55.709> too

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
speed and actually go really high too

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.520 
speed and actually go really high too
this<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.180> fantastic<00:02:57.870> way<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.020> just<00:02:58.320> get<00:02:58.440> to

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
this is a fantastic way to just get to

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.979 
this is a fantastic way to just get to
people<00:02:58.680> quickly<00:02:59.209> of<00:03:00.209> course<00:03:00.510> aiming<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:00.840> is

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
people quickly of course aiming this is

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.690 
people quickly of course aiming this is
really<00:03:01.260> tricky<00:03:01.440> because<00:03:01.980> have<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.340> email<00:03:02.520> for

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
really tricky because have to email for

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.830 
really tricky because have to email for
the<00:03:02.790> ground<00:03:03.030> first<00:03:03.239> and<00:03:03.420> then<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:03.630> have<00:03:03.750> to

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
the ground first and then you have to

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.870 
the ground first and then you have to
quickly<00:03:04.050> shoot<00:03:04.290> up<00:03:04.410> at<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.650> wall<00:03:04.850> you<00:03:05.850> just

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
quickly shoot up at the wall you just

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.220 
quickly shoot up at the wall you just
kind<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.180> have<00:03:06.300> to<00:03:06.330> get<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.600> aim<00:03:06.720> down<00:03:06.930> on<00:03:07.080> this

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
kind of have to get the aim down on this

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.500 
kind of have to get the aim down on this
part<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:08.280> us<00:03:08.550> if<00:03:08.760> you've<00:03:08.910> all<00:03:09.090> jumped<00:03:09.360> before

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
part of us if you've all jumped before

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.330 
part of us if you've all jumped before
through<00:03:09.870> normal<00:03:10.080> rocket<00:03:10.350> launcher<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:11.190> is

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
through normal rocket launcher this is

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.940 
through normal rocket launcher this is
going<00:03:11.520> to<00:03:11.610> be<00:03:11.730> kind<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.030> easier<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.450> do<00:03:12.950> because

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
going to be kind of easier to do because

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.710 
going to be kind of easier to do because
the<00:03:14.250> rockets<00:03:14.519> unload<00:03:14.880> really<00:03:15.180> faster<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.630> the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
the rockets unload really faster of the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.210 
the rockets unload really faster of the
rocket<00:03:16.019> launcher<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:16.650> means<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:16.890> can<00:03:16.980> gain<00:03:17.130> a

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
rocket launcher it means you can gain a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.310 
rocket launcher it means you can gain a
ton<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.489> speed<00:03:17.760> really<00:03:17.940> quickly<00:03:18.390> now<00:03:18.570> a

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
ton of speed really quickly now a

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.140 
ton of speed really quickly now a
similar<00:03:19.620> way<00:03:19.890> of<00:03:19.920> jumping<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.910> actually

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
similar way of jumping is to actually

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.460 
similar way of jumping is to actually
use<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.360> wall<00:03:21.510> first<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:21.989> then<00:03:22.080> move<00:03:22.260> towards

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
use the wall first and then move towards

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.289 
use the wall first and then move towards
the<00:03:22.650> ground<00:03:22.830> when<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.130> rock<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.430> jump<00:03:23.610> so

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
the ground when you rock and jump so

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.580 
the ground when you rock and jump so
it's<00:03:24.390> basically<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.750> opposite<00:03:25.080> of<00:03:25.140> wall<00:03:25.350> jump

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
it's basically the opposite of wall jump

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.960 
it's basically the opposite of wall jump
you're<00:03:26.130> going<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.340> look<00:03:26.400> at<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.610> wall<00:03:26.730> first

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
you're going to look at the wall first

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.310 
you're going to look at the wall first
and<00:03:27.209> you're<00:03:27.360> going<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.540> quickly<00:03:27.720> aim<00:03:28.019> towards

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
and you're going to quickly aim towards

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.800 
and you're going to quickly aim towards
the<00:03:28.410> ground<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.980> gain<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.220> Thomas<00:03:29.610> speed<00:03:29.820> and

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
the ground to gain a Thomas speed and

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.910 
the ground to gain a Thomas speed and
you<00:03:30.870> kind<00:03:31.019> of<00:03:31.049> want<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.260> make<00:03:31.380> sure<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.650> more

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
you kind of want to make sure to a more

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.190 
you kind of want to make sure to a more
horizontal<00:03:32.250> this<00:03:32.730> time<00:03:32.940> because<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.080> wall

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
horizontal this time because of the wall

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.390 
horizontal this time because of the wall
jump<00:03:34.410> you're<00:03:34.530> going<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.709> aim<00:03:34.830> more<00:03:35.010> down<00:03:35.220> so

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
jump you're going to aim more down so

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.039 
jump you're going to aim more down so
you<00:03:35.459> can<00:03:35.549> get<00:03:35.670> more<00:03:35.790> height<00:03:36.000> with<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.330> but<00:03:36.959> with

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
you can get more height with it but with

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.289 
you can get more height with it but with
this<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.260> want<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.410> get<00:03:37.500> more<00:03:37.680> speed<00:03:37.980> so

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
this you want to get more speed so

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.280 
this you want to get more speed so
making<00:03:39.299> yourself<00:03:39.570> level<00:03:39.840> with<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.080> wall<00:03:40.260> and

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
making yourself level with the wall and

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.720 
making yourself level with the wall and
then<00:03:40.530> quickly<00:03:40.739> switching<00:03:41.160> straight<00:03:41.459> towards

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
then quickly switching straight towards

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.190 
then quickly switching straight towards
the<00:03:41.880> ground<00:03:42.060> will<00:03:42.480> help<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:42.690> get<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.900> ton<00:03:43.170> of

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
the ground will help you get a ton of

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.320 
the ground will help you get a ton of
speed<00:03:43.530> it's<00:03:44.430> kind<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.640> similar<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.090> normal

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
speed it's kind of similar to the normal

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.460 
speed it's kind of similar to the normal
rocket<00:03:45.600> launcher<00:03:45.900> except<00:03:46.290> it's<00:03:46.380> all

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
rocket launcher except it's all

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.160 
rocket launcher except it's all
happening<00:03:46.890> much<00:03:47.070> quicker<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:48.750> next<00:03:48.989> up<00:03:49.080> we're

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
happening much quicker the next up we're

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.140 
happening much quicker the next up we're
going<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.320> talk<00:03:49.440> about<00:03:49.500> sink<00:03:49.920> jumps<00:03:50.280> place<00:03:50.970> we

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
going to talk about sink jumps place we

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.759 
going to talk about sink jumps place we
don't<00:03:51.269> know<00:03:51.420> what<00:03:51.570> exactly<00:03:51.630> that<00:03:51.930> means<00:03:52.200> it's

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
don't know what exactly that means it's

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.020 
don't know what exactly that means it's
when<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.010> shoot<00:03:53.190> two<00:03:53.340> Rockets<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.880> same

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
when you shoot two Rockets is the same

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.240 
when you shoot two Rockets is the same
spot<00:03:54.360> at<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.600> same<00:03:54.630> time<00:03:55.080> to<00:03:55.769> basically<00:03:56.040> get

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
spot at the same time to basically get

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.710 
spot at the same time to basically get
more<00:03:56.519> height<00:03:56.760> than<00:03:56.970> you<00:03:57.060> could<00:03:57.269> with<00:03:57.480> just<00:03:57.690> a

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
more height than you could with just a

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.600 
more height than you could with just a
normal<00:03:57.810> rocket<00:03:58.230> jump<00:03:58.440> now<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.250> find<00:03:59.519> that

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
normal rocket jump now I find that

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.830 
normal rocket jump now I find that
getting<00:03:59.940> singles<00:04:00.269> with<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.450> beggars<00:04:00.720> bazooka

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
getting singles with the beggars bazooka

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.780 
getting singles with the beggars bazooka
is<00:04:01.230> actually<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.620> lot<00:04:01.950> easier<00:04:01.980> than<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.519> normal

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
is actually a lot easier than a normal

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.400 
is actually a lot easier than a normal
rocket<00:04:03.090> jump<00:04:03.299> because<00:04:03.900> they're<00:04:04.140> shootin<00:04:04.320> the

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
rocket jump because they're shootin the

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.990 
rocket jump because they're shootin the
two<00:04:04.530> Rockets<00:04:04.860> very<00:04:05.040> quickly<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.610> makes<00:04:05.820> it<00:04:05.940> a

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
two Rockets very quickly it makes it a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.190 
two Rockets very quickly it makes it a
little<00:04:06.090> bit<00:04:06.269> easier<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.660> get<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.930> timing

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
little bit easier to get the timing

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.259 
little bit easier to get the timing
right<00:04:07.380> so<00:04:08.160> all<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.400> really<00:04:08.430> have<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:08.880> do<00:04:09.060> is

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
right so all you really have to do is

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.789 
right so all you really have to do is
load<00:04:09.720> two<00:04:09.900> Rockets<00:04:10.230> while<00:04:10.380> you're<00:04:10.470> still<00:04:10.650> in

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
load two Rockets while you're still in

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.440 
load two Rockets while you're still in
the<00:04:10.950> air<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.400> when<00:04:12.030> you<00:04:12.090> get<00:04:12.180> close<00:04:12.329> to

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
the air and when you get close to

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
the air and when you get close to
hitting<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.840> ground<00:04:13.079> you're<00:04:13.260> going<00:04:13.380> to

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
hitting the ground you're going to

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.780 
hitting the ground you're going to
release<00:04:13.739> them<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.220> you're<00:04:14.430> just<00:04:14.519> going<00:04:14.670> to

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
release them and you're just going to

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.319 
release them and you're just going to
basically<00:04:14.880> bounce<00:04:15.269> off<00:04:15.480> of<00:04:15.660> those<00:04:15.720> two<00:04:15.900> rocket

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
basically bounce off of those two rocket

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.240 
basically bounce off of those two rocket
it's<00:04:17.259> actually<00:04:17.530> really<00:04:17.769> cool<00:04:17.919> how<00:04:18.129> much

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
it's actually really cool how much

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.069 
it's actually really cool how much
height<00:04:18.430> you<00:04:18.519> can<00:04:18.669> get<00:04:18.849> probably<00:04:19.599> won't<00:04:19.810> be<00:04:19.900> as

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
height you can get probably won't be as

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.589 
height you can get probably won't be as
useful<00:04:20.590> in<00:04:20.680> actual<00:04:20.859> games<00:04:21.280> be<00:04:22.120> can<00:04:22.270> still<00:04:22.479> use

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
useful in actual games be can still use

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:23.670 
useful in actual games be can still use
it<00:04:22.720> to<00:04:22.840> your<00:04:22.960> advantage<00:04:23.050> in<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.530> lot<00:04:23.650> of

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
it to your advantage in a lot of

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.890 
it to your advantage in a lot of
situations<00:04:24.539> lastly<00:04:25.539> we're<00:04:25.659> going<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:25.810> talk

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
situations lastly we're going to talk

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.300 
situations lastly we're going to talk
about<00:04:26.080> two<00:04:26.409> more<00:04:26.620> jumps<00:04:26.830> here<00:04:27.039> with<00:04:27.220> the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
about two more jumps here with the

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.430 
about two more jumps here with the
overload<00:04:27.669> rocket<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.840> first<00:04:29.050> one<00:04:29.199> is<00:04:29.319> when

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
overload rocket the first one is when

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.869 
overload rocket the first one is when
you<00:04:29.500> use<00:04:29.590> an<00:04:29.710> overload<00:04:30.069> rocket<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.520> do<00:04:30.610> a<00:04:30.639> wall

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:30.879 
you use an overload rocket to do a wall

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.089 
you use an overload rocket to do a wall
jump<00:04:31.120> now<00:04:31.930> like<00:04:32.110> before<00:04:32.229> with<00:04:32.590> a<00:04:32.620> normal<00:04:32.979> wall

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
jump now like before with a normal wall

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:33.570 
jump now like before with a normal wall
jump

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
jump

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.890 
jump
you're<00:04:33.819> basically<00:04:34.000> is<00:04:34.180> using<00:04:34.389> two<00:04:34.539> Rockets

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
you're basically is using two Rockets

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.450 
you're basically is using two Rockets
jump<00:04:35.050> off<00:04:35.169> a<00:04:35.199> bit<00:04:35.470> but<00:04:36.009> this<00:04:36.129> time<00:04:36.310> I'm<00:04:36.370> going

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
jump off a bit but this time I'm going

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.860 
jump off a bit but this time I'm going
to<00:04:36.520> use<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.699> overload<00:04:37.030> rocket<00:04:37.300> first<00:04:37.509> and

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
to use the overload rocket first and

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.420 
to use the overload rocket first and
then<00:04:38.259> we<00:04:38.379> use<00:04:38.500> two<00:04:38.680> Rockets<00:04:39.009> while<00:04:39.129> to<00:04:39.280> get

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
then we use two Rockets while to get

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.460 
then we use two Rockets while to get
towards<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.789> wall<00:04:39.970> and<00:04:40.810> this<00:04:40.930> one<00:04:41.080> requires<00:04:41.379> a

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
towards the wall and this one requires a

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.920 
towards the wall and this one requires a
lot<00:04:41.680> of<00:04:41.710> timing<00:04:42.099> to<00:04:42.250> do<00:04:42.460> we<00:04:43.449> have<00:04:43.629> to<00:04:43.720> do<00:04:43.810> is

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
lot of timing to do we have to do is

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.270 
lot of timing to do we have to do is
once<00:04:44.139> you<00:04:44.229> jump<00:04:44.440> off<00:04:44.590> of<00:04:44.620> your<00:04:44.860> overload

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
once you jump off of your overload

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.399 
once you jump off of your overload
rocket<00:04:45.639> you're<00:04:46.180> going<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:46.569> release<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:47.020> rocket

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:47.409 
rocket you're going to release a rocket

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:48.869 
rocket you're going to release a rocket
as<00:04:47.530> soon<00:04:47.860> as<00:04:48.069> you're<00:04:48.250> sick<00:04:48.460> and<00:04:48.580> rocket

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:48.879 
as soon as you're sick and rocket

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:50.640 
as soon as you're sick and rocket
overloads<00:04:49.330> so<00:04:49.840> they<00:04:49.960> basically<00:04:50.319> shoot<00:04:50.469> at<00:04:50.560> the

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
overloads so they basically shoot at the

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.219 
overloads so they basically shoot at the
same<00:04:50.830> time<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:52.270> getting<00:04:52.479> this<00:04:52.719> down<00:04:52.960> will

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
same time and getting this down will

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:54.930 
same time and getting this down will
help<00:04:53.319> you<00:04:53.440> gain<00:04:53.650> a<00:04:53.680> ton<00:04:54.039> of<00:04:54.099> speed<00:04:54.550> as<00:04:54.729> you<00:04:54.789> can

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
help you gain a ton of speed as you can

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.119 
help you gain a ton of speed as you can
see<00:04:55.060> right<00:04:55.240> here<00:04:55.500> this<00:04:56.500> is<00:04:56.560> probably<00:04:56.919> going<00:04:57.069> to

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:57.129 
see right here this is probably going to

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:58.950 
see right here this is probably going to
be<00:04:57.219> really<00:04:57.610> useful<00:04:57.969> in<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.300> bigger<00:04:58.479> Maps<00:04:58.750> like

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
be really useful in the bigger Maps like

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.439 
be really useful in the bigger Maps like
upward<00:04:59.319> end<00:04:59.469> badwater<00:05:00.000> now<00:05:01.000> this<00:05:01.120> last<00:05:01.330> time

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
upward end badwater now this last time

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:02.339 
upward end badwater now this last time
we're<00:05:01.599> going<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.780> talk<00:05:01.870> about<00:05:01.900> here<00:05:02.229> is

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
we're going to talk about here is

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:03.809 
we're going to talk about here is
probably<00:05:02.500> my<00:05:02.710> most<00:05:02.830> favorite<00:05:03.009> one<00:05:03.460> to<00:05:03.610> use

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
probably my most favorite one to use

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:05.939 
probably my most favorite one to use
because<00:05:04.750> it's<00:05:04.990> actually<00:05:05.229> quite<00:05:05.409> a<00:05:05.440> few<00:05:05.680> spots

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
because it's actually quite a few spots

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.129 
because it's actually quite a few spots
you<00:05:06.069> can<00:05:06.099> use<00:05:06.310> on<00:05:06.460> open<00:05:06.759> maps<00:05:07.020> basically<00:05:08.020> what

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
you can use on open maps basically what

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.930 
you can use on open maps basically what
you<00:05:08.229> do<00:05:08.409> is<00:05:08.590> you<00:05:08.979> use<00:05:09.099> your<00:05:09.129> overload<00:05:09.610> rocket

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
you do is you use your overload rocket

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.920 
you do is you use your overload rocket
while<00:05:10.060> you're<00:05:10.150> still<00:05:10.300> kind<00:05:10.509> of<00:05:10.599> level<00:05:10.840> with

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
while you're still kind of level with

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.300 
while you're still kind of level with
the<00:05:11.020> ground<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:11.560> you<00:05:11.620> shoot<00:05:11.800> behind<00:05:11.949> yourself

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
the ground and you shoot behind yourself

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.670 
the ground and you shoot behind yourself
and<00:05:12.729> you<00:05:13.509> release<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:13.930> other<00:05:14.080> two<00:05:14.319> rockets

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
and you release the other two rockets

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.649 
and you release the other two rockets
when<00:05:14.800> you're<00:05:14.919> close<00:05:15.099> to<00:05:15.129> the<00:05:15.310> ground<00:05:15.550> this<00:05:16.479> is

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
when you're close to the ground this is

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:17.999 
when you're close to the ground this is
kind<00:05:16.870> of<00:05:16.900> similar<00:05:17.110> to<00:05:17.289> a<00:05:17.409> normal<00:05:17.560> wall<00:05:17.800> jump

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
kind of similar to a normal wall jump

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:19.499 
kind of similar to a normal wall jump
like<00:05:18.159> we<00:05:18.250> talked<00:05:18.430> before<00:05:18.550> except<00:05:19.389> you're

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
like we talked before except you're

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:20.939 
like we talked before except you're
using<00:05:19.690> two<00:05:19.900> rockets<00:05:20.289> and<00:05:20.440> we're<00:05:20.529> gaining<00:05:20.710> a

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
using two rockets and we're gaining a

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.219 
using two rockets and we're gaining a
lot<00:05:21.190> more<00:05:21.400> speed<00:05:21.659> so<00:05:22.659> what<00:05:22.750> we're<00:05:22.870> doing<00:05:22.900> is

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
lot more speed so what we're doing is

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.390 
lot more speed so what we're doing is
we're<00:05:23.380> loading<00:05:23.529> three<00:05:23.800> rockets

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
we're loading three rockets

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.430 
we're loading three rockets
we're<00:05:24.669> using<00:05:24.819> our<00:05:25.000> third<00:05:25.330> rocket<00:05:25.779> to<00:05:26.020> overload

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
we're using our third rocket to overload

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.200 
we're using our third rocket to overload
and<00:05:26.590> send<00:05:26.770> ourselves<00:05:26.860> forward<00:05:27.430> and<00:05:27.639> then<00:05:28.120> we

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
and send ourselves forward and then we

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.700 
and send ourselves forward and then we
use<00:05:28.330> the<00:05:28.449> other<00:05:28.599> two<00:05:28.840> rocket<00:05:29.169> to<00:05:29.349> quickly

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
use the other two rocket to quickly

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.230 
use the other two rocket to quickly
shoot<00:05:29.889> off<00:05:29.979> of<00:05:30.159> the<00:05:30.219> ground<00:05:30.460> and<00:05:30.699> gain<00:05:30.909> a<00:05:30.940> lot

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
shoot off of the ground and gain a lot

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.540 
shoot off of the ground and gain a lot
of<00:05:31.270> speed<00:05:31.479> and<00:05:31.599> height<00:05:32.039> it's<00:05:33.039> actually<00:05:33.340> really

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
of speed and height it's actually really

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.890 
of speed and height it's actually really
incredible<00:05:33.969> to<00:05:34.120> software<00:05:34.389> I<00:05:34.509> can<00:05:34.630> go<00:05:34.779> with

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
incredible to software I can go with

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.080 
incredible to software I can go with
this<00:05:35.159> it's<00:05:36.159> actually<00:05:36.219> not<00:05:36.490> too<00:05:36.669> hard<00:05:36.849> to<00:05:36.940> pull

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
this it's actually not too hard to pull

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.930 
this it's actually not too hard to pull
off<00:05:37.120> once<00:05:37.449> you<00:05:37.539> get<00:05:37.690> pain<00:05:37.870> a<00:05:37.900> bit<00:05:38.639> and<00:05:39.639> rocket

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
off once you get pain a bit and rocket

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.159 
off once you get pain a bit and rocket
jumping<00:05:40.150> with<00:05:40.270> the<00:05:40.360> beggars<00:05:40.630> bazooka<00:05:40.750> is

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
jumping with the beggars bazooka is

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.870 
jumping with the beggars bazooka is
going<00:05:41.349> to<00:05:41.440> be<00:05:41.529> really<00:05:41.800> weird<00:05:42.069> at<00:05:42.219> first<00:05:42.250> like

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
going to be really weird at first like

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.640 
going to be really weird at first like
with<00:05:43.029> my<00:05:43.180> first<00:05:43.449> time<00:05:43.719> I<00:05:43.900> picked<00:05:44.259> it<00:05:44.349> up<00:05:44.440> and<00:05:44.590> I

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
with my first time I picked it up and I

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.200 
with my first time I picked it up and I
was<00:05:44.740> like<00:05:44.860> how<00:05:45.159> on<00:05:45.279> earth<00:05:45.310> do<00:05:45.580> you<00:05:45.610> do<00:05:45.759> this<00:05:45.969> I

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
was like how on earth do you do this I

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.939 
was like how on earth do you do this I
actually<00:05:46.870> found<00:05:47.139> another<00:05:47.440> player<00:05:47.680> called

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:47.949 
actually found another player called

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.070 
actually found another player called
blind<00:05:48.219> pyro<00:05:48.580> and<00:05:48.879> he's<00:05:49.090> a<00:05:49.120> fantastic<00:05:49.539> beggars

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
blind pyro and he's a fantastic beggars

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.140 
blind pyro and he's a fantastic beggars
bazooka<00:05:50.169> jumper<00:05:50.650> and<00:05:51.520> he's<00:05:51.669> basically<00:05:51.940> where

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
bazooka jumper and he's basically where

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.300 
bazooka jumper and he's basically where
I<00:05:52.180> learned<00:05:52.389> most<00:05:52.539> of<00:05:52.690> my<00:05:52.750> jumps<00:05:53.020> from<00:05:53.250> so<00:05:54.250> I

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
I learned most of my jumps from so I

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.740 
I learned most of my jumps from so I
would<00:05:54.430> suggest<00:05:54.550> go<00:05:54.879> looking<00:05:55.180> at<00:05:55.270> his<00:05:55.419> videos

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
would suggest go looking at his videos

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.390 
would suggest go looking at his videos
and<00:05:55.779> seeing<00:05:56.139> how<00:05:56.259> he<00:05:56.319> uses<00:05:56.650> them<00:05:56.979> in<00:05:57.099> actual

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
and seeing how he uses them in actual

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.189 
and seeing how he uses them in actual
games<00:05:57.639> and<00:05:58.389> of<00:05:58.479> course<00:05:58.509> you<00:05:58.810> guys<00:05:58.930> just<00:05:59.139> need

00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 
games and of course you guys just need

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.749 
games and of course you guys just need
to<00:05:59.289> practice<00:05:59.500> the<00:05:59.770> overload<00:06:00.129> rockets<00:06:00.550> and

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
to practice the overload rockets and

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.149 
to practice the overload rockets and
normal<00:06:01.029> rocket<00:06:01.300> jumps<00:06:01.509> with<00:06:01.659> it<00:06:01.810> if<00:06:02.800> you<00:06:02.889> spent

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
normal rocket jumps with it if you spent

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:04.589 
normal rocket jumps with it if you spent
enough<00:06:03.310> time<00:06:03.340> with<00:06:03.520> it<00:06:03.789> then<00:06:04.060> it'll<00:06:04.240> get<00:06:04.360> so

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599 
enough time with it then it'll get so

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:05.820 
enough time with it then it'll get so
much<00:06:04.750> easier<00:06:05.050> to<00:06:05.110> do<00:06:05.229> when<00:06:05.349> it's<00:06:05.500> actually<00:06:05.650> a

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
much easier to do when it's actually a

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.640 
much easier to do when it's actually a
lot<00:06:06.190> of<00:06:06.219> fun<00:06:06.370> to<00:06:06.669> use<00:06:07.229> anyway<00:06:08.229> it's<00:06:08.379> gonna<00:06:08.469> be

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
lot of fun to use anyway it's gonna be

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.350 
lot of fun to use anyway it's gonna be

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
bit of something about jumping with

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.640 
bit of something about jumping with
biggest<00:06:13.360> bazooka<00:06:13.719> and<00:06:13.870> hopefully<00:06:14.529> you<00:06:14.590> can

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
biggest bazooka and hopefully you can

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.899 
biggest bazooka and hopefully you can
all<00:06:14.740> try<00:06:14.979> this<00:06:15.039> weapon<00:06:15.430> and<00:06:15.520> have<00:06:15.639> a<00:06:15.669> lot<00:06:15.879> of

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
all try this weapon and have a lot of

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:16.589 
all try this weapon and have a lot of
fun<00:06:16.120> with<00:06:16.270> it

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 
fun with it

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:18.689 
fun with it
later<00:06:17.440> I'm<00:06:17.529> gonna<00:06:17.590> post<00:06:17.830> more<00:06:18.099> jumping<00:06:18.400> videos

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
later I'm gonna post more jumping videos

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:20.700 
later I'm gonna post more jumping videos
other<00:06:19.000> classes<00:06:19.360> and<00:06:19.449> stuff<00:06:19.690> until<00:06:20.379> then<00:06:20.529> I

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
other classes and stuff until then I

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.699
