00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.760
 wrong 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.309
 the Christian to the track 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.769
 who can not afford to be 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.309
 this is the fifth although he recognizes his faults for his mistakes 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.279
 has not deleted 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.789
 do not want to have 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.789
 does not have the courage to do 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.390
 the one who never does anything and only rivers for many Christians 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.250
 correcting our only mission on earth has become commonplace 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.580
 as we do not dedicate only to correct 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.580
 we do not have time to do anything productive 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.750
 he had 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.930
 the idea was born asiain 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.110
 many Christians are today as external 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.330
 they have not yet released 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.710
 they do not want to sacrifice anything of themselves 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.020
 they have stuck in salvation 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.020
 there is no desire to work for god 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.520
 the one who will never make mistakes 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 This is the Christian who believes that everything can be 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.750
 does not need guidance in split tips 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.220
 always believe to be right 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.440
 as usual 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.440
 this type of believers tends to disappear 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.430
 the one who does nothing 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.430
 its origin until the av 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.890
 is the typical Christian in prayer 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.960
 without help 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.200
 without directing 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.300
 who has lost his first love 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.000
 there is uncertainty in the church 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.420
 maybe some stumbling made him fall 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.420
 I was what can be the same 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.210
 oil is the enclosure 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.510
 this month precisely the perfect Christian 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.300
 but has all the qualities necessary to be a true child of 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.640
 God 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.469
 works for the Lord and is useful in his hands 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:11.559
 he knows how to use his wheeled 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:14.289
 he is always willing to correct his mistakes 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:16.089
 and will be willing to help 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:17.869
 and the other's mistakes 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:20.869
 he humbles 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:22.729
 it has closed 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:24.709
 never be the trophy 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.519
 he knows what he does for whoever does it 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:28.689
 It's wise 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:29.919
 plumb 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.599
 has domain frob 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.469
 it's balanced 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:34.809
 matter where you are 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:37.809
 yes its march will be 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.389
 God help us to be like this last one 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:43.719
 just wait 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.499
 the eraser does not end before he does
