located just underneath the dash you're

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.460 
located just underneath the dash you're
going<00:00:44.860> to<00:00:45.010> see<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.340> DME<00:00:45.700> harness<00:00:46.230> which<00:00:47.230> will

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
going to see the DME harness which will

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.860 
going to see the DME harness which will
gently<00:00:47.710> pry<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.130> metal<00:00:48.520> prong<00:00:48.730> away<00:00:49.270> towards

housing careful so you don't lift by the
wires<00:00:54.790> and<00:00:55.150> damage<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.810> harness<00:00:58.500> now<00:00:59.500> that

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
wires and damage the harness now that

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.050 
wires and damage the harness now that
the<00:00:59.800> wiring<00:01:00.010> harness<00:01:00.490> has<00:01:00.640> been<00:01:00.790> removed

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.060 
the wiring harness has been removed

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.810 
the wiring harness has been removed
we'll<00:01:01.900> set<00:01:02.080> our<00:01:02.200> multimeter<00:01:02.680> to<00:01:02.800> test<00:01:03.130> the<00:01:03.280> RPM

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
we'll set our multimeter to test the RPM

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.469 
we'll set our multimeter to test the RPM
sensor<00:01:05.520> set<00:01:06.520> your<00:01:06.670> multimeter<00:01:07.030> to<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.299> ohm

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
sensor set your multimeter to the ohm

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.419 
sensor set your multimeter to the ohm
setting<00:01:07.960> and<00:01:08.939> then<00:01:09.939> locate<00:01:10.329> pins<00:01:10.630> 8<00:01:10.869> and<00:01:11.200> 27<00:01:11.979> on

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
setting and then locate pins 8 and 27 on

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:15.090 
setting and then locate pins 8 and 27 on
the<00:01:12.700> harness<00:01:13.409> polarity<00:01:14.409> won't<00:01:14.619> matter<00:01:14.799> in

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
the harness polarity won't matter in

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.069 
the harness polarity won't matter in
this<00:01:15.250> case<00:01:18.210> acceptable<00:01:19.210> resistance<00:01:19.689> ranges

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
this case acceptable resistance ranges

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.330 
this case acceptable resistance ranges
should<00:01:20.499> be<00:01:20.619> from<00:01:20.890> 600<00:01:21.549> to<00:01:22.049> 1600<00:01:23.049> ohms<00:01:23.259> as<00:01:23.649> you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
should be from 600 to 1600 ohms as you

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.370 
should be from 600 to 1600 ohms as you
can<00:01:24.490> see<00:01:24.700> we<00:01:25.060> read<00:01:25.299> at<00:01:25.450> about<00:01:25.689> eleven<00:01:26.200> hundred

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
can see we read at about eleven hundred

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.660 
can see we read at about eleven hundred
ohms<00:01:28.289> now<00:01:29.289> we're<00:01:29.590> going<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:29.859> test<00:01:30.219> our<00:01:30.429> top

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
ohms now we're going to test our top

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.749 
ohms now we're going to test our top
dead<00:01:30.969> center<00:01:31.479> reference<00:01:32.140> sensor<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.490> in<00:01:33.640> this

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
dead center reference sensor so in this

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.169 
dead center reference sensor so in this
case<00:01:34.030> we<00:01:34.299> locate<00:01:34.689> pins<00:01:34.990> 25<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:37.289> 26

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
case we locate pins 25 and 26

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.059 
case we locate pins 25 and 26
again<00:01:40.179> acceptable<00:01:41.049> resistance<00:01:41.679> ranges

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
again acceptable resistance ranges

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.209 
again acceptable resistance ranges
should<00:01:42.340> be<00:01:42.490> between<00:01:42.670> 600<00:01:43.539> to<00:01:44.020> 1600<00:01:44.740> ohms<00:01:44.920> and

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
should be between 600 to 1600 ohms and

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:52.859 
should be between 600 to 1600 ohms and
here<00:01:45.999> we<00:01:46.149> reflect<00:01:46.600> 1100<00:01:47.499> ohms

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.359 

now<00:01:53.869> we're<00:01:54.080> going<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.380> perform<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.860> dynamic

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
now we're going to perform a dynamic

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.520 
now we're going to perform a dynamic
test<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:56.030> measure<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.450> AC<00:01:56.600> voltage<00:01:57.020> produced

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
test to measure the AC voltage produced

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.060 
test to measure the AC voltage produced
by<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.880> RPM<00:01:59.330> sensor<00:01:59.780> first<00:02:00.409> set<00:02:00.920> your

by the RPM sensor first set your
multimeter<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.850> AC<00:02:02.060> volt<00:02:06.520> then<00:02:07.520> locate<00:02:08.000> pin<00:02:08.330> 8

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
multimeter to AC volt then locate pin 8

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.250 
multimeter to AC volt then locate pin 8
and<00:02:10.270> 27<00:02:11.270> again<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:13.569> before<00:02:14.569> performing<00:02:15.170> this

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
and 27 again and before performing this

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.870 
and 27 again and before performing this
test<00:02:15.470> it's<00:02:15.770> a<00:02:15.830> great<00:02:16.040> idea<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.489> make<00:02:16.580> sure<00:02:16.730> that

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
test it's a great idea to make sure that

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.000 
test it's a great idea to make sure that

and 26 with your multimeter and then
crank<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.200> car<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:52.130> should<00:02:52.340> expect<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.790> see

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
crank the car you should expect to see

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:03.940 
crank the car you should expect to see
under<00:02:53.690> 1<00:02:54.200> volt<00:02:59.500> as<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:02.810> can<00:03:02.959> see<00:03:03.200> we<00:03:03.530> ran<00:03:03.769> out

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
under 1 volt as you can see we ran out

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.449 
under 1 volt as you can see we ran out
about<00:03:04.280> point<00:03:04.880> 0<00:03:05.360> 1<00:03:05.390> volts<00:03:06.079> if<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:07.220> find

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
about point 0 1 volts if you find

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.280 
about point 0 1 volts if you find
similar<00:03:07.850> ranges<00:03:08.239> from<00:03:08.359> your<00:03:08.540> multimeter<00:03:08.989> that

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
similar ranges from your multimeter that

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.370 
similar ranges from your multimeter that
means<00:03:09.470> your<00:03:09.620> sensors<00:03:09.980> are<00:03:10.250> good

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
means your sensors are good

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.720 
means your sensors are good
we<00:03:12.380> have<00:03:12.560> lifted<00:03:12.920> one<00:03:13.190> of<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.370> crankshaft

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
we have lifted one of the crankshaft

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.599 
we have lifted one of the crankshaft
position<00:03:14.450> sensors<00:03:15.100> pay<00:03:16.100> special<00:03:16.340> attention

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
position sensors pay special attention

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.910 
position sensors pay special attention
to<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.239> connection<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.590> insulation

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
to the connection and the insulation

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.160 
to the connection and the insulation
around<00:03:19.190> it<00:03:19.640> if<00:03:19.760> they<00:03:20.090> don't<00:03:20.239> look<00:03:20.570> right<00:03:20.900> if

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
around it if they don't look right if

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.710 
around it if they don't look right if
they're<00:03:21.680> cracking<00:03:21.950> it's<00:03:22.730> definitely<00:03:23.269> time<00:03:23.480> to

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
they're cracking it's definitely time to

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.500 
they're cracking it's definitely time to
replace<00:03:24.260> it
