using<00:00:38.940> rice<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.420> important<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.930> order<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.170> play

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
using rice is important in order to play

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
miss stuff and divert from the stuff you

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.340 
miss stuff and divert from the stuff you
miss<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.980> essentially<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.149> plan<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.989> am

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
miss is essentially the plan that I am

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.000 
miss is essentially the plan that I am
utilizing<00:00:46.559> here<00:00:47.360> so<00:00:48.469> basically<00:00:49.469> how<00:00:49.770> do<00:00:49.829> you

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
utilizing here so basically how do you

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.189 
utilizing here so basically how do you
figure<00:00:50.190> out<00:00:50.340> what<00:00:50.820> your<00:00:51.120> field<00:00:51.570> view<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:51.989> well

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
figure out what your field view as well

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.869 
figure out what your field view as well
it's<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.559> difference<00:00:52.949> from<00:00:53.070> person<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.850> person

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
it's a difference from person to person

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.310 
it's a difference from person to person
but<00:00:54.360> basically<00:00:54.660> when<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.020> focus<00:00:55.170> on

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
but basically when you focus on

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.660 
but basically when you focus on
something<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.770> kind<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.949> like<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.100> box<00:00:56.399> and

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
something it's kind of like a box and

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.430 
something it's kind of like a box and
everything<00:00:56.760> inside<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.539> box<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.230> focus

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
everything inside the box is in focus

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.279 
everything inside the box is in focus
and<00:00:58.680> everything<00:00:59.010> else<00:00:59.160> around<00:00:59.309> it<00:01:00.109> isn't<00:01:01.109> as

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
and everything else around it isn't as

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.710 
and everything else around it isn't as
much<00:01:03.049> for<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> most<00:01:04.290> part<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.630> basically<00:01:06.630> I

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
much for the most part so basically I

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.969 
much for the most part so basically I
have<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.869> figure<00:01:07.020> out<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.530> extend

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
have to figure out is that you extend

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.969 
have to figure out is that you extend
your<00:01:08.159> arm<00:01:08.340> like<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:10.590> then<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.860> hold

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
your arm like this and then you hold

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.770 
your arm like this and then you hold
your<00:01:11.130> hands<00:01:11.460> out<00:01:11.610> like<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.420> front<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.659> you

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
your hands out like this in front of you

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.990 
your hands out like this in front of you
so<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.110> do<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.740> right<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.610> hold<00:01:14.820> it

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
so you do like this right so you hold it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.289 
so you do like this right so you hold it
right<00:01:15.960> there<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.320> from<00:01:16.500> your<00:01:16.740> thumb<00:01:17.270> to<00:01:18.270> your

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
right there and from your thumb to your

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.390 
right there and from your thumb to your
pinky<00:01:18.840> make<00:01:19.619> sure<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.799> your<00:01:19.979> pinky<00:01:20.220> isn't

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.030 
fucked like mine you basically this is
your<00:01:23.159> field<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.790> view<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.680> this<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.830> basically

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
your field of view and this is basically

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.520 
your field of view and this is basically
like<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.460> square<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.960> move<00:01:28.140> around<00:01:28.380> on

middle of the screen because it open
comes<00:01:44.729> boxed<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.189> here's<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
comes boxed in like this so here's the

example i almost burped alright so

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.740 
example i almost burped alright so
here's<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.020> example<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:53.280> are<00:01:53.430> going

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
here's the example and we are going

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.690 
here's the example and we are going
looking<00:01:54.020> at<00:01:54.230> some<00:01:54.590> gameplay<00:01:55.070> footage<00:01:55.250> for<00:01:55.610> me

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
looking at some gameplay footage for me

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.850 
looking at some gameplay footage for me
as<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:55.880> sniper<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.990> we're<00:01:57.560> just<00:01:57.650> going<00:01:57.740> to

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
as a sniper and we're just going to

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.920 
as a sniper and we're just going to
focus<00:01:58.310> on<00:01:58.580> looking<00:01:58.940> at<00:01:59.210> things<00:01:59.360> shooting<00:01:59.750> at

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
focus on looking at things shooting at

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.300 
focus on looking at things shooting at
things<00:02:00.050> turning<00:02:00.350> around<00:02:00.500> looking<00:02:00.860> around<00:02:00.920> so

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
things turning around looking around so

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.920 
things turning around looking around so
pretty<00:02:01.550> much<00:02:01.670> from<00:02:01.970> a<00:02:02.030> sniper<00:02:02.270> perspective

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
pretty much from a sniper perspective

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.719 
pretty much from a sniper perspective
but<00:02:03.080> you<00:02:03.140> can<00:02:03.320> pretty<00:02:03.800> much<00:02:03.890> apply<00:02:04.460> these<00:02:04.520> to

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
but you can pretty much apply these to

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.940 
but you can pretty much apply these to
any<00:02:04.850> class<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:05.270> here<00:02:05.420> we<00:02:05.479> have<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.780> square<00:02:06.110> but

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
any class so here we have the square but

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:07.870 
any class so here we have the square but
I<00:02:07.010> was<00:02:07.130> talking<00:02:07.340> about<00:02:07.400> and<00:02:07.610> we're<00:02:07.790> it's

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
I was talking about and we're it's

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.249 
I was talking about and we're it's
usually<00:02:08.330> in<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.479> center<00:02:08.780> that's<00:02:08.990> where<00:02:09.080> most

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
usually in the center that's where most

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.320 
usually in the center that's where most
of<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.470> action<00:02:09.530> takes<00:02:10.160> place<00:02:10.250> fairly<00:02:11.060> little

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
of the action takes place fairly little

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.000 
of the action takes place fairly little
takes<00:02:11.510> place<00:02:11.750> outside<00:02:11.900> of<00:02:12.230> this<00:02:12.440> box<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:12.890> this

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
takes place outside of this box so this

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.980 
takes place outside of this box so this
is<00:02:13.100> where<00:02:13.250> your<00:02:13.400> focus<00:02:14.180> this<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:14.750> as<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:14.900> can

theoretically<00:03:13.040> we're<00:03:13.250> like<00:03:13.430> my<00:03:13.580> focus<00:03:13.910> shifts

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
theoretically we're like my focus shifts

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.030 
theoretically we're like my focus shifts
so<00:03:14.720> this<00:03:15.019> is<00:03:15.140> basically<00:03:15.290> like<00:03:15.769> where<00:03:15.950> you

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
so this is basically like where you

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.199 
so this is basically like where you
should<00:03:16.220> move<00:03:16.340> your<00:03:16.400> eyes<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.820> not<00:03:16.970> really

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
should move your eyes and not really

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.440 
should move your eyes and not really
stay<00:03:17.870> everything<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:18.380> center<00:03:19.299> it's<00:03:20.299> a<00:03:20.330> bit

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
stay everything in center it's a bit

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.789 
stay everything in center it's a bit
exaggerated<00:03:20.959> because<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.260> box<00:03:21.440> is<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.620> bit

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
exaggerated because the box is a bit

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.400 
exaggerated because the box is a bit
smaller<00:03:22.070> than<00:03:22.130> your<00:03:22.459> list<00:03:22.670> you<00:03:22.820> see<00:03:22.970> here

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
smaller than your list you see here

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.180 
smaller than your list you see here
changing<00:03:24.410> around<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.799> sides<00:03:25.010> shooting

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
changing around to the sides shooting

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.729 
changing around to the sides shooting
there<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.340> go<00:03:28.510> looking<00:03:29.510> at<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.810> ammo<00:03:30.500> and

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
there you go looking at the ammo and

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:31.780 
there you go looking at the ammo and
health<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:31.070> see<00:03:31.190> how<00:03:31.250> much<00:03:31.400> health<00:03:31.579> i<00:03:31.670> have

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
health to see how much health i have

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.310 
health to see how much health i have
didn't<00:03:32.030> really<00:03:32.209> have<00:03:32.299> to<00:03:32.420> move<00:03:32.600> my<00:03:32.630> focus<00:03:33.170> so

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
didn't really have to move my focus so

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.460 
didn't really have to move my focus so
much<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:35.269> this<00:03:35.600> is<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.780> same<00:03:35.989> quick<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:36.260> over

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
much and this is the same quick it over

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.020 
much and this is the same quick it over
and<00:03:36.590> over<00:03:36.680> by<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.010> way<00:03:37.160> so<00:03:37.760> let<00:03:37.850> me<00:03:37.880> see

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
and over by the way so let me see

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.140 
and over by the way so let me see
something<00:03:38.329> down<00:03:38.420> there<00:03:39.880> you<00:03:40.880> don't<00:03:41.000> really

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
something down there you don't really

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.880 
something down there you don't really
need<00:03:41.360> to<00:03:41.540> check<00:03:41.810> your<00:03:41.930> ammo<00:03:42.079> and<00:03:42.380> odd<00:03:42.470> whenever

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
need to check your ammo and odd whenever

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.729 
need to check your ammo and odd whenever
or<00:03:43.280> health<00:03:43.730> whenever<00:03:44.180> your<00:03:44.390> lower<00:03:44.720> fired<00:03:45.620> a

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
or health whenever your lower fired a

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.220 
or health whenever your lower fired a
lot<00:03:46.390> but<00:03:47.390> if<00:03:47.510> you<00:03:47.570> play<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.840> game<00:03:47.930> for<00:03:47.989> a<00:03:48.140> long

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
lot but if you play the game for a long

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.330 
lot but if you play the game for a long
time<00:03:48.410> you<00:03:48.500> don't<00:03:48.650> really<00:03:48.739> need<00:03:48.920> it<00:03:49.070> to<00:03:49.190> know

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
time you don't really need it to know

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
there as well and then we check our

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.660 
there as well and then we check our
health<00:04:20.109> we<00:04:20.380> move<00:04:20.650> our<00:04:20.769> ice<00:04:20.920> quite<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.220> bit<00:04:21.400> and

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
health we move our ice quite a bit and

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.580 
health we move our ice quite a bit and
when<00:04:22.540> you<00:04:22.600> move<00:04:22.840> your<00:04:22.990> eyes<00:04:23.020> quite<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.380> bit<00:04:23.560> in

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
when you move your eyes quite a bit in

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.050 
when you move your eyes quite a bit in
the<00:04:23.710> beginning<00:04:23.770> it<00:04:24.160> becomes<00:04:24.460> easier<00:04:24.790> to<00:04:24.940> move

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
the beginning it becomes easier to move

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.090 
the beginning it becomes easier to move
your<00:04:25.180> eyes<00:04:25.270> faster<00:04:25.840> you'll<00:04:26.440> notice<00:04:26.710> like<00:04:26.860> a

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
your eyes faster you'll notice like a

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.760 
your eyes faster you'll notice like a
lot<00:04:27.310> of<00:04:27.520> pro<00:04:28.120> Korean<00:04:29.050> players<00:04:29.260> do<00:04:29.440> this<00:04:29.620> the

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
lot of pro Korean players do this the

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.010 
lot of pro Korean players do this the
people<00:04:30.010> that<00:04:30.100> play<00:04:30.250> starcraft<00:04:30.790> they<00:04:31.540> move

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
people that play starcraft they move

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.860 
people that play starcraft they move
their<00:04:32.170> eyes<00:04:32.740> a<00:04:33.520> lot<00:04:33.850> around<00:04:34.150> a<00:04:34.300> lots<00:04:34.540> and<00:04:34.840> i

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
their eyes a lot around a lots and i

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.300 
their eyes a lot around a lots and i
think<00:04:35.080> you<00:04:35.260> can<00:04:35.380> do<00:04:35.500> that<00:04:35.530> especially<00:04:35.860> when

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
think you can do that especially when

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.280 
think you can do that especially when
you're<00:04:36.430> reloading<00:04:36.700> just<00:04:36.970> like<00:04:37.090> that<00:04:37.300> between

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
you're reloading just like that between

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.990 
you're reloading just like that between
shots<00:04:38.650> you<00:04:38.770> look<00:04:38.800> around<00:04:39.010> and<00:04:39.370> see<00:04:39.850> especially

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
shots you look around and see especially

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.250 
shots you look around and see especially
for<00:04:40.360> sniper<00:04:40.570> you<00:04:40.780> can<00:04:40.870> do<00:04:40.960> it<00:04:41.050> with<00:04:41.140> other

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
for sniper you can do it with other

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.300 
for sniper you can do it with other
classes<00:04:41.590> as<00:04:41.710> well<00:04:41.740> when<00:04:42.040> you're<00:04:42.130> just

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
classes as well when you're just

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.390 
classes as well when you're just
reloading<00:04:42.760> so<00:04:43.240> that's<00:04:43.540> always<00:04:44.040> good<00:04:45.040> thing<00:04:45.280> to

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
reloading so that's always good thing to

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.990 
reloading so that's always good thing to
try<00:04:45.610> out<00:04:47.280> sometimes<00:04:48.280> you<00:04:48.370> got<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.640> keep<00:04:48.730> see

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
try out sometimes you got to keep see

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.820 
try out sometimes you got to keep see
like<00:04:49.180> their<00:04:49.360> you<00:04:49.750> turn<00:04:50.170> and<00:04:50.320> look<00:04:50.410> at<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.650> same

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
like their you turn and look at the same

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.640 
like their you turn and look at the same
time<00:04:51.010> it's<00:04:51.430> important<00:04:51.820> to<00:04:51.880> do<00:04:52.170> and<00:04:53.170> now<00:04:53.440> so

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
time it's important to do and now so

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.170 
time it's important to do and now so
hopefully<00:04:54.370> you're<00:04:54.610> getting<00:04:54.670> something<00:04:55.030> out

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
hopefully you're getting something out

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.240 
hopefully you're getting something out
of<00:04:55.240> this<00:04:55.360> looking<00:04:56.140> at<00:04:56.470> things<00:04:56.680> tutorial

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
of this looking at things tutorial

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.030 
of this looking at things tutorial
basically<00:04:57.700> just<00:04:57.850> using<00:04:58.120> your<00:04:58.180> eyes<00:04:58.920> there<00:04:59.920> we

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
basically just using your eyes there we

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.300 
basically just using your eyes there we
go<00:05:00.130> just<00:05:00.610> keep<00:05:00.790> being<00:05:00.970> locked<00:05:01.330> onto<00:05:01.540> the<00:05:01.750> spy

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
go just keep being locked onto the spy

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.290 
go just keep being locked onto the spy
maybe<00:05:03.310> lost<00:05:03.580> them<00:05:03.790> MV<00:05:04.600> some<00:05:05.200> again<00:05:06.180> so<00:05:07.180> it

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
maybe lost them MV some again so it

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.430 
maybe lost them MV some again so it
would<00:05:07.419> be<00:05:07.510> nice<00:05:07.630> to<00:05:07.810> have<00:05:07.930> like<00:05:08.080> some<00:05:08.260> kind<00:05:08.410> of

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
would be nice to have like some kind of

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.810 
would be nice to have like some kind of
technology<00:05:08.919> where<00:05:09.100> you<00:05:09.310> could<00:05:09.460> actually<00:05:09.490> see

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
technology where you could actually see

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.130 
technology where you could actually see
where<00:05:10.210> my<00:05:10.330> eyes<00:05:10.360> were<00:05:10.600> looking<00:05:10.810> at<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:10.960> screen

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
where my eyes were looking at the screen

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.750 
where my eyes were looking at the screen
and<00:05:11.290> I<00:05:11.350> pretty<00:05:11.860> cool<00:05:12.070> so<00:05:12.220> this<00:05:12.370> is<00:05:12.460> all<00:05:12.610> just

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
and I pretty cool so this is all just

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.880 
and I pretty cool so this is all just
done<00:05:12.940> imposed<00:05:13.330> to<00:05:13.480> wear<00:05:13.630> my<00:05:13.780> where<00:05:14.560> I<00:05:14.590> should

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
done imposed to wear my where I should

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.030 
done imposed to wear my where I should
be<00:05:14.919> looking<00:05:16.350> and<00:05:17.350> usually<00:05:17.590> probably<00:05:17.890> in<00:05:17.950> the

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
be looking and usually probably in the

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.440 
be looking and usually probably in the
scope<00:05:18.310> you<00:05:18.550> kind<00:05:18.790> of<00:05:18.850> just<00:05:19.000> you're<00:05:19.240> in<00:05:19.360> the

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
scope you kind of just you're in the

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.790 
scope you kind of just you're in the
focuses<00:05:19.870> on<00:05:19.990> so<00:05:20.200> it<00:05:20.290> doesn't<00:05:20.530> really<00:05:20.590> matter

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
focuses on so it doesn't really matter

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.080 
focuses on so it doesn't really matter
you<00:05:21.040> don't<00:05:21.190> have<00:05:21.340> to<00:05:21.460> look<00:05:21.640> all<00:05:21.850> that<00:05:21.940> much

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
you don't have to look all that much

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.540 
you don't have to look all that much
around<00:05:25.110> so<00:05:26.110> there<00:05:26.290> we<00:05:26.410> go<00:05:26.440> bring<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.250> dorati

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
around so there we go bring the dorati

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.940 
around so there we go bring the dorati
ain't<00:05:27.790> getting<00:05:28.030> brutally<00:05:28.300> murdered<00:05:31.650> so<00:05:32.650> once

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
ain't getting brutally murdered so once

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.230 
ain't getting brutally murdered so once
again<00:05:33.070> going<00:05:33.760> out<00:05:34.050> in<00:05:35.050> four<00:05:35.260> things<00:05:36.240> things

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
again going out in four things things

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.490 
again going out in four things things
are<00:05:37.360> generally<00:05:37.660> an<00:05:37.720> hour<00:05:37.870> fuck<00:05:38.050> is<00:05:38.200> there<00:05:38.380> in

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
are generally an hour fuck is there in

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.720 
are generally an hour fuck is there in
no<00:05:38.650> really<00:05:38.919> need<00:05:39.040> to<00:05:39.100> look<00:05:39.220> around<00:05:39.490> you<00:05:39.610> can

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
no really need to look around you can

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.780 
no really need to look around you can
see<00:05:39.760> the<00:05:40.030> square<00:05:40.690> covers<00:05:41.110> most<00:05:41.320> of<00:05:41.410> it<00:05:41.790> and

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
see the square covers most of it and

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.370 
see the square covers most of it and
we'll<00:05:42.910> go<00:05:43.030> around<00:05:43.180> in<00:05:43.390> a<00:05:43.450> scope<00:05:43.690> it's<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.110> same

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
we'll go around in a scope it's the same

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.950 
we'll go around in a scope it's the same
as<00:05:44.530> well

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.090 

there<00:05:47.560> goes<00:05:47.710> Scouts<00:05:48.720> can't<00:05:49.720> get<00:05:49.900> them<00:05:50.100> he's

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
there goes Scouts can't get them he's

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.870 
there goes Scouts can't get them he's
too<00:05:51.310> fast<00:05:52.350> so<00:05:53.350> looking<00:05:53.500> around<00:05:53.770> just<00:05:54.190> keeping

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
too fast so looking around just keeping

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.650 
too fast so looking around just keeping
things<00:05:55.030> in<00:05:55.150> focus<00:05:55.449> for<00:05:55.630> now<00:05:57.449> here<00:05:58.449> should<00:05:58.630> we

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
things in focus for now here should we

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.180 
things in focus for now here should we
look<00:05:58.780> up<00:05:58.990> top<00:05:59.199> but<00:05:59.410> yet<00:05:59.560> we<00:05:59.710> get<00:05:59.860> distracted

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
look up top but yet we get distracted

see other things the carts take out a
pyro<00:06:03.810> turn<00:06:04.810> around<00:06:05.050> look<00:06:05.259> this<00:06:06.250> is<00:06:06.340> important

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
pyro turn around look this is important

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
but just look around with the center

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:14.339 
but just look around with the center
sometimes<00:06:12.699> yeah<00:06:12.849> like<00:06:13.030> that<00:06:13.210> now<00:06:14.199> we're

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449 
we know where the bombs are the bombs

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:48.779 
we know where the bombs are the bombs
aren't<00:06:46.630> going<00:06:46.840> to<00:06:46.900> move<00:06:47.310> so<00:06:48.310> it's<00:06:48.460> important

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:48.789 
aren't going to move so it's important

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:50.189 
aren't going to move so it's important
to<00:06:48.819> do<00:06:48.970> so<00:06:49.150> you<00:06:49.210> get<00:06:49.449> a<00:06:49.479> good<00:06:49.630> feel<00:06:49.840> of<00:06:49.960> that<00:06:50.050> so

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 
to do so you get a good feel of that so

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.600 
to do so you get a good feel of that so
you<00:06:50.259> can<00:06:50.349> dodge<00:06:50.500> them<00:06:50.740> as<00:06:51.039> long<00:06:51.220> as<00:06:51.340> you<00:06:51.430> just

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
you can dodge them as long as you just

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.420 
you can dodge them as long as you just
watch<00:06:51.970> where<00:06:52.210> they<00:06:52.360> are<00:06:52.509> and<00:06:52.659> remember<00:06:52.960> it<00:06:53.430> you

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
watch where they are and remember it you

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.529 
watch where they are and remember it you
also<00:06:54.550> got<00:06:54.669> have<00:06:54.789> a<00:06:54.849> good<00:06:54.970> feel<00:06:55.120> of<00:06:55.300> where<00:06:55.419> you

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:55.539 
also got have a good feel of where you

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:57.300 
also got have a good feel of where you
remain<00:06:55.810> spatially<00:06:56.289> in<00:06:56.349> the<00:06:56.409> game<00:06:56.560> that's

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
remain spatially in the game that's

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.680 
remain spatially in the game that's
something<00:06:57.460> that<00:06:57.580> comes<00:06:57.759> over<00:06:57.909> time<00:06:58.150> to<00:07:00.690> look

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690 
something that comes over time to look

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.899 
something that comes over time to look
around<00:07:01.870> and<00:07:02.380> then<00:07:02.919> as<00:07:03.190> you<00:07:03.340> look<00:07:03.520> around<00:07:03.639> you

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:03.909 
around and then as you look around you

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:05.339 
around and then as you look around you
killed<00:07:04.180> by<00:07:04.300> curry<00:07:04.479> rocket<00:07:04.840> but<00:07:05.020> that<00:07:05.169> happens

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:05.349 
killed by curry rocket but that happens

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:07.860 
killed by curry rocket but that happens
