guess it's frosted so it's nice that you

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.900 
guess it's frosted so it's nice that you
can<00:00:29.820> see<00:00:30.000> through<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:31.489> bumpers<00:00:32.489> here<00:00:32.700> are

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
can see through it the bumpers here are

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.880 
can see through it the bumpers here are
made<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> TPU<00:00:34.170> type<00:00:34.940> material<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.890> it

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
made of like a TPU type material and it

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.049 
made of like a TPU type material and it
feels<00:00:38.399> alright<00:00:38.730> with<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> grip<00:00:39.239> but<00:00:40.969> it's<00:00:41.969> not

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
feels alright with the grip but it's not

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.459 
feels alright with the grip but it's not
a<00:00:42.920> it<00:00:43.920> doesn't<00:00:44.219> feel<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.610> it'll<00:00:45.480> be<00:00:45.930> good<00:00:46.350> in

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
a it doesn't feel like it'll be good in

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.100 
a it doesn't feel like it'll be good in
the<00:00:46.500> hands<00:00:46.860> after<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> while<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.399> guess<00:00:48.110> mainly

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the hands after a while I guess mainly

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.250 
the hands after a while I guess mainly
because<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.649> back<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.340> slippery<00:00:51.260> like

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
because the back is so slippery like

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.560 
because the back is so slippery like
that<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.800> that's<00:00:53.280> something<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.210> didn't

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
that and that's something that I didn't

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.160 
that and that's something that I didn't
like<00:00:54.780> about<00:00:55.070> my<00:00:56.070> body<00:00:56.520> glove<00:00:56.820> case<00:00:56.899> it<00:00:57.899> was<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
like about my body glove case it was the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.639 
like about my body glove case it was the
same<00:00:58.350> problem<00:00:59.780> I'm<00:01:00.780> looking<00:01:00.989> for<00:01:01.320> something

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
same problem I'm looking for something

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.200 
same problem I'm looking for something
that<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:02.039> get<00:01:02.160> me<00:01:02.309> grip<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> back<00:01:02.910> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
that can get me grip on the back and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.070 
that can get me grip on the back and
it's<00:01:03.600> still<00:01:03.780> sleek<00:01:04.290> at<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.500> same<00:01:04.680> time

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
it's still sleek at the same time

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.780 
it's still sleek at the same time
unfortunately<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.200> isn't<00:01:07.409> doing<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.950> but

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
unfortunately this isn't doing it but
