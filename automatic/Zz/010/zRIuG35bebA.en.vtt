for<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:43.969> team<00:01:44.179> total<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.689> I<00:01:44.719> just<00:01:44.929> take<00:01:45.020> a

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
for the team total and I just take a

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.899 
for the team total and I just take a
shot<00:01:45.289> with<00:01:45.319> Cincinnati<00:01:45.920> on<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.460> over<00:01:46.759> which

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
shot with Cincinnati on the over which

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.550 
shot with Cincinnati on the over which
right<00:01:47.119> now<00:01:47.299> would<00:01:47.420> be<00:01:47.450> just<00:01:47.780> 25<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:48.409> a<00:01:48.439> half

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
right now would be just 25 and a half

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.200 
right now would be just 25 and a half
and<00:01:48.710> again<00:01:48.890> they<00:01:49.009> put<00:01:49.159> up<00:01:49.249> at<00:01:49.340> least<00:01:49.369> 40<00:01:49.939> in

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
and again they put up at least 40 in

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.940

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.140 
and then so so on the road and therefore
they<00:02:09.140> could<00:02:09.319> in<00:02:09.530> theory<00:02:09.979> get<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.610> size<00:02:10.880> the
