00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
thinking about turning this into a

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.720 
thinking about turning this into a
series<00:04:26.170> of<00:04:26.200> breaking<00:04:26.650> down<00:04:26.770> every<00:04:27.160> zombie<00:04:27.370> map

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
series of breaking down every zombie map

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.880 
series of breaking down every zombie map
and<00:04:27.970> how<00:04:28.150> it<00:04:28.330> connects<00:04:28.660> to<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.900> campaign<00:04:29.380> so

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890
