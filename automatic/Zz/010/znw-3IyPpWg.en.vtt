potentially the best definitely I mean

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.520

when<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.209> first<00:02:18.270> come<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.690> United<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.260> likes<00:02:19.440> of

when I first come to United the likes of

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.880 
when I first come to United the likes of
working<00:02:19.980> yeah<00:02:20.370> David<00:02:21.239> Beckham<00:02:21.650> players<00:02:22.650> all

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
working yeah David Beckham players all

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.130 
working yeah David Beckham players all
of<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.190> but<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.970> managers<00:02:24.390> kind<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.720> built<00:02:25.050> a

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
of that but the managers kind of built a

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.530 
of that but the managers kind of built a
new<00:02:25.290> team<00:02:25.560> since<00:02:25.830> then<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.400> we've<00:02:27.239> got<00:02:27.390> some

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
new team since then and we've got some

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.000 
new team since then and we've got some
very<00:02:27.690> talented<00:02:27.930> players<00:02:28.319> but<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.650> think<00:02:28.860> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
very talented players but I think the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.190 
very talented players but I think the
biggest<00:02:29.190> difference<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.060> strength<00:02:31.050> in

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
biggest difference is that strength in

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.320 
biggest difference is that strength in
