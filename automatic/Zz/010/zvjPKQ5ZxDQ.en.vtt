many<00:01:54.750> people<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.350> make<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:56.149> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
many people I have to make this for the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.030 
many people I have to make this for the
fact<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.869> takes<00:01:58.049> one<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.469> half<00:01:58.530> skeins

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
fact that it takes one and a half skeins

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.929 
fact that it takes one and a half skeins
of yarn<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.610> make<00:01:59.640> one<00:02:00.890> I'm<00:02:01.890> very<00:02:01.950> very<00:02:02.729> lucky

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
of yarn to make one I'm very very lucky

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.539 
of yarn to make one I'm very very lucky
with<00:02:03.619> school<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.649> all<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> Commission's<00:02:05.430> I

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
with school and all the Commission's I

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.630 
with school and all the Commission's I
have<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.939> all<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.659> stuff<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:08.039> amount<00:02:08.459> of

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
have and all that stuff so the amount of

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.979 
have and all that stuff so the amount of
urine<00:02:08.789> i'm<00:02:08.970> about<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.330> show<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.750> might

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
urine i'm about to show you you might

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.840 
urine i'm about to show you you might
want<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.289> brace<00:02:10.440> yourself

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
want to brace yourself

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.610 
want to brace yourself
it's<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.810> big<00:02:13.960> one<00:02:14.100> so<00:02:15.100> basically<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:17.440> yarn

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
it's a big one so basically the yarn

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.020 
it's a big one so basically the yarn
that<00:02:17.740> comes<00:02:17.950> in<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.220> kit<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.640> urn<00:02:18.820> that<00:02:18.970> I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
that comes in the kit and the urn that I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.610 
that comes in the kit and the urn that I
bought<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.360> go<00:02:19.390> along<00:02:19.660> with<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.840> is<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.410> Mary

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
bought to go along with it is that Mary

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.110 
bought to go along with it is that Mary
maxim<00:02:21.010> starlet<00:02:21.430> yarn<00:02:21.580> which<00:02:22.240> I<00:02:22.420> think<00:02:22.720> for<00:02:23.290> a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
maxim starlet yarn which I think for a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.580 
maxim starlet yarn which I think for a
what<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:25.150> would<00:02:25.420> consider<00:02:26.430> maybe<00:02:27.430> bargain<00:02:28.000> yarn

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
what I would consider maybe bargain yarn

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.560 
what I would consider maybe bargain yarn
it's<00:02:29.590> really<00:02:29.830> good<00:02:30.010> it's<00:02:30.580> it's<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.180> pretty<00:02:31.360> nice

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
it's really good it's it's a pretty nice

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.780 
it's really good it's it's a pretty nice
worsted<00:02:31.990> weight<00:02:32.110> it's<00:02:32.260> pretty<00:02:32.770> soft<00:02:33.100> I'm

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
worsted weight it's pretty soft I'm

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.960 
worsted weight it's pretty soft I'm
making<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.180> baby<00:02:34.420> blanket<00:02:34.720> out<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.970> starlet

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
making a baby blanket out of the starlet

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.880 
making a baby blanket out of the starlet
I<00:02:37.000> think<00:02:37.270> it's<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.630> DK<00:02:37.990> weight<00:02:38.200> i'm<00:02:38.470> not<00:02:38.680> sure

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
I think it's the DK weight i'm not sure

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.580 
I think it's the DK weight i'm not sure
but<00:02:39.450> i'm<00:02:40.450> kind<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.810> impressed<00:02:40.990> with<00:02:41.500> the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
but i'm kind of impressed with the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.950 
but i'm kind of impressed with the
merrier<00:02:41.830> maxima<00:02:42.340> our<00:02:42.430> inequality<00:02:42.810> it's<00:02:43.810> just

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
merrier maxima our inequality it's just

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.360 
merrier maxima our inequality it's just
not<00:02:43.990> what<00:02:44.170> I<00:02:44.230> was<00:02:44.380> expecting<00:02:44.440> especially

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
not what I was expecting especially

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.650 
not what I was expecting especially
since<00:02:45.550> it's<00:02:45.820> like<00:02:45.910> one<00:02:46.420> hundred<00:02:46.630> percent

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
since it's like one hundred percent

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.350 
since it's like one hundred percent
acrylic<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:47.470> it's<00:02:47.650> not<00:02:47.860> like<00:02:48.280> Karen<00:02:49.060> simply

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
acrylic and it's not like Karen simply

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.910 
acrylic and it's not like Karen simply
soft<00:02:49.570> or<00:02:49.870> red<00:02:49.990> heart<00:02:50.200> soft<00:02:50.440> or<00:02:50.590> anything<00:02:50.890> like

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
soft or red heart soft or anything like

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.510 
soft or red heart soft or anything like
that<00:02:51.040> like<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:51.490> not<00:02:51.640> branded<00:02:52.510> as<00:02:52.630> soft<00:02:52.900> um

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
that like it's not branded as soft um

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.620 
that like it's not branded as soft um
but<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.610> quality<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:55.000> pretty<00:02:55.210> good<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.540> if

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
but the quality is pretty good and if

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.030 
but the quality is pretty good and if
you<00:02:55.720> haven't<00:02:56.020> tried<00:02:56.080> it<00:02:56.200> before<00:02:56.410> it's<00:02:56.770> really
