00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.109 
drugstore I believe this look is like
half<00:00:22.080> drugstore<00:00:22.619> makeup<00:00:22.859> items<00:00:23.369> or<00:00:23.670> probably

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
half drugstore makeup items or probably

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.910 
half drugstore makeup items or probably
even<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.480> little<00:00:24.600> bit<00:00:24.689> more<00:00:24.869> than<00:00:25.080> half<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.890> I

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
even a little bit more than half so I

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.009 
even a little bit more than half so I
really<00:00:26.220> like<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.420> was<00:00:27.720> kind<00:00:27.960> of

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
not to mention it's a really black

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.330 
not to mention it's a really black
mascara<00:04:10.079> which<00:04:10.440> sometimes<00:04:10.799> it's<00:04:11.160> hard<00:04:11.310> to

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
mascara which sometimes it's hard to

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:24.649 
mascara which sometimes it's hard to
find<00:04:11.609> but<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:12.180> really<00:04:12.570> like<00:04:12.750> it<00:04:12.870> so<00:04:13.049> far

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.390

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
so don't be in too much of a hurry

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.429 
so don't be in too much of a hurry
because<00:04:27.789> if<00:04:28.000> you<00:04:28.150> are<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:28.750> might<00:04:29.080> make<00:04:29.229> this

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:29.439 
because if you are you might make this

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:30.929

fingers<00:04:57.550> today<00:04:57.789> instead<00:04:58.029> of<00:04:58.150> my<00:04:58.300> tweezers<00:04:58.689> and

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
fingers today instead of my tweezers and

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.649 
fingers today instead of my tweezers and

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
actually worked out pretty well for me

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:03.089 
actually worked out pretty well for me
surprisingly<00:05:01.659> because<00:05:01.960> it<00:05:02.169> every<00:05:02.469> time<00:05:02.680> and

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
surprisingly because it every time and

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.550 
surprisingly because it every time and
then<00:05:03.789> I'm<00:05:04.060> also<00:05:04.300> going<00:05:04.779> to<00:05:04.900> be<00:05:05.080> tight<00:05:05.349> lining

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
then I'm also going to be tight lining

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.309 
then I'm also going to be tight lining
my<00:05:05.770> eyes<00:05:05.800> with<00:05:06.310> the<00:05:06.340> l'oreal<00:05:06.879> voluminous

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:07.319 
my eyes with the l'oreal voluminous

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:09.659 
my eyes with the l'oreal voluminous
smoldering<00:05:08.319> eyeliner<00:05:08.529> I<00:05:09.129> really<00:05:09.430> like<00:05:09.550> this

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
smoldering eyeliner I really like this

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.059 
smoldering eyeliner I really like this
because<00:05:09.879> it's<00:05:10.060> pretty<00:05:10.240> big<00:05:10.449> so<00:05:10.840> um<00:05:11.199> it<00:05:11.919> just

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.069 
because it's pretty big so um it just

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:13.320 
because it's pretty big so um it just
gets<00:05:12.189> right<00:05:12.460> on<00:05:12.490> that<00:05:12.729> tight<00:05:12.909> line<00:05:13.090> without

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
gets right on that tight line without

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.839 
gets right on that tight line without
making<00:05:14.229> it<00:05:14.319> a<00:05:14.379> half<00:05:14.529> full<00:05:14.770> because<00:05:14.979> this<00:05:15.430> is

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
making it a half full because this is

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:23.100 
making it a half full because this is
actually<00:05:15.969> really<00:05:16.599> terrifying<00:05:20.729> and<00:05:22.020> then<00:05:23.020> i'm

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
actually really terrifying and then i'm

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.990 
actually really terrifying and then i'm
taking<00:05:23.139> the<00:05:23.560> Milani<00:05:23.949> anti<00:05:24.400> feathering<00:05:24.849> lip

taking the Milani anti feathering lip

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.790 
taking the Milani anti feathering lip
liner<00:05:25.180> in<00:05:25.449> the<00:05:25.479> color<00:05:25.539> transparent<00:05:26.379> i<00:05:26.469> haven't

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
liner in the color transparent i haven't

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.079 
liner in the color transparent i haven't
heard<00:05:26.949> anybody<00:05:27.159> talk<00:05:27.339> about<00:05:27.669> this<00:05:27.849> yet<00:05:28.060> but

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:28.089 
heard anybody talk about this yet but

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:30.360 
heard anybody talk about this yet but
it's<00:05:28.389> basically<00:05:28.599> a<00:05:29.080> lip<00:05:29.319> primer<00:05:29.529> and<00:05:29.979> a<00:05:30.099> line

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
it's basically a lip primer and a line

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.490 
it's basically a lip primer and a line
filler<00:05:30.729> so<00:05:31.419> it's<00:05:31.539> supposed<00:05:31.629> to<00:05:31.900> increase<00:05:32.289> the

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
filler so it's supposed to increase the

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.589 
filler so it's supposed to increase the
longevity<00:05:32.710> of<00:05:33.129> your<00:05:33.339> lipstick<00:05:33.819> and<00:05:34.060> i'm

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
longevity of your lipstick and i'm

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.839 
longevity of your lipstick and i'm
putting<00:05:35.080> this<00:05:35.259> all<00:05:35.589> over<00:05:35.949> my<00:05:36.159> lips<00:05:36.339> filling

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:36.849 
putting this all over my lips filling

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:38.459 
putting this all over my lips filling
them<00:05:36.969> in<00:05:37.060> and<00:05:37.389> it<00:05:37.539> makes<00:05:37.690> some<00:05:37.810> kind<00:05:37.960> of<00:05:38.080> sticky

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:38.469 
them in and it makes some kind of sticky

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:40.469 
them in and it makes some kind of sticky
which<00:05:38.800> I'm<00:05:39.159> assuming<00:05:39.339> is<00:05:39.669> the<00:05:39.789> primer<00:05:40.029> part<00:05:40.389> of

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
which I'm assuming is the primer part of

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.570 
which I'm assuming is the primer part of
it<00:05:40.599> and<00:05:40.870> then<00:05:41.319> I'm<00:05:41.500> also<00:05:41.680> taking<00:05:41.919> a<00:05:42.250> lipstick
