got to condense that down there's a lot

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.330 
got to condense that down there's a lot
of<00:00:48.660> double<00:00:49.110> speed<00:00:49.320> everywhere<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.070> mean<00:00:50.250> this

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
of double speed everywhere I mean this

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.439 
of double speed everywhere I mean this
is<00:00:50.460> all<00:00:50.550> sweat<00:00:51.480> up<00:00:51.629> them<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.340> ok<00:00:53.340> wait<00:00:54.210> after

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
is all sweat up them so ok wait after

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.860 
is all sweat up them so ok wait after
the<00:00:54.719> last<00:00:54.960> three<00:00:55.289> Emmys<00:00:55.530> already<00:00:56.750> for<00:00:57.750> those

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the last three Emmys already for those

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.630 
the last three Emmys already for those
of<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.050> who<00:00:58.140> don't<00:00:58.289> know<00:00:58.410> does<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.399> five

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
of you who don't know does the five

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.160 
of you who don't know does the five
components<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.149> level<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.600> each<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.989> them

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
components the level and each of them

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.130 
components the level and each of them
have<00:01:01.410> 10<00:01:01.739> enemies<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.370> them<00:01:03.049> I<00:01:05.780> guess<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.990> best

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
have 10 enemies in them I guess the best

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.649 
have 10 enemies in them I guess the best
way<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.590> probably<00:01:07.710> taking<00:01:08.610> your<00:01:08.850> favorite<00:01:09.390> map

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
way is probably taking your favorite map

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.840 
way is probably taking your favorite map
I've<00:01:10.170> tried<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.310> achievement<00:01:11.610> so

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
I've tried to do this achievement so

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.160 
I've tried to do this achievement so
many<00:01:12.000> times<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.330> map<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.689> kind<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.020> know

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
many times in this map I kind of know

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.170 
many times in this map I kind of know
where<00:01:13.439> everyone<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.850> different

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
where everyone is and the different

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.420 
where everyone is and the different
variants<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.720> when<00:01:15.900> they<00:01:16.110> spawn<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.710> play<00:01:17.310> at

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
variants of when they spawn I play at

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.539 
variants of when they spawn I play at
that<00:01:17.520> many<00:01:17.729> times<00:01:17.939> i'ma<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:19.470> no<00:01:19.650> chance<00:01:20.310> at

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
that many times i'ma have no chance at

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.620 
that many times i'ma have no chance at
Walden<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.939> shot<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.509> head

Walden you shot that one in the head
with<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.950> looks<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.280> lot<00:01:23.340> more<00:01:23.400> aggressive

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
with it it looks a lot more aggressive

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.160 
with it it looks a lot more aggressive
because<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.090> sped<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.420> yeah<00:01:25.189> but<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:27.750> biggest

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
because it sped up yeah but the biggest

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.249 
because it sped up yeah but the biggest
key<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:28.979> achievement<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.900> just<00:01:30.900> going
