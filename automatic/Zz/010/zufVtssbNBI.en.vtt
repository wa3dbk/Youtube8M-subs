because<00:00:32.250> once<00:00:32.489> they<00:00:32.669> ripen<00:00:33.090> they're<00:00:33.480> very

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
because once they ripen they're very

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.569 
because once they ripen they're very
fragile<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:34.739> very<00:00:34.950> difficult<00:00:35.370> to
