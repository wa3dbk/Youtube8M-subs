00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.189
 hi guys I am at zero and today 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.349
 we are on dragon age inquisition not for 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.070
 a gameplay or something but today we'll do a 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.730
 nice tutorial and the tutorial will be called 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:20.539
 I don't know, I'll just show you today 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:24.000
 how to make the perfect excuse for the game 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.619
 first of all you will need at least two 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.750
 no warriors at least one let us say at least 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.720
 a warrior who is a tank or 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.009
 this tree here that vanguard and I of 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.500
 councilor to increase all 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.840
 skill this tree since one from 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.780
 defense is another 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.430
 other defense another from damage established 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.770
 these things here damage bonuses are fine 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.390
 Also a bit of damage they must be 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.559
 in short, all these things here if you want 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.280
 I'll show you all the 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.180
 steps 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.150
 if I said things well and then at least 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.559
 I would say all the tree of the water to everyone 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.330
 all two warriors also doing 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.710
 fail if you want to do two 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.630
 specialization for one 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.430
 specialization for a warrior 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.200
 friend not yours because yours 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.080
 put a type superspecialization 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.820
 champion a templar with a bit bad peace 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.649
 I took the destroyer then the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.649
 facilities technically under his attack 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.330
 then the sample would be right on 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.040
 there is sultan defense which I would recommend to you 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.050
 do it this way 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.230
 and then there is the Templar which of course 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.060
 cassandra instead the champion 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.680
 apple because friends specializations 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.320
 you can't cut it, it's just one 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:37.030
 so where does it say the companion more 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.400
 adequate and therefore this is how much then 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.690
 the other few points that will test the 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.550
 I would advise you to put them up 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.430
 circles because the circles give the 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.370
 statistics ie force peuterey forza 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.640
 q3 more constitutions among these 3 then 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.890
 if for example he makes sword and shield and tank 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.440
 it would be perfect because sword and shield is 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.950
 already for six almost a tank then avant-garde 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.720
 age then also you will have the remaining 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.190
 do on specialization or do it 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.200
 sword and shield specialization the 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.970
 remaining on the avant-garde is the same 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.020
 the important thing is that he has a sword on his sword 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.050
 shield and avant-garde and the other that is 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.820
 the sample specialization this for 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.680
 as a warrior regarding the 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.860
 fucking warrior 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:25.030
 in fact I said or I must say that it would be me 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.520
 that I make the destroyer and then arms a 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.930
 two hands and I put a little condottiere a 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.080
 avant-garde because I find myself 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.980
 possible questions of habits 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.260
 Cassandro, as I told you, but one 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.600
 templare then with sword and shield 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.640
 templar and a bit of sun that still not 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.040
 I put it there because there are no fines and then 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.090
 we have the other here the thief if me 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.780
 I recommend making a varric type a 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.879
 a remote cell even if you do though 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.920
 a given up close is not a problem though 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.530
 the archer who closes because they need two 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.319
 or at least one to keep friends busy 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.760
 that is, the enemies or the warriors and the 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:06.269
 another two or three depends on the distance a 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.739
 then hit one of the two from the 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.830
 striking distance must be a 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:16.080
 archer in my opinion so I would tell you about 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.849
 take what's called 21 serao 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.769
 barriques, however, I would like to close that a little 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.430
 more useful if you say he asks us instead 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.299
 main characters as we say 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.950
 arcella 16 of the main character 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.989
 with marcel there are no problems e 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.390
 specialization is the one that most 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.360
 please I would say that as a murderer 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.989
 specialization to the best then 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.959
 archer you must obviously do all the 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:42.180
 all the archer tree and finally some 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.099
 of poison because the velino this band 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.519
 here I would say 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.410
 1234 because the poison is silent 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.840
 to the archer of course because you give them 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.209
 continuous damage from poisoning and therefore 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.840
 more damaged then recapping 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.850
 the archer should be a velino archer 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.319
 and assassin specializations or in 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.719
 case of barrique-makers 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.670
 then we pass to the magician because it is obvious that 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:08.680
 you must at least one magician an archer a 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.780
 warrior in the group there is a magician a 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.930
 thief in the group because so if you want 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.430
 Download the game one hundred percent 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.720
 it is more useful as it will require you 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.560
 sometimes specific skills 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.750
 burglar type thief uses wizard magic e 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.050
 something like that and it breaks through walls there 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.030
 we are then the monologue you have to put 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.889
 first of all spirit because it would be 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:35.710
 a kind of wizard tank what helps 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:38.110
 friends and so take everything there is the 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.539
 all towards here that serves to revive 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.400
 friends this then put up barriers 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.750
 this quiet the negative effects e 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.440
 built pushes enemies however there 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.780
 will serve everything then the second skill is a 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.550
 your choice between fire electricity and 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.810
 ice but I remind you that the ice 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.599
 need more 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.970
 always as many that is to say on the 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:01.479
 sea â€‹â€‹and the fire blocked indices instead 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.840
 damage area and continuous electricity damage 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.729
 instead everything is based more on his attack 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.800
 then on my specializations 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.020
 specialization on a necromancer who does 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.550
 put veils to make things run away from 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.840
 gender 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:18.970
 then there is what we call that type pdl that 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.370
 that's what I recommend even more 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:25.249
 because the knight who would be like already 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.729
 I already told you a sketch of the wizard tanks 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:30.019
 which therefore helps friends creates barriers 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.919
 attack a magic sword so it's a lot 

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:33.549
 helpful 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.549
 finally there is 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.520
 the soccer does not remember me finally if 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.630
 in other words, the other skill that you have 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.210
 will allow you to throw stone punches 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.310
 points from underground or even 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.840
 rips believe just rips and 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.570
 those advice is as I said the 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.560
 knight spirit and another powers a 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.630
 choice between these three though 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.750
 preferably asks for ice either 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.220
 better of course the third choice is there 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.570
 a third category you will choose not 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.370
 you will never manage to put all the points 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.810
 if in the previous ones you have put 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.610
 all points of all skill points 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.140
 you have to choose the one that suits you 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.590
 like what you like best 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.550
 so how to recap we have a 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.670
 warrior or two 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.190
 then a thief and a magician if he decides to 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:20.800
 being a warrior is fine if you choose to 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.000
 be a thief you won't put I advise you 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.580
 not to put the team side because 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.070
 having two then we say that the defense of 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.270
 group drops the magician the same thing not 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.250
 I recommend you put a magician you can 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:34.740
 never ask but second you are 22 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:41.100
 instead I would like to bank very well then 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:44.140
 this and that regarding the thing 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.180
 what exactly no these for how much 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.190
 regards the creation of the characters e 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.270
 hence the choice of the characters to have 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:54.300
 in team a special greeting to z of 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.130
 m 2 that gave me the idea for this 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.040
 special guide made for you then 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.249
 let me know if you found this useful 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.349
 guide 

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:07.459
 as usual , I invite you to comment 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:09.719
 that I like to write, share, etc. 

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:13.589
 I'm talking slowly because I don't remember 

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:15.419
 if I have to say something and then there 

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:19.879
 see you at the next short video game 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:19.879
 tutorial what you shave
