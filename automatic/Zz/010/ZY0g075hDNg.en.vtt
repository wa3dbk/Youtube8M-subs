we're looking at a casio g-shock GA 1001

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.509 
we're looking at a casio g-shock GA 1001
ADR<00:00:13.330> it<00:00:13.809> comes<00:00:14.139> with<00:00:14.290> instruction<00:00:14.860> manual<00:00:15.309> and

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 
ADR it comes with instruction manual and

ADR it comes with instruction manual and
in<00:00:15.730> the<00:00:15.820> original<00:00:16.349> g-shock<00:00:17.380> tin<00:00:17.710> box<00:00:18.150> let's

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
in the original g-shock tin box let's

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.660 
in the original g-shock tin box let's
take<00:00:19.330> a<00:00:19.360> look<00:00:19.630> so<00:00:20.290> this<00:00:20.439> is<00:00:20.619> one<00:00:20.800> of<00:00:20.830> the<00:00:21.040> analog

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
take a look so this is one of the analog

that's<00:01:08.200> one<00:01:08.380> thing<00:01:08.560> I<00:01:08.650> wish<00:01:08.830> they<00:01:08.980> had

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
that's one thing I wish they had

that's one thing I wish they had
included<00:01:09.610> in<00:01:09.700> this<00:01:09.850> watch<00:01:10.409> additionally<00:01:11.409> it

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
included in this watch additionally it

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.560 
included in this watch additionally it
does<00:01:11.619> not<00:01:11.829> have<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.340> six<00:01:12.610> multi<00:01:13.000> band<00:01:13.210> that's

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
does not have the six multi band that's

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.800 
does not have the six multi band that's
the<00:01:13.780> calibration<00:01:14.470> using<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.520> atomic<00:01:16.000> power

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
the calibration using the atomic power

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.960 
the calibration using the atomic power
stations<00:01:17.350> to<00:01:17.439> set<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.829> time<00:01:18.040> so<00:01:18.369> those<00:01:18.820> are

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
stations to set the time so those are

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.190 
stations to set the time so those are
two<00:01:19.090> things<00:01:19.240> that<00:01:19.390> I<00:01:19.509> think<00:01:19.600> it's<00:01:19.899> it's

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
two things that I think it's it's

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.170 
two things that I think it's it's
lacking<00:01:20.530> but<00:01:20.860> otherwise<00:01:21.100> this<00:01:21.579> is<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.790> really

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
lacking but otherwise this is a really
