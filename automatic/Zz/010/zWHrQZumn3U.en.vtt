of fabric put it through the hoop and

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.490 
of fabric put it through the hoop and
then<00:00:34.590> waste<00:00:35.370> all<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.059> fabric<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:37.140> cut<00:00:37.380> it

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
then waste all that fabric to cut it

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.780

down to fit the pattern on the quilt and

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.700 
down to fit the pattern on the quilt and
I<00:00:42.570> was<00:00:42.719> going<00:00:42.989> through<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.170> lot<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.440> material

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
I was going through a lot of material

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.400 
I was going through a lot of material
and<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.239> certain<00:00:45.690> point<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.050> stopped

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and I just at a certain point I stopped

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.100 
and I just at a certain point I stopped
I<00:00:46.590> said<00:00:46.800> that's<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.340> can't<00:00:47.610> use<00:00:48.329> anymore<00:00:48.870> I

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
I said that's it I can't use anymore I

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.799 
I said that's it I can't use anymore I
need<00:00:49.289> there<00:00:49.620> was<00:00:49.739> another<00:00:50.000> 40<00:00:51.000> pieces<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.780> I

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
need there was another 40 pieces that I

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.100 
need there was another 40 pieces that I
think<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.170> had<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.699> embroider<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.660> took<00:00:54.930> me

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
think I had to embroider and it took me

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.990 
think I had to embroider and it took me
two<00:00:55.350> weeks<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.399> embroidering

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
two weeks to just do the embroidering

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.529 
two weeks to just do the embroidering
so<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:58.219> stopped<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.430> at<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.820> point<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.359> then

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
