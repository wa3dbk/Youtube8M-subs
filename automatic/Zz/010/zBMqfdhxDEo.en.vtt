because of breaking rules I think was

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.670 
because of breaking rules I think was
because<00:03:39.360> he<00:03:39.600> wasn't<00:03:39.870> wearing<00:03:40.020> a<00:03:40.140> scientist<00:03:40.530> or

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
because he wasn't wearing a scientist or
