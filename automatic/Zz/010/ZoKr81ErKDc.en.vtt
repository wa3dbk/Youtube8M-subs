00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
and the reason that I'm still doing it

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.440 
and the reason that I'm still doing it
is<00:00:51.420> one<00:00:51.600> because<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.930> love<00:00:52.200> it<00:00:52.380> too<00:00:53.309> because<00:00:54.180> I

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
is one because I love it too because I

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.000 
is one because I love it too because I
feel<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.630> I<00:00:54.750> didn't<00:00:54.930> really<00:00:55.079> utilize<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
feel like I didn't really utilize it the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.610 
feel like I didn't really utilize it the
first<00:00:56.219> time<00:00:56.460> through<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.290> didn't<00:00:58.290> fully<00:00:58.380> take

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
first time through I didn't fully take

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.140 
first time through I didn't fully take
advantage<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:59.130> it<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.399> at<00:00:59.610> this<00:00:59.730> point

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
advantage of it so at this point

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.840 
advantage of it so at this point
smoking<00:01:00.630> out<00:01:00.720> any<00:01:01.470> bit<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.860> those<00:01:01.980> movie<00:01:02.580> games

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
smoking out any bit of those movie games

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.609 
smoking out any bit of those movie games
I<00:01:03.060> can<00:01:03.270> get

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
I can get

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.669 
I can get
and<00:01:05.009> so<00:01:05.189> I'll<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.339> doing<00:01:05.579> starting<00:01:06.030> strength

00:01:06.669 --> 00:01:06.679 
and so I'll be doing starting strength

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:09.789 
and so I'll be doing starting strength
and<00:01:07.679> so<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.189> can't<00:01:08.789> stand<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.240> anymore

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
and so I can't stand it anymore

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.929 
and so I can't stand it anymore

times a week I'm learning does that make
some<00:02:38.200> pretty<00:02:38.410> crazy<00:02:38.890> gains

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
some pretty crazy gains

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.120 
some pretty crazy gains
Gina's<00:02:40.600> tempeh<00:02:40.900> tell<00:02:41.320> me<00:02:41.470> about<00:02:41.590> some<00:02:41.860> people

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
Gina's tempeh tell me about some people

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.250 
Gina's tempeh tell me about some people
that<00:02:42.550> he's<00:02:42.730> met<00:02:42.940> at<00:02:43.060> San<00:02:43.240> Jose<00:02:43.540> that's<00:02:44.140> about

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
that he's met at San Jose that's about

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.500 
that he's met at San Jose that's about
five<00:02:44.560> times<00:02:44.800> a<00:02:44.890> week<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.850> are<00:02:45.910> super<00:02:46.270> strong

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
five times a week that are super strong

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.970 
five times a week that are super strong
so<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.500> feel<00:02:47.920> like<00:02:49.320> obviously<00:02:50.320> keeping<00:02:50.680> into

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
so I feel like obviously keeping into

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.270 
so I feel like obviously keeping into
account<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.610> volume<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:52.740> feel<00:02:53.740> you<00:02:53.890> can<00:02:54.040> squat

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
account the volume I feel you can squat

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.970 
account the volume I feel you can squat
as<00:02:54.430> much<00:02:54.580> as<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.850> want

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
as much as you want

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.830 
as much as you want
because<00:02:56.550> all<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.819> muscles<00:02:57.150> involved<00:02:58.760> but<00:02:59.840> I'm

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
because all the muscles involved but I'm

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.619 
because all the muscles involved but I'm
a<00:03:00.989> novice<00:03:01.349> and<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.280> could<00:03:02.459> all<00:03:02.580> end<00:03:02.819> when<00:03:03.510> my

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
a novice and that could all end when my

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.150 
a novice and that could all end when my
strength<00:03:03.840> goes<00:03:04.140> higher<00:03:04.379> so<00:03:04.709> we'll<00:03:04.890> see<00:03:05.040> what

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
strength goes higher so we'll see what

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.059 
strength goes higher so we'll see what
happens<00:03:05.750> but<00:03:06.750> there's<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.170> lot<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.440> interesting

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
happens but there's a lot of interesting

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.460 
happens but there's a lot of interesting
stuff<00:03:08.730> I've<00:03:08.849> been<00:03:08.910> hearing<00:03:09.319> hearing<00:03:10.319> about

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
stuff I've been hearing hearing about

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.750 
stuff I've been hearing hearing about
from<00:03:10.650> gin<00:03:10.890> just<00:03:11.099> people<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.640> way<00:03:11.730> people

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
from gin just people the way people

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.000 
from gin just people the way people
train<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:13.050> now<00:03:13.230> if<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.590> want<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:13.860> bad<00:03:13.980> enough

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
train and now if you want it bad enough

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.460 
train and now if you want it bad enough
and<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.730> could<00:03:14.910> train<00:03:15.630> as<00:03:15.750> often<00:03:16.019> as<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.319> want

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
and you could train as often as you want

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.410 
and you could train as often as you want
and<00:03:17.220> make<00:03:17.489> gains<00:03:17.730> as<00:03:17.910> long<00:03:18.030> as<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.209> get<00:03:18.330> in

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
and make gains as long as you get in

that<00:03:18.540> rest<00:03:19.489> so<00:03:21.230> kinesiology<00:03:22.230> just<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.560> general

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
that rest so kinesiology just in general

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.990 
that rest so kinesiology just in general
is<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.069> very<00:03:23.840> very<00:03:24.840> new<00:03:25.170> field<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.980> science<00:03:26.580> so

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
is a very very new field of science so

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.850 
is a very very new field of science so
there's<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.019> lot<00:03:28.110> of<00:03:28.200> techniques<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.739> the

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
there's a lot of techniques that the

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.820 
there's a lot of techniques that the
body<00:03:29.040> can<00:03:29.250> handle<00:03:29.780> that<00:03:30.780> we<00:03:31.349> might<00:03:31.530> have<00:03:31.680> no

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
body can handle that we might have no

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.400 
body can handle that we might have no
clue<00:03:32.010> about<00:03:32.099> so<00:03:32.459> who<00:03:32.580> knows<00:03:33.079> but<00:03:34.079> that's

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
clue about so who knows but that's

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
clue about so who knows but that's
beside<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:34.950> point

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
beside the point

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.339 
beside the point
my<00:03:35.910> main<00:03:36.090> point<00:03:36.239> is<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.569> love<00:03:36.720> sunny<00:03:36.989> strength

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
my main point is I love sunny strength

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.309 
my main point is I love sunny strength
