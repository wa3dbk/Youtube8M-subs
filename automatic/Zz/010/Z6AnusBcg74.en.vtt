 St Hoff, the "Der Spiegel" Chelsea voluntarily was also from the media 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:07.460
 he consistently positive the positive stuff or exhibited one could in the 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.460
 Internet rather say at missed the opportunity 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.249
 and Chelsea is not in great shape to take this point with me 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.890
 and bribing cash register language now is a bit too fast 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.890
 very happy alone would be the wrong approach 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.560
 Yes, I think we dance for more, too 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.489
 who exactly the question as have been smooth 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.119
 as son's guests also with the crew or themed commitments 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.420
 Percent it must not be no matter who we play 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.170
 only that one is content with a defeat of any form percent 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.380
 Look there 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.050
 and vice versa, then it should not be that we have in Toronto 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.000
 also on 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.670
 that due to the result Revier evaluates the services as negative 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.860
 you could play clearly 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.230
 and it was something then 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.180
 against Chelsea 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.390
 We did not do that and we will not 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.230
 Gilligan to experience developments Haller is a determination community 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.720
 lousy game then decide for us 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.950
 yet we still have new clients dash percent 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.160
 Howard, of course, sees that much positive for this team 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.920
 in this few months still a little further and further developed and 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.430
 I've said it with this years probably was the biggest one 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.160
 Compliment for us 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.360
 that my colleague saw forced Aachen Lampard and change 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.219
 4 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:26.480
 the big opponent 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.630
 the company usually only ever 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.810
 from the other side is 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.579
 is that a problem as I have fewer problems than we possibly can ourselves 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.400
 Greil 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.000
 for Artur colleague board has rightly said we have a very 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.320
 good server 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.610
 this is nothing to lure Bucklebury knows he is now in therapy 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.730
 Already there was the possibility of a place detached from everything 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.680
 Returners Kamber do not broach this issue so flatly 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.400
 are answering 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.710
 Hannah many players denied that on Tuesday of their Festival League games 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.280
 were many influences 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.280
 which also arrived on the players 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.579
 and 2 some players think I have no problem at all and 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.469
 Wendeler would play against Buxtehude we would have no problem and for others 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.219
 Player puts food Bublé employee tan 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.680
 Incredibly many stimuli may have already been partly flooded 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.609
 Percent was "but that also means there must be deeper grace and procedure 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.369
 helps such a course 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:27.859
 the animal for the local derby is called that 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.569
 Abdullah team can also mediate 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.829
 and that we not only have the responsibility of loyalty points for the table too 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.569
 but above all, a win for the fans to get percent 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.609
 Above all, what do I think? 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.059
 Percent we can look at the tracks and so on for the up 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:46.059
 Stamford Bridge APA pay off because some players were surprised 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:51.049
 since the product in the acoustics and as far as the Englishman was lofty 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.949
 Weekends were superior and he did not come here 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.709
 for restrained what 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.900
 or what difference is under roof and so Leo cultural association that was already 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.659
 exceptionally good 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.419
 and I think so 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:08.559
 They certainly throw a gift in the form of a Turkish lounger very grateful 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:09.289
 and 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:10.920
 but demolished hangers 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.059
 to convey that to the team and that's why I do not pull it that way 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:15.109
 big waves 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.479
 I do not have that much concern 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.159
 Percent that we can not do it 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.569
 b how do you rate the next opponent first? 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.679
 who lost in the future 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:30.629
 Bruckbauer may be out of control because she is new coach 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.439
 System that talks a lot 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.439
 That is why the effect is closing 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.940
 Landau 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.220
 tactical orientation, Möller has not hidden the results 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.369
 not voting now but also 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:46.999
 it is more obvious that it is obvious that percent 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:52.829
 the hummingbird of healthy can pursue a very clear concept - and very clear ideas 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.790
 Scope and the way his team play football percent 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.289
 would like to have around 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:01.249
 for this idea but already a lusty to want at Astana 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:02.859
 Copenhagen implemented 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.169
 under current is natural 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.559
 the panty king else wants Munich or Leverkusen 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:12.319
 that's not an idea like you have percent if the results do not matter votes 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.319
 this is normal 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.389
 but I am sure 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.719
 The Olper healthy quality has one hears the automatisms 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.830
 grab automatisms trigger results 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.449
 and it should not be heard on Saturday it can be independent of it 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.529
 If I choose to speak with the near who have long been in the club 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.710
 Percent Grigoli just said my opinion no matter how Leverkusen in the weeks 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.850
 played before 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.559
 Kaka r has been able to play weeks before 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:44.759
 Pröll against Leverkusen was a carpenter Tu's game and 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.219
 Percent of the colleague is there now and you may but before too 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:52.199
 of course we try the double character 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.840
 to use around 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.030
 to distract a bit from the failures of the past few weeks and the 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.629
 To re-focus team 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.629
 what about staff at InnoScooter again vigorously 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.939
 rotate 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:07.610
 that's certainly percent 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.089
 now percent after the exhausting weeks also Bachmann nice games 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.919
 Gibson is not taking 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.530
 Peter quite justified behind and say 'come two goals 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.020
 the fresh green set every euro 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.569
 Percent of course if the players spy on Tuesday also to the limits 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.570
 We had to go the other day with the Arabs and games fresh 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.360
 To have an ambush 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.460
 and percent there are certainly percent so expect that 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.039
 the installation does not have to be like for up to EUR 1 3 1 4 2 in Bonn 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.909
 give a few more question marks 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.949
 Derdiyok with Rollator Custody 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.069
 still problems have slight problems without now definitely fail 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:50.789
 Gunter euro so petite 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.059
 show something 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:56.029
 under Katie Mitchell Mister so he 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:59.659
 the Bundeswehr is closed and whether it takes place with the help of Rome 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.080
 Here we are again 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.470
 from the fans of the young people for that put me in view of us 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.400
 Media in Zurich also come Katzenberg valves how fast you should or how 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.129
 you have a doping mentality 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:13.080
 if you take the test machines that are native to the region like 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.599
 One quickly grasps the meaning of the game for the people 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.050
 who brought forward today 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.170
 Before the game, of course, Western Copper poses with the theme when decanting 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.430
 Watch Minister pursuer there is a certain tension there 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.210
 under 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.339
 Then you sing around the flames 

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:37.300
 they know about the importance for Folsom fans and they had the fans 

00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:38.249
 game 

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:39.490
 under 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.309
 but for us it is always 

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:44.189
 Game as important as any other game I play because it is about three 

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:45.789
 Points down 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:48.590
 that is betrayal that decides that is not 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.169
 «The cookbooks 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:53.379
 the last year have played fair but again 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.399
 Places also at the penultimate 

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:57.409
 when that was very turbulent 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:58.590
 superior at high 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:59.869
 through the post 

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:03.289
 the first duel wins one percentage point in the class what is what 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:04.870
 yours from Police Atmosphere 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.870
 from this game in memory 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:10.919
 he stands 

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:12.699
 your faith I was in that 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:15.129
 but so dominant and superior 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:18.289
 but knowing percent +4 runs you have to score 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.399
 you can get foul play maybe he will 

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.369
 the goal more 

00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:24.759
 that's him 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:27.759
 thematically relied on the 2 0 relatively quickly 

00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:31.599
 sorry game lost and eleven lives and basically become around 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.899
 and I think we have 

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:37.139
 I can no longer say that Hornets could give you a double title 

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:42.229
 and in this Chris perhaps still a tribute a little bit for her 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:45.169
 to do well 

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:48.169
 Works will be motivated to go into this game 

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:53.449
 he breathed three points to keep us Sting is it Heller I play you 

00:07:54.429 --> 00:07:56.199
 I think 

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:59.279
 we have found ours good in the last few weeks we have 

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:02.990
 in the Bundesliga when I showed the good performance 

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.879
 and then it becomes easier Walsmann
