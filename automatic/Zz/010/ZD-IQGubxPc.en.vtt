all<00:04:15.120> those<00:04:15.269> chances<00:04:15.660> are<00:04:15.780> still<00:04:15.959> being<00:04:16.109> a

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
all those chances are still being a

publicly come out and said that second

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.939 
publicly come out and said that second
driver<00:04:29.210> Felipe<00:04:29.690> Massa<00:04:29.960> needs<00:04:30.350> to<00:04:30.590> do<00:04:30.710> a<00:04:30.740> lot

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949

better<00:04:31.160> that<00:04:32.090> suggests<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.539> me<00:04:32.630> that<00:04:32.750> he's

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
better that suggests to me that he's

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.330 
better that suggests to me that he's
probably<00:04:33.199> out<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.590> door<00:04:33.800> come<00:04:34.009> the<00:04:34.130> end<00:04:34.160> of

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
probably out the door come the end of

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.460 
probably out the door come the end of
the<00:04:34.430> season<00:04:34.639> there's<00:04:35.419> an<00:04:35.600> opportunity<00:04:35.810> for

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
go at a big team as a second driver like

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.529 
go at a big team as a second driver like
Paul<00:04:43.669> di<00:04:43.880> Resta<00:04:43.910> at<00:04:44.509> force<00:04:44.840> india<00:04:45.520> so<00:04:46.539> two

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
Paul di Resta at force india so two

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.719 
Paul di Resta at force india so two
people<00:04:47.750> there<00:04:48.199> possibly<00:04:48.860> a<00:04:49.070> few<00:04:49.280> others<00:04:49.580> as

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
people there possibly a few others as

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.820 
people there possibly a few others as
well<00:04:49.910> we'll<00:04:50.330> be<00:04:50.539> looking<00:04:50.690> to<00:04:50.990> try<00:04:51.199> and<00:04:51.500> do

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
well we'll be looking to try and do

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.189 
well we'll be looking to try and do
better<00:04:52.100> than<00:04:52.880> Felipe<00:04:53.360> Massa<00:04:53.600> does<00:04:53.870> in<00:04:54.050> this

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
better than Felipe Massa does in this

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.080 
better than Felipe Massa does in this
race<00:04:54.440> so<00:04:55.070> for<00:04:55.280> some<00:04:55.430> of<00:04:55.520> them<00:04:55.610> it's<00:04:55.669> not<00:04:55.789> just

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
race so for some of them it's not just

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.850 
race so for some of them it's not just
gonna<00:04:56.180> be<00:04:56.240> a<00:04:56.330> case<00:04:56.720> of<00:04:56.750> how<00:04:57.410> close<00:04:57.680> to<00:04:57.710> the

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
gonna be a case of how close to the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.710 
gonna be a case of how close to the
