basically it I'm sure you've already
dealt<00:00:12.929> with<00:00:13.049> rhythm<00:00:13.440> but<00:00:13.620> rhythm<00:00:14.009> it's<00:00:14.549> an

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
dealt with rhythm but rhythm it's an

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.080 
dealt with rhythm but rhythm it's an
important<00:00:15.179> aspect<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.929> playing<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.470> flute

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
important aspect of playing the flute

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.970 
important aspect of playing the flute
rhythm<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:20.119> generated<00:00:21.119> with<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.980> staccato

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
rhythm is generated with a staccato

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.700 
rhythm is generated with a staccato
style<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.699> play<00:00:24.000> okay<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.289> doesn't<00:00:25.320> mean

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
style of play okay but that doesn't mean

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.710 
style of play okay but that doesn't mean
it<00:00:25.920> has<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.369> harsh<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:27.119> doesn't<00:00:27.390> mean<00:00:27.539> it

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
it has to be harsh it doesn't mean it

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.070 
it has to be harsh it doesn't mean it
has<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.930> be<00:00:28.640> loud<00:00:29.640> because<00:00:30.510> there<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.900> such<00:00:31.050> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
has to be loud because there is such a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.810 
has to be loud because there is such a
thing<00:00:31.289> as<00:00:31.380> too<00:00:31.500> slower<00:00:31.769> them<00:00:32.070> there's<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.579> fast

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
thing as too slower them there's a fast

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.240 
thing as too slower them there's a fast
rhythm<00:00:33.239> there's<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.480> hard<00:00:33.750> rhythm<00:00:34.170> okay<00:00:34.649> but

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
rhythm there's a hard rhythm okay but

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.229 
rhythm there's a hard rhythm okay but
rhythms<00:00:35.610> are<00:00:35.880> basically<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.110> flute<00:00:37.380> are

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
rhythms are basically in the flute are

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.819 
rhythms are basically in the flute are
generated<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.600> your<00:00:39.809> tongue<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.469> very

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
generated with your tongue it's a very

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.729 
generated with your tongue it's a very
very<00:00:41.250> subtle<00:00:41.730> technique<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.260> beginning

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
very subtle technique in the beginning

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.650 
very subtle technique in the beginning
when<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.430> remember<00:00:44.850> when<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.030> first<00:00:45.239> started<00:00:45.570> to

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
when I remember when I first started to

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.420 
when I remember when I first started to
play<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:46.140> wasn't<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.770> didn't<00:00:47.039> sound<00:00:47.219> very

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
play it wasn't it didn't sound very

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:56.689 
play it wasn't it didn't sound very
subtle<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.090> know<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.390> more<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:54.949> okay<00:00:55.949> now

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
subtle you know it's more that okay now

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.240 
subtle you know it's more that okay now
what<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.390> found<00:00:57.690> over<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.140> years<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.980> more<00:00:59.190> I

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
what I found over the years the more I

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.000 
what I found over the years the more I
play<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.000> more<00:01:00.300> subtle<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.559> tonguing

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
play the more subtle that that tonguing

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.889 
play the more subtle that that tonguing
becomes<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.120> has<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.660> subtle

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
becomes and it has to be subtle

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.539 
becomes and it has to be subtle
especially<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.650> play<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> low<00:01:05.309> note

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
especially if you play on the low note

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:13.330 
especially if you play on the low note
because<00:01:06.330> if<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.600> tongue<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.140> low<00:01:07.320> note<00:01:07.350> hard

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.010 

blows<00:01:14.340> goes<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.970> next<00:01:15.210> octave<00:01:15.360> okay<00:01:15.960> so

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
blows goes to the next octave okay so

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.679 
blows goes to the next octave okay so
you<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.560> subtle<00:01:16.770> with<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.600> we<00:01:18.600> have

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
you have to be subtle with it so we have

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.899 
you have to be subtle with it so we have
no<00:01:18.840> choice<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:20.040> subtle<00:01:20.400> with<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.700> with

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
no choice but to be subtle with it with

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.850 
no choice but to be subtle with it with
the<00:01:21.030> tonguing<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> beauty<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the tonguing but the beauty of the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.550 
the tonguing but the beauty of the
tonguing<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.119> gives<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> time<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
tonguing is that it gives you a time to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:40.929 
tonguing is that it gives you a time to
the<00:01:25.590> song<00:01:25.920> Dada<00:01:26.700> Dada<00:01:27.270> Dada<00:01:28.110> down<00:01:28.759> there<00:01:29.759> dad

and<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.899> more<00:01:43.170> subtle<00:01:43.469> the<00:01:43.710> better<00:01:49.250> listen<00:01:50.250> to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and the more subtle the better listen to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:03.800 
and the more subtle the better listen to
the<00:01:50.369> difference<00:01:50.729> without<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> tonguing

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.080 

okay<00:02:04.810> both<00:02:05.350> of<00:02:05.380> alak<00:02:06.039> to<00:02:06.159> play<00:02:06.369> without<00:02:06.549> tongue

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
okay both of alak to play without tongue

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.859 
okay both of alak to play without tongue
without<00:02:07.659> rhythm<00:02:07.869> or<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.739> play<00:02:09.750> let<00:02:10.750> the

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
without rhythm or to play let the

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.530 
without rhythm or to play let the
fingering<00:02:11.379> I<00:02:11.650> should<00:02:12.160> say<00:02:12.340> let<00:02:12.879> the<00:02:13.000> fingering

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
fingering I should say let the fingering

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.330 
fingering I should say let the fingering
to<00:02:13.690> create<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.110> rhythm<00:02:16.650> or<00:02:17.650> allow<00:02:18.280> the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
to create the rhythm or allow the

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.890 
to create the rhythm or allow the
fingering<00:02:18.879> and<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.269> tongue<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.660> do<00:02:19.810> the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
fingering and the tongue to do the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.289 
fingering and the tongue to do the
rhythm<00:02:20.170> but<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.950> does<00:02:24.129> it<00:02:24.430> takes<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.849> note<00:02:24.940> and

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
rhythm but it does it takes the note and

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.300 
rhythm but it does it takes the note and
brings<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.080> again<00:02:26.379> and<00:02:26.799> we<00:02:26.920> talked<00:02:27.160> about

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
brings it again and we talked about

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.150 
brings it again and we talked about
earlier<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.940> brings<00:02:28.239> it<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:29.200> its<00:02:29.319> peak<00:02:29.620> by

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
earlier it brings it to its peak by

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.940 
earlier it brings it to its peak by
tonguing<00:02:30.640> okay<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:32.260> generates<00:02:32.769> the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
tonguing okay and that generates the

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.309 
tonguing okay and that generates the
rhythm<00:02:33.250> now<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.329> aspect<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:34.930> rhythm

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
rhythm now the the aspect of rhythm

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.199 
rhythm now the the aspect of rhythm
you'll<00:02:35.890> find<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.459> if<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.730> do<00:02:36.849> a<00:02:36.879> combination

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
you'll find is if you do a combination

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.530 
you'll find is if you do a combination
of<00:02:37.810> both<00:02:38.019> of<00:02:38.349> rhythm<00:02:39.160> rhythmic<00:02:39.940> tonguing<00:02:40.360> and

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
of both of rhythm rhythmic tonguing and

00:02:40.540 --> 00:03:04.710 
of both of rhythm rhythmic tonguing and
finger<00:02:41.170> rhythm

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.630 

if<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:05.709> heard<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:05.980> difference<00:03:06.129> on<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.430> high

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
if you heard the difference on the high

just<00:03:12.340> did<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.910> breathing<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.390> allowed<00:03:13.660> the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
just did the breathing and allowed the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.290 
just did the breathing and allowed the
fingering<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.319> do<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.620> do<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.190> rhythms<00:03:15.519> so

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
fingering to do it do the rhythms so

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.110 
fingering to do it do the rhythms so
rhythms<00:03:16.750> are<00:03:16.989> important<00:03:17.530> but<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.670> armature

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
rhythms are important but the armature

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.460 
rhythms are important but the armature
that<00:03:19.269> we<00:03:19.360> talked<00:03:19.599> about<00:03:19.690> earlier<00:03:20.200> in<00:03:20.319> regards

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
that we talked about earlier in regards

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.410 
that we talked about earlier in regards
to<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.980> moisture<00:03:21.400> control<00:03:22.349> really<00:03:23.349> plays<00:03:23.739> a

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
to the moisture control really plays a

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.870 
to the moisture control really plays a
big<00:03:25.420> aspect<00:03:25.900> of<00:03:26.200> creating<00:03:26.890> a<00:03:27.010> nice<00:03:27.280> tonguing

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
big aspect of creating a nice tonguing

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.390 
big aspect of creating a nice tonguing
effect<00:03:28.269> when<00:03:28.989> you<00:03:29.140> can<00:03:29.319> control<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.920> opening

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
effect when you can control the opening

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.330 
effect when you can control the opening
of<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.700> flute<00:03:30.970> with<00:03:31.209> your<00:03:31.360> lips<00:03:31.980> your<00:03:32.980> tongue

air<00:03:35.500> that<00:03:35.650> go<00:03:35.799> through<00:03:36.160> become<00:03:36.790> much<00:03:37.030> more

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
air that go through become much more

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.910 
air that go through become much more
subtle<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:37.930> they've<00:03:38.260> become<00:03:38.380> much<00:03:38.680> more

all<00:03:45.190> of<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:47.049> habits<00:03:47.530> that<00:03:47.650> we've<00:03:47.890> learned

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
all of the the habits that we've learned

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.710 
all of the the habits that we've learned
in<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.519> beginning<00:03:48.640> when<00:03:49.120> we<00:03:49.150> first<00:03:49.450> learned

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
in the beginning when we first learned

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.809 
in the beginning when we first learned
to<00:03:49.840> play<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.140> flute<00:03:50.319> we<00:03:50.980> tend<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.400> get<00:03:51.549> stuck

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
to play the flute we tend to get stuck

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.910 
to play the flute we tend to get stuck
with<00:03:51.849> those<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.450> I<00:03:52.510> don't<00:03:52.540> mean<00:03:52.900> stuck<00:03:53.260> in<00:03:53.590> a

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
with those and I don't mean stuck in a

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.440 
with those and I don't mean stuck in a
bad<00:03:54.130> way<00:03:54.370> I<00:03:54.400> mean<00:03:54.610> we<00:03:54.760> just<00:03:54.940> tend<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.239> do<00:03:55.360> it

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
bad way I mean we just tend to do it

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.710 
bad way I mean we just tend to do it
automatically<00:03:56.110> over<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.530> over<00:03:56.769> again<00:03:57.030> so<00:03:58.030> now

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
automatically over and over again so now

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.539 
automatically over and over again so now
when<00:03:58.989> you<00:03:59.079> have<00:03:59.319> to<00:03:59.440> make<00:03:59.590> changes<00:04:00.099> your<00:04:00.400> are

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
when you have to make changes your are

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:01.830 
when you have to make changes your are
going<00:04:00.670> to<00:04:00.760> have<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:00.970> be<00:04:01.030> very<00:04:01.209> conscious<00:04:01.720> about

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
going to have to be very conscious about

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.509 
going to have to be very conscious about
making<00:04:02.319> those<00:04:02.440> changes<00:04:02.650> whenever<00:04:03.130> you<00:04:03.280> play

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
making those changes whenever you play

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.819 
making those changes whenever you play
but<00:04:04.030> they're<00:04:04.180> beneficial<00:04:04.630> and<00:04:04.989> if<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:05.590> never

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
but they're beneficial and if you never

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.650 
but they're beneficial and if you never
use<00:04:06.069> them<00:04:06.310> it's<00:04:06.459> still<00:04:06.700> a<00:04:06.730> good<00:04:07.000> thing<00:04:07.060> to

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
use them it's still a good thing to

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.940 
use them it's still a good thing to
learn<00:04:07.840> it's<00:04:08.109> it's<00:04:08.319> just<00:04:08.590> getting<00:04:08.829> to<00:04:08.920> know

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950

lot more flexibility in how to play and
the<00:04:15.790> other<00:04:15.940> aspect<00:04:16.419> to<00:04:16.450> that<00:04:16.539> of<00:04:16.900> rhythm<00:04:17.289> is

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
the other aspect to that of rhythm is

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.039 
the other aspect to that of rhythm is
the<00:04:17.979> vibrato<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.940> I<00:04:19.479> have<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:19.720> tell<00:04:19.959> you

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
the vibrato and I have to tell you

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.170 
the vibrato and I have to tell you
teaching<00:04:20.859> my<00:04:21.130> bharata<00:04:21.400> has<00:04:21.609> been<00:04:21.729> like<00:04:21.910> one<00:04:21.940> of

teaching my bharata has been like one of

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.350 
teaching my bharata has been like one of
the<00:04:22.240> hardest<00:04:22.419> things<00:04:22.840> for<00:04:23.080> me<00:04:23.470> to<00:04:23.590> do<00:04:23.830> but

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
the hardest things for me to do but

the hardest things for me to do but
finally<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:25.450> spoke<00:04:26.229> to<00:04:26.380> a<00:04:26.789> voice<00:04:27.789> teacher<00:04:28.120> a

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
started to give me a couple of exercises

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.710 
started to give me a couple of exercises
in<00:04:33.310> terms<00:04:33.520> of<00:04:33.669> how<00:04:33.789> she<00:04:33.850> teaches<00:04:34.479> because

right<00:05:01.270> here<00:05:01.570> and<00:05:01.720> just<00:05:01.770> rest<00:05:02.770> it<00:05:02.950> there<00:05:02.979> and

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
right here and just rest it there and

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.130 
right here and just rest it there and
then<00:05:03.310> go<00:05:05.910> you'll<00:05:06.910> notice<00:05:07.300> it's<00:05:07.510> moving<00:05:07.930> your

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
then go you'll notice it's moving your

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.779 
then go you'll notice it's moving your
diaphragm<00:05:08.409> is<00:05:08.740> moving<00:05:09.039> back<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:09.400> forth<00:05:09.640> when

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
diaphragm is moving back and forth when

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.019 
diaphragm is moving back and forth when
you<00:05:09.849> do<00:05:10.030> that<00:05:10.210> every

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:12.029 
you do that every

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:20.600 
you do that every
now<00:05:13.029> if<00:05:13.240> you<00:05:13.360> do<00:05:13.539> that<00:05:13.689> into<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.139> flute

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:33.029 

continually<00:05:30.479> okay<00:05:31.479> first<00:05:31.929> feel<00:05:32.349> it<00:05:32.499> so<00:05:32.979> you

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
continually okay first feel it so you

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.489 
continually okay first feel it so you
could<00:05:33.249> do<00:05:33.369> it<00:05:33.490> very<00:05:34.059> easily<00:05:34.330> by<00:05:34.959> just<00:05:34.990> putting

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:35.499 
could do it very easily by just putting

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:36.749 
could do it very easily by just putting
your<00:05:35.559> hand<00:05:35.770> in<00:05:35.860> front<00:05:35.949> of<00:05:36.039> your<00:05:36.189> mouth<00:05:36.279> and<00:05:36.580> put

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 
your hand in front of your mouth and put

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.339 
your hand in front of your mouth and put
your<00:05:36.849> hand<00:05:37.089> in<00:05:37.209> front<00:05:37.360> so<00:05:37.599> you<00:05:37.659> can<00:05:37.809> feel<00:05:38.110> the

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
your hand in front so you can feel the

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:44.339 
your hand in front so you can feel the
diaphragm<00:05:38.860> okay<00:05:39.550> and<00:05:39.879> then<00:05:42.959> you'll<00:05:43.959> feel<00:05:44.169> it

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
diaphragm okay and then you'll feel it

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.670 
diaphragm okay and then you'll feel it
move<00:05:44.499> that<00:05:45.279> down<00:05:45.399> it<00:05:45.819> just<00:05:45.879> moves<00:05:46.300> on<00:05:46.509> you<00:05:46.680> when

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
move that down it just moves on you when

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.439 
move that down it just moves on you when
you<00:05:47.770> do<00:05:47.889> that<00:05:48.039> into<00:05:48.249> the<00:05:48.369> flute<00:05:48.580> and<00:05:48.789> you<00:05:48.849> first

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
you do that into the flute and you first

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.029 
you do that into the flute and you first
start<00:05:49.749> to<00:05:49.809> do<00:05:50.020> it<00:05:50.169> what<00:05:50.589> winds<00:05:50.919> up<00:05:50.979> happening

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
start to do it what winds up happening

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.119 
start to do it what winds up happening
is<00:05:51.550> it<00:05:51.729> becomes<00:05:52.089> it's<00:05:52.749> very<00:05:53.139> it's<00:05:53.860> kind<00:05:54.009> of<00:05:54.039> a

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:54.129 
is it becomes it's very it's kind of a

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:57.019 
is it becomes it's very it's kind of a
harsh<00:05:54.430> vibrato<00:05:54.939> but<00:05:55.569> that's<00:05:55.779> a<00:05:55.930> good<00:05:56.169> start

00:05:57.019 --> 00:05:57.029 
harsh vibrato but that's a good start

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:59.579 
harsh vibrato but that's a good start
just<00:05:58.029> keep<00:05:58.300> doing<00:05:58.479> it<00:05:58.719> all<00:05:58.930> of<00:05:59.050> a<00:05:59.110> sudden<00:05:59.439> one

00:05:59.579 --> 00:05:59.589 
just keep doing it all of a sudden one

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:01.290 
just keep doing it all of a sudden one
day<00:05:59.680> you're<00:05:59.800> gonna<00:05:59.860> go<00:06:00.039> wow<00:06:00.249> that<00:06:00.639> sounds<00:06:00.999> that

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
day you're gonna go wow that sounds that

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.299 
day you're gonna go wow that sounds that
was<00:06:01.479> really<00:06:01.809> subtle<00:06:02.229> I<00:06:02.529> was<00:06:02.680> able<00:06:02.800> to<00:06:02.919> do<00:06:03.039> it<00:06:03.159> it

00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:03.309 
was really subtle I was able to do it it

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:05.040 
was really subtle I was able to do it it
just<00:06:03.369> comes<00:06:03.789> to<00:06:04.029> you<00:06:04.119> what<00:06:04.539> you're<00:06:04.719> doing<00:06:04.930> is

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
just comes to you what you're doing is

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.070 
just comes to you what you're doing is
you're<00:06:05.199> getting<00:06:05.379> your<00:06:06.039> diaphragm<00:06:06.459> and<00:06:07.080> your

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
you're getting your diaphragm and your

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.350 
you're getting your diaphragm and your
mental<00:06:08.409> process<00:06:08.889> used<00:06:09.219> to<00:06:09.429> doing<00:06:09.819> that<00:06:09.939> into

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
mental process used to doing that into

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:32.069 
mental process used to doing that into
the<00:06:10.479> flute<00:06:10.719> but<00:06:11.559> start<00:06:11.919> with<00:06:12.099> that

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:32.079 

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:34.899 

and<00:06:33.079> what<00:06:33.469> will<00:06:33.619> happen<00:06:33.799> is<00:06:34.159> over<00:06:34.459> a<00:06:34.489> period<00:06:34.759> of

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:34.909 
and what will happen is over a period of

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:38.019 
and what will happen is over a period of
time<00:06:35.149> the<00:06:36.019> vibrato<00:06:36.469> becomes<00:06:36.949> very<00:06:37.429> subtle<00:06:37.879> you

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:38.029 
time the vibrato becomes very subtle you

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:40.029 
time the vibrato becomes very subtle you
won't<00:06:38.299> even<00:06:38.419> be<00:06:38.569> conscious<00:06:38.839> of<00:06:39.229> it<00:06:39.379> but<00:06:39.889> it'll

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 
won't even be conscious of it but it'll

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:42.069 
won't even be conscious of it but it'll
become<00:06:40.249> so<00:06:40.639> subtle<00:06:40.909> that<00:06:41.149> people<00:06:41.419> go<00:06:41.599> how<00:06:42.019> do

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:42.079 
become so subtle that people go how do

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:44.259 
become so subtle that people go how do
you<00:06:42.199> do<00:06:42.409> that<00:06:42.589> how<00:06:42.949> are<00:06:43.009> you<00:06:43.099> doing<00:06:43.369> that<00:06:43.519> that

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:44.269 
you do that how are you doing that that

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:46.589 
you do that how are you doing that that
that<00:06:44.299> that's<00:06:45.289> fluttering<00:06:45.889> in<00:06:46.039> the<00:06:46.069> sound

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:46.599 
that that's fluttering in the sound

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:49.569 
that that's fluttering in the sound
because<00:06:47.599> you<00:06:47.689> become<00:06:47.989> very<00:06:48.199> unconscious<00:06:49.159> of

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:49.579 
because you become very unconscious of

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:51.069 
because you become very unconscious of
actually<00:06:49.939> creating<00:06:50.299> it<00:06:50.359> and<00:06:50.539> the<00:06:50.629> subtlety

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:51.079 
actually creating it and the subtlety

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:53.169 
actually creating it and the subtlety
will<00:06:51.319> become<00:06:51.619> unconscious<00:06:52.279> in<00:06:52.459> the<00:06:52.789> beginning

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:53.179 
will become unconscious in the beginning

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:55.329 
will become unconscious in the beginning
what<00:06:53.719> will<00:06:53.839> happen<00:06:54.169> is<00:06:54.289> you're<00:06:54.889> gonna<00:06:55.039> it's

what will happen is you're gonna it's

00:06:55.339 --> 00:07:03.249 
what will happen is you're gonna it's
going<00:06:55.549> to<00:06:55.639> be<00:06:55.699> much<00:06:55.879> harsher<00:07:01.209> okay<00:07:02.209> and<00:07:02.419> don't

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:03.259 
going to be much harsher okay and don't

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:05.259 
going to be much harsher okay and don't
get<00:07:03.379> discouraged<00:07:03.919> just<00:07:04.219> continue<00:07:04.759> to<00:07:04.789> do<00:07:05.059> that

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:05.269 
get discouraged just continue to do that

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:07.659 
get discouraged just continue to do that
now<00:07:05.779> some<00:07:06.709> of<00:07:06.739> the<00:07:06.889> things<00:07:07.099> that<00:07:07.339> I've<00:07:07.429> seen

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:07.669 
now some of the things that I've seen

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:10.869 
now some of the things that I've seen
that<00:07:07.729> you<00:07:07.999> want<00:07:08.269> to<00:07:08.419> avoid<00:07:08.749> is<00:07:09.049> who<00:07:10.039> is<00:07:10.339> is<00:07:10.729> to

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:10.879 
that you want to avoid is who is is to

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:14.139 
that you want to avoid is who is is to
go<00:07:11.739> that's<00:07:12.739> not<00:07:13.009> a<00:07:13.069> vibrato<00:07:13.489> what<00:07:13.969> you're

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:14.149 
go that's not a vibrato what you're

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:18.039 
go that's not a vibrato what you're
doing<00:07:14.389> is<00:07:14.539> you're<00:07:14.689> blowing<00:07:15.579> or<00:07:16.719> I've<00:07:17.719> seen

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:18.049 
doing is you're blowing or I've seen

00:07:18.049 --> 00:07:20.289 
doing is you're blowing or I've seen
where<00:07:18.369> flute<00:07:19.369> players<00:07:19.579> will<00:07:19.789> take<00:07:19.939> the<00:07:20.089> flute

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:20.299 
where flute players will take the flute

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:23.709 
where flute players will take the flute
and<00:07:20.419> go<00:07:21.969> and<00:07:22.969> what<00:07:23.119> they're<00:07:23.239> doing<00:07:23.269> is<00:07:23.629> they're

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:23.719 
and go and what they're doing is they're

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:24.879 
and go and what they're doing is they're
just<00:07:23.899> moving<00:07:24.019> the<00:07:24.259> instrument<00:07:24.679> they're<00:07:24.769> not

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:24.889 
just moving the instrument they're not

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:26.499 
just moving the instrument they're not
creating<00:07:25.189> a<00:07:25.249> vibrato<00:07:25.579> it's<00:07:25.909> a<00:07:25.999> physical

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:26.509 
creating a vibrato it's a physical

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:34.389 
creating a vibrato it's a physical
process<00:07:26.719> with<00:07:27.169> the<00:07:27.259> instrument<00:07:33.159> what's<00:07:34.159> very

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:34.399 
process with the instrument what's very

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:37.209 
process with the instrument what's very
important<00:07:34.939> is<00:07:35.089> that<00:07:35.899> we<00:07:36.379> make<00:07:36.559> sure<00:07:36.589> that<00:07:36.860> the

00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:37.219 
important is that we make sure that the

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:39.459 
important is that we make sure that the
the<00:07:37.429> vibrato<00:07:38.149> is<00:07:38.539> generated<00:07:39.199> from<00:07:39.289> the

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:39.469 
the vibrato is generated from the

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:42.069 
the vibrato is generated from the
diaphragm<00:07:39.799> okay<00:07:40.369> all<00:07:41.239> the<00:07:41.479> other<00:07:41.599> techniques

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:42.079 
diaphragm okay all the other techniques

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:44.350 
diaphragm okay all the other techniques
in<00:07:42.379> terms<00:07:42.619> of<00:07:42.829> creating<00:07:43.309> other<00:07:43.610> types<00:07:44.119> of

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360 
in terms of creating other types of

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.079 
in terms of creating other types of
vibrato<00:07:44.749> are<00:07:45.019> fine<00:07:45.259> but<00:07:45.919> you<00:07:46.519> do<00:07:46.729> want<00:07:46.969> to

00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:47.089 
vibrato are fine but you do want to

00:07:47.089 --> 00:07:49.809 
vibrato are fine but you do want to
practice<00:07:47.539> the<00:07:48.289> vibrato<00:07:48.739> from<00:07:49.279> the<00:07:49.519> diaphragm

00:07:49.809 --> 00:07:49.819 
practice the vibrato from the diaphragm

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:51.219 
practice the vibrato from the diaphragm
the<00:07:49.999> reason<00:07:50.389> I<00:07:50.449> say<00:07:50.629> that<00:07:50.659> it<00:07:50.869> because<00:07:51.079> it's

00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:51.229 
the reason I say that it because it's

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:54.279 
the reason I say that it because it's
much<00:07:51.379> more<00:07:51.559> subtle<00:07:52.009> it's<00:07:52.239> it<00:07:53.239> has<00:07:53.269> more<00:07:53.839> of<00:07:54.139> a

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:54.289 
much more subtle it's it has more of a

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:55.839 
much more subtle it's it has more of a
subtlety<00:07:54.649> to<00:07:54.739> it<00:07:54.949> that<00:07:55.249> you<00:07:55.369> go<00:07:55.519> you're<00:07:55.699> going

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:55.849 
subtlety to it that you go you're going

00:07:55.849 --> 00:07:59.679 
subtlety to it that you go you're going
to<00:07:55.909> wind<00:07:56.119> up<00:07:56.209> using<00:07:56.389> later<00:07:56.719> on<00:07:56.809> in<00:07:57.110> many<00:07:57.319> songs
