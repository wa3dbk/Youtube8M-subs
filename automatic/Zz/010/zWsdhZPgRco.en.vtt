00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.880
 but the first thing that comes to mind 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.580
 ask yourself about this new mondeo 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.250
 it's like going out to communicate it if they come 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.900
 by the car as focus or party and this 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.730
 is a segment to a market a little bit 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.500
 above but still with a very car 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.570
 modern what is the strategy ways 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.750
 alerts and the truth that they are multiple 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.250
 the channels or clearly the field 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.620
 has as a priority to be a 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.360
 niche vehicle obviously appeals 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.489
 first to the entire sales history of 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.530
 the brand with the customers of the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.059
 dealerships the titles of the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.850
 officials are referents each 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.890
 within their locations locations in 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.230
 the ones that move this added up with a 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.280
 strategy pretty strong in terms 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.500
 of the use of the channels 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.570
 digital and I do not do not mean are the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.010
 social networks but also marketing 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.620
 direct digital or really be 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.810
 we try to be very sharp say 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.090
 when choosing the recipient of the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.230
 communication but of course trying 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.690
 of 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.120
 give recognition to the brand and to 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.820
 model that in some sense also 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.320
 exceed the market niche because all 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.370
 the vehicles have two roles the role 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.600
 own communication and results 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.430
 within its segment that also has 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.300
 a role that complements the primary brand 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.550
 and let's say this a role of the ford brand 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.380
 remains to be revitalized and good 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.000
 clearly the mondeo is one of the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.320
 vehicles that attract more in this sense 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.460
 with which it is envisaged 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.350
 communication campaign if you want a 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.030
 little more traditional with many spotlights 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.970
 about everything digital and good the page 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.710
 web are multiple resources and forms of 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.510
 bring information from a vehicle like 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.400
 well you said a lot of equipment a lot 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.520
 technology that needs to be explained 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.220
 let's say it's not easy to transfer everything 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.020
 that to the final consumer if it really does not 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.370
 we are interested good justly if 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.300
 it seems to you one of the platforms you can 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.100
 to root part about mykey system 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.899
 and a little bit to talk about the system without 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.130
 that although it is created in several is 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.980
 available at party maybe with less 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.690
 this less knowledge but definitive 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.830
 it is a device too 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.650
 electronic of a configuration that what 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.390
 what it does is one can set one of 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.840
 the keys of the main vehicle but 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.770
 the second key with certain not yes 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.230
 the word are restrictions or 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.090
 configurations this typically when 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.740
 one lends the car to his son 73 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.570
 wants to make certain patagones 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.850
 this behavior as can be a 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.380
 maximum speed as it may not 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.460
 have the ability to turn on the audio on 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.750
 audio system if you did not put the belt 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.680
 of security the inability to 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.600
 disable devices like control 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.720
 of traction in counter stability are 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.820
 little things this but good again 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.480
 the idea is to offer a small value 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.849
 aggregate 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.870
 that may result let's say in a better 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.340
 vocation of choosing the model but 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.659
 also a relationship of the brand with the 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.790
 people because the idea that you're 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.080
 technologies end up drilling the range 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.430
 that is, it is not something typical of a model 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.950
 but as I mentioned you is also in 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.260
 the party the idea is we have like the 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.519
 vocation in recent years and the 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.019
 launch 100 pictorially by the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.340
 prodigal of from the strategy of 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.650
 one for the big global platforms 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.170
 to bring a lot of technology to places 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.360
 where typically we got to say 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.190
 some way try to democratize from 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.140
 put it to accessible values ​​and good 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.549
 part of those this has to be thinking 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.950
 How nice to be able to go out with your friends and 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.120
 a mondeo but that's another story for 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.160
 start asking about the 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.200
 expectations of fort masters no doubt 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.379
 some before the flagship marks me 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.510
 what are the expectations in a year a 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.069
 bit weird for and for presented a car 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.920
 of this caliber in case the time of 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.519
 presents a challenge like everything but 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.769
 we understand we have a proposal 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.239
 extremely interesting for the consumer 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.410
 Argentine where from the hand of the 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.900
 product that we understand is what 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.519
 sufficiently differentiated to the strong 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.330
 we really understand the product is 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.150
 very 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.480
 They may also be you who the 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.610
 end up evaluating on your own but 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.410
 this configured with a proposal of 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.850
 value in the product price combination 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.950
 that we think is also extremely 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.350
 differential in this case the vehicle 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.960
 comes from the Hermosillo plant in Mexico 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.760
 and that in essence this global strategy 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.200
 of putting global products in many 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.180
 plants allows us for example in this 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.130
 case take advantage of the agreement 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.400
 bilateral that we have with mexico and 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.080
 avoid what is traditionally 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.220
 increase the area of extra vehicles 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.220
 zone and it allows us to press this 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.030
 vehicle a price band this 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.120
 differentiator to not then we understand 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.860
 that the product price combination 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.390
 we really understand not after the 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.220
 market will verify it but we understand 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.070
 that is superior when it comes to thinking 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.410
 from the origin this new mondeo how much 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.240
 weight the design in as argument of 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.100
 sale we are particularly in 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.540
 Argentina in a segment in which its 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.850
 competitors have a couple of years 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.260
 over how much this new design weighs 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.060
 that also ford will always be explained that 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.830
 the magnetic holder and saint very good 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.139
 designs clearly the design is one of 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.030
 the 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.099
 main factors decision to purchase 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.960
 we like to say that it has been simplified 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.719
 a little bit of what is not read literally but 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.610
 one first first have that contact 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:14.029
 visual where the vehicle really does 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.199
 attracts and wants to know represented and 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:17.499
 then look for a bunch of arguments 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.819
 rational to finish convincing 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:22.159
 although it is not so well because obviously 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.689
 certain premium segments plus some 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:26.779
 value component or some component 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:28.340
 of equipment or certain profiles 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:30.590
 of users but if the design is 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.960
 clearly a role has a role 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.360
 determinant and in that sense maybe there 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.330
 it can be said that it exceeds the application 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.699
 to mondeo the language design of the young 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.129
 has tics design has really fulfilled 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.370
 more than let's say that role being 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:48.379
 really highlighted by people as a 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.029
 very attractive design language that what 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.979
 We verify on foot they are incorporated 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:53.839
 fire that really the world is not the 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.909
 exception I had the opportunity to 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:59.029
 try it a bit through the streets of the 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:02.580
 city ​​and the vehicle generates that that 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:04.199
 let's say let's say this atypical maybe 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.939
 and we really understand that it's something that 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:07.530
 new mondeo good differential 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:10.259
 transports a new good room 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.699
 aires- I ask you your expectations aya 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.949
 obviously worlds where you'll be 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.300
 the star of fort stand and by 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.949
 last wondered how can you not another 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.750
 way what is the expectation for the 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:19.979
 2015 with all the news we know 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.069
 that they are going to have to intuit that no 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:25.409
 we can move forward but the question 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:27.479
 that is, in the industry of the salon year 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:28.770
 it's a special year it's a party 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:30.930
 it really is an extremely event 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.520
 significant where the truth one 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.870
 can offer to people or so 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.190
 least to inform people 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.349
 everything that does not do everything one 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.000
 offers all the product offer and 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:42.150
 Well there are clearly focused 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.949
 This year's efforts are a little short 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.319
 the molding will be one of the 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:48.479
 definitive protagonists of that space 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:49.860
 and we are very confident very confident in 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.900
 that people leave very happy 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.500
 stand knowing new things why 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.569
 we can not yet mention but 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.300
 ratifying a way this way of the 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:03.750
 global platforms of this performance 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:06.569
 of the brand looking at 2015 as I 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.919
 you were telling the truth that we came two years ago 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:08.560
 years of a market share 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:12.790
 close 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:15.160
 to 12 6% 26 of 2013 in fact already 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.440
 approaching figures close to 14 8 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.870
 almost 15 participation points in what 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.520
 that goes of the year I am really very 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.139
 happy and seeing that all this that you 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.010
 mentioned was going to be verified in the 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:25.810
 user preferences 

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.840
 well, thank you very much many 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.840
 Thank you 

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.010
 ah 

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.080
 ah 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.040
 ah 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.169
 ah
