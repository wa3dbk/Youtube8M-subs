00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.309 

I<00:03:33.319> think<00:03:34.250> when<00:03:34.970> you<00:03:35.120> start<00:03:35.420> out<00:03:35.599> in<00:03:35.780> modeling<00:03:36.200> I

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
I think when you start out in modeling I

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.009 
I think when you start out in modeling I
think<00:03:36.560> because<00:03:37.250> mainly<00:03:38.239> girls<00:03:38.510> start<00:03:38.870> when

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
think because mainly girls start when

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.300 
think because mainly girls start when
they're<00:03:39.170> really<00:03:39.349> very<00:03:39.620> young<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.129> I<00:03:40.159> think

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
they're really very young and I think

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.759 
they're really very young and I think
the<00:03:40.519> most<00:03:40.700> important<00:03:41.209> thing<00:03:41.420> is<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.349> do<00:03:42.530> finish

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
the most important thing is to do finish

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.920 
the most important thing is to do finish
your<00:03:42.890> school<00:03:43.310> before<00:03:44.299> you<00:03:44.480> start<00:03:44.750> like

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
your school before you start like

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.979 
your school before you start like
working<00:03:45.920> full-time<00:03:46.190> because<00:03:46.670> otherwise<00:03:47.629> work

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
working full-time because otherwise work

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.979 
working full-time because otherwise work
you<00:03:48.170> know<00:03:48.290> there's<00:03:49.250> no<00:03:49.400> point<00:03:49.730> I<00:03:50.060> think<00:03:50.690> it's

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
you know there's no point I think it's

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.289 
you know there's no point I think it's
not<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.200> good<00:03:51.349> idea<00:03:51.470> to<00:03:51.830> do<00:03:51.980> just<00:03:52.400> this<00:03:52.519> job<00:03:52.819> and

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
not a good idea to do just this job and

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.850 
not a good idea to do just this job and
if<00:03:53.390> you<00:03:53.510> have<00:03:53.660> any<00:03:53.870> other<00:03:54.049> talents<00:03:54.530> then<00:03:54.709> go

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
if you have any other talents then go

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.640 
if you have any other talents then go
and<00:03:54.980> do<00:03:55.099> that<00:03:55.280> instead<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:57.849> that<00:03:58.849> was<00:03:58.970> a<00:03:59.060> joke

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
and do that instead and that was a joke

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.399 
and do that instead and that was a joke
but<00:04:01.090> yeah<00:04:02.090> you<00:04:02.209> just<00:04:02.239> have<00:04:02.629> to<00:04:02.780> really<00:04:02.989> try<00:04:03.379> and

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:03.409 
but yeah you just have to really try and

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.130 
but yeah you just have to really try and
and<00:04:04.090> be<00:04:05.090> yourself<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:05.720> listen<00:04:05.810> to<00:04:06.049> your
