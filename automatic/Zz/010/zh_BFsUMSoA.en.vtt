going<00:02:49.889> out<00:02:50.069> on<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.280> limb<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.579> I'm<00:02:50.819> saying<00:02:51.090> that

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
going out on a limb and I'm saying that

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.000

it is the slowest jet in the game now it

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.970 
it is the slowest jet in the game now it
starts<00:02:56.579> off<00:02:56.790> as<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.750> helicopter<00:02:58.500> when<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.739> take

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
starts off as a helicopter when you take

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.559 
starts off as a helicopter when you take
up<00:02:59.159> off<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.879> ground<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.239> take<00:03:00.359> off

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
up off the ground you take off

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.899 
up off the ground you take off
vertically<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.829> to<00:03:01.980> hit<00:03:02.099> right<00:03:02.579> on

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
vertically and you have to hit right on

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.679 
vertically and you have to hit right on
your<00:03:03.209> d-pad<00:03:03.510> for<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.859> turbo<00:03:05.430> boost<00:03:06.389> to

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
your d-pad for the turbo boost to

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.800 
your d-pad for the turbo boost to
actually<00:03:07.230> kick<00:03:07.590> on<00:03:07.939> and<00:03:08.939> then<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.389> turns<00:03:09.629> into

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
actually kick on and then it turns into

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.440 
actually kick on and then it turns into
a<00:03:09.989> jet<00:03:10.349> so<00:03:10.769> at<00:03:10.950> first<00:03:11.159> it's<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.489> helicopter<00:03:12.180> you

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
a jet so at first it's a helicopter you

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.270 
a jet so at first it's a helicopter you
can't<00:03:12.750> do<00:03:12.870> any<00:03:13.019> barrel<00:03:13.470> rolls<00:03:13.709> without

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
can't do any barrel rolls without

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.539 
can't do any barrel rolls without
turning<00:03:15.000> on<00:03:15.150> your<00:03:16.049> jet<00:03:16.560> by<00:03:16.980> hitting<00:03:17.189> right<00:03:17.519> on

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
turning on your jet by hitting right on

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.449 
turning on your jet by hitting right on
the<00:03:17.849> d-pad<00:03:18.030> it's<00:03:18.510> pretty<00:03:18.810> cool<00:03:19.019> I<00:03:19.260> like<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.530> it

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
the d-pad it's pretty cool I like it it

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.479 
the d-pad it's pretty cool I like it it
fires<00:03:20.940> rockets<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:21.870> cannons<00:03:22.190> such<00:03:23.190> as<00:03:23.340> the

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
fires rockets and cannons such as the

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.569 
fires rockets and cannons such as the
others<00:03:23.729> do<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.389> aircraft<00:03:24.959> is<00:03:25.229> it's<00:03:26.099> so<00:03:26.340> far

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
others do this aircraft is it's so far

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.159 
others do this aircraft is it's so far
my<00:03:26.760> favorite<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.239> just<00:03:27.419> like<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.690> hybrid<00:03:27.900> I

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
my favorite I just like the hybrid I

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.860 
my favorite I just like the hybrid I
like<00:03:28.530> how<00:03:28.769> balanced<00:03:29.519> it<00:03:29.669> is<00:03:29.699> it's<00:03:30.090> super<00:03:30.629> easy

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
like how balanced it is it's super easy

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.399 
like how balanced it is it's super easy
to<00:03:31.109> land<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:32.040> seeing<00:03:32.370> how<00:03:32.840> when<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.989> turbo

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
to land so seeing how when the turbo

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.559 
to land so seeing how when the turbo
isn't<00:03:34.859> turned<00:03:35.069> on<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.519> can't<00:03:35.909> do<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.150> barrel

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
isn't turned on you can't do a barrel

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.270 
isn't turned on you can't do a barrel
roll<00:03:36.599> because<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.199> helicopter<00:03:37.409> can't<00:03:38.129> do<00:03:38.250> a

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
roll because the helicopter can't do a

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.369 
roll because the helicopter can't do a
barrel<00:03:38.639> roll<00:03:38.699> so<00:03:39.329> will<00:03:39.479> actually<00:03:39.989> turned

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
barrel roll so will actually turned

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.939 
barrel roll so will actually turned
myself<00:03:40.650> upside<00:03:41.400> down<00:03:42.079> and<00:03:43.079> then<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.379> turned<00:03:43.709> off

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
myself upside down and then I turned off

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.550 
myself upside down and then I turned off
the<00:03:44.280> Jets<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.180> then<00:03:45.449> I<00:03:45.540> tried<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.870> see<00:03:46.319> if<00:03:46.409> I

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
the Jets and then I tried to see if I

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.979 
the Jets and then I tried to see if I
could<00:03:46.620> maneuver<00:03:47.250> my<00:03:47.549> way<00:03:47.699> back<00:03:48.030> up<00:03:48.269> right<00:03:48.659> and

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
could maneuver my way back up right and

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.500
