they<00:02:05.969> have<00:02:06.180> 1.3<00:02:06.950> billion<00:02:08.000> dollars<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.149> debt

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
they have 1.3 billion dollars in debt

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.119 
they have 1.3 billion dollars in debt
each<00:02:09.539> time<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.899> changed<00:02:10.200> hands<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.679> amount

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
each time you changed hands the amount

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.010 
each time you changed hands the amount
of<00:02:11.190> debt<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> company<00:02:11.760> has

of debt the company has

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.680 
of debt the company has
roughly<00:02:12.590> doubled<00:02:13.040> so<00:02:13.700> how<00:02:13.880> does<00:02:14.210> a<00:02:14.330> company's

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
roughly doubled so how does a company's

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.300 
roughly doubled so how does a company's
stay<00:02:15.110> profitable<00:02:15.380> under<00:02:15.860> those<00:02:15.950> kinds<00:02:16.250> of

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
stay profitable under those kinds of

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.190 
stay profitable under those kinds of
conditions<00:02:16.460> you<00:02:17.300> just<00:02:17.450> keep<00:02:17.600> on<00:02:17.750> borrowing

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
conditions you just keep on borrowing

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.080 
conditions you just keep on borrowing
money<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.500> pay<00:02:18.800> off<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.190> money<00:02:19.610> that's<00:02:19.880> in

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
money to pay off the money that's in

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.530 
money to pay off the money that's in
debt<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.540> then<00:02:21.340> hopefully<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:23.090> cuts<00:02:23.360> I'm

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
debt and then hopefully that cuts I'm

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.390 
debt and then hopefully that cuts I'm
working<00:02:23.960> through<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.770> next<00:02:25.010> year<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.340> next

working through the next year the next

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.960 
working through the next year the next
year<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.970> next<00:02:26.000> year<00:02:26.440> doubly<00:02:27.440> dangerous<00:02:27.970> was

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
year the next year doubly dangerous was

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.590 
year the next year doubly dangerous was
the<00:02:29.150> fact<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:31.250> companies<00:02:31.910> when<00:02:32.570> they

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
the fact that the companies when they

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.080 
the fact that the companies when they
would<00:02:32.930> take<00:02:33.470> out<00:02:33.710> some<00:02:33.980> of<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.130> equity<00:02:34.310> as<00:02:34.790> you
