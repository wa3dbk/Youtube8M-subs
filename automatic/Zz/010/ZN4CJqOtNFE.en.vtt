00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:19.749
 PC 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.109
 not 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.169
 t 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.099
 here is such 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.099
 what cat 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.620

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.170
 during the day 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.320
 so armored with 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.480
 with red it's time to side 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.300
 and half h 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.450
 he 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.450
 he has 750 housing 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.790

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.790
 call from 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.420
 snapshot on which 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.580
 ale irony 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.470
 he says that such a cube 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.230
 such a card 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.790
 interesting and here is the 6th route 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.280
 such a 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:05.359
 the end 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.440
 relax 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:13.299
 it turns out 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.559
 So 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.579
 we have this such process 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.020
 what it is with obs for 7 thousand 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.380
 I think that you should not say that 20 b 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.129
 to yourself 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:33.509
 3 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:36.619
 with such 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:39.059
 m 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:42.059
 20 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:47.629
 but in cards 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.640
 and get as not condemned as a challenge 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.629
 standing oksana 310 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:54.909
 to us 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.689
 chaos plot to pieces 10 to class viner 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.729

 as says to 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.709
 with 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.109
 m

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.950
 dsk earlier and intelligence 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:41.679
 t 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.029
 how can you say so 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:51.029
 So 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:54.930
 with almost the ability 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.260
 my tour and card is flexible of the smartest 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.499
 scaring there is still the same as in chicago 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:03.889

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.349
 pumping down the mound 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.349
 and this ability is not 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.649
 So 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:15.219
 but 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:18.219
 but 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:23.029
 Zelenogradskaya

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.059
 So 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:26.340
 but 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.020
 here he is 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.449
 I assure 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.900

 40 by the end of 90 able 10 of them to chaos 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.979
 Yes, there is participation to them, however, 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.069
 what we know 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.069
 one more card or 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.990

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.919
 blue card ability and can 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.160
 on the mystery lets lovers if you

 go a class 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.949
 and believe me 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:32.349
 value 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.379
 end capacity card such a card 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:39.879
 gateway and here's a specialty card 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.169
 it closes so easily 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.169
 times whom 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.339
 3 so 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:57.589
 note 4 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.749
 and 5 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:03.129
 honest 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.129
 and how else will close 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.190
 we have a recession from us too which is hers 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.190

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.770
 svt 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.770
 h 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:21.189
 but 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:23.360
 just komi 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.889

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:33.559
 including about where I'm already like this more often 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.159
 and here is a trap 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:40.770
 m 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.960
 and feel the fist 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.960
 cube of buyers like that once 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:49.110
 Kostomarov from

 this is a man Kiev 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.580
 I will clarify that the guns 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.520
 m 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.580
 and know 

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:25.469
 prim 

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:28.469
 but not worth the weaving 

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:32.249
 because there is also a radio km 

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:35.249
 when kospi on 1 thousand 

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:40.439
 total viewing we stand
