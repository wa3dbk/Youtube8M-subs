00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.899 
the game in the middle of the like
between<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.500> splits<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:41.219> had<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.490> break<00:01:41.700> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
between the splits we had to break and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.480 
between the splits we had to break and
we<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.209> lost<00:01:42.929> our<00:01:43.079> flow<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.709> that's<00:01:44.340> why

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
we just lost our flow so that's why

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.249 
we just lost our flow so that's why
we're<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> little<00:01:45.060> bit<00:01:45.270> inconsistent<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.079> we

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
we're a little bit inconsistent but we

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.340 
we're a little bit inconsistent but we
pick<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.039> up<00:01:47.159> again<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:48.149> learn<00:01:48.329> again<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
pick it up again and we learn again and

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.199 
pick it up again and we learn again and
again<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.709> then<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.100> gotta<00:01:50.759> be<00:01:50.880> good<00:01:50.969> at<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
again and then we gotta be good at the

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:52.940 
again and then we gotta be good at the
end<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.390> season<00:01:51.630> all<00:01:52.289> right<00:01:52.439> we'll<00:01:52.590> see<00:01:52.770> what's
