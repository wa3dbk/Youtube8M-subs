00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.680 
video he's a guy that kinda is like a
Sherlock<00:02:08.160> Holmes<00:02:08.429> type<00:02:08.729> character<00:02:09.300> but

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
instead of solving like murder mysteries

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.670 
instead of solving like murder mysteries
and<00:02:11.640> stuff<00:02:11.790> he<00:02:11.910> solves<00:02:12.360> things<00:02:12.870> dealing<00:02:13.230> with

those<00:02:19.859> type<00:02:20.219> of<00:02:20.250> mysteries<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.750> think<00:02:22.049> that

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
those type of mysteries and I think that

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.610 
those type of mysteries and I think that
in<00:02:22.829> itself<00:02:23.219> would<00:02:23.400> make<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.579> very<00:02:24.049> very<00:02:25.049> fun<00:02:25.590> and

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
in itself would make a very very fun and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.890 
in itself would make a very very fun and
entertaining<00:02:26.400> film<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.030> with<00:02:27.510> Benedict

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.629 
Cumberbatch as that character he's gonna
own<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.349> I<00:02:31.500> really<00:02:31.769> hope<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.129> this<00:02:32.370> would

in a hit he hasn't really carried his
own<00:02:40.650> hit<00:02:40.980> movie<00:02:41.430> like<00:02:41.939> he<00:02:42.180> did<00:02:42.359> the<00:02:42.510> fifth
