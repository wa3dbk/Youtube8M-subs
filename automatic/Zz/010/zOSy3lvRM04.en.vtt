00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
doing this or you can just leave it as

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.350 
doing this or you can just leave it as
is<00:02:49.130> but<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.250> extra<00:02:50.610> little<00:02:50.760> transmissive

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
is but that extra little transmissive

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.390 
is but that extra little transmissive
powder<00:02:51.570> gives<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.500> little<00:02:52.739> bit<00:02:52.980> more<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.220> a

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
powder gives it a little bit more of a

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.729 
powder gives it a little bit more of a
fullness<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.090> life<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:55.050> your<00:02:55.200> lashes<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.680> the

fullness and life to your lashes and the

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.050 
fullness and life to your lashes and the
reason<00:02:55.950> I'm<00:02:56.040> using<00:02:56.100> translucent<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:57.030> I

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
reason I'm using translucent is that I

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.590 
reason I'm using translucent is that I
don't<00:02:57.330> have<00:02:57.390> any<00:02:57.600> fallout<00:02:58.140> here<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.600> it

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
don't have any fallout here and it

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.020 
don't have any fallout here and it
absorbs<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.380> moisture<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.550> oil<00:03:02.670> or

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
absorbs the moisture and oil or

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.490 
absorbs the moisture and oil or
whatever's<00:03:03.450> on<00:03:03.570> your<00:03:03.630> lashes<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.320> gives

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
whatever's on your lashes and it gives

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.259 
whatever's on your lashes and it gives
you<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.680> nice<00:03:04.890> full<00:03:05.549> looks<00:03:05.880> I'm<00:03:06.060> going<00:03:06.180> to

the bottom I'm going to place this here

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.400 
the bottom I'm going to place this here

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
i'm going to ply a little bit of the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
i'm going to ply a little bit of the
powder

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.930 

now<00:03:21.830> you<00:03:21.890> don't<00:03:22.040> even<00:03:22.190> need<00:03:22.340> your<00:03:22.490> primer<00:03:22.730> you

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
now you don't even need your primer you

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.130 
now you don't even need your primer you
can<00:03:23.060> just<00:03:23.270> go<00:03:23.360> straight<00:03:23.660> to<00:03:23.780> translucent

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
can just go straight to translucent

can just go straight to translucent
powder<00:03:24.640> but<00:03:25.640> I<00:03:25.670> feel<00:03:25.849> like<00:03:25.880> that<00:03:26.120> primer

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
powder but I feel like that primer

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.920 
powder but I feel like that primer
really<00:03:26.750> helps<00:03:27.020> mix<00:03:27.200> just<00:03:27.500> a<00:03:27.650> little<00:03:27.860> longer

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
really helps mix just a little longer

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.930 
really helps mix just a little longer
again<00:03:29.930> it's<00:03:30.170> always<00:03:30.470> good<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:30.680> use<00:03:30.920> this<00:03:31.069> guy

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.990 

it's<00:03:34.940> a<00:03:35.000> huge<00:03:35.510> huge<00:03:35.720> difference<00:03:36.520> so<00:03:37.520> I'm<00:03:37.790> using

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
it's a huge huge difference so I'm using
