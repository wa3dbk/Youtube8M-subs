00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
gonna start here with the ID AK which is

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.780 
gonna start here with the ID AK which is
one<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.650> your<00:00:13.799> newer<00:00:13.980> products<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.639> if<00:00:14.700> you

one of your newer products and if you
can<00:00:14.940> just<00:00:14.969> explain<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.599> little<00:00:15.809> bit<00:00:16.020> about<00:00:16.199> it

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
can just explain a little bit about it

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.500 
can just explain a little bit about it
yeah<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.100> ID<00:00:17.310> akka<00:00:17.699> was<00:00:18.150> something<00:00:18.420> that

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
yeah the ID akka was something that

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.060 
yeah the ID akka was something that
we've<00:00:18.630> had<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.930> works<00:00:19.140> for<00:00:19.289> quite<00:00:19.859> some

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
we've had in the works for quite some

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.630 
we've had in the works for quite some
time<00:00:20.100> it's<00:00:20.550> really<00:00:20.910> for<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:21.960> people<00:00:22.890> who<00:00:23.340> have

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
time it's really for for people who have

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.099 
time it's really for for people who have
multiple<00:00:24.439> digital<00:00:25.439> devices<00:00:26.390> with<00:00:27.390> an<00:00:27.539> iPod

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
multiple digital devices with an iPod

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.759 
multiple digital devices with an iPod
you<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.560> stick<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.039> into<00:00:29.369> our<00:00:29.400> into<00:00:30.359> our<00:00:30.769> our

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
you can stick this into our into our our

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.490 
you can stick this into our into our our
dock<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.000> dock<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.540> actually<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> digital

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
dock and this dock is actually a digital

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.420 
dock and this dock is actually a digital
dock<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.850> will<00:00:36.239> take<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.250> information<00:00:38.250> from

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
dock that will take the information from

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.490 
dock that will take the information from
the<00:00:38.610> iPod<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.300> ones<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.809> zeros<00:00:40.200> from<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the iPod the ones and zeros from the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.310 
the iPod the ones and zeros from the
iPod<00:00:40.980> instead<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.000> analog<00:00:42.480> output<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
iPod instead of the analog output and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.979 
iPod instead of the analog output and
transfer<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.100> directly<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:45.090> our<00:00:45.120> deck<00:00:45.510> which

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
transfer it directly to our deck which

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.590 
transfer it directly to our deck which
basically<00:00:46.620> our<00:00:46.890> deck<00:00:47.160> doesn't<00:00:47.489> know<00:00:47.910> that

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
basically our deck doesn't know that

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.420 
basically our deck doesn't know that
this<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.989> an<00:00:49.170> iPod<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.890> thinks<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
this is an iPod it thinks it's a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.700 
this is an iPod it thinks it's a
high-end<00:00:50.850> CD<00:00:51.149> player<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.780> does<00:00:51.930> anything

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
high-end CD player as it does anything

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.369 
high-end CD player as it does anything
that<00:00:52.949> transfers<00:00:53.460> ones<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.030> zeros<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.320> you

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
that transfers ones and zeros so you

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.959 
that transfers ones and zeros so you
have<00:00:55.559> all<00:00:55.829> kinds<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.250> things<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.789> can

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
have all kinds of things that you can

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.490 
have all kinds of things that you can
hook<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.300> up<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.590> it's<00:00:58.590> got<00:00:58.739> an<00:00:58.829> iPod<00:00:59.280> input

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
hook it up with it's got an iPod input

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.860 
hook it up with it's got an iPod input
digital<00:01:01.500> iPod<00:01:01.920> input<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.910> kind<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.149> USB<00:01:03.480> for

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
digital iPod input it's kind of USB for

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.590 
digital iPod input it's kind of USB for
your<00:01:04.019> computer<00:01:04.680> coax<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.090> then<00:01:06.240> you've<00:01:06.390> got

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
your computer coax and then you've got

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.380 
your computer coax and then you've got
opticals<00:01:07.409> for<00:01:07.680> things<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:07.950> Apple<00:01:08.610> TVs<00:01:09.030> so

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
opticals for things like Apple TVs so

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.300 
opticals for things like Apple TVs so
just<00:01:09.630> about<00:01:09.840> any<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> devices<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.070> you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
just about any of the devices that you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.960 
just about any of the devices that you
have<00:01:12.530> that<00:01:13.530> are<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:14.159> are<00:01:14.280> digital<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.820> can

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
have that are that are digital you can

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.880 
have that are that are digital you can
hook<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.080> would<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.619> explain<00:01:16.799> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
hook up to this and would you explain a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.340 
hook up to this and would you explain a
little<00:01:16.979> bit<00:01:17.220> about<00:01:17.369> why<00:01:17.790> using<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:19.020> as

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
little bit about why using this as

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.380 
little bit about why using this as
opposed<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.670> electronics<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.299> are

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
opposed to the electronics that are

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
opposed to the electronics that are
built<00:01:21.570> into<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> iPod<00:01:22.380> why<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:23.040> such<00:01:23.310> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
built into the iPod why this is such a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.399 
built into the iPod why this is such a
huge<00:01:23.549> improvement<00:01:24.180> yeah<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.780> iPods<00:01:25.110> actually

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
huge improvement yeah the iPods actually

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.499 
huge improvement yeah the iPods actually
got<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> very<00:01:25.920> good<00:01:26.189> d-to-a<00:01:26.610> converter<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
got a very good d-to-a converter but the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.109 
got a very good d-to-a converter but the
one<00:01:27.689> thing<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.170> doesn't<00:01:28.680> have<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.460> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
one thing that it doesn't have is is a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.420 
one thing that it doesn't have is is a
big<00:01:30.750> power<00:01:31.110> supply<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:32.070> can't<00:01:32.280> really

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
big power supply you just can't really

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.920 
big power supply you just can't really
fit<00:01:32.729> much<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.180> power<00:01:33.360> supply<00:01:33.780> into

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
fit much of a power supply into

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.080 
fit much of a power supply into
something<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.220> we<00:01:35.340> don't<00:01:35.579> have<00:01:35.820> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
something like this so we don't have to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.210 
something like this so we don't have to
rely<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.170> power<00:01:37.380> supply<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.920> something

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
rely on the power supply of something

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.830 
rely on the power supply of something
like<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.790> only<00:01:38.820> thing<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.390> rely<00:01:39.810> on

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
like this the only thing that we rely on

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.170 
like this the only thing that we rely on
out<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:41.040> device<00:01:41.400> or<00:01:41.640> any<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> other

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
out of this device or any of the other

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.510 
out of this device or any of the other
digital<00:01:42.420> devices<00:01:42.600> are<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.890> ones<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.220> zeros

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
digital devices are the ones the zeros

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.060 
digital devices are the ones the zeros
if<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.570> get<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.840> ones<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.320> zeros<00:01:46.710> out<00:01:46.950> of

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
if we can get the ones and zeros out of

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.030 
if we can get the ones and zeros out of
this<00:01:47.399> our<00:01:48.210> unit<00:01:48.540> basically<00:01:49.229> thinks<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.890> it's

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
this our unit basically thinks that it's

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.270 
this our unit basically thinks that it's
high<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.670> CD<00:01:51.000> player<00:01:51.740> so<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.070> going<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
high in CD player so this is going to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.310 
high in CD player so this is going to
take<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> signal<00:01:53.820> from<00:01:54.119> an<00:01:54.240> iPod<00:01:54.570> your<00:01:54.780> computer

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
take a signal from an iPod your computer

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.459 
take a signal from an iPod your computer
sometimes<00:01:56.280> even<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.610> gaming<00:01:56.939> system<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.509> lets

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
sometimes even a gaming system and lets

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.770 
sometimes even a gaming system and lets
you<00:01:58.680> play<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.399> through<00:01:59.640> your<00:01:59.820> high-end<00:02:00.270> system

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
you play it through your high-end system

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.780 
you play it through your high-end system
and<00:02:01.049> have<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.560> sound<00:02:01.680> fantastic<00:02:02.310> that's<00:02:02.579> right

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
and have it sound fantastic that's right

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.280 
and have it sound fantastic that's right
that's<00:02:03.119> exactly<00:02:03.659> right<00:02:03.689> because<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.079> lot<00:02:04.259> of

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
that's exactly right because a lot of

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.660 
that's exactly right because a lot of
people<00:02:04.439> have<00:02:04.680> systems<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.250> they<00:02:05.369> really

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
people have systems that they really

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.029 
people have systems that they really
adore<00:02:06.060> right<00:02:06.450> now<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.259> problem<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.829> is

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
adore right now the problem is is

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.949 
adore right now the problem is is
they've<00:02:08.190> got<00:02:08.310> seven<00:02:08.610> or<00:02:08.729> eight<00:02:08.879> analog<00:02:09.479> inputs

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
they've got seven or eight analog inputs

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.910 
they've got seven or eight analog inputs
and<00:02:10.280> frankly<00:02:11.280> their<00:02:11.459> there<00:02:12.060> are<00:02:12.090> no<00:02:12.420> more

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
and frankly their there are no more

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.880 
and frankly their there are no more
log<00:02:13.190> sources<00:02:13.940> other<00:02:14.450> than<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.959> turntable<00:02:15.620> these

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
log sources other than a turntable these

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.339 
log sources other than a turntable these
days<00:02:16.099> everything<00:02:16.640> else<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.239> digital<00:02:17.780> the

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
days everything else is digital the

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.900 
days everything else is digital the
problem<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.099> lot<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.430> people<00:02:19.640> take<00:02:19.819> these

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
problem is a lot of people take these

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.530 
problem is a lot of people take these
digital<00:02:20.330> sources<00:02:20.750> convert<00:02:21.739> them<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:21.920> analog

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
digital sources convert them to analog

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.809 
digital sources convert them to analog
to<00:02:23.540> put<00:02:23.810> them<00:02:23.900> through<00:02:23.930> their<00:02:24.260> analog<00:02:24.819> setups

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
to put them through their analog setups

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.090 
to put them through their analog setups
and<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.810> performance<00:02:27.319> is<00:02:27.440> never<00:02:27.770> very<00:02:28.099> good

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
and the performance is never very good

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.240 
and the performance is never very good
it's<00:02:31.100> gonna<00:02:31.580> be<00:02:31.700> very<00:02:31.910> very<00:02:32.120> yes<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:34.010> learn

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
it's gonna be very very yes to learn

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.610 
it's gonna be very very yes to learn
