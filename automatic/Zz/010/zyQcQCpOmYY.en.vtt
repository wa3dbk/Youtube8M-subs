00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.800 

so<00:00:31.550> that's<00:00:31.760> what<00:00:31.910> we<00:00:32.000> started<00:00:32.060> doing<00:00:32.360> raising

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
so that's what we started doing raising

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.990 
so that's what we started doing raising
organic<00:00:33.170> meat<00:00:33.400> and<00:00:34.400> then<00:00:34.550> it<00:00:34.670> got<00:00:34.760> to<00:00:34.970> the

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
organic meat and then it got to the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.790 
organic meat and then it got to the
point<00:00:35.210> worse<00:00:35.440> profitable<00:00:36.440> enough<00:00:36.590> where<00:00:36.770> I

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
point worse profitable enough where I

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.490 
point worse profitable enough where I
could<00:00:36.980> quit<00:00:37.280> my<00:00:37.310> job<00:00:37.430> at<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:38.060> city<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.110> I<00:00:39.140> quit

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
could quit my job at the city so I quit

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.020 
could quit my job at the city so I quit
the<00:00:39.650> city<00:00:39.830> job<00:00:40.100> which<00:00:40.309> most<00:00:40.580> people<00:00:40.730> thought<00:00:41.000> I

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
the city job which most people thought I

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.080 
the city job which most people thought I
was<00:00:41.120> crazy<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:42.400> started<00:00:43.400> farming<00:00:43.550> full-time

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
was crazy and started farming full-time

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.299 
was crazy and started farming full-time
and<00:00:45.100> so<00:00:46.100> we<00:00:46.220> did<00:00:46.400> that<00:00:46.520> for<00:00:46.760> how<00:00:47.150> many<00:00:47.210> years

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
and so we did that for how many years

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.470 
and so we did that for how many years
eight<00:00:49.309> eight<00:00:49.730> years<00:00:50.059> and<00:00:50.300> then<00:00:50.960> once<00:00:51.949> we

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
eight eight years and then once we

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.910 
eight eight years and then once we
started<00:00:53.480> making<00:00:53.570> a<00:00:53.750> lucrative<00:00:54.350> I<00:00:54.620> guess<00:00:54.800> you

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
started making a lucrative I guess you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.610
