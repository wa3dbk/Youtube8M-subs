example now in this instance is it a

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.300 
example now in this instance is it a
sign<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.810> healthy<00:01:58.259> debate<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> executive

branch<00:01:59.579> or<00:02:00.119> does<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.689> look<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.320> something

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
branch or does this look like something

else<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:03.320> well<00:02:04.320> there's<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.979> lot<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.219> be

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
else to you well there's a lot to be

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.039 
else to you well there's a lot to be
said<00:02:05.369> about<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.729> primarily<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.719> think<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
said about this primarily I think the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.419 
said about this primarily I think the
first<00:02:07.200> thing<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.469> entered<00:02:07.590> my<00:02:07.770> mind<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
first thing that entered my mind is the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.100 
first thing that entered my mind is the
we<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:09.030> access<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:09.810> much<00:02:09.869> more

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
we just have access to so much more

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.479 
we just have access to so much more
information<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:10.770> didn't<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.039> back<00:02:11.310> in

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
information that we didn't have back in

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.980 
information that we didn't have back in
really<00:02:12.180> any<00:02:12.330> time<00:02:12.540> prior<00:02:12.780> to

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
really any time prior to

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.740 
really any time prior to
probably<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.770> 70s<00:02:14.130> or<00:02:14.220> 80s<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:15.480> know<00:02:15.510> there

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
probably the 70s or 80s you know there

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.110 
probably the 70s or 80s you know there
were<00:02:15.840> tire<00:02:16.140> stories<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.770> huge<00:02:17.400> state<00:02:17.700> secrets

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
were tire stories of huge state secrets

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.550 
were tire stories of huge state secrets
that<00:02:18.240> were<00:02:18.330> kept<00:02:18.600> by<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.780> press<00:02:19.080> because<00:02:19.290> they

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
that were kept by the press because they

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.710 
that were kept by the press because they
didn't<00:02:19.800> want<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.070> release<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.600> there<00:02:21.600> was

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
didn't want it release so there was

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.510 
didn't want it release so there was
probably<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.050> lot<00:02:22.140> more<00:02:22.260> bickering<00:02:22.460> behind<00:02:23.460> the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
probably a lot more bickering behind the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.540 
probably a lot more bickering behind the
scenes<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.850> we<00:02:24.000> are<00:02:24.150> more<00:02:24.750> privy<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.230> today

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
scenes that we are more privy to today

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.010 
scenes that we are more privy to today
with<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.730> said<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.270> think<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.660> reason<00:02:27.810> we're

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
with that said I think the reason we're

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.310 
with that said I think the reason we're
seeing<00:02:28.260> Obama<00:02:28.560> vs<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.070> generals<00:02:29.460> is<00:02:29.610> because

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
seeing Obama vs the generals is because

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.050 
seeing Obama vs the generals is because
Obama<00:02:31.320> has<00:02:31.590> set<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:32.040> set<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.520> political

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
Obama has set a set of political

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.630 
Obama has set a set of political
objectives<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.870> then<00:02:34.680> told<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.190> generals

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
objectives and then told the generals

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.490 
objectives and then told the generals
how<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.300> achieve<00:02:36.510> those<00:02:36.990> political

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
how to achieve those political

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.690 
how to achieve those political
objectives<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.220> generals<00:02:38.610> are

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
objectives and the generals are

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.900 
objectives and the generals are
basically<00:02:39.150> saying<00:02:39.830> we<00:02:40.830> can<00:02:41.040> do<00:02:41.400> what<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.760> tell

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
basically saying we can do what you tell

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.400 
basically saying we can do what you tell
us<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.210> do<00:02:42.390> or<00:02:42.600> we<00:02:42.840> can<00:02:42.990> achieve<00:02:43.110> your

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
us to do or we can achieve your

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.110 
us to do or we can achieve your
political<00:02:43.920> objectives<00:02:44.370> but<00:02:44.550> we<00:02:44.700> can't<00:02:44.940> do

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
political objectives but we can't do

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.820 
political objectives but we can't do
both<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.630> that's<00:02:46.230> where<00:02:46.530> we<00:02:46.560> get<00:02:46.770> into

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
both and that's where we get into

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.550 
both and that's where we get into
trouble<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.520> ideal<00:02:48.270> arrangement<00:02:48.840> here

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
trouble the ideal arrangement here

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.960 
trouble the ideal arrangement here
should<00:02:49.770> be<00:02:49.800> that<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.250> civilian<00:02:50.700> leadership

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
should be that the civilian leadership

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.010 
should be that the civilian leadership
the<00:02:51.240> President<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.690> United<00:02:51.870> States

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
the President of the United States

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.180 
the President of the United States
should<00:02:52.410> set<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.650> series<00:02:52.980> of<00:02:53.010> political

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
should set a series of political

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.790 
should set a series of political
objectives<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.180> be<00:02:54.210> achieved<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.870> then<00:02:55.530> turn

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
objectives to be achieved and then turn

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.370 
objectives to be achieved and then turn
that<00:02:56.600> operational<00:02:57.600> goal<00:02:57.840> over<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.290> the

that operational goal over to the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.320 
that operational goal over to the
military<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.100> leave<00:02:59.430> them<00:02:59.730> alone<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.210> do

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
military and leave them alone to do

military and leave them alone to do
their<00:03:00.510> jobs<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:01.440> if<00:03:01.650> Obama<00:03:02.040> is<00:03:02.250> saying<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.760> want

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
their jobs so if Obama is saying I want

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.680 
their jobs so if Obama is saying I want
to<00:03:03.180> defeat<00:03:03.450> Isis<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:05.550> don't<00:03:06.270> want<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.540> put
