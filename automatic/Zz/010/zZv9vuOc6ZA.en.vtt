all<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.379> time<00:02:10.619> but<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.459> know<00:02:11.580> sometimes

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
all the time but you know sometimes

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.760 
all the time but you know sometimes
probably<00:02:12.959> have<00:02:13.560> to

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
probably have to

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.510 
probably have to
like<00:02:14.070> my<00:02:14.310> favorite<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.870> ones<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.230> do<00:02:16.290> have<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:17.160> do

like my favorite the ones I do have I do
have<00:02:17.820> other<00:02:18.000> favorites<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.570> don't<00:02:18.870> have

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
have other favorites that I don't have

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.490 
have other favorites that I don't have

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
yet that I will try to get but these are

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.140 
yet that I will try to get but these are
probably<00:02:22.980> my<00:02:23.070> favorite<00:02:23.220> out<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.910> my

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
probably my favorite out of my

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.870 
probably my favorite out of my
collection<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.750> do<00:02:24.840> have<00:02:25.230> these<00:02:25.560> are<00:02:25.770> the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
collection that I do have these are the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.820 
collection that I do have these are the
13s<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.090> have<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.750> also<00:02:27.990> do<00:02:28.350> like<00:02:28.560> these

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
13s that I have I also do like these

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.190 
13s that I have I also do like these
just<00:02:29.220> because<00:02:29.550> it's<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.540> different<00:02:30.900> type<00:02:31.170> of

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
just because it's a different type of

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.100 
just because it's a different type of
Jordan<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.420> because<00:02:33.420> like<00:02:33.570> most<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:33.990> time

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
Jordan and because like most of the time

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.690 
Jordan and because like most of the time
like<00:02:34.170> they<00:02:34.500> do<00:02:34.560> look<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.950> same<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:35.550> they're

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
like they do look the same but they're

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.910 
like they do look the same but they're
just<00:02:35.850> different<00:02:36.210> colors<00:02:36.630> but<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.320> do<00:02:37.560> really

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
just different colors but I do really

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.330 
just different colors but I do really
like<00:02:38.160> these<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:38.670> because<00:02:39.650> it<00:02:40.650> has<00:02:40.830> cool

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
like these just because it has cool

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.600 
like these just because it has cool
printing<00:02:41.970> here<00:02:42.210> and<00:02:43.040> it's<00:02:44.040> really<00:02:44.220> easy<00:02:44.490> to

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
printing here and it's really easy to

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.610 
printing here and it's really easy to
match<00:02:44.850> up<00:02:45.060> things<00:02:45.300> with<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.050> these<00:02:46.320> are<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
match up things with so these are the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.890 
match up things with so these are the
grapes<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.400> did<00:02:47.700> buy<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.210> like<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.600> color

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
grapes that I did buy I like the color

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.010 
grapes that I did buy I like the color
combination<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.520> decided<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.600> get<00:02:51.810> these

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
combination so I decided to get these

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.230 
combination so I decided to get these
ones<00:02:52.230> as<00:02:52.380> well<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.860> then<00:02:53.340> really<00:02:53.850> liking

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
ones as well and then really liking

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.090 
ones as well and then really liking
these<00:02:54.390> nothing's<00:02:55.020> quite<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.440> while<00:02:55.620> ago<00:02:55.770> so

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
these nothing's quite a while ago so

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.090 
these nothing's quite a while ago so
they're<00:02:56.580> not<00:02:56.640> really<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:57.030> recent<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:58.100> yeah

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
they're not really that recent but yeah

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.730 
they're not really that recent but yeah
I<00:02:59.130> got<00:02:59.580> this<00:02:59.820> from<00:03:01.790> champs<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:03.000> believe<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:03.740> yeah

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
I got this from champs I believe so yeah

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.070 
I got this from champs I believe so yeah
and<00:03:05.100> it's<00:03:05.880> really<00:03:05.970> easy<00:03:06.210> to<00:03:06.450> pair<00:03:06.720> up<00:03:06.840> just

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
and it's really easy to pair up just

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.450 
and it's really easy to pair up just
because<00:03:07.350> most<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.860> clothing<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:08.370> do

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
because most of the clothing that I do

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.970 
because most of the clothing that I do
have<00:03:08.760> it's<00:03:09.420> not<00:03:09.570> really<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:09.840> girly<00:03:10.440> it's

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
have it's not really that girly it's

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.180 
have it's not really that girly it's
only<00:03:11.190> because<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.520> work<00:03:11.790> at<00:03:11.940> spring<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.660> like<00:03:12.870> I

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
only because I work at spring and like I

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.490 
only because I work at spring and like I
have<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.340> dress<00:03:14.550> curly<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:15.180> have<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:15.720> outside<00:03:16.110> in

have to dress curly I have it outside in
my<00:03:16.560> closet<00:03:17.130> but<00:03:17.250> most<00:03:17.550> of<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.730> time<00:03:17.940> if<00:03:18.360> I

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870

ultimate favorite just because these

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.830 
ultimate favorite just because these
were<00:04:19.680> my<00:04:19.830> first<00:04:20.220> Jordans<00:04:20.880> saw<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.480> photo<00:04:21.750> of

Chris<00:04:22.049> Brown<00:04:22.290> and<00:04:22.500> he<00:04:22.620> was<00:04:22.770> wearing<00:04:22.950> them<00:04:23.160> and

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
Chris Brown and he was wearing them and

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.550 
Chris Brown and he was wearing them and
I<00:04:23.400> freaked<00:04:24.000> out<00:04:24.180> because<00:04:24.360> I've<00:04:24.870> always<00:04:25.229> wanted

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
I freaked out because I've always wanted

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.170 
I freaked out because I've always wanted
the<00:04:26.250> true<00:04:26.490> blue<00:04:26.729> so

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
the true blue so

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.810 
the true blue so
these<00:04:27.300> are<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.570> true<00:04:27.810> blues<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.820> they're

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
these are the true blues and they're

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.529 
these are the true blues and they're
probably<00:04:30.180> one<00:04:30.479> of<00:04:30.509> my<00:04:30.900> favorites<00:04:31.380> um<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:32.030> just<00:04:33.030> I
