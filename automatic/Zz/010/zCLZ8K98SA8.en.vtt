screenshots of what tom has tweeted out
so<00:00:29.259> over<00:00:29.619> here<00:00:29.980> it<00:00:30.609> says<00:00:30.789> that<00:00:31.029> the<00:00:31.119> opengl<00:00:31.749> to

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
so over here it says that the opengl to

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.240 
so over here it says that the opengl to
is<00:00:32.380> done<00:00:32.970> so<00:00:33.970> it<00:00:34.300> still<00:00:34.570> has<00:00:34.720> small<00:00:35.020> some<00:00:35.949> small

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
is done so it still has small some small

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.680 
is done so it still has small some small
bugs<00:00:36.550> but<00:00:37.270> everything<00:00:37.989> has<00:00:38.230> been<00:00:38.680> ported<00:00:39.160> now

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
bugs but everything has been ported now

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.750 
bugs but everything has been ported now

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
so if you don't know what opengl to is

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.750 
so if you don't know what opengl to is
basically<00:00:43.719> right<00:00:44.379> now<00:00:44.590> we're<00:00:44.949> running<00:00:45.309> out<00:00:45.489> at

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
basically right now we're running out at

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.229 
basically right now we're running out at
least<00:00:46.239> 40<00:00:46.840> frames<00:00:46.989> per<00:00:47.289> second<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:48.789> minecraft

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.389 
least 40 frames per second on minecraft
proposition<00:00:49.750> but<00:00:49.930> with<00:00:50.289> opengl<00:00:50.890> to<00:00:51.160> it's

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
proposition but with opengl to it's

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.810 
proposition but with opengl to it's
going<00:00:51.550> to<00:00:51.609> run<00:00:51.760> a<00:00:51.789> lot<00:00:52.090> faster<00:00:52.120> at<00:00:52.750> least<00:00:53.820> 60

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
going to run a lot faster at least 60

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.939 
going to run a lot faster at least 60
frames<00:00:55.030> per<00:00:55.120> second<00:00:55.600> so<00:00:55.780> this<00:00:55.929> is<00:00:56.079> a<00:00:56.260> huge

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949

he responded back with it means there's
going<00:01:44.350> to<00:01:44.440> be<00:01:44.470> sprinting<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.280> crouching<00:01:46.180> so

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
going to be sprinting and crouching so

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.950 
going to be sprinting and crouching so
that<00:01:47.440> is<00:01:47.740> good<00:01:48.010> news<00:01:48.070> because<00:01:48.700> i<00:01:49.210> really<00:01:49.750> hate

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
that is good news because i really hate

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.740 
that is good news because i really hate
using<00:01:50.530> block<00:01:50.890> lon<00:01:51.070> cho<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:52.390> know<00:01:52.510> use

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
using block lon cho to you know use

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.600 
using block lon cho to you know use
sprinting<00:01:53.290> and<00:01:53.410> stuff<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:53.890> I<00:01:54.190> could<00:01:54.340> just<00:01:54.370> use

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
sprinting and stuff and I could just use

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.210 
sprinting and stuff and I could just use
the<00:01:54.640> normal<00:01:54.910> minecraft<00:01:55.300> PE<00:01:55.690> to<00:01:56.410> use<00:01:56.590> sprinting

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
the normal minecraft PE to use sprinting

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.750 
the normal minecraft PE to use sprinting
and<00:01:57.430> crouch<00:01:57.790> so<00:01:58.300> that<00:01:58.540> is<00:01:58.690> awesome<00:01:59.610> looks<00:02:00.610> like

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
and crouch so that is awesome looks like

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.210 
and crouch so that is awesome looks like
realms<00:02:01.180> is<00:02:01.300> going<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.510> be<00:02:01.600> back<00:02:01.780> as<00:02:01.960> well<00:02:02.230> and<00:02:02.470> a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
realms is going to be back as well and a

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.490 
realms is going to be back as well and a
new<00:02:03.490> sound<00:02:03.790> engine<00:02:04.240> so<00:02:04.540> I'm<00:02:04.720> guessing<00:02:04.900> by<00:02:05.260> that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
new sound engine so I'm guessing by that

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.119 
new sound engine so I'm guessing by that
they<00:02:06.310> mean<00:02:06.340> that<00:02:06.580> in<00:02:07.420> Minecraft<00:02:08.050> PC<00:02:08.200> as<00:02:08.619> the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
in this screenshot arm someone asked

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.020 
in this screenshot arm someone asked
that<00:02:50.500> enchanting<00:02:51.500> system<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.160> then<00:02:52.700> Tom

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
that enchanting system and then Tom

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.360 
that enchanting system and then Tom
responded<00:02:53.840> back<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.170> said<00:02:54.260> oh<00:02:54.650> yeah<00:02:55.100> i<00:02:55.130> forgot

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.790 
responded back and said oh yeah i forgot
enchanting<00:02:56.050> so<00:02:57.050> yeah<00:02:57.350> it's<00:02:57.560> going<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.739> be

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
enchanting so yeah it's going to be

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.040 
enchanting so yeah it's going to be
enchanting<00:02:58.430> now<00:02:58.640> so<00:02:59.030> i'm<00:02:59.330> guessing<00:02:59.600> that<00:02:59.900> it's

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
enchanting now so i'm guessing that it's

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.229 
enchanting now so i'm guessing that it's
going<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.230> probably<00:03:00.680> be<00:03:01.070> XP<00:03:01.610> for<00:03:01.910> that<00:03:02.090> because

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
going to probably be XP for that because

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.560 
going to probably be XP for that because
one<00:03:03.170> chaining<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.709> need<00:03:03.860> XP<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.550> enchant<00:03:05.420> your

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
one chaining you need XP to enchant your

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.300 
one chaining you need XP to enchant your
weapon<00:03:05.900> so<00:03:06.080> i'm<00:03:06.260> guessing<00:03:06.860> that<00:03:07.070> this

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
weapon so i'm guessing that this

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.759 
weapon so i'm guessing that this
probably<00:03:07.610> going<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.820> be<00:03:07.880> exp<00:03:08.540> in<00:03:08.780> zero<00:03:09.530> point

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
probably going to be exp in zero point

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.740 
probably going to be exp in zero point
10.0<00:03:10.340> as<00:03:10.580> well<00:03:10.910> i'm<00:03:11.120> not<00:03:11.269> one<00:03:11.480> hundred<00:03:11.540> percent

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
10.0 as well i'm not one hundred percent

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.190 
10.0 as well i'm not one hundred percent
sure<00:03:12.019> but<00:03:12.500> that's<00:03:12.860> just<00:03:13.100> my<00:03:13.989> assumption<00:03:14.989> of

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
sure but that's just my assumption of

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.110 
sure but that's just my assumption of
guessing<00:03:15.830> so<00:03:16.160> I<00:03:16.190> yeah<00:03:16.610> that<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:16.880> really

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
guessing so I yeah that is really

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.910 
guessing so I yeah that is really
awesome<00:03:17.390> alright<00:03:18.019> so<00:03:18.200> that's<00:03:18.320> basically<00:03:18.530> it

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
awesome alright so that's basically it

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.100
