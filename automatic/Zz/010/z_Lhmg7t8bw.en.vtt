00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.920 
take the axial piece with the stud on
the<00:02:48.569> end<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.079> then<00:02:50.010> insert<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.790> stud<00:02:51.120> part

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
the end and then insert the stud part

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.220 
the end and then insert the stud part
right<00:02:52.829> into<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.310> clip<00:02:53.629> just<00:02:54.629> like<00:02:54.780> that

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
right into the clip just like that

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.059 
right into the clip just like that
and<00:02:56.510> then<00:02:57.510> you're<00:02:57.599> gonna<00:02:57.690> slide<00:02:58.079> on<00:02:58.110> these<00:02:58.590> two

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
and then you're gonna slide on these two

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.180 
and then you're gonna slide on these two
grey<00:02:59.549> Technic<00:03:00.180> pieces<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:01.140> wider<00:03:01.530> one<00:03:01.859> first

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
grey Technic pieces the wider one first

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.319 
grey Technic pieces the wider one first
and<00:03:02.900> then<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:04.049> put<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.410> thin<00:03:04.620> one<00:03:05.180> or<00:03:06.180> the

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
and then just put the thin one or the

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.050 
and then just put the thin one or the
narrow<00:03:06.569> one<00:03:06.780> on<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.200> end<00:03:07.410> just<00:03:07.799> like<00:03:08.519> that<00:03:08.790> and

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
narrow one on the end just like that and

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.009 
narrow one on the end just like that and
then<00:03:09.750> simply<00:03:10.140> attach<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:11.040> nozzle<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.870> the

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
then simply attach the nozzle to the

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.750 
then simply attach the nozzle to the
clip<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.900> there<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:16.019> have<00:03:16.049> it<00:03:16.549> super<00:03:17.549> easy

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
clip and there you have it super easy

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.240 
clip and there you have it super easy
and<00:03:18.090> fast<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.599> build<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.079> it<00:03:19.920> looks<00:03:20.099> awesome

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
and fast to build and it looks awesome

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.190 
and fast to build and it looks awesome
so<00:03:20.609> let's<00:03:20.670> see<00:03:20.819> what<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.000> looks<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:22.049> can

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
so let's see what it looks like you can

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.949 
so let's see what it looks like you can
take<00:03:22.409> a<00:03:22.440> clone<00:03:25.190> turn<00:03:26.190> this<00:03:26.370> hand<00:03:28.190> gun<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:29.340> it

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
take a clone turn this hand gun in it

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.259 
take a clone turn this hand gun in it
and<00:03:30.959> then<00:03:31.079> kind<00:03:31.409> of<00:03:31.470> as<00:03:31.650> our<00:03:32.190> heaviest<00:03:32.970> other

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
and then kind of as our heaviest other

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.110 
and then kind of as our heaviest other
hand<00:03:33.829> resting<00:03:35.660> right<00:03:36.660> by<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.230> other<00:03:37.440> handle

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
hand resting right by the other handle

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.909 
hand resting right by the other handle
so<00:03:39.120> we<00:03:39.239> cannot<00:03:39.569> actually<00:03:39.900> hold<00:03:40.319> both<00:03:40.500> handles

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
so we cannot actually hold both handles

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.860 
so we cannot actually hold both handles
at<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.069> same<00:03:41.280> time<00:03:41.519> but<00:03:42.329> you<00:03:42.419> can<00:03:42.569> kind<00:03:42.810> of

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
at the same time but you can kind of

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.129 
at the same time but you can kind of
make<00:03:43.019> it<00:03:43.049> look<00:03:43.260> like<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.590> can<00:03:44.269> look<00:03:45.269> at<00:03:45.419> that

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.039 

and<00:03:49.139> have<00:03:49.440> them<00:03:49.620> charged<00:03:50.040> in<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.310> battle<00:03:50.700> so

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
and have them charged in the battle so

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.250 
and have them charged in the battle so
it's<00:03:52.049> a<00:03:52.169> like<00:03:52.799> I<00:03:52.919> said<00:03:53.129> it's<00:03:53.250> my<00:03:53.340> favorite
