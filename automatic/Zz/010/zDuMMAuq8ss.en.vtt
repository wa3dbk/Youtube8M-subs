00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
it looks so that's that and here's the a

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.350 
it looks so that's that and here's the a
runner<00:03:50.360> pretty<00:03:51.080> much<00:03:51.170> to<00:03:51.290> shield<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:52.550> other

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
runner pretty much to shield and other

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.810 
runner pretty much to shield and other
miscellaneous<00:03:53.600> pars<00:03:54.260> two<00:03:54.500> blades<00:03:54.800> which<00:03:55.610> are

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
miscellaneous pars two blades which are

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.480 
miscellaneous pars two blades which are
pretty<00:03:56.060> cool<00:03:56.330> like<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.320> blades<00:03:57.620> alright<00:03:58.130> so

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
pretty cool like the blades alright so

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.810 
pretty cool like the blades alright so
then<00:03:59.480> assign<00:03:59.840> all<00:04:00.770> right<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.070> this<00:04:01.250> red<00:04:01.610> is

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
but at the same time I don't I mean I

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.300 
but at the same time I don't I mean I
just<00:04:20.660> don't<00:04:20.780> want<00:04:20.960> I<00:04:21.140> just<00:04:21.830> want<00:04:21.950> harder<00:04:22.250> to

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
just don't want I just want harder to

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.590 
just don't want I just want harder to
build<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.700> I<00:04:22.790> really<00:04:23.180> don't<00:04:23.300> want<00:04:23.420> to<00:04:23.480> waste

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
build it I really don't want to waste

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.130 
build it I really don't want to waste
time<00:04:24.070> so<00:04:25.070> here's<00:04:25.340> some<00:04:25.460> more<00:04:25.610> read<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:26.780> poly

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
time so here's some more read the poly

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.200 
time so here's some more read the poly
capture<00:04:27.530> in<00:04:27.620> size<00:04:27.830> from<00:04:28.280> bush<00:04:28.460> legs<00:04:28.730> arms<00:04:29.150> and

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
capture in size from bush legs arms and

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.760 
capture in size from bush legs arms and
other<00:04:29.390> parts<00:04:30.370> back<00:04:31.370> and<00:04:32.170> here's<00:04:33.170> the<00:04:33.620> little

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
other parts back and here's the little

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.350 
other parts back and here's the little
beanie<00:04:33.980> effects<00:04:34.490> I<00:04:34.700> think<00:04:35.030> these<00:04:35.150> are<00:04:35.210> really

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
beanie effects I think these are really

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.730 
beanie effects I think these are really
cool<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:35.780> probably<00:04:36.080> gonna<00:04:36.200> pose<00:04:36.410> them<00:04:36.620> with

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
cool and probably gonna pose them with

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.690 
cool and probably gonna pose them with
these<00:04:36.919> as<00:04:37.100> well

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
these as well

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.790 
these as well
so<00:04:38.540> I<00:04:38.570> don't<00:04:38.900> know<00:04:38.990> I'm<00:04:39.290> really<00:04:39.440> designed

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
so I don't know I'm really designed

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.430 
so I don't know I'm really designed
between<00:04:40.100> the<00:04:40.220> shielding<00:04:40.610> rifle<00:04:41.420> or<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:41.900> sword

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
between the shielding rifle or the sword

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.510 
between the shielding rifle or the sword
bits<00:04:42.680> or<00:04:43.340> do<00:04:43.640> a<00:04:43.670> combination<00:04:45.130> some<00:04:46.130> more<00:04:46.250> red

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
bits or do a combination some more red

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.520 
bits or do a combination some more red
this<00:04:46.970> is<00:04:47.180> probably<00:04:47.600> for<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.960> little<00:04:48.260> side

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
this is probably for the little side

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.490 
this is probably for the little side
thrusters<00:04:49.420> all<00:04:50.420> right<00:04:50.540> if<00:04:50.780> you<00:04:50.930> get<00:04:51.260> some
