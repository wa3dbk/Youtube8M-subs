00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
that's released during pregnancy which

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.359 
that's released during pregnancy which
is<00:00:29.200> why<00:00:29.290> they<00:00:29.410> call<00:00:29.590> it<00:00:29.619> the<00:00:29.800> pregnancy<00:00:30.220> diet

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
gotcha the idea is very simple they

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.750 
gotcha the idea is very simple they
believe<00:00:32.680> in<00:00:32.829> this<00:00:32.890> diet<00:00:33.160> that<00:00:33.370> if<00:00:33.489> you<00:00:33.579> take

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
believe in this diet that if you take

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.270 
believe in this diet that if you take
HCG<00:00:34.030> you<00:00:34.570> will<00:00:34.720> mobilize<00:00:35.200> your<00:00:35.230> fat<00:00:35.680> stores<00:00:35.980> so

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
HCG you will mobilize your fat stores so

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.130 
HCG you will mobilize your fat stores so
you<00:00:36.340> decrease<00:00:36.700> your<00:00:36.730> fat<00:00:37.090> and<00:00:37.360> nourish<00:00:38.020> your

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
you decrease your fat and nourish your

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.780 
you decrease your fat and nourish your
body<00:00:38.290> that<00:00:38.560> way<00:00:38.770> but<00:00:38.830> also<00:00:39.100> you<00:00:39.310> calorie

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
body that way but also you calorie

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.970 
body that way but also you calorie
restrict<00:00:40.210> yourself<00:00:40.540> to<00:00:40.570> 500<00:00:41.500> calories<00:00:41.890> a<00:00:41.920> day

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
restrict yourself to 500 calories a day

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.550 
restrict yourself to 500 calories a day
so<00:00:42.670> it's<00:00:42.880> an<00:00:42.970> extremely<00:00:43.540> calorie<00:00:44.080> restrictive

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
so it's an extremely calorie restrictive

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.980 
so it's an extremely calorie restrictive
