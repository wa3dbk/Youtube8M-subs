00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.460
 people and welcome to a small one 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.880
 quick scoping between sasuke and me 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.590
 probably let ballet in again 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.480
 quite exciting duel between 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.379
 Both of us both know not bad 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.279
 I would say so or yes me 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:28.460
 know improved but do not care so know 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:28.460
 the average for me a bit 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.390
 directly times the first film makes 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.410
 Wednesday with I am I do not have 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.360
 realized that you were there at all 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.739
 I just wanted one up there, yes 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.260
 I saw it also with the panorama 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.190
 explosion on the left gets 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.770
 another guest play 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:04.340
 and that's where skp fraser comes from 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:04.340
 Direct injection reveals our clear 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.760
 not a bad cuba perhaps he sees 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.689
 but even from us but I have something 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.689
 just seen show yourself 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.759
 Although I can strongly from there is the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:36.140
 damn clear 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:36.140
 frasier kelsey jeffries page other places 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.110
 now i lay you my start micro lag 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.000
 no chance 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.670
 he does not play with the eleven 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.180
 my regular weapon just guessed 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.550
 he is probably right 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:06.220
 made 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:09.670
 it is what he does but no 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.620
 right fix koops what are you talking about? 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.330
 gtm of the first look in and see 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.540
 then first to the left or from 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.540
 the side 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.020
 I saw it 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:39.549
 You're talking about the other young boy here 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.549
 pieces 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.520
 no i wanted i just know myself 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:03:04.550
 seen or realized that we directly 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:06.920
 the fraser i think the name is really cool 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.030
 find advertising or for any 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.330
 washing machine bet 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:17.320
 the new trailer makes all eight ladies 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.320
 and the bad connection 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:37.940
 I have him but I ran better 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:41.710
 when i am with a weapon which is mine 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:46.550
 actually not not regular games 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:48.500
 but the power was right 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.740
 bad of you , they are not 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.920
 better I killed you what are you talking 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.920
 You there 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.610
 the game instead of leaving there was 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.760
 Kicked like pink or does not like 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.760
 more 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.160
 too bad that you again Vollmer 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:14.239
 usually only stretch normally 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.239
 not so much in arrears 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.100
 too bad that was 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.990
 Currently he plays really bad 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.410
 optionally play really well 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:32.030
 So better than now Saturday from the 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:35.700
 you do not put everything back in there 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.380
 yes I know now he has 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.760
 Me again for the first time you know that 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.050
 the problem is that I am there all the time 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.620
 any lex does not have that 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:47.880
 play smart just because you take on 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.380
 I would have to take up the case 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.020
 actually think about the ssd on because 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:05:02.130
 the much more practical where to get the 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:05.400
 nfg nfz too good but 11 was not like that 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:09.300
 good is why filter with the litter was 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.889
 that's the same with low as well 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.150
 low of the knives as at 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.150
 take battlefield 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.330
 barclays why I had long peep 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:27.840
 you can not be that 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:32.870
 It may not be a realistic one 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.870
 was right and realistic shows through 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:06:12.210
 I would probably be back anyway 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:06:14.639
 seen from the side the wheel with straight 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.550
 with him depends evil death fired to 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:23.969
 have so you it would not be even if 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:28.979
 would know where are you right now 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:31.369
 I did not run the plane in 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:31.369
 seen more 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:40.039
 one is not so good again 

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:40.039
 I'm proud of it 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.590
 This is 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.590
 Yes 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:07:01.010
 I agree but I wanted some 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.240
 I heard you 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.530
 I think clearly recognizable I think so 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.970
 must me it was must myself first so 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.750
 so far used to this life and 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.750
 to fix in the meantime 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:39.379
 shows itself free because it was there 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:42.199
 after a passive role and lines 

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:48.860
 I thought in the end he thought so too 

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:51.069
 but it was not even there 

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.069
 with me 

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.509
 okay no wonder was not so good 

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:59.620
 but first make cut really say 

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:59.620
 then until the next
