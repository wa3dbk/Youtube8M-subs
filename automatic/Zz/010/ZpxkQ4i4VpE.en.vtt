 hi everyone again how are you waiting 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.939
 Well, because today I will talk about your 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.860
 countries so I hope they do not get angry 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.750
 if you do not forget the last time of my 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.789
 prediction of the world we stay in 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.140
 group phase then now we go as 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.120
 eighth of final and if it gives us time 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.070
 until rooms before I will not say the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.660
 results because they get angry and have to 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.730
 listen to it with good audio now yes 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.800
 let's go in the first game is Brazil see 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.900
 Spain is difficult match for both 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.659
 equipment but in the end this turned out 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.059
 Brazil defeats the world champion or 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:50.219
 Brazil will go to the quarter in the second 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.930
 Mexico match against Chile match very 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.260
 exciting but a lot of emotion in the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.420
 match x so the match turned out 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.219
 mexico beats chile so Mexico pass to 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.170
 quarterfinals in the third match 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.000
 Greece against Italy a very match 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.830
 easy for italy so italy 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.080
 obviously he won to greece if greece 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.110
 is eliminated Italy went to quarters of 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.880
 final to play with the x dvi good 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.860
 we go with the next match in the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.509
 fourth match colombia against uruguay 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.399
 I do not want them to be angry if they are of these 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.140
 two countries and they lose theirs and I want 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.000
 let them know that both teams are very 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.800
 good but only one has to win and 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.600
 that was and will be for me 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.430
 uruguay I'm sorry but this team is 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.230
 good is not better or worse than colombia 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.270
 but I was checking and for me uruguay 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.950
 it's better we go with the next one 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.690
 the fifth game against France 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.880
 Argentina was very obvious that Argentina 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.920
 I was going to win if France went through repechage 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.840
 towards Argentina he won normally 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.940
 easy or difficult intermediate x of 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.670
 Argentina go to the quarterfinals 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.470
 French is removed sad face in 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.150
 the sixth match against Ecuador nigeria 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.700
 now before ecuador is better than 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.950
 nigeria but niger is very very good from 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.900
 1 to 10 18 x to see the match of 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.430
 mexico time in the xerez they will know that I say 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.470
 if it were not for the eight-year memo 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.480
 would have won in the seventh game 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.980
 German already faces Russia but first 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.260
 I want to say something this I take into account 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.060
 if Russia does not expel him from the World Cup if 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.980
 they do not know why it is because it seems that 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.840
 wants good war let's continue with the theme 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.030
 Russia against Germany a very match 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.790
 easy for germany towards germany happens to 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.310
 quarterfinals as always xd in the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.140
 last US game faces belgium 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.210
 a difficult match for both teams 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.950
 but this team beat belgium in the 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.900
 eliminator was very good I think that 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.670
 was in first second say in the 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.670
 comments where it was but 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.870
 well this has been all for today and it 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.760
 that was very short and I said that if we 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.680
 reach time I would do it quarters but 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.510
 I decided not to do it because that way every month 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.609
 would raise one until we are closer 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.319
 of the World Cup and remember not to get angry 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.239
 if he lost his team and if they give him dislike 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.829
 I want you to tell me why my mistake 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.840
 but it does not go to the error that your country does not 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.840
 step now if I say goodbye to all 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.050
 everyone 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.180
 therefore
