the<00:01:45.869> target<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.799> basically<00:01:47.100> what<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.340> does<00:01:47.430> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
the target so basically what it does is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.840 
the target so basically what it does is
it<00:01:48.030> takes<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.509> shadow<00:01:48.810> step<00:01:49.049> out<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.280> so

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
it takes the shadow step out for you so

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.760 
it takes the shadow step out for you so
with<00:01:51.540> shadow<00:01:51.780> step<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.380> shadows<00:01:52.649> up

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
with shadow step you have the shadows up

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.410 
with shadow step you have the shadows up
to<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> person<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.460> then<00:01:53.670> cheap<00:01:53.939> shot<00:01:54.180> them

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
