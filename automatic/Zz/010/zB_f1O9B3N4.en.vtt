liquid<00:00:02.429> text<00:00:02.700> paint<00:00:02.909> marker<00:00:03.210> review<00:00:03.540> this<00:00:03.659> is

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
liquid text paint marker review this is

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.630 
liquid text paint marker review this is
their<00:00:03.990> water-based<00:00:04.470> paint<00:00:04.770> marker<00:00:05.100> we've<00:00:05.520> got

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
their water-based paint marker we've got

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.160 
their water-based paint marker we've got
two<00:00:05.819> different<00:00:05.940> sizes<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.779> six<00:00:07.020> different

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
two different sizes and six different

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.960 
two different sizes and six different
colors<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.740> give<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.919> range<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.429> how<00:00:08.820> these

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
colors to give a range of how these

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.270 
colors to give a range of how these
really<00:00:09.240> work<00:00:09.389> out<00:00:09.570> so<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.679> smaller

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
really work out so this is a smaller

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.700 
really work out so this is a smaller
size<00:00:11.519> here<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:11.969> comes<00:00:12.150> with<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.710> different

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
size here it comes with a different

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.189 
size here it comes with a different
chisel<00:00:14.400> tip<00:00:14.549> which<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:14.969> actually<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.719> four

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
chisel tip which is actually a four

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.189 
chisel tip which is actually a four
millimeter<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:17.369> up<00:00:17.699> standard<00:00:18.630> size<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:19.020> guess

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
millimeter so up standard size I guess

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.870 
millimeter so up standard size I guess
for<00:00:19.470> some<00:00:19.500> chisel<00:00:20.039> tips<00:00:20.220> I've<00:00:20.400> used<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.789> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
for some chisel tips I've used in the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.150 
for some chisel tips I've used in the
past<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.080> larger<00:00:22.380> size<00:00:22.590> comes<00:00:22.890> with<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
past but the larger size comes with the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.429 
past but the larger size comes with the
standard<00:00:23.519> nib<00:00:23.730> 15<00:00:24.449> millimeters<00:00:24.930> there<00:00:25.170> so

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
standard nib 15 millimeters there so

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.670 
standard nib 15 millimeters there so
nice<00:00:25.740> big<00:00:25.949> square<00:00:26.310> nib<00:00:26.550> on<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:27.500> so<00:00:28.500> yeah

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
nice big square nib on that so yeah

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.050 
nice big square nib on that so yeah
let's<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:28.949> jump<00:00:29.250> into<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.580> with<00:00:29.730> some<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
let's just jump into it with some of the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.110 
let's just jump into it with some of the
smaller<00:00:30.330> one<00:00:31.309> first<00:00:32.309> off<00:00:32.550> we'll<00:00:32.669> be<00:00:32.820> doing<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
smaller one first off we'll be doing a

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:48.670 
smaller one first off we'll be doing a
square<00:00:33.420> with<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> medium<00:00:33.989> magenta

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:01:05.770 

next<00:00:49.680> up<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> phthalo<00:00:50.490> cyan<00:00:51.000> blue

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:20.850 

fluorescent<00:01:06.780> orange

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.580 

and<00:01:22.150> last<00:01:23.150> up<00:01:23.360> to<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:23.630> four<00:01:23.930> millimeter<00:01:24.320> chill

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
and last up to the four millimeter chill

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:42.610 
and last up to the four millimeter chill
tip<00:01:24.830> markers<00:01:25.130> we<00:01:25.280> have<00:01:25.370> cadmium<00:01:25.940> red

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.900 

alright<00:01:43.620> so<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> red<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.130> medium<00:01:44.490> magenta

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
alright so the red and medium magenta

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.540 
alright so the red and medium magenta
have<00:01:45.000> really<00:01:45.450> held<00:01:45.630> up<00:01:45.780> well<00:01:45.990> they<00:01:46.200> both<00:01:46.830> show

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
have really held up well they both show

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.700 
have really held up well they both show
to<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> most<00:01:48.390> opacity<00:01:48.990> first<00:01:49.230> off<00:01:49.440> but

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
to have the most opacity first off but

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.470 
to have the most opacity first off but
the<00:01:50.100> cleanest<00:01:50.490> lines<00:01:50.670> for<00:01:50.910> that<00:01:51.000> matter<00:01:51.210> I

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
the cleanest lines for that matter I

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.130 
the cleanest lines for that matter I
really<00:01:52.260> like<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.680> de<00:01:53.100> lo<00:01:53.280> cyan<00:01:53.670> blue<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:54.600> is

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
really like the de lo cyan blue this is

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.050 
really like the de lo cyan blue this is
a<00:01:55.350> lighter<00:01:55.680> color<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.130> allows<00:01:56.370> you<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.850> kind

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
a lighter color and allows you to kind

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.340 
a lighter color and allows you to kind
of<00:01:57.150> mix<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.510> as<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.080> straight-up

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
of mix it as if it's a straight-up

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.170 
of mix it as if it's a straight-up
acrylic<00:01:58.830> paint<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.340> I'll<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.790> interested<00:01:59.970> to

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
acrylic paint so I'll be interested to

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.180 
acrylic paint so I'll be interested to
use<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.720> but<00:02:01.020> um<00:02:01.200> pretty<00:02:01.740> much<00:02:01.860> straight<00:02:02.070> off

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
use that but um pretty much straight off

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.100 
use that but um pretty much straight off
the<00:02:02.310> board<00:02:02.580> all<00:02:02.940> of<00:02:03.180> them<00:02:03.330> when<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.570> went<00:02:03.810> fast

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the board all of them when I went fast

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.870 
the board all of them when I went fast
these<00:02:04.440> first<00:02:04.710> lines<00:02:04.979> they<00:02:05.550> were<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.729> little

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
these first lines they were a little

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.280 
these first lines they were a little
streaky<00:02:06.300> but<00:02:06.479> as<00:02:06.660> soon<00:02:06.840> as<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.020> slowed<00:02:07.170> them

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
streaky but as soon as I slowed them

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.249 
streaky but as soon as I slowed them
down<00:02:07.520> coverage<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.790> doing<00:02:09.570> a<00:02:09.630> film<00:02:09.869> no

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
down coverage and doing a film no

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.140 
down coverage and doing a film no
problem<00:02:10.590> there<00:02:10.800> with<00:02:10.950> those<00:02:11.070> so<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.910> really

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
problem there with those so I really

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.550 
problem there with those so I really
like<00:02:12.330> how<00:02:12.480> we<00:02:12.510> do<00:02:12.690> smaller<00:02:12.959> ones<00:02:13.200> work<00:02:13.410> out

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
like how we do smaller ones work out

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.370 
like how we do smaller ones work out
let's<00:02:13.800> check<00:02:14.010> out<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.250> larger<00:02:14.520> tagging<00:02:14.880> side

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
let's check out the larger tagging side

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:28.210 
let's check out the larger tagging side
this<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.650> cobalt<00:02:17.010> blue<00:02:23.000> cadmium<00:02:24.000> yellow

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.960 

alright<00:02:29.220> now<00:02:29.340> we're<00:02:29.489> going<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.670> take<00:02:29.820> these

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
alright now we're going to take these

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.760 
alright now we're going to take these
larger<00:02:30.330> sizes<00:02:30.540> outside<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.350> test<00:02:31.500> them<00:02:31.680> on

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
larger sizes outside and test them on

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:51.520 
larger sizes outside and test them on
some<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.130> Buried<00:02:32.400> surfaces

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:14.180

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
so after working with these markers for

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.240 
so after working with these markers for
a<00:03:32.810> little<00:03:33.020> while<00:03:33.200> now<00:03:33.440> I've<00:03:33.680> kind<00:03:33.860> of<00:03:33.950> got<00:03:34.100> my

me<00:03:44.810> I<00:03:44.990> had<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:45.410> really<00:03:45.590> go<00:03:45.770> slow<00:03:46.070> to<00:03:46.130> try<00:03:46.490> and

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
me I had to really go slow to try and

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.280 
me I had to really go slow to try and
get<00:03:46.730> that<00:03:46.880> even<00:03:47.150> coating<00:03:47.630> that<00:03:47.780> you<00:03:48.110> know<00:03:48.230> you

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
get that even coating that you know you

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.560 
get that even coating that you know you
saw<00:03:48.560> on<00:03:48.710> here<00:03:49.070> but<00:03:49.550> that<00:03:49.970> being<00:03:50.150> said<00:03:50.240> it

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
saw on here but that being said it

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.600 
saw on here but that being said it
really<00:03:50.810> wasn't<00:03:50.960> a<00:03:51.140> practical<00:03:51.890> speed<00:03:52.310> for

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
really wasn't a practical speed for

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.850 
really wasn't a practical speed for
myself<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:53.630> it's<00:03:54.080> unfortunate<00:03:54.260> for<00:03:54.770> these

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
myself so it's unfortunate for these

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.070 
myself so it's unfortunate for these
larger<00:03:55.220> size<00:03:55.400> didn't<00:03:55.910> flow<00:03:56.420> as<00:03:56.630> well<00:03:56.840> as<00:03:56.990> I

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
larger size didn't flow as well as I

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.200 
larger size didn't flow as well as I
would<00:03:57.140> have<00:03:57.260> liked<00:03:57.560> that<00:03:58.160> being<00:03:58.670> said<00:03:58.910> they

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
would have liked that being said they

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.250 
would have liked that being said they
worked<00:03:59.450> well<00:03:59.780> in<00:04:00.140> a<00:04:00.200> really<00:04:01.070> standard<00:04:01.490> like<00:04:01.790> no

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
worked well in a really standard like no

worked well in a really standard like no
background<00:04:03.280> situation<00:04:04.330> but<00:04:05.330> overall<00:04:05.720> you

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
background situation but overall you

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.690 
background situation but overall you
know<00:04:06.110> that<00:04:06.620> step<00:04:07.040> was<00:04:07.190> something<00:04:07.460> that<00:04:07.490> could

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
know that step was something that could

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.240 
know that step was something that could
be<00:04:07.730> improved<00:04:08.030> on<00:04:08.330> but<00:04:09.260> these<00:04:09.530> smaller<00:04:09.830> ones<00:04:10.070> I

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
be improved on but these smaller ones I

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.280 
be improved on but these smaller ones I
really<00:04:10.640> like<00:04:10.820> them<00:04:10.970> they<00:04:11.120> float<00:04:11.390> well<00:04:12.020> enough

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
really like them they float well enough

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.840 
really like them they float well enough
that<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:12.530> could<00:04:12.590> use<00:04:12.830> them<00:04:13.040> in<00:04:13.070> tag<00:04:13.460> or<00:04:13.640> anything

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
that I could use them in tag or anything

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.080 
that I could use them in tag or anything
use<00:04:14.270> them<00:04:14.480> in<00:04:15.260> really<00:04:16.070> any<00:04:16.250> situation<00:04:16.430> I<00:04:16.880> can

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
how much better they worked compared to

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.030 
how much better they worked compared to
the<00:04:31.790> larger<00:04:32.150> ones<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:32.840> you<00:04:33.590> know<00:04:33.680> that<00:04:33.890> being

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
the larger ones and you know that being

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.950 
the larger ones and you know that being
said<00:04:34.130> it's<00:04:34.790> something<00:04:35.060> for<00:04:35.330> liquitex<00:04:35.690> maybe

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960

to<00:04:36.080> work<00:04:36.169> on<00:04:36.410> but<00:04:36.770> overall<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.580> larger<00:04:37.910> ones

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
to work on but overall the larger ones

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.350 
to work on but overall the larger ones
not<00:04:38.300> so<00:04:38.510> great<00:04:38.950> maybe<00:04:39.950> I<00:04:40.160> I<00:04:40.640> thought<00:04:41.090> it<00:04:41.240> was

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
not so great maybe I I thought it was

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.909 
not so great maybe I I thought it was
one<00:04:41.660> of<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.810> markers<00:04:42.110> but<00:04:42.320> both<00:04:42.440> of<00:04:42.470> them<00:04:42.650> kind

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
one of the markers but both of them kind

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.890 
one of the markers but both of them kind
of<00:04:42.980> held<00:04:43.340> up<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.610> that<00:04:43.730> same<00:04:43.970> standard<00:04:44.270> the

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
of held up to that same standard the

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.170 
of held up to that same standard the
nibs<00:04:45.290> works<00:04:45.530> great<00:04:45.770> they<00:04:46.040> I<00:04:46.520> didn't<00:04:46.820> write<00:04:47.090> out

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
nibs works great they I didn't write out

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.940 
nibs works great they I didn't write out
too<00:04:47.419> tough<00:04:47.630> of<00:04:47.750> services<00:04:48.290> but<00:04:48.500> they<00:04:48.620> held<00:04:48.800> up

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
too tough of services but they held up

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.100 
too tough of services but they held up
totally<00:04:49.280> fine<00:04:49.490> so<00:04:49.850> that<00:04:50.270> shouldn't<00:04:50.870> be<00:04:51.020> an

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
totally fine so that shouldn't be an

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.860 
totally fine so that shouldn't be an
issue<00:04:51.200> but<00:04:51.740> overall<00:04:52.430> you<00:04:52.880> know<00:04:53.000> paint<00:04:53.540> markers
