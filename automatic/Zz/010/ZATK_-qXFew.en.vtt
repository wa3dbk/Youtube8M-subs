 tremendous the fall of the goalkeeper of 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.010
 villarreal they are trying 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.510

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.829

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.760
 tremendous 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.420
 upside down 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.420
 and we see it 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.430
 the neck the head this we have 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.390
 it is completely 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.390
 still 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.220
 especially the neck practically 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.810
 supporting all the weight of his body in the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.619
 head the head 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.110
 and well, that is why it was left lying on 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:21.570
 the soil when these things happen what 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.570
 more natalia desire is expected right away 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.490
 that it moves the hand to move 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.189
 move the hand the athlete in this case 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.520
 the goalkeeper is now and I am left more 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:35.579
 quiet because it's that good 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.350
 these things unfortunately have happened 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.380
 in the world of football and we always take 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.090
 wood and nothing bad happens and it appears 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.140
 that sweeps cheering sergio asenjo but 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.960
 it is evident that this fall has been 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.429
 tremendous already when we saw it in the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.740
 direct clear the goalkeeper 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.569
 natalia good you are a coach 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.810
 he has to do that but clearly the fall 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:57.509
 is unpredictable often does have is 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.340
 very risky that that action in 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.719
 of the goalkeepers in corners in 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.689
 side faults where you have to 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.250
 to go looking at values â€‹â€‹is a career 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.579
 lateral you find people you 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.840
 you encounter obstacles that you do not control 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.299
 that you suddenly collide with the body and 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.630
 there clearly the impact is in the area below 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:19.350
 It totally unbalances you but look 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:22.310
 Christmas bears in the center of the neck 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.310
 read a truck
