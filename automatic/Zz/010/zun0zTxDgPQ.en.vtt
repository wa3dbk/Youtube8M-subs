00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840

polishes I could have done two separate
videos<00:00:10.139> as<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.889> definitely<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.340> more

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
videos as this is definitely the more

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.070 
videos as this is definitely the more
orange<00:00:11.849> colors<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.509> these<00:00:12.660> are<00:00:12.840> definitely

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
orange colors and these are definitely

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.470 
orange colors and these are definitely
the<00:00:13.259> more<00:00:13.410> Coralie<00:00:13.980> peachy<00:00:14.429> colors<00:00:14.790> but<00:00:15.450> I

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
the more Coralie peachy colors but I

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.460 
the more Coralie peachy colors but I
thought<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.870> would<00:00:15.960> just<00:00:16.109> throw<00:00:16.199> them<00:00:16.379> all

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
thought it would just throw them all

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.930 
thought it would just throw them all
together<00:00:16.619> because<00:00:17.070> these<00:00:17.190> are<00:00:17.369> kind<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.640> how<00:00:17.910> I

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
together because these are kind of how I

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.880 
together because these are kind of how I
have<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.660> them<00:00:18.810> all<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.199> same<00:00:19.439> row<00:00:19.680> on

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
have I have them all in the same row on

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.189 
have I have them all in the same row on
my<00:00:19.920> nail<00:00:20.220> polish<00:00:20.580> rack<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.840> just<00:00:22.050> thought

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
my nail polish rack and I just thought

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.960 
my nail polish rack and I just thought
it'd<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.350> easier<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:22.769> make<00:00:23.100> one<00:00:23.369> video<00:00:23.550> of

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
it'd be easier just make one video of

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.630 
it'd be easier just make one video of
all<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.359> them<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:25.199> I'm<00:00:25.680> gonna<00:00:25.830> actually<00:00:26.400> zoom

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
all of them but I'm gonna actually zoom

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.490 
all of them but I'm gonna actually zoom
in<00:00:26.789> close<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.449> actually<00:00:27.599> see<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
in close so you can actually see the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.470 
in close so you can actually see the
swatch<00:00:28.830> against<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.519> color<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> bottle<00:00:30.390> I

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
swatch against the color of the bottle I

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.530 
swatch against the color of the bottle I
have<00:00:30.510> ten<00:00:31.109> color<00:00:31.590> swatched<00:00:32.130> for<00:00:32.520> you

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
have ten color swatched for you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.420 
have ten color swatched for you
and<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.870> did<00:00:34.079> want<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.410> mention<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.370> I

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
and I did want to just mention that I

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.910 
and I did want to just mention that I
did<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.180> same<00:00:36.210> for<00:00:36.480> every<00:00:37.050> single<00:00:37.380> nail<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.739> use

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
did the same for every single nail I use

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.610 
did the same for every single nail I use
the<00:00:38.129> Milani<00:00:38.460> smooth<00:00:38.940> base<00:00:39.239> coat<00:00:39.600> as<00:00:39.809> my<00:00:40.379> base

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the Milani smooth base coat as my base

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.470 
the Milani smooth base coat as my base
and<00:00:40.649> then<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.040> did<00:00:41.219> two<00:00:41.430> coats<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.879> each<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.450> I

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
and then I did two coats on each and I

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.380 
and then I did two coats on each and I
didn't<00:00:42.750> do<00:00:42.840> any<00:00:43.110> topcoat<00:00:43.980> which<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.149> see

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
didn't do any topcoat which you can see

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.209 
didn't do any topcoat which you can see
is<00:00:45.539> unfortunate<00:00:46.170> because<00:00:46.320> some<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.950> these

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
is unfortunate because some of these

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.330 
is unfortunate because some of these
actually<00:00:47.550> really<00:00:48.210> need<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.690> top<00:00:48.930> coat<00:00:49.200> first<00:00:50.100> up

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
actually really need a top coat first up

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.939 
actually really need a top coat first up

if<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> camera<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.629> picking<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:04.080> up<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.379> it

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
if the camera is picking it up but it

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.130 
if the camera is picking it up but it
does<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> bit<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.700> matte<00:01:06.000> finish<00:01:06.299> not<00:01:06.780> so

does have a bit of a matte finish not so

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.520 
does have a bit of a matte finish not so
much<00:01:08.299> that<00:01:09.299> noticeable<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.110> definitely

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
much that noticeable but I definitely

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530 
much that noticeable but I definitely
would<00:01:10.710> put<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.130> top<00:01:11.369> coat<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.210> color

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
would put a top coat on with this color

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.240 
would put a top coat on with this color
this<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.960> obviously<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.500> brightest<00:01:13.979> color

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
this is obviously the brightest color

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.630 
this is obviously the brightest color
but<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.909> did<00:01:15.119> want<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.509> throw<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.900> here

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
but I did want to just throw it in here

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.960 
but I did want to just throw it in here
next<00:01:17.640> step<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.320> this<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.560> ESI's<00:01:20.070> Brazil<00:01:20.700> net

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
which I wasn't expecting and just to

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.380 
which I wasn't expecting and just to
compare<00:04:39.330> like<00:04:40.200> here's<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:41.070> neon<00:04:41.580> orange<00:04:41.970> and

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
compare like here's the neon orange and

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.030 
compare like here's the neon orange and
then<00:04:42.450> here's<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.970> SC<00:04:44.970> action<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:45.900> even<00:04:46.890> the

neon<00:04:47.370> orange<00:04:47.640> looks<00:04:48.150> better<00:04:48.450> than<00:04:48.990> this<00:04:49.740> one

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
neon orange looks better than this one

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.690 
neon orange looks better than this one
being<00:04:51.150> that<00:04:51.240> they're<00:04:51.540> both<00:04:51.690> mad<00:04:52.020> but<00:04:52.890> I<00:04:53.160> don't

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.740 
like this color at all actually and then
I<00:04:58.890> did<00:04:59.130> throw<00:04:59.370> in<00:04:59.550> as<00:04:59.760> these<00:04:59.970> cute<00:05:00.360> as<00:05:00.480> a<00:05:00.510> button

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
I did throw in as these cute as a button

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.450 
I did throw in as these cute as a button
even<00:05:01.080> though<00:05:01.320> this<00:05:01.530> leans<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:01.980> little<00:05:02.010> bit<00:05:02.310> more

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
even though this leans a little bit more

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.010 
even though this leans a little bit more
on<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.670> pink<00:05:02.910> side<00:05:03.150> but<00:05:03.450> I<00:05:03.480> did<00:05:03.720> want<00:05:03.870> to<00:05:03.930> just

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020
