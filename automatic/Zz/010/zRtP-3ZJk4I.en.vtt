he<00:01:29.939> doesn't<00:01:30.210> really<00:01:30.329> like<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.630> take<00:01:30.780> damage<00:01:31.020> he

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
he doesn't really like to take damage he

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.080 
he doesn't really like to take damage he
doesn't<00:01:31.560> really<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:31.920> take<00:01:32.220> abuse<00:01:32.549> so

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
doesn't really like take abuse so

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.700 
doesn't really like take abuse so
whenever<00:01:33.360> he<00:01:33.540> gets<00:01:33.630> hit<00:01:33.869> he<00:01:34.259> healed<00:01:34.560> himself

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
whenever he gets hit he healed himself

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.590 
whenever he gets hit he healed himself
up<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.369> sat<00:01:35.520> full<00:01:35.729> health<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.329> he<00:01:36.420> doesn't

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
up so we sat full health so he doesn't

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.609 
up so we sat full health so he doesn't
really<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.900> worry<00:01:36.930> about<00:01:37.200> anymore<00:01:37.439> and

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
really have to worry about anymore and

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.170 
really have to worry about anymore and
that's<00:01:37.680> kind<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.310> reasoning<00:01:39.060> behind

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
that's kind of like the reasoning behind

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.850 
that's kind of like the reasoning behind
why<00:01:39.509> restoration<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.259> important<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:40.680> this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
why restoration is so important for this

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.800 
why restoration is so important for this
build<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.369> heavy<00:01:41.820> armor<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.479> reason<00:01:42.720> why

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
build so heavy armor the reason why

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.090 
build so heavy armor the reason why
you're<00:01:42.990> doing<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.530> because<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.040> said

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
you're doing this is because like I said

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.399 
you're doing this is because like I said
he<00:01:44.549> doesn't<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.090> take<00:01:45.270> hits<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.750> what's

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
he doesn't like to take hits and what's

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.139 
he doesn't like to take hits and what's
the<00:01:46.560> best<00:01:46.710> way<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.159> take<00:01:47.430> hits<00:01:47.640> very<00:01:47.939> hard

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
the best way to not take hits very hard

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.270 
the best way to not take hits very hard
heavy<00:01:48.659> armor<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.170> though<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.920> doesn't<00:01:50.070> really

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
heavy armor and though it doesn't really

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.130 
heavy armor and though it doesn't really
make<00:01:50.430> sense<00:01:50.460> with<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.850> Acrobat<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:51.869> there<00:01:52.049> is

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
make sense with the Acrobat but there is

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.630 
make sense with the Acrobat but there is
a<00:01:52.170> perk<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.950> heavy<00:01:53.130> armor<00:01:53.340> called

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
a perk and the heavy armor called

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.760 
a perk and the heavy armor called
conditioning<00:01:54.240> which<00:01:54.600> allows<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.259> run

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
conditioning which allows you to run

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.010 
conditioning which allows you to run
around<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:57.270> heavy<00:01:57.509> armor<00:01:57.689> doesn't

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
around and the heavy armor doesn't

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.080 
around and the heavy armor doesn't
weight<00:01:58.259> anything<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.549> good<00:01:59.850> and

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
weight anything so it's really good and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.370 
weight anything so it's really good and
kind<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.390> still<00:02:00.630> fits<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.020> with<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.350> whole

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
kind of still fits in with the whole

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.260 
kind of still fits in with the whole
acrobatic<00:02:02.219> feel<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.729> running<00:02:03.030> around<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
acrobatic feel of running around the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.030 
acrobatic feel of running around the
battlefield<00:02:03.509> quickly<00:02:04.049> like<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.530> said<00:02:04.710> earlier

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
battlefield quickly like I said earlier

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.100 
battlefield quickly like I said earlier
you'll<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.579> using<00:02:05.729> one-handed<00:02:06.210> maces<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.049> you

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
you'll be using one-handed maces so you

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.240 
you'll be using one-handed maces so you
want<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> make<00:02:07.439> sure<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.649> get<00:02:07.799> points<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
want to make sure you get points in the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.580 
want to make sure you get points in the
one-handed<00:02:08.640> tree<00:02:08.869> especially<00:02:09.869> bone<00:02:10.259> breaker

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
one-handed tree especially bone breaker

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.690 
one-handed tree especially bone breaker
which<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:10.950> really<00:02:11.190> good<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.370> ignore<00:02:11.640> armor

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
which is really good to ignore armor

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.390 
which is really good to ignore armor
to<00:02:13.270> hit<00:02:13.569> your<00:02:13.750> enemy<00:02:14.020> harder<00:02:14.560> so<00:02:15.129> you<00:02:15.190> also

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
to hit your enemy harder so you also

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.490 
to hit your enemy harder so you also
could<00:02:15.610> be<00:02:15.640> using<00:02:16.030> archery<00:02:16.569> and<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.290> want<00:02:17.440> to

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
could be using archery and you want to

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.900 
could be using archery and you want to
make<00:02:17.590> sure<00:02:17.739> you<00:02:17.950> get<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.220> Ranger<00:02:18.670> perk

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
make sure you get the Ranger perk

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.610 
make sure you get the Ranger perk
because<00:02:19.269> it<00:02:19.390> allows<00:02:19.599> you<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:20.260> move<00:02:20.410> faster

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
because it allows you to move faster

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.740 
because it allows you to move faster
with<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.040> bodhran<00:02:21.519> and<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:22.060> gives<00:02:22.269> more<00:02:22.480> into

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
with the bodhran and it gives more into

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.809 
with the bodhran and it gives more into
that<00:02:22.870> Acrobat<00:02:23.470> feel<00:02:23.860> of<00:02:24.129> running<00:02:24.670> around

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
that Acrobat feel of running around

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.390 
that Acrobat feel of running around
quickly<00:02:25.269> without<00:02:25.599> getting<00:02:25.780> hit<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:27.069> then<00:02:27.220> of

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
quickly without getting hit and then of

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.949 
quickly without getting hit and then of
course<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.790> have<00:02:27.940> some<00:02:28.150> sneak<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.599> be<00:02:28.690> able<00:02:28.810> to

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
course you have some sneak to be able to

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.839 
course you have some sneak to be able to
use<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.800> can<00:02:29.830> get<00:02:30.010> dead<00:02:30.250> through<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.400> aim<00:02:30.580> to

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
use you can get dead through the aim to

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.460 
use you can get dead through the aim to
get<00:02:31.000> your<00:02:31.120> sneaky<00:02:31.390> text<00:02:31.720> with<00:02:31.870> your<00:02:32.019> bow<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.349> do

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
get your sneaky text with your bow to do

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.020 
get your sneaky text with your bow to do
a<00:02:32.500> little<00:02:32.590> bit<00:02:32.739> more<00:02:32.890> damage<00:02:33.099> and<00:02:33.459> this<00:02:33.849> is

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
a little bit more damage and this is

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.000 
a little bit more damage and this is
really<00:02:34.180> good<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.690> avoid<00:02:34.989> combat<00:02:35.410> because<00:02:35.800> like

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
really good to avoid combat because like

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.470 
really good to avoid combat because like
I<00:02:36.130> said<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.819> don't<00:02:37.030> really<00:02:37.120> want<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.390> take

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.570 
I said you don't really want to take
combat<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:38.019> your<00:02:38.380> character<00:02:38.769> hates<00:02:39.040> combat

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
Skyrim so let's go ahead and talk about

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.100 
Skyrim so let's go ahead and talk about
the<00:02:48.250> weapons<00:02:48.819> and<00:02:49.120> armor<00:02:49.420> like<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.900> said<00:02:50.080> a

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
the weapons and armor like I said a

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.780 
the weapons and armor like I said a
little<00:02:50.349> bit<00:02:50.470> earlier<00:02:50.620> you'll<00:02:51.280> be<00:02:51.370> using<00:02:51.519> heavy

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
little bit earlier you'll be using heavy

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.759 
little bit earlier you'll be using heavy
armor<00:02:52.090> so<00:02:52.420> any<00:02:52.599> real<00:02:52.930> heavy<00:02:53.230> armor<00:02:53.530> of<00:02:53.650> your

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
armor so any real heavy armor of your

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.220 
armor so any real heavy armor of your
choice<00:02:54.099> would<00:02:54.970> really<00:02:55.180> work<00:02:55.420> in<00:02:55.630> this<00:02:55.959> build

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
choice would really work in this build

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.979 
choice would really work in this build
even<00:02:56.590> decides<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.549> use<00:02:57.579> daedric<00:02:58.299> armor<00:02:58.390> which

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
even decides to use daedric armor which

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.449 
even decides to use daedric armor which
i<00:02:59.110> think<00:02:59.170> is<00:02:59.349> pretty<00:02:59.590> cool<00:02:59.829> and<00:03:00.099> it's<00:03:00.280> probably

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
i think is pretty cool and it's probably

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.069 
i think is pretty cool and it's probably
one<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.819> highest<00:03:01.000> armor<00:03:01.390> rating<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.930> the

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
one of the highest armor rating and the

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.470 
one of the highest armor rating and the
game<00:03:02.349> so<00:03:02.890> I'd<00:03:03.040> recommend<00:03:03.190> using<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.819> unless

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
game so I'd recommend using that unless

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.180 
game so I'd recommend using that unless
you<00:03:04.690> want<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:05.019> different<00:03:05.260> type<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.680> heavy<00:03:05.950> armor

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
you want a different type of heavy armor

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.530 
you want a different type of heavy armor
to<00:03:06.370> really<00:03:06.670> roleplay<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.150> little<00:03:07.299> bit<00:03:07.390> better

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
to really roleplay a little bit better

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.870 
to really roleplay a little bit better
day<00:03:08.440> 2<00:03:08.500> works<00:03:08.890> fine<00:03:09.099> is<00:03:09.340> probably<00:03:09.579> one<00:03:09.730> of<00:03:09.760> the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
day 2 works fine is probably one of the

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.449 
day 2 works fine is probably one of the
best<00:03:10.030> in<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.269> game<00:03:10.420> also<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.560> Daedric<00:03:12.010> weapon

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
best in the game also a Daedric weapon

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.120 
best in the game also a Daedric weapon
would<00:03:12.610> be<00:03:12.640> pretty<00:03:12.970> good<00:03:13.150> i<00:03:13.209> use<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.569> JJ<00:03:13.900> mace<00:03:14.560> to

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
would be pretty good i use a JJ mace to

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.000 
would be pretty good i use a JJ mace to
be<00:03:15.280> able<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.640> do<00:03:16.180> damage<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:16.599> enemies<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.709> I

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
be able to do damage to enemies and I

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.710 
be able to do damage to enemies and I
think<00:03:18.220> it's<00:03:18.340> pretty<00:03:18.519> good<00:03:18.670> as<00:03:18.850> well<00:03:19.000> because

think it's pretty good as well because

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.090 
think it's pretty good as well because

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
have more like acrobatic few because I

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.689 
have more like acrobatic few because I

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
health and the reason behind that is

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.279 
health and the reason behind that is
since<00:04:48.940> you<00:04:49.030> were<00:04:49.180> abused<00:04:49.569> as<00:04:49.720> child<00:04:49.960> you<00:04:50.110> kind

more<00:05:10.120> acrobatic<00:05:10.449> feel<00:05:11.319> I<00:05:11.590> think<00:05:12.400> there's<00:05:12.699> one

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
more acrobatic feel I think there's one

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.129 
more acrobatic feel I think there's one
thing<00:05:12.849> I<00:05:13.060> forgot<00:05:13.090> I<00:05:13.389> thought<00:05:13.720> about<00:05:13.840> the

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
thing I forgot I thought about the

standing<00:05:14.680> stone<00:05:14.979> I<00:05:15.220> always<00:05:16.030> loved<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.449> Lord

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
standing stone I always loved the Lord

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.899 
standing stone I always loved the Lord
stone<00:05:17.080> gives<00:05:17.680> you<00:05:17.770> more<00:05:17.919> health<00:05:18.190> &amp;<00:05:18.370> magicka

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
but if you're starting off the game I'd

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.950 
but if you're starting off the game I'd
probably<00:05:21.159> pick<00:05:21.460> up<00:05:21.639> the<00:05:21.789> warrior<00:05:22.150> stone<00:05:22.449> that

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
probably pick up the warrior stone that

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.689 
probably pick up the warrior stone that
way<00:05:23.169> you<00:05:23.229> can<00:05:23.470> get<00:05:23.620> your<00:05:23.800> warrior<00:05:24.099> skills<00:05:24.220> up<00:05:24.580> a

way you can get your warrior skills up a

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.430
