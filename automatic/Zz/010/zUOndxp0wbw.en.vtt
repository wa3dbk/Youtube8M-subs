00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 more than three years of travel by the five 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.529
 continents and everything on board a bike 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.150
 more than 40 thousand photos in addition to 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.690
 a website a book 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:20.730
 know the cyclical epic of the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:23.699
 adventurer to simon 46 countries 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.010
 three years and two months pedaling actor 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.680
 Simon decided to make a dream come true. 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.929
 unveil the world by bike 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.420
 I read a sedentary life in the sense of 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.820
 live on site not only sedentary 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.680
 to be alone on the sofa without a nomadic life 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.629
 then completely changed lifestyle 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.670
 nor worse he had already transported with 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.129
 a big turn inside of me 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.930
 know had ever known enough and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.160
 of that I wanted to see what one wants 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.920
 outside world 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.250
 in law he has left 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.329
 everything went behind patronage and embarked 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.129
 in this adventure 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.010
 in drawing the script he gave preference 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.180
 least visited countries in 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.010
 unknown 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.739
 what I came across in the world like this 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.960
 traveling is that sometimes I expected a 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.970
 certain authenticity of the world in that 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.950
 Thing thing you thought arrived in thailand 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.400
 or passing through the villages involved a 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.170
 thing that I never imagined and hence not 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.180
 arrived in a village in the homeland 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.790
 everybody wants or sunday 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.220
 you know neither the money nor the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.979
 much but's already so I started to 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.840
 preparing with the world is very 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.759
 many symptoms of this great tourism that 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.409
 We've been seeing each other for years. 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.420
 so much so that this is reflected in the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.509
 countries that I liked the most 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.430
 So for me to tie in were the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.329
 best amazing countries where 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.850
 I passed 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.130
 precisely because he had no tourist 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.049
 almost and here I am going to show a little 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.880
 him what it is this palace here 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:58.140
 thousands of years 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:01.829
 built on death stone 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.299
 so risks nee and never know how much 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.119
 near arrived but I know I arrived 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.429
 because I suffered two accidents was a 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.349
 rollover of a bus that was incredible 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.990
 I was traveling already for almost two years. 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.290
 I was in the neighborhood 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.350
 and almost never got transport there 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.120
 all she can do a bike 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.590
 he was in dubai I had to take a 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.870
 new passport that it was 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.480
 exhausted full of affection full of 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.860
 sticker and thence went to abu dhabi 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.080
 And that day I told how I gotta 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.540
 back I'll take a bus was the biggest 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.730
 the last 15 years of the neighborhood and 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.980
 hence the bus flipped on the road and in the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.530
 second, it was already in Turkey that the bus 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.270
 actually got on the road and arrived 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.250
 to get over me but played to 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.560
 I got run over hard, I said. 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.280
 commented Sainz after the money that gives 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.460
 to see here the teaching the bags ready 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.610
 without hands with suitcases in front is 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.830
 very difficult to get to know the 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.010
 customs of each country to act ask the 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.330
 hosting in the house of the residents and is a 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.160
 muslim country 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.330
 I often want the man to come 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.600
 talk to me that I was the only one who had 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.950
 a condition for which he was married and hence 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.990
 as the woman can not stay in the same 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.840
 test under the same roof as a man 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.910
 unknown how I put the 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.430
 woman out twice in their 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.740
 parents or I do not know the neighbor's house and so 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.630
 I slept through the house in yours, that's 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.090
 Weird to us, to them, it 's mine. 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.790
 normal but this shows the quality of this 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.190
 We did not even receive with our told the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.360
 Sometimes I say goodbye and they cry. 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.360
 at the time of the team asking 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.910
 here you can see another 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.440
 difficulty that accompanied during the 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.500
 trip that they are or that is 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.240
 sometimes it is because 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.880
 not that I asked the escort 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.070
 for me I would go alone but from the 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.620
 moment the policeman and someone else's 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.320
 My army, pedaling, have already called the 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.210
 next police post and then I do not 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.640
 I was not allowed to pedal if I did not 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.980
 had a school and then the police officer 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.880
 I would only stay 24 hours with me. 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.880
 changing police 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.330
 whenever he arrived in the place with internet 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.170
 he updated the site with stories and 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.110
 Photos 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.060
 in all were 40 thousand records 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.700
 now the best moments of the trip 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.950
 are told in this book that will be 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.930
 launched tomorrow in são paulo 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.670
 I continue to book that after I 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.660
 I went back, I could not pack 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:32.000
 It took me six months to get 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.790
 everything in the bag is fine this is a symptom 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.830
 a little madness even to create 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.600
 courage to speak not now what I do not 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.919
 I'm going to the world because I had 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.140
 that feeling that I could leave 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.960
 from now on you know if you keep 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.820
 I still feel that I feel 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.430
 I was already in love 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.960
 I'm taking roots, andré, there you are. 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.940
 think I said that the soul is still 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.770
 I was there I went back but it's a 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.340
 proof where the cars are back and now 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.340
 is at home
