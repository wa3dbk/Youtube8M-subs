00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
together two legato passages the first

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.030 
together two legato passages the first
is<00:00:24.300> using<00:00:24.450> the<00:00:24.630> default<00:00:25.110> flip<00:00:25.560> legato

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
is using the default flip legato

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.130 
is using the default flip legato
transitions<00:00:26.759> and<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.329> second<00:00:27.689> melody<00:00:27.960> is

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
transitions and the second melody is

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.530 
transitions and the second melody is
being<00:00:28.410> slurred<00:00:28.849> for<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.939> purpose<00:00:30.270> of<00:00:30.390> this

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540 
being slurred for the purpose of this

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.569 
being slurred for the purpose of this
demonstration<00:00:30.779> I've<00:00:31.500> left<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.860> dynamic<00:00:32.340> set

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
demonstration I've left the dynamic set

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.940 
demonstration I've left the dynamic set
at<00:00:32.790> an<00:00:32.940> even<00:00:33.149> mezzo<00:00:33.600> Forte<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.320> both<00:00:34.470> passages

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950

at an even mezzo Forte for both passages
with<00:00:35.640> no<00:00:35.910> programmed<00:00:36.450> expression<00:00:53.120> now<00:00:54.120> let's

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
with no programmed expression now let's

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:12.590 
with no programmed expression now let's
switch<00:00:54.630> to<00:00:54.690> slur<00:01:10.700> you<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.880> switch<00:01:12.090> from<00:01:12.119> solo

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
switch to slur you can switch from solo

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.899 
switch to slur you can switch from solo
to<00:01:13.110> duet<00:01:13.439> mode<00:01:13.679> which<00:01:14.189> allows<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.670> play

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
to duet mode which allows you to play

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.999 
to duet mode which allows you to play
two<00:01:15.359> legato<00:01:15.780> melodies<00:01:16.229> at<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> same<00:01:16.740> time

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
make sure to keep them separated by at

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:33.440 
make sure to keep them separated by at
least<00:01:19.530> six<00:01:19.979> semitones

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.880 

you<00:01:34.450> can<00:01:34.600> further<00:01:34.870> tweak<00:01:35.230> the<00:01:35.380> response<00:01:35.770> of

you can further tweak the response of

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.250 
you can further tweak the response of
legato<00:01:36.250> with<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.610> response<00:01:37.090> slider<00:01:37.660> for
