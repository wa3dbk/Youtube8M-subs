00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
really tight so then we're going to skip

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.929 
really tight so then we're going to skip
a<00:01:48.450> sub<00:01:49.079> hole<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:50.040> come<00:01:50.490> down<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.880> one

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
a sub hole and come down to this one

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.940

come down to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.420 
come down to
this<00:02:14.110> one<00:02:14.320> right<00:02:14.470> here<00:02:14.530> says<00:02:14.950> skip<00:02:15.190> that<00:02:15.370> one

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
this one right here says skip that one

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.230 
this one right here says skip that one
and<00:02:15.960> then<00:02:16.960> interlock<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.770> third<00:02:18.280> diamond<00:02:19.090> of

to<00:02:22.660> skip<00:02:22.840> another<00:02:23.040> sidewalls<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.820> skipping

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
to skip another sidewalls so skipping

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.660 
to skip another sidewalls so skipping
this<00:02:25.480> one<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.620> coming<00:02:27.070> down<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.400> this<00:02:27.490> one

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
this one and coming down to this one

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.720 
this one and coming down to this one
right<00:02:27.820> here<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:29.590> skip<00:02:30.250> that<00:02:30.280> one

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
right here so skip that one

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.170 
right here so skip that one
into<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.180> outside<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.080> one<00:02:32.260> and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
into the outside of that one and

into the outside of that one and
interlock<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.480> fourth<00:02:34.990> mesh<00:02:35.530> hole<00:02:35.770> down

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
interlock the fourth mesh hole down

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.670 
interlock the fourth mesh hole down
that's<00:02:36.280> gonna<00:02:36.480> create<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.570> channel<00:02:37.990> and<00:02:38.140> it's<00:02:38.530> a

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
that's gonna create a channel and it's a

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.600 
that's gonna create a channel and it's a
mid<00:02:38.860> low<00:02:39.040> we're<00:02:39.190> going<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.370> pull<00:02:39.520> the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
mid low we're going to pull the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.810 
mid low we're going to pull the
challenge<00:02:39.940> just<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.090> little<00:02:40.360> lower<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:42.610> without

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
challenge just a little lower so without

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.450 
challenge just a little lower so without
skipping<00:02:43.060> any<00:02:43.330> holes<00:02:43.510> just<00:02:43.840> go<00:02:44.320> right<00:02:44.590> into

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
skipping any holes just go right into

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.660 
skipping any holes just go right into
the<00:02:45.970> next<00:02:46.000> sidewall<00:02:46.630> hole<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.920> interlock<00:02:48.490> the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
the next sidewall hole and interlock the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.050 
the next sidewall hole and interlock the
next<00:02:48.940> time<00:02:49.090> now<00:02:49.390> write<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.080> one<00:02:50.290> more<00:02:50.440> time<00:02:50.620> so

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
next time now write it one more time so

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.920 
next time now write it one more time so
right<00:02:52.060> into<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.960> next<00:02:53.140> sidewall<00:02:53.650> hole<00:02:54.930> just

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
right into the next sidewall hole just

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.930 
right into the next sidewall hole just
like<00:02:56.080> that<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.530> interlock<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.520> next<00:02:57.790> diamond

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
like that and interlock the next diamond

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.210 
like that and interlock the next diamond
down<00:02:58.240> so<00:02:59.170> now<00:02:59.320> we've<00:02:59.470> got<00:02:59.650> our<00:02:59.680> mesh<00:02:59.950> pulled

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
down so now we've got our mesh pulled

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.560 
down so now we've got our mesh pulled
down<00:03:00.370> really<00:03:00.580> nice<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:00.910> tightly<00:03:01.060> on<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.390> side

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
down really nice and tightly on the side

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.140 
down really nice and tightly on the side
we<00:03:01.750> can<00:03:01.900> start<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.200> form<00:03:02.410> that<00:03:02.560> nice<00:03:03.000> mid<00:03:04.000> low

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
we can start to form that nice mid low

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.110 
we can start to form that nice mid low
pocket<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:05.620> we're<00:03:05.770> going<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:05.920> do<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.220> one<00:03:06.580> so

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
pocket so we're going to do a one so

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.520 
pocket so we're going to do a one so
come<00:03:07.390> pop<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:08.410> under<00:03:08.710> the<00:03:09.550> bottom<00:03:09.880> of<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.060> mesh
