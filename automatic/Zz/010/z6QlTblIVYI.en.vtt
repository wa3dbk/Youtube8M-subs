00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.910 
Bobby Petrino offers his thoughts on the
day's<00:00:16.550> work<00:00:16.820> I<00:00:17.260> think<00:00:18.260> the<00:00:18.380> thing<00:00:18.529> I<00:00:18.680> was<00:00:18.859> most

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
day's work I think the thing I was most

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.340 
day's work I think the thing I was most
encouraged<00:00:19.910> with<00:00:20.150> is<00:00:20.359> how<00:00:20.510> competitive<00:00:20.930> it

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
encouraged with is how competitive it

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.589 
encouraged with is how competitive it
was<00:00:21.529> that<00:00:22.010> you<00:00:22.250> know<00:00:22.369> both<00:00:22.640> sides<00:00:22.970> were<00:00:23.210> making

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599 
was that you know both sides were making

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.800 
was that you know both sides were making
plays<00:00:23.869> and<00:00:24.430> I<00:00:25.430> thought<00:00:25.970> we<00:00:26.090> started<00:00:26.359> to<00:00:26.630> run

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
plays and I thought we started to run

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.089 
plays and I thought we started to run
the<00:00:26.990> ball<00:00:27.140> a<00:00:27.199> little<00:00:27.410> bit<00:00:27.619> better<00:00:27.830> than<00:00:28.039> we

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
the ball a little bit better than we

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.070 
the ball a little bit better than we
have<00:00:28.340> been<00:00:28.490> in<00:00:28.550> practice<00:00:28.880> so<00:00:29.570> that<00:00:29.599> was<00:00:29.900> good

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
have been in practice so that was good

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.890 
have been in practice so that was good
to<00:00:30.230> see<00:00:30.470> our<00:00:31.070> defensive<00:00:31.670> front<00:00:31.970> I<00:00:32.240> think<00:00:32.810> it's

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
to see our defensive front I think it's

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.900 
to see our defensive front I think it's
going<00:00:33.020> to<00:00:33.110> be<00:00:33.200> really<00:00:33.440> good<00:00:33.560> you<00:00:34.550> know<00:00:34.670> guys

to get up there and get after the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.780 
to get up there and get after the
receivers<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:09.920> they've<00:01:10.070> made<00:01:10.250> some<00:01:10.550> plays

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
receivers and they've made some plays

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.730 
receivers and they've made some plays
but<00:01:10.850> also<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.540> receivers<00:01:11.990> made<00:01:12.200> plays<00:01:12.470> down

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
but also the receivers made plays down

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.970 
but also the receivers made plays down
the<00:01:12.770> field<00:01:13.660> so<00:01:14.660> that's<00:01:14.870> another<00:01:15.170> area<00:01:15.440> of

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
the field so that's another area of

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.280 
the field so that's another area of
going<00:01:16.580> into<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:17.030> scrimmage<00:01:17.570> I<00:01:17.720> really<00:01:18.050> wanted

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
going into the scrimmage I really wanted

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.930 
going into the scrimmage I really wanted
to<00:01:18.350> do<00:01:18.470> is<00:01:18.560> put<00:01:18.740> as<00:01:18.830> much<00:01:18.980> pressure<00:01:19.040> as<00:01:19.490> we<00:01:19.730> can

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
to do is put as much pressure as we can

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.360 
to do is put as much pressure as we can
on<00:01:19.970> those<00:01:20.360> corners<00:01:20.690> that's<00:01:21.650> why<00:01:21.830> we<00:01:21.980> took<00:01:22.130> so

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
on those corners that's why we took so

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.730 
on those corners that's why we took so
many<00:01:22.520> shots<00:01:22.850> down<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.420> field<00:01:23.690> and<00:01:24.020> you<00:01:24.620> know

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
many shots down the field and you know

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.740 
many shots down the field and you know
again<00:01:25.340> we<00:01:25.910> have<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.180> improve<00:01:26.300> on<00:01:26.600> our

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
again we have to improve on our

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.360 
again we have to improve on our
technique<00:01:27.260> there<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:27.740> playing<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.160> ball<00:01:28.340> in
