these<00:01:17.170> on<00:01:17.350> after<00:01:17.680> buying<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.250> kit<00:01:18.460> it<00:01:19.030> comes

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
these on after buying the kit it comes

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.030 
these on after buying the kit it comes
with<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.620> unpainted<00:01:20.620> body<00:01:21.580> which<00:01:22.390> you<00:01:22.420> have<00:01:22.690> to

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
with a unpainted body which you have to

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.770 
with a unpainted body which you have to
obviously<00:01:24.040> cut<00:01:24.370> out<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.730> paint<00:01:25.060> yourself<00:01:25.480> I

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
obviously cut out and paint yourself I

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.250 
obviously cut out and paint yourself I
went<00:01:26.410> the<00:01:26.530> with<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:27.040> blue<00:01:27.370> white<00:01:27.640> scheme<00:01:28.260> I

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
went the with the blue white scheme I

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.590 
went the with the blue white scheme I
tried<00:01:30.100> adding<00:01:30.280> flames<00:01:30.820> didn't<00:01:31.240> turn<00:01:31.390> out<00:01:31.420> as

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
tried adding flames didn't turn out as

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.530 
tried adding flames didn't turn out as
clean<00:01:32.080> as<00:01:32.200> I<00:01:32.290> wanted<00:01:32.560> but<00:01:32.740> it<00:01:32.980> works<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:34.390> now<00:01:34.510> I

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
clean as I wanted but it works so now I

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:43.880 
clean as I wanted but it works so now I
will<00:01:34.750> get<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.260> the<00:01:36.300> electronics<00:01:37.300> I<00:01:38.100> used

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:52.460 

I<00:01:46.640> used<00:01:47.640> an<00:01:48.470> XE<00:01:49.470> run<00:01:49.790> 150<00:01:50.790> amp<00:01:51.470> brushless

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
I used an XE run 150 amp brushless

I used an XE run 150 amp brushless
sensored<00:01:53.220> /<00:01:53.880> sensorless<00:01:55.430> ESC<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.050> it<00:01:58.050> will<00:01:58.500> be

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
sensored / sensorless ESC and it will be

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.990 
sensored / sensorless ESC and it will be

love it only thing I wish would it came

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.510 
love it only thing I wish would it came
with<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.810> there's<00:02:13.380> more<00:02:13.530> flexible<00:02:13.980> motor

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
with it there's more flexible motor

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.790 
with it there's more flexible motor
wires<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.209> this<00:02:15.330> tight<00:02:15.870> setup<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
wires and this tight setup that the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.420 
wires and this tight setup that the
techno<00:02:17.190> has<00:02:17.520> as<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:18.660> can<00:02:18.870> see<00:02:19.440> here<00:02:20.190> give<00:02:20.310> me<00:02:20.370> a

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
techno has as you can see here give me a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.380 
techno has as you can see here give me a
second<00:02:20.820> as<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.720> can<00:02:21.810> see<00:02:21.989> it's<00:02:22.170> very<00:02:22.470> very

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
second as you can see it's very very

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.600 
second as you can see it's very very
nice<00:02:24.390> layout<00:02:24.780> not<00:02:25.709> necessarily<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.280> cleanest

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
nice layout not necessarily the cleanest

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.949 
nice layout not necessarily the cleanest
look<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.850> have<00:02:27.030> here<00:02:27.209> with<00:02:27.300> some<00:02:27.510> wires<00:02:27.720> going

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
look I have here with some wires going

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.180 
look I have here with some wires going
here<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:29.100> series<00:02:29.730> connector<00:02:30.180> right<00:02:30.239> here<00:02:30.300> but

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
here the series connector right here but

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.490 
here the series connector right here but
it<00:02:32.190> still<00:02:32.489> works<00:02:32.870> gets<00:02:33.870> me<00:02:33.989> around<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.290> track

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
it still works gets me around the track

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.350 
it still works gets me around the track
and<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:36.390> have<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.989> salve<00:02:37.830> ox<00:02:38.040> 1256<00:02:38.790> titanium

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
and I have a salve ox 1256 titanium

and I have a salve ox 1256 titanium
gears<00:02:39.600> servo<00:02:39.989> in<00:02:40.140> here

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
gears servo in here

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.770 
gears servo in here
great<00:02:41.430> servo<00:02:41.880> loved<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.660> had<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.440> my<00:02:43.620> RC<00:02:44.220> 0.2<00:02:44.610> II

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
great servo loved it had it my RC 0.2 II

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.850 
great servo loved it had it my RC 0.2 II
so<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.810> decided<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.350> put<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:46.830> one<00:02:47.040> and

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
so I decided to put it in this one and

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
so I decided to put it in this one and
everything<00:02:49.860> went<00:02:50.220> together<00:02:50.370> pretty<00:02:50.549> well

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
everything went together pretty well

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.600 
everything went together pretty well
with<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.570> kit<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:52.110> have<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.560> say<00:02:52.739> this<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.100> my

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
with the kit I have to say this is my

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.210 
with the kit I have to say this is my
first<00:02:53.850> kit<00:02:54.180> building<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.440> don't<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:55.950> haven't

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
first kit building so I don't I haven't

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.680 
first kit building so I don't I haven't
had<00:02:56.370> necessarily<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.030> most<00:02:57.209> experience<00:02:57.630> and

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
had necessarily the most experience and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.920 
had necessarily the most experience and
I<00:02:57.810> built<00:02:58.709> this<00:02:58.890> kid<00:02:59.160> in<00:02:59.280> about<00:02:59.720> ten<00:03:00.720> hours<00:03:01.340> so<00:03:02.340> I

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
I built this kid in about ten hours so I

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.479 
I built this kid in about ten hours so I
would<00:03:03.930> recommend<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.650> if<00:03:04.799> you<00:03:05.070> want<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.370> get

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
would recommend it if you want to get

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.880 
would recommend it if you want to get
into<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.670> sky<00:03:05.910> buggy<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.299> you<00:03:06.510> your<00:03:07.230> first<00:03:07.500> kit

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
into a sky buggy and you your first kit

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.580 
into a sky buggy and you your first kit
this<00:03:08.580> one<00:03:09.560> compared<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:11.250> guess<00:03:11.970> most

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
this one compared to I guess most

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.570 
this one compared to I guess most
name-brand<00:03:14.840> RC<00:03:15.840> companies<00:03:16.170> this<00:03:16.890> has<00:03:17.549> a

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
name-brand RC companies this has a

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.560 
name-brand RC companies this has a
pretty<00:03:17.940> decent<00:03:18.180> one

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
pretty decent one

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.690 
pretty decent one
I<00:03:18.720> thought<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.650> RC<00:03:19.920> 8<00:03:20.010> also<00:03:20.400> had<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.549> pretty

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
I thought the RC 8 also had a pretty

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.979 
I thought the RC 8 also had a pretty
good<00:03:20.790> one<00:03:20.940> but<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.330> didn't<00:03:21.540> have<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.690> build<00:03:21.810> that

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
good one but I didn't have to build that

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.770 
good one but I didn't have to build that
when<00:03:22.110> it<00:03:22.230> came<00:03:22.320> pre-built<00:03:22.799> for<00:03:22.830> me<00:03:23.269> so<00:03:24.269> some

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
when it came pre-built for me so some

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.750 
when it came pre-built for me so some
tips<00:03:25.019> that<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:26.100> thought<00:03:26.910> while<00:03:27.500> building<00:03:28.760> this

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
tips that I thought while building this

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.940 
tips that I thought while building this
car<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.269> somebody<00:03:30.480> should<00:03:30.660> know<00:03:30.989> that

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
car that somebody should know that

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.460 
car that somebody should know that
hasn't<00:03:32.670> built<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:32.880> kit<00:03:33.060> before<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:34.110> I<00:03:34.200> had<00:03:34.350> to

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
hasn't built a kit before that I had to

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.830 
hasn't built a kit before that I had to
learn<00:03:34.620> later<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.250> uh<00:03:35.280> whatever<00:03:36.180> building<00:03:36.570> the

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
learn later is uh whatever building the

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.120 
learn later is uh whatever building the
shocks<00:03:37.700> of<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:39.500> technology<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.769> have<00:03:41.010> to

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
shocks of the technology you have to

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.840 
shocks of the technology you have to
make<00:03:41.310> sure<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.579> use<00:03:42.299> some<00:03:42.660> green<00:03:43.079> slime<00:03:43.850> teams

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
make sure to use some green slime teams

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.130 
make sure to use some green slime teams
associate<00:03:45.239> green<00:03:45.510> slime

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
associate green slime

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.830 
associate green slime
I<00:03:46.170> will<00:03:46.730> flash<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:48.090> part<00:03:48.480> number

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
I will flash that part number

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.130 
I will flash that part number
up<00:03:49.230> right<00:03:49.650> now<00:03:51.590> all<00:03:52.590> right<00:03:53.569> that's<00:03:54.569> will

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
up right now all right that's will

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.430 
up right now all right that's will
prevent<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.800> shocks<00:03:56.040> from<00:03:56.280> leaking<00:03:56.760> which

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
prevent the shocks from leaking which

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.660 
prevent the shocks from leaking which
happened<00:03:58.970> just<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.300> rears<00:04:01.489> which<00:04:02.489> was

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
happened just to the rears which was

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.930 
happened just to the rears which was
kind<00:04:02.879> of<00:04:02.910> odd<00:04:06.500> because<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:08.340> didn't<00:04:08.849> happen

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
kind of odd because it didn't happen

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.250 
kind of odd because it didn't happen
anywhere<00:04:09.330> else<00:04:09.510> did<00:04:09.690> you<00:04:09.810> just<00:04:09.959> happen<00:04:10.170> the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
anywhere else did you just happen the

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.630 
anywhere else did you just happen the
reason<00:04:10.349> I<00:04:10.620> thought<00:04:11.099> that<00:04:11.160> was<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.400> little<00:04:11.489> bit

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
reason I thought that was a little bit

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.250 
reason I thought that was a little bit
funny<00:04:12.110> so<00:04:13.110> I<00:04:13.610> made<00:04:14.610> sure<00:04:14.640> and<00:04:15.390> bought<00:04:15.959> some<00:04:16.169> of

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
funny so I made sure and bought some of

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:23.030 
funny so I made sure and bought some of
that<00:04:16.350> from<00:04:16.560> a<00:04:16.680> main<00:04:16.889> hobbies<00:04:19.579> what<00:04:20.579> else<00:04:22.040> other

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
that from a main hobbies what else other

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.830 
that from a main hobbies what else other
than<00:04:23.280> that<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.760> mean<00:04:23.790> that's<00:04:24.060> pretty<00:04:24.330> much<00:04:24.450> it

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
than that I mean that's pretty much it

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.909 
than that I mean that's pretty much it
we<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.290> didn't<00:04:25.590> have<00:04:25.710> many<00:04:25.919> other<00:04:27.919> problems

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
we I didn't have many other problems

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.140 
we I didn't have many other problems
with<00:04:29.070> it<00:04:29.220> went<00:04:29.520> together<00:04:29.639> like<00:04:29.820> I<00:04:29.970> said

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
with it went together like I said

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.100 
with it went together like I said
smoothly<00:04:30.479> a<00:04:31.490> great<00:04:32.490> first<00:04:32.790> kid<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.510> think

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
smoothly a great first kid I think

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.290 
smoothly a great first kid I think
