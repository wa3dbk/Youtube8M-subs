00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.550 
three years and us I made a huge
difference<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.670> huge<00:01:53.909> three<00:01:54.600> years<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.290> three

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
difference a huge three years just three

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.090 
difference a huge three years just three
years<00:01:55.590> right<00:01:56.219> but<00:01:57.119> when<00:01:57.689> we<00:01:57.810> started<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.530> also

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
years right but when we started I also

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.249 
years right but when we started I also
have<00:01:59.490> body<00:01:59.790> fat<00:02:00.060> percentage<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.750> was<00:02:00.990> six

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
have body fat percentage but I was six

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.219 
have body fat percentage but I was six
to<00:02:01.969> 190<00:02:02.969> pounds<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.600> was<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.750> high<00:02:03.990> body

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
to 190 pounds but that was a high body

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.959 
to 190 pounds but that was a high body
fat<00:02:04.350> percentage<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.009> would<00:02:05.159> say<00:02:05.280> my<00:02:05.460> body<00:02:05.700> fat

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
fat percentage I would say my body fat

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.440 
fat percentage I would say my body fat
was<00:02:06.509> up<00:02:06.689> around<00:02:06.960> 25%<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:09.330> which<00:02:09.690> left<00:02:10.050> me<00:02:10.349> at<00:02:11.220> a

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
was up around 25% so which left me at a

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.230 
was up around 25% so which left me at a
lean<00:02:12.450> when<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.050> was<00:02:13.230> lean

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
lean when I was lean

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.100 
lean when I was lean
about<00:02:15.240> 117<00:02:16.460> if<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.820> if<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.210> I<00:02:18.660> was<00:02:18.900> probably

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
about 117 if that if that I was probably

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.530 
about 117 if that if that I was probably
more<00:02:19.260> like<00:02:19.410> around<00:02:19.800> 165<00:02:20.640> pounds<00:02:21.180> on<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.330> lean

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
more like around 165 pounds on a lean

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.530 
more like around 165 pounds on a lean
body<00:02:21.810> fat<00:02:22.110> percentage<00:02:22.530> yeah<00:02:22.950> now<00:02:23.790> when<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.180> get

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
body fat percentage yeah now when I get

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.890 
body fat percentage yeah now when I get
through<00:02:24.780> your<00:02:25.020> transformation<00:02:25.770> now<00:02:25.950> 6<00:02:26.370> 2<00:02:26.720> 2<00:02:27.720> or

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
through your transformation now 6 2 2 or

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.350 
through your transformation now 6 2 2 or
3<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.980> know<00:02:29.100> I'm<00:02:29.190> saying<00:02:29.430> better<00:02:29.970> leaves

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
3 you know I'm saying better leaves

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.020 
3 you know I'm saying better leaves
different<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.500> lean<00:02:31.740> body<00:02:32.040> fabric<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.760> we're

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
different that lean body fabric so we're

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.150 
different that lean body fabric so we're
from<00:02:33.270> 190<00:02:33.810> 190<00:02:34.800> pounds<00:02:35.130> fat<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.680> 205<00:02:37.680> pounds

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
from 190 190 pounds fat is to 205 pounds

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.690 
from 190 190 pounds fat is to 205 pounds
cut<00:02:38.400> yeah<00:02:38.700> fat<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.600> skinny<00:02:40.010> down<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.280> lean<00:02:41.490> and

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
cut yeah fat and skinny down to lean and

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.190 
cut yeah fat and skinny down to lean and
musk<00:02:41.910> after<00:02:42.600> 3<00:02:42.780> years

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
musk after 3 years

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.680
