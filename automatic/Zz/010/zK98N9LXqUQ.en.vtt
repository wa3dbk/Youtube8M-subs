something now I am an okay demo and to
me<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.640> seems<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.090> quickie<00:01:39.390> bomb<00:01:39.570> might<00:01:39.840> not

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
me it seems the quickie bomb might not

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.810 
me it seems the quickie bomb might not
be<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> new<00:01:40.320> favorite<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.920> could<00:01:41.369> be<00:01:41.460> wrong<00:01:41.610> of

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
be a new favorite I could be wrong of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.310 
be a new favorite I could be wrong of
course<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.360> seems<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.780> fact<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
course but it seems to the fact that the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.050 
course but it seems to the fact that the
stinkies<00:01:43.619> only<00:01:43.829> stay<00:01:44.009> off<00:01:44.130> for<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.460> long<00:01:44.700> means

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
stinkies only stay off for so long means

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.490 
stinkies only stay off for so long means
you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.329> only<00:01:45.479> put<00:01:45.810> two<00:01:46.020> or<00:01:46.049> three<00:01:46.170> out<00:01:46.409> at

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
you can only put two or three out at

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.380 
you can only put two or three out at
once<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.430> definitely<00:01:47.820> say<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
once but I can definitely say that the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.999 
once but I can definitely say that the
shorter<00:01:48.899> arm<00:01:49.079> time<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.590> going<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.890> be<00:01:49.979> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
shorter arm time is going to be a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.069 
shorter arm time is going to be a
godsend<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> lot<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.689> aggressive

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
godsend to a lot of the aggressive

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.859 
godsend to a lot of the aggressive
sticky<00:01:52.350> demos<00:01:52.790> so<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:54.270> might<00:01:54.509> put<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
sticky demos so that might put a

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.690 
sticky demos so that might put a
dampener<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.409> some<00:01:55.680> things<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.490> far<00:01:56.670> as

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
dampener on some things but as far as

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.310 
dampener on some things but as far as
Smith's<00:01:57.060> --mess<00:01:57.240> goes<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.689> think<00:01:58.140> we're<00:01:58.229> gonna

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
Smith's --mess goes I think we're gonna

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.990 
Smith's --mess goes I think we're gonna
see<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> lot<00:01:58.740> more<00:01:58.799> demo<00:01:59.219> men<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.729> lot<00:01:59.969> more

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
see a lot more demo men and a lot more

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.420 
see a lot more demo men and a lot more
defensive<00:02:00.540> pill<00:02:00.719> bombs<00:02:00.979> there's<00:02:01.979> also<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
defensive pill bombs there's also the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.399 
defensive pill bombs there's also the
new<00:02:02.579> shotgun<00:02:03.090> which<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.570> me<00:02:03.689> makes<00:02:03.869> sense<00:02:04.170> and

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
new shotgun which to me makes sense and

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.109 
new shotgun which to me makes sense and
maybe<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.070> designed<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.610> some<00:02:05.820> sort<00:02:05.969> of

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
maybe it's designed to be some sort of

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.969 
maybe it's designed to be some sort of
I'm<00:02:06.390> out<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.689> ammo<00:02:06.990> I'm<00:02:07.290> gonna<00:02:07.590> whip<00:02:07.799> this

I'm out of ammo I'm gonna whip this
thing<00:02:08.039> out<00:02:08.369> kind<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.700> weapon<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.929> seems<00:02:10.349> a

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
thing out kind of weapon but it seems a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.290 
thing out kind of weapon but it seems a
little<00:02:10.560> overpowered<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.400> me<00:02:11.580> either<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.239> is

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
little overpowered to me either this is

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.760 
little overpowered to me either this is
meant<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.599> be<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.780> straight<00:02:13.140> upgrade

meant to be a straight upgrade

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.590 
meant to be a straight upgrade
or<00:02:13.860> there's<00:02:14.340> some<00:02:14.580> sort<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.880> hidden<00:02:15.090> stats<00:02:15.450> of

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
or there's some sort of hidden stats of
