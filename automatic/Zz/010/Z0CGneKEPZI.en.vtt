00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.629
 and well, a few moments ago 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.340
 president enrique peña grandson sent a 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.679
 message on the occasion of your first report 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.590
 of government which occurred in a 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.750
 context of economic slowdown and 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.610
 with difficulties to push his agenda 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.029
 of structural reforms especially 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.130
 energetics and finance to do 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.380
 a balance is with us angel 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.360
 analyst executioner and columnist of the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.099
 newspaper exception here welcome how 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.160
 you are you are very well thank you very much 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.200
 also for being with you in this first 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.180
 day of excélsior tv thank you very much is a 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.740
 honor angels name the opposite to 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.240
 botepronto what would be a first 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.630
 reflection of what we have just heard 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.490
 and see botepronto to boat soon I 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.040
 I felt in one of the reports of 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.090
 president lópez mateos or adolfo ruiz 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:57.320
 curtains because you do not have to justify or 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.110
 explain this the same as always thinking 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.329
 that the approval of a law 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.360
 automatically face and solve 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.960
 problems and that it is also enough that 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.340
 let's announce a law and its total approval 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.530
 or partial 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.770
 in the congress so that the problems 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.170
 practically a vice is solved or 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.200
 a practice that comes from afar and 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.789
 today was not the exception I ignore 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.770
 because everyone talked about these 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:28.270
 problems with people because that the 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.939
 put etcetera but I think that I 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.490
 impresses botepronto would be that over 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.039
 the same as what we have already seen in front 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.459
 to a totally novel situation that 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.770
 is the complexity and severity of a 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:45.500
 great diversity of problems that we 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.099
 they are all exploding at the same time 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.280
 a speech your health or better opinion of 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:56.149
 a desirable country but we do not know if it will be 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.239
 possible do not notice you put abounding in 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.479
 this point that we have in the last 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:05.869
 maybe 15 20 years has always talked about 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.869
 the desirable of the desirable and we say the 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.000
 what is it but we never touch the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.140
 comfortable and much less in the conditions 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.460
 current 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.590
 we talk about 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.400
 aspect that is determinant in the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.010
 governing the context more than what in 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.860
 any other time in the country in its 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.800
 contemporary history what is it with 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.870
 say with what resources are we going to do what 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.410
 that is being announced today is more 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.990
 critical to answer that with what and the 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.560
 there really was not a clear answer or 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.020
 deal with the specific issue of where or from 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.320
 where would the resources go to 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.540
 solve both the desirable project the 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.150
 that gives the impression that everything is 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.850
 subject to the realization of the 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.370
 famous structural reforms that is 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.710
 the energy reform fundamentally and 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.190
 energy and reform well water comes out 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:04.880
 sit down like that it's fine again 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.740
 we are betting that if we make and 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.320
 we managed to finalize a reform 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.190
 energetic whatever we achieve 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.350
 approve with the asegunes be 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.480
 decaffeinated or deep and then with 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.069
 the tax reform 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.769
 it will automatically start to face 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.489
 sister of heaven the truth is that it is not 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.189
 A) Yes 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.049
 first place so that the effects 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:30.499
 positive in regard to the 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.959
 revenue of the treasury in fiscal matters goes 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:35.420
 to take years because you have the 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.269
 same structure you to tests we are going to 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.969
 suppose that the congress in an act almost 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:45.169
 of madness approve the best reform 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:47.750
 fiscal last morning and goes universal 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.219
 do not hesitate elimination of so what 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.379
 we saw about them with the law 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:53.840
 Service Professional confession to 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.750
 government to the teacher that you eliminate all 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.030
 tax expenditures and so on everything 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.310
 do you approve it the day after tomorrow or the 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.040
 Thursday because on Tuesday we are busy 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.799
 on Thursday very well but so that the 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.310
 positive effects are seen in a way 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:12.109
 concrete not only in the coffers of the treasury 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.810
 but in the daily practice of 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:17.509
 minimal contributors will take us 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.449
 all this government of course in the 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:23.150
 energy reform we do the same 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.010
 best of the reforms to be angry 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.990
 cuauhtémoc cárdenas 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.680
 but we make the best of reforms 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.380
 deep wide everything we can 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.380
 imagine what they call us neoliberals 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.470
 very well but for the first one to arrive 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.120
 company to drill to get the thousands 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.490
 of millions of dollars that is required 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.990
 can also pass them though 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.600
 sex however angel say the 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.420
 international financial analysts 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.280
 say the brokerages that the simple 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.040
 made to approve those reforms 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.110
 Structures send a message for their 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.420
 arrival is still closed and generates a 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.570
 business environment more conducive so 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:05.210
 however , this is obviously 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.920
 correct your specialist in this 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.630
 question of the markets you know that 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.910
 they work based on expectations 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.060
 then those reforms are approved 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.220
 then expectations become 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.420
 maybe of neutrals or negatives to 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.900
 positive 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.660
 the problem is in the concretion of 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.930
 those expectations to start the 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.270
 drilling technical analysis 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.580
 in international markets the 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:36.250
 thousands of millions of dollars and then 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:38.860
 get here and start everything I put you 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.479
 simple collateral issues 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.820
 rights of way for roads that 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:47.240
 you have to open the problems of the 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.509
 tenders is to say these things that 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.150
 more we would like it to be realized almost 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:56.270
 immediately but the economic reality 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.220
 and you have a professional life 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.400
 around her you know it's not 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.740
 automatic and daily accepted that the 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.960
 expectations change from neutral or from 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.630
 obviously negative to possible 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.070
 a coincidence of the experts 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.190
 Economics of financial analysts 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:16.520
 that we will not see we will not see then a 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:19.070
 immediate result in the coming years 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.229
 or even year and a half however 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.660
 expectations that you can throw are 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.880
 very positive we will definitely have 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.919
 to see how the laws are tied 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.680
 secondary for putting them to approve the 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:32.270
 law with the reform and other laws are 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.380
 Take care from agreeing as they say 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.380
 classics good but 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.789
 but as Lopez Portillo said also 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.949
 you have to apply the law of tamal you have to 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:45.500
 tie down and you have to bitter up 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:48.560
 but here there would be an element too 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:51.380
 important that there is a tremendous amount 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.930
 of complex problems that get worse 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.539
 day by day it is very difficult to be 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.280
 say you know that you look at expectations already 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:59.360
 they are because you do not wait in your 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.940
 protests 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.639
 year and a half or two years or three as of 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.630
 the little president a moment ago 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.550
 this has to be replicated in the 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.410
 pocket of Mexicans and it's not going to 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.419
 reflect immediately if you read and first 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.370
 it has to be reflected in the check 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:15.349
 payroll or on the electronic card 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.750
 where they credit you so that you have a 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:20.599
 employment that will be reflected in your pocket 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:23.599
 otherwise, this will be what 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:26.419
 we have seen again and again and again and that 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:28.220
 it is dangerous by gravity I repeat 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:29.870
 the problems at this time and the 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.150
 juncture that lives in the economy 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.919
 international thank you very much thank you 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.930
 base then it's an honor to have been 

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:38.800
 with you on this first day of excélsior 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.800
 Thank you very much
