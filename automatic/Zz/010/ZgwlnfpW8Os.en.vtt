00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.219
 they analyze all the means to a 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.620
 new video of mod parma in kraft in his 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.510
 version 1.7 points 2 this time 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.460
 I bring a way that what I do is 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.860
 added new items as well as some 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.760
 new milestones blocks which we 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.760
 will allow to obtain 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.330
 more a bit more realistic structures 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.010
 would allow us to modify it by driving 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.110
 our driving in our house or if 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.780
 we want a pyramid as you can see 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.870
 it creates us allows us to obtain forms 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.180
 triangular in our constructions 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.210
 of my house and these are the items that 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.590
 we do add two ontology and these are 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.830
 the tools that we will use 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.530
 also add a door and a lid 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.210
 will approve I have my little door and then 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.290
 they will show you the bed as I tend 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.300
 add a hammer that is what we 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.770
 will allow to work with wood and a 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.310
 chisel that is the one that will allow us 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.320
 work with 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.370
 the stone but 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.159
 Pear-shaped is in our block 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.870
 as we have as a traca 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.730
 this mod 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:19.400
 or those who bring us but have the 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.430
 action or the special feature of 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.620
 who take the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.780
 can take the appearance of the block 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.890
 that we have in our hand as they can 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.160
 see here is the ladder and the pose of 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.160
 wood 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.510
 he also adds us 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.940
 looking like a hatch like this 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.860
 highlights that by right clicking with it 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.799
 it's like the hammer selected 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.540
 and it will change their appearance and 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.320
 same way you have the possibility of 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.320
 acquire 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.009
 the colors ie the shape of the block 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.710
 selected what we have this is the 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.800
 close has three types if I'm wrong in 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.390
 first 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.570
 just like the door I can 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.570
 Modify 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.940
 this the second 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.550
 the second way to make it be of 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.500
 same way you have the possibility of 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.310
 acquire the texture of the block that 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.430
 let's have selected 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.180
 He also adds what would be 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.459
 a torch a button or on seeing the 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.470
 we'll put the torch there and this one 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.940
 also has the feature that 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.880
 all attend have characteristics of 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.340
 absorb him 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.600
 the shape of the block that we have in 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.600
 our hand at that time 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.580
 add the bed 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.260
 as you can see up to half clicking 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.180
 right with her and the hammer then 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.909
 we will modify the bed 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.469
 we will add that texture and if we want 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.240
 that the bed let's say it's yellow 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:48.710
 well 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.760
 Take the structure is available 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.760
 do not add a button 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.840
 what are you here with which we can 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.550
 of the construction is like I said 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.640
 previously 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.670
 the truth is that the move was quite 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.170
 useful since it allows us to modify or 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.240
 have a little more customization 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.160
 in our our game 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.890
 to download this mode what they have 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.540
 what to do is to go to the link that 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.100
 I will give the description of the video this we 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.470
 will take to serve am 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.660
 click and once there we wait for 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.340
 five seconds pass and this one 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.390
 will redirect automatically in the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.580
 mega server once they have given here 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.470
 click on click here where it says jump 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.960
 advertising will be taken by the server 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.650
 mega the good file the module weighs 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.299
 nothing 300 advantages and 3 fits 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.530
 to download and download 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.849
 managers will be this folder this 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.680
 archive 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.299
 we copy it control it or just 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.920
 we click right and copy paste it 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.230
 inside the folder that is 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.420
 within the minecraft point to reach 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.280
 to the point folder minecraft we use the 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.310
 key combination wynton plus xerez and 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.630
 we write percent app data by 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.610
 hundred 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.010
 and we click on accept or just 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.960
 we wait for the enter key and make it to 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.060
 point minecraft let's see folder mod 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.800
 here is the move and once we have 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.810
 we will enjoy the mod and the 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.540
 new structures that this one us 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.610
 will allow to obtain I hope the video 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.290
 tutorial to your liking do not forget that
