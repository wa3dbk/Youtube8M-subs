making game characters do what we want

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.300 
making game characters do what we want
them<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.420> right<00:01:09.810> out<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.320> box<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:11.130> don't

the<00:01:13.320> technology<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.920> allows<00:01:14.310> us<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.640> do

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the technology that allows us to do

the technology that allows us to do
these<00:01:14.939> things<00:01:15.020> we<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.290> get<00:01:16.470> right<00:01:16.799> in

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
these things we can just get right in

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.340 
these things we can just get right in
and<00:01:17.130> try<00:01:17.700> things<00:01:17.759> out<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.140> immediately

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and try things out we can immediately

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.770 
and try things out we can immediately
add<00:01:19.890> lights<00:01:20.220> we<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.030> immediately<00:01:21.299> add

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
add lights we can immediately add

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.310 
add lights we can immediately add
materials<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.009> effects<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
materials and effects to that so a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.190 
materials and effects to that so a
designer<00:01:26.040> who

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
designer who

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.830 
designer who
prototype<00:01:28.039> something<00:01:28.490> in<00:01:29.299> just<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.509> few<00:01:29.659> hours

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
prototype something in just a few hours

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.800 
prototype something in just a few hours
that<00:01:30.380> would<00:01:30.860> take<00:01:31.219> without<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.420> engine<00:01:32.689> it

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
that would take without the engine it

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.709 
that would take without the engine it
could<00:01:32.840> take<00:01:33.049> weeks<00:01:33.110> or<00:01:33.469> even<00:01:33.560> months<00:01:34.719> kismet

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
could take weeks or even months kismet

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.130 
could take weeks or even months kismet
is<00:01:36.020> an<00:01:36.350> in<00:01:36.649> editor<00:01:37.369> scripting<00:01:38.090> system<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.869> lot

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
is an in editor scripting system a lot

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.219 
is an in editor scripting system a lot
of<00:01:39.259> parts<00:01:39.469> of<00:01:39.619> building<00:01:40.429> a<00:01:40.490> game<00:01:40.729> are

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
of parts of building a game are

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.109 
of parts of building a game are
scripting<00:01:42.229> things<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:43.130> making<00:01:43.490> game<00:01:43.789> against

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
scripting things and making game against

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.520 
scripting things and making game against
work<00:01:44.390> so<00:01:45.340> kismet<00:01:46.340> allows<00:01:46.640> us<00:01:46.909> to<00:01:47.179> have<00:01:47.659> one<00:01:48.500> of

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
work so kismet allows us to have one of

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.440 
work so kismet allows us to have one of
our<00:01:48.679> designers<00:01:48.860> actually<00:01:49.759> go<00:01:49.880> in<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.210> use<00:01:50.420> a

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
our designers actually go in and use a

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.499 
our designers actually go in and use a
visual<00:01:50.899> interface<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:52.130> define<00:01:52.549> what<00:01:52.819> is<00:01:53.270> going

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
visual interface to define what is going

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.050 
visual interface to define what is going
to<00:01:53.569> happen<00:01:53.899> in<00:01:54.020> sort<00:01:54.319> of<00:01:54.350> an<00:01:54.469> event-driven

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
to happen in sort of an event-driven

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.990 
to happen in sort of an event-driven
system<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:56.810> for<00:01:57.590> instance<00:01:57.679> we<00:01:58.100> may<00:01:58.250> want<00:01:58.610> to

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
system so for instance we may want to

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.649 
system so for instance we may want to
activate<00:01:59.840> music<00:02:00.349> we<00:02:00.740> can<00:02:00.950> simply<00:02:01.580> drop<00:02:02.360> down<00:02:02.630> a

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
activate music we can simply drop down a

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.550 
activate music we can simply drop down a
level<00:02:03.140> started<00:02:04.130> event<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:05.270> then<00:02:05.899> we<00:02:06.319> draw<00:02:06.530> a

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
level started event and then we draw a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.609 
level started event and then we draw a
line<00:02:06.950> come<00:02:07.310> back<00:02:07.549> to<00:02:07.880> play<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:09.140> music<00:02:09.259> and

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
line come back to play the music and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.640 
line come back to play the music and
it's<00:02:10.340> as<00:02:10.459> simple<00:02:10.579> as<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:10.819> but<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.239> allows

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
it's as simple as that but it allows

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.630 
it's as simple as that but it allows
level<00:02:12.650> designers<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.099> go<00:02:13.220> in<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.459> very

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
level designers to go in and very

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.520 
level designers to go in and very
quickly<00:02:13.880> do<00:02:14.150> different<00:02:15.079> kinds<00:02:15.110> of<00:02:15.380> game

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
quickly do different kinds of game

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.259 
quickly do different kinds of game
events<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.579> normally<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:16.970> have<00:02:17.060> to

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
events that that normally you have to

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.789 
events that that normally you have to
have<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.450> programmer<00:02:17.840> come<00:02:18.140> in<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.410> do<00:02:18.530> and

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
have a programmer come in and do and

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.500 
have a programmer come in and do and
they<00:02:19.400> can<00:02:19.549> do<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:19.760> very<00:02:19.880> quickly<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.420> very

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
they can do it very quickly and very

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.720 
they can do it very quickly and very
instantly<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.709> actually<00:02:21.950> see<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.310> results

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
instantly and actually see the results

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.789 
instantly and actually see the results
immediately<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:26.209> fat<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:27.140> unreal

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
immediately so this is fat the unreal

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.280 
immediately so this is fat the unreal
physics<00:02:28.310> asset<00:02:28.790> tool<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.269> this<00:02:29.840> allows<00:02:30.110> us<00:02:30.140> to

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
physics asset tool and this allows us to

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.550 
physics asset tool and this allows us to
preview<00:02:30.829> what<00:02:31.639> our<00:02:32.359> characters<00:02:32.750> physics

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
preview what our characters physics

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.800 
preview what our characters physics
animations<00:02:33.889> are<00:02:34.430> going<00:02:34.609> to<00:02:34.700> look<00:02:34.880> like<00:02:34.910> right

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
animations are going to look like right

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.650 
animations are going to look like right
in<00:02:35.840> editor<00:02:36.380> so<00:02:36.980> he's<00:02:37.489> able<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.940> manipulate<00:02:38.329> our

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
in editor so he's able to manipulate our

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.690 
in editor so he's able to manipulate our
character<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.319> working<00:02:39.769> around<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.370> in<00:02:40.579> kind

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
character and working around and in kind

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.349 
character and working around and in kind
of<00:02:40.819> a<00:02:40.940> rag<00:02:41.150> doll<00:02:41.359> mode<00:02:42.040> where<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.329> his<00:02:44.329> body

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
of a rag doll mode where is his body

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.420 
of a rag doll mode where is his body
parts<00:02:44.900> are<00:02:45.049> kind<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.290> flapping<00:02:45.560> around<00:02:45.769> and<00:02:46.280> so

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
parts are kind of flapping around and so

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.670 
parts are kind of flapping around and so
on<00:02:46.720> basically<00:02:47.720> we<00:02:47.810> can<00:02:47.930> see<00:02:48.079> how<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.380> reacts

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
on basically we can see how that reacts

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.410 
on basically we can see how that reacts
and<00:02:48.920> we<00:02:49.010> can<00:02:49.160> tweak<00:02:49.310> parameters<00:02:49.940> until<00:02:50.120> we<00:02:50.269> get

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
and we can tweak parameters until we get

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.840 
and we can tweak parameters until we get
acceptable<00:02:50.900> we<00:02:51.019> want<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:52.160> physics<00:02:52.519> asset

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
acceptable we want the physics asset

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.009 
acceptable we want the physics asset
tool<00:02:53.180> is<00:02:53.569> just<00:02:54.350> another<00:02:54.680> example<00:02:54.799> of<00:02:55.609> how<00:02:56.150> we

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
tool is just another example of how we

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.780 
tool is just another example of how we
can<00:02:57.260> go<00:02:57.530> into<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.799> editor<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.340> what<00:02:58.489> we<00:02:58.609> see

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
can go into the editor and what we see

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.580 
can go into the editor and what we see
is<00:02:58.910> what<00:02:59.060> we<00:02:59.150> get<00:02:59.420> we<00:02:59.870> can<00:03:00.049> do<00:03:00.139> it<00:03:00.260> right<00:03:00.290> from

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
is what we get we can do it right from

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.250 
is what we get we can do it right from
the<00:03:00.739> beginning<00:03:01.269> we<00:03:02.269> can<00:03:02.450> use<00:03:02.630> this<00:03:02.780> actually

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
the beginning we can use this actually

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.750 
the beginning we can use this actually
in<00:03:03.319> our<00:03:03.380> prototyping<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.250> game<00:03:04.430> we<00:03:04.579> don't

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
in our prototyping of the game we don't

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.699 
in our prototyping of the game we don't
have<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.000> leave<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.389> for<00:03:05.690> later<00:03:05.870> when<00:03:06.590> we're

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
have to leave it for later when we're

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.259 
have to leave it for later when we're
getting<00:03:06.950> really<00:03:07.130> intense<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.730> development

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
getting really intense and development

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.180 
getting really intense and development
we<00:03:08.660> can<00:03:08.840> add<00:03:09.019> this<00:03:09.200> as<00:03:09.530> part<00:03:10.040> of<00:03:10.099> our

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
we can add this as part of our

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.160 
we can add this as part of our
prototyping<00:03:10.849> phase<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.359> actually<00:03:11.599> see<00:03:11.900> what

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
prototyping phase and actually see what

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.080 
prototyping phase and actually see what
we're<00:03:12.349> doing<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:13.130> saves<00:03:13.370> an<00:03:13.519> enormous<00:03:13.849> amount

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
we're doing it saves an enormous amount

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.490 
we're doing it saves an enormous amount
of<00:03:14.150> time<00:03:14.389> you<00:03:14.599> don't<00:03:14.630> have<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.079> have<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.260> whole

look good and look accurate one of the
advantages<00:03:34.450> of<00:03:34.750> using<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:36.160> UDK<00:03:36.610> is<00:03:36.850> that<00:03:37.150> we

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
advantages of using the UDK is that we

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.630 
advantages of using the UDK is that we
got<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.900> use<00:03:38.160> some<00:03:39.160> of<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.280> systems

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
got to use some of the systems

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.130 
got to use some of the systems
specifically<00:03:40.180> designed<00:03:40.570> for<00:03:40.660> Gears<00:03:40.959> of<00:03:41.020> War

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
specifically designed for Gears of War

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.260 
specifically designed for Gears of War
in<00:03:41.920> particular<00:03:42.190> we<00:03:42.760> use<00:03:42.910> something<00:03:43.150> called

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
in particular we use something called

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.320 
in particular we use something called
the<00:03:43.510> fluid<00:03:43.840> surface<00:03:44.020> actor<00:03:44.560> which<00:03:45.220> in<00:03:46.060> games

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
the fluid surface actor which in games

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.780 
the fluid surface actor which in games
like<00:03:46.480> here's<00:03:46.720> a<00:03:46.780> war<00:03:47.050> is<00:03:47.200> used<00:03:47.560> for<00:03:47.980> when<00:03:48.760> a

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
like here's a war is used for when a

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.490 
like here's a war is used for when a
character<00:03:49.090> walks<00:03:49.510> across<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:50.050> surface<00:03:50.230> of

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
character walks across the surface of

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.930 
character walks across the surface of
water<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.100> actually<00:03:51.280> see<00:03:51.550> the<00:03:51.700> water

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
water and you actually see the water

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.530 
water and you actually see the water
disturb<00:03:53.520> we<00:03:54.520> took<00:03:54.670> it<00:03:54.819> a<00:03:54.850> little<00:03:55.120> bit<00:03:55.330> further

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
disturb we took it a little bit further

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.720 
disturb we took it a little bit further
and<00:03:55.840> actually<00:03:55.989> placed<00:03:56.500> it<00:03:56.709> in<00:03:56.860> our<00:03:57.280> underwater

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
and actually placed it in our underwater

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.820 
and actually placed it in our underwater
2d<00:03:58.270> world<00:03:58.480> so<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:59.020> the<00:03:59.140> characters<00:03:59.560> are

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
2d world so that the characters are

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.550 
2d world so that the characters are
always<00:04:00.489> sort<00:04:00.850> of<00:04:00.940> immersed<00:04:01.269> in<00:04:01.480> it<00:04:01.600> so<00:04:02.110> anytime

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
always sort of immersed in it so anytime

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.050 
always sort of immersed in it so anytime
there's<00:04:02.769> any<00:04:02.830> movement<00:04:03.070> on<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.459> screen<00:04:03.790> you

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
there's any movement on the screen you

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.830 
there's any movement on the screen you
see<00:04:04.090> ripples<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:04.930> waves<00:04:04.989> and<00:04:05.590> so<00:04:05.739> on<00:04:05.950> but

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
see ripples and waves and so on but

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.810 
see ripples and waves and so on but
beyond<00:04:07.840> that<00:04:08.019> we<00:04:08.350> actually<00:04:08.500> put<00:04:09.130> more<00:04:09.550> layers

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
beyond that we actually put more layers

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.509 
beyond that we actually put more layers
on<00:04:10.120> top<00:04:10.150> of<00:04:10.510> it<00:04:10.600> even<00:04:10.780> we<00:04:11.709> added<00:04:11.890> material

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
on top of it even we added material

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.020 
on top of it even we added material
effects<00:04:13.300> around<00:04:13.630> the<00:04:14.590> level<00:04:14.950> that<00:04:15.250> simulates

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
effects around the level that simulates

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.199 
effects around the level that simulates
caustics<00:04:16.890> we<00:04:17.890> have<00:04:18.040> light<00:04:18.250> beams<00:04:18.549> coming<00:04:18.880> down

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
caustics we have light beams coming down

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.270 
caustics we have light beams coming down
in<00:04:19.450> various<00:04:19.810> planes<00:04:20.140> and<00:04:20.680> showing<00:04:21.010> dust

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
in various planes and showing dust

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.640 
in various planes and showing dust
particles<00:04:21.880> floating<00:04:22.270> around<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:22.990> then<00:04:23.500> we

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
particles floating around and then we

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.890 
particles floating around and then we
use<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.280> post<00:04:24.490> process<00:04:25.000> system<00:04:25.450> to<00:04:25.570> actually

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
use the post process system to actually

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.810 
use the post process system to actually
create<00:04:26.140> a<00:04:26.169> sort<00:04:26.380> of<00:04:26.470> wavy<00:04:26.830> effect<00:04:27.070> over<00:04:27.790> the

create a sort of wavy effect over the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.240 
create a sort of wavy effect over the
screen<00:04:28.210> general<00:04:29.200> editor<00:04:29.350> really<00:04:29.830> allows<00:04:30.040> us

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
screen general editor really allows us

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.640 
screen general editor really allows us
to<00:04:30.400> do<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.550> lot<00:04:30.790> with<00:04:31.000> animation<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.810> lot<00:04:32.440> of<00:04:32.560> it

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
to do a lot with animation a lot of it

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.920 
to do a lot with animation a lot of it
can<00:04:32.830> be<00:04:32.919> done<00:04:33.070> actually<00:04:33.850> in<00:04:34.000> the<00:04:34.270> in<00:04:34.780> the

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
can be done actually in the in the

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.110 
can be done actually in the in the
editor<00:04:35.229> itself<00:04:35.380> using<00:04:35.979> the<00:04:36.070> anima<00:04:36.340> truth<00:04:36.520> so

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
editor itself using the anima truth so

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.800 
editor itself using the anima truth so
we<00:04:37.960> have<00:04:38.110> our<00:04:38.140> artists<00:04:38.710> build<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:40.300> animations

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
we have our artists build the animations

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.110 
we have our artists build the animations
in<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.680> 3d<00:04:41.979> modeling<00:04:42.310> programs<00:04:42.669> like<00:04:42.910> just

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
in the 3d modeling programs like just

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.290 
in the 3d modeling programs like just
like<00:04:43.300> normal<00:04:43.479> we<00:04:44.440> import<00:04:44.919> them<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.310> then<00:04:45.820> we

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
like normal we import them and then we

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.110 
like normal we import them and then we
put<00:04:46.720> them<00:04:46.870> in<00:04:47.050> a<00:04:47.290> visual<00:04:48.280> interface<00:04:48.820> called

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
put them in a visual interface called

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.390 
put them in a visual interface called
the<00:04:49.330> ana<00:04:49.479> tree<00:04:49.840> inside<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:51.100> unreal

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
the ana tree inside the unreal

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.000 
the ana tree inside the unreal
development<00:04:51.520> kits<00:04:52.120> editor<00:04:52.479> and<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:53.770> enema

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
development kits editor and the enema

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.820 
development kits editor and the enema
tree<00:04:54.160> basically<00:04:54.910> allows<00:04:55.210> us<00:04:55.419> to<00:04:55.830> blend

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
tree basically allows us to blend

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.060 
tree basically allows us to blend
between<00:04:57.419> different<00:04:58.419> animations<00:04:59.260> in<00:04:59.500> our

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
between different animations in our

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.060 
between different animations in our
particular<00:05:00.310> game<00:05:00.870> we<00:05:01.870> use<00:05:02.020> it<00:05:02.169> for<00:05:02.200> you<00:05:02.979> know

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
particular game we use it for you know

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.310 
particular game we use it for you know
the<00:05:03.250> Wizzle<00:05:03.550> character<00:05:03.940> smiling<00:05:04.660> and<00:05:05.260> making

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
the Wizzle character smiling and making

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.490 
the Wizzle character smiling and making
different<00:05:06.100> expressions

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
different expressions

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.140 
different expressions
and<00:05:07.860> things<00:05:08.040> like<00:05:08.190> that<00:05:08.250> and<00:05:08.580> we<00:05:09.000> can

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
and things like that and we can

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.150 
and things like that and we can
dynamically<00:05:09.840> blend<00:05:10.320> those<00:05:10.710> animations

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
dynamically blend those animations

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.670 
dynamically blend those animations
together<00:05:11.810> you<00:05:12.810> can<00:05:12.990> trigger<00:05:13.200> it<00:05:13.320> through

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
together you can trigger it through

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.050 
together you can trigger it through
kismet<00:05:14.040> you<00:05:14.190> can<00:05:14.340> trigger<00:05:14.520> that<00:05:14.760> as<00:05:14.880> their

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
kismet you can trigger that as their

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.510 
kismet you can trigger that as their
script<00:05:15.510> but<00:05:16.260> the<00:05:16.770> really<00:05:16.950> great<00:05:17.160> part<00:05:17.460> about

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
script but the really great part about

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.250 
script but the really great part about
the<00:05:17.760> nm<00:05:18.000> tree<00:05:18.180> editor<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.930> thing<00:05:19.110> that's

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
the nm tree editor the thing that's

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260 
the nm tree editor the thing that's
saved<00:05:19.500> us<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:19.800> most<00:05:19.950> time<00:05:20.160> is<00:05:20.430> that<00:05:20.580> we<00:05:20.670> can<00:05:20.820> go

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
saved us the most time is that we can go

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.880 
saved us the most time is that we can go
in<00:05:21.450> and<00:05:21.600> we<00:05:21.660> can<00:05:21.720> move<00:05:21.960> sliders<00:05:22.500> back<00:05:22.710> and

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
in and we can move sliders back and

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.430 
in and we can move sliders back and
forth<00:05:23.100> and<00:05:23.340> actually<00:05:23.700> see<00:05:23.970> what<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:25.020> final

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
forth and actually see what the final

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.230 
forth and actually see what the final
