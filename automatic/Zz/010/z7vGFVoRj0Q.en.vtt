00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.210
 the fischtown pinguins have her 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.849
 away game in Bad Nauheim 5 to 3 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.650
 Lost the penguins being the first 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.500
 scored by this is very 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.019
 gangster on template from marian data 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.370
 and andrÃ© tell you can in the eleventh 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.800
 play minute very nice for the dollar 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.420
 first hit in the game through is very 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.480
 great that our man currently with 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.450
 the number 55 terms on the field 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.660
 nearly 3,000 spectators watched this 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.360
 play in nauheim and we from pinguins tv 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.010
 were there and gave us time 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.469
 thought in new home that's what we want 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.420
 take a close look and you see it 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.520
 unfortunately a little bit that there of the two 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.100
 on the left upper half often 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.520
 the view blocked on something completely 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.530
 should happen left on the ice and 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.830
 here's the one-to-one compensation 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.590
 by max nagl on addition of markus 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.020
 gods and harry long in duplicate 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.880
 he exceeded the penalty distribution was 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.250
 as follows to nauheim and ten minutes 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.459
 and all at five punishments 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.830
 Bremerhaven at 29 minutes and 

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:29.789
 a total of nine penalties including one 5 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.069
 plus playing time for marian data after 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.349
 an injury to a game that 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:37.770
 here it is again the nauheimer 

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:39.240
 which are on and possibly this 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.030
 scoring a goal can look forward to it 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.239
 the fans but it should not be for 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.200
 the nauheimer there to achieve the 2 1 

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:51.330
 but this will be coming soon and yes 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.039
 It was a very hard game like you 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:59.550
 sees and here the big chance for the 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:02.489
 host from nauheim and there is the 2 1 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:07.700
 by kevin lavallee on play by tim 

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:10.289
 may and alexander tree in the 19th 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.330
 minute of play, however, it was time 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.989
 for the fischtown pinguins again 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.910
 goal to achieve the whole by the man 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.640
 to see with the number 77 here on the left 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.220
 jaroslaw harbor judge on game of 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.300
 mark kosick and the friar jaroslaw 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.560
 I like the port judge personally 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.230
 Already in the me was very good 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.390
 say play or before the season 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.690
 achieve one or the other gate and 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.750
 also last Friday at the game 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.520
 achieve a goal against Kaufbeuren 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.320
 yes, the good man, I think I'm fine 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.320
 settled in bremerhaven also feels 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.870
 very well as you already in the 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.430
 Read 19 newspaper was deep now 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.450
 stood by pinguins with our man 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.690
 the number 18 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.380
 the 3 2 from the point of view of pinguins branding 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:06.400
 cook on game of dustin and 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:08.850
 others tell you can do it all 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.070
 pretty good for the fischtown pinguins 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.050
 but that should not happen once 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:18.490
 rich because the penguins lose like 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:21.610
 already mentioned with 5 to 3 in nauheim here 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.040
 again the possibility for times 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.510
 pretty close to the gate to get here 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.840
 we see free on the far right 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.830
 there is a man who will be right up there 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.830
 shoot goal and that is again the 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:40.980
 scorer max nagl on play 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.980
 by patrick on it and daniel oppolzer 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.790
 there have had luck again 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.230
 is driven here from the gate far out 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.830
 hunter has been there almost a bit 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.700
 miscalculated 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.730
 The puck did not go out of the 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.710
 attack zone and that is ice cold 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.680
 punished by the nauheimern this 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.930
 but not yet but it will be 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.090
 happen and exactly here the ex 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.880
 bremerhavener jason pinizzotto on 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:16.380
 Addition of trainersohn taylor general 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:19.260
 and taste a total of three points 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.770
 scored in the game against the 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.150
 fischtown pinguins kings tv is in 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.040
 This season, one time or another 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.920
 still go to an away game 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.000
 and record this for you 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.430
 you can also play the home games 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.250
 Watching employees live on sport tv 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.320
 Just click spray tv there can 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.180
 then you one or the other game too 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.820
 home from your fischtown pinguins 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.250
 if you have illness or illness 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.610
 far away fansite and yet like 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.220
 like to see your fischtown pinguins 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.410
 decide the whole game and here one 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.480
 so-called empty-net-goal at least 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.910
 it is so specified by conc trick and 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.110
 in statistics, however, is not 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.290
 the case as we have seen there 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.490
 Hunter stood in the gate and accordingly 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.810
 not taken the goalkeeper out 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.280
 but here is the fischtown 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.880
 Penguins then made the goalkeeper out 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.210
 Although the disc can take 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:14.280
 relatively good for themselves 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.840
 but it should not be that anymore 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.030
 they shoot a gate for shopping queens 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.590
 and we'll be back at the 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.840
 next game of fischtown pinguins 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:27.690
 that's against sunday in bremerhaven 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.090
 the starbulls from rosenheim i wish 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.430
 Have a nice day tonight 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.810
 tomorrow or whatever and we hear 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.370

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.370
