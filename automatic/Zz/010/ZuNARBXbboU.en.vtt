00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.550 

makes<00:01:32.920> me<00:01:33.070> think<00:01:33.130> twice<00:01:33.549> about<00:01:34.409> doing<00:01:35.409> my

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
makes me think twice about doing my

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.240 
makes me think twice about doing my
super<00:01:35.920> fast<00:01:36.159> rides<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:38.110> he<00:01:38.530> had<00:01:38.710> his<00:01:38.950> gear<00:01:39.220> on

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
super fast rides and he had his gear on

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.370 
super fast rides and he had his gear on
you<00:01:39.970> know<00:01:40.090> he<00:01:40.299> had<00:01:40.450> his<00:01:40.479> helmet<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:44.110> works

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
but I guess there's only so much

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.840

a little paranoid and self-conscious but

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:06.269 
a little paranoid and self-conscious but
I<00:06:02.029> think<00:06:03.520> like<00:06:04.520> they<00:06:04.669> say<00:06:04.879> in<00:06:04.999> reality<00:06:05.509> TV

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:06.279 
I think like they say in reality TV

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:10.739 
I think like they say in reality TV
after<00:06:07.599> you're<00:06:08.599> around<00:06:08.870> the<00:06:09.020> camera<00:06:09.469> so<00:06:09.650> much

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:10.749 
after you're around the camera so much

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:12.999 
after you're around the camera so much
you<00:06:11.749> just<00:06:11.779> live<00:06:12.199> with<00:06:12.229> it<00:06:12.499> and<00:06:12.650> it<00:06:12.800> just

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009 
you just live with it and it just

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.129 
you just live with it and it just
becomes<00:06:13.249> a<00:06:13.430> part<00:06:13.460> of<00:06:13.759> you<00:06:13.960> and<00:06:14.960> you<00:06:15.050> don't

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
becomes a part of you and you don't

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.219 
becomes a part of you and you don't
think<00:06:15.409> about<00:06:15.529> it<00:06:15.939> and<00:06:16.939> that's<00:06:17.629> why<00:06:17.749> people<00:06:17.990> do

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
think about it and that's why people do

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:20.170 
think about it and that's why people do
things<00:06:18.469> on<00:06:18.740> reality<00:06:19.129> TV<00:06:19.520> that<00:06:19.699> are<00:06:19.849> caught<00:06:20.060> on
