00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.130 
in addition something you can do to help
caramelize<00:03:31.909> them<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.299> little<00:03:32.480> quicker<00:03:32.810> at<00:03:33.019> this

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
caramelize them a little quicker at this

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.660 
caramelize them a little quicker at this
point<00:03:33.409> because<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.219> can<00:03:34.340> add<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.489> little

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
point because you can add a little

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.720 
point because you can add a little
balsamic<00:03:34.879> vinegar<00:03:36.280> so<00:03:37.280> in<00:03:37.400> add<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:37.549> little

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
balsamic vinegar so in add a little

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.880 
balsamic vinegar so in add a little
balsamic<00:03:37.909> got<00:03:38.420> too<00:03:38.569> much<00:03:38.750> too<00:03:39.739> strong

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
balsamic got too much too strong

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.970 
balsamic got too much too strong
balsamic<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:41.079> you<00:03:42.079> also<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.379> do<00:03:42.500> this<00:03:42.650> little

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
balsamic and you also you do this little

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.780 
balsamic and you also you do this little
brown<00:03:43.159> sugar<00:03:43.189> that<00:03:44.180> helps<00:03:44.480> too<00:03:44.689> and<00:03:45.670> just<00:03:46.670> so

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
brown sugar that helps too and just so

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.220 
brown sugar that helps too and just so
you<00:03:46.819> know<00:03:46.939> the<00:03:47.209> technical<00:03:47.510> definition<00:03:47.780> of

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
you know the technical definition of

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.140 
you know the technical definition of
caramelizing<00:03:48.680> onions<00:03:48.889> is<00:03:49.579> the<00:03:49.760> grounding<00:03:50.120> of

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
caramelizing onions is the grounding of

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.539 
caramelizing onions is the grounding of
surface<00:03:50.569> sugars<00:03:51.099> rounding<00:03:52.099> its<00:03:52.219> surface

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
surface sugars rounding its surface

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.140 
surface sugars rounding its surface
sugars<00:03:52.879> so<00:03:53.209> that's<00:03:53.359> what<00:03:53.480> we're<00:03:53.599> doing<00:03:53.780> it

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
sugars so that's what we're doing it

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.849 
sugars so that's what we're doing it
okay<00:03:56.150> so<00:03:56.900> at<00:03:57.109> this<00:03:57.200> point<00:03:57.409> we<00:03:57.590> pretty<00:03:57.769> much

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
okay so at this point we pretty much

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.530 
okay so at this point we pretty much
caramelize<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.489> onions<00:03:58.519> you<00:03:59.180> can<00:03:59.299> see<00:03:59.450> how

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
caramelize the onions you can see how

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.089 
caramelize the onions you can see how
much<00:03:59.719> it's<00:03:59.870> cooled<00:04:00.079> down<00:04:00.200> in<00:04:00.409> that<00:04:00.530> hole<00:04:00.769> big

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
much it's cooled down in that hole big

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.580 
much it's cooled down in that hole big
pile<00:04:01.450> you<00:04:02.450> can<00:04:02.599> take<00:04:02.750> it<00:04:02.840> further<00:04:03.049> if<00:04:03.260> you<00:04:03.379> want

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
pile you can take it further if you want

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.470 
pile you can take it further if you want
the<00:04:03.950> longer<00:04:04.310> goes<00:04:04.579> that<00:04:04.879> darker<00:04:05.180> it's<00:04:05.299> going

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
the longer goes that darker it's going

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.629 
the longer goes that darker it's going
to<00:04:05.540> get<00:04:05.689> and<00:04:05.989> that<00:04:06.889> just<00:04:07.040> means<00:04:07.159> it's<00:04:07.370> going<00:04:07.489> to

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
to get and that just means it's going to

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:08.979 
to get and that just means it's going to
get<00:04:07.700> sweeter<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.239> lovelier<00:04:08.599> you<00:04:08.720> know<00:04:08.810> that

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
get sweeter and lovelier you know that

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.690 
get sweeter and lovelier you know that
old<00:04:09.109> gedd<00:04:09.739> thing<00:04:10.159> golden-brown<00:04:10.549> delicious

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
old gedd thing golden-brown delicious

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.339 
old gedd thing golden-brown delicious
and<00:04:11.269> that's<00:04:11.389> exactly<00:04:11.659> what<00:04:12.049> we're<00:04:12.139> doing

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
and that's exactly what we're doing

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.009 
and that's exactly what we're doing
right<00:04:12.530> here<00:04:12.909> so<00:04:13.909> I<00:04:14.269> guess<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.750> big<00:04:14.989> question

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
right here so I guess the big question

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.110 
right here so I guess the big question
is<00:04:15.530> flat<00:04:16.099> and<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.430> little<00:04:16.789> my<00:04:16.880> during

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
is flat and a little my during

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.539 
is flat and a little my during
caramelizing<00:04:17.570> all<00:04:17.930> these<00:04:18.079> onions<00:04:18.410> I<00:04:19.009> have<00:04:19.459> a

journalists<00:04:44.599> use<00:04:44.750> your<00:04:44.900> imagination<00:04:45.500> and

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
journalists use your imagination and

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.029 
journalists use your imagination and
they'll<00:04:47.000> keep<00:04:47.150> for<00:04:47.210> about<00:04:47.479> a<00:04:47.510> month<00:04:48.409> put<00:04:48.949> them

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
they'll keep for about a month put them

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.170 
they'll keep for about a month put them
in<00:04:49.070> a<00:04:49.130> container<00:04:49.220> with<00:04:49.520> some<00:04:49.699> olive<00:04:49.820> oil<00:04:49.970> on

in a container with some olive oil on

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.320 
in a container with some olive oil on
top<00:04:50.210> so<00:04:51.169> they're<00:04:51.949> very<00:04:52.220> practical<00:04:52.970> to<00:04:53.030> do<00:04:53.150> all

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
top so they're very practical to do all

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.360 
top so they're very practical to do all
the<00:04:53.449> once<00:04:53.599> and<00:04:53.780> save<00:04:54.020> also<00:04:54.860> if<00:04:54.979> you<00:04:55.039> got<00:04:55.220> some

the once and save also if you got some

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.560 
the once and save also if you got some
onions<00:04:55.520> that<00:04:55.699> are<00:04:55.760> going<00:04:56.000> bad<00:04:56.180> you<00:04:56.360> know<00:04:56.449> what

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
onions that are going bad you know what

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.029 
onions that are going bad you know what
to<00:04:56.659> do<00:04:56.750> with<00:04:56.870> them<00:04:56.960> now<00:04:57.560> I<00:04:57.590> know<00:04:57.680> what<00:04:57.830> to<00:04:57.919> do<00:04:58.009> a

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
to do with them now I know what to do a

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.060 
to do with them now I know what to do a
little<00:04:58.250> caramelize<00:04:58.789> them<00:04:58.909> and<00:04:59.740> yeah<00:05:00.740> so

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
little caramelize them and yeah so

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.689 
little caramelize them and yeah so
that's<00:05:01.340> that's<00:05:01.729> about<00:05:02.030> it<00:05:03.280> you<00:05:04.280> want<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.520> find
