how's<00:00:05.470> it<00:00:05.500> going<00:00:05.740> guys<00:00:06.220> it's<00:00:06.700> gaming<00:00:07.149> full<00:00:07.359> 12

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:07.630 
how's it going guys it's gaming full 12

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.930 
how's it going guys it's gaming full 12
here<00:00:07.960> i'm<00:00:08.140> in<00:00:08.380> my<00:00:08.500> super<00:00:08.890> flat<00:00:09.160> world<00:00:09.430> and<00:00:09.850> i

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:09.940 
here i'm in my super flat world and i

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.400 
here i'm in my super flat world and i
made<00:00:10.330> this<00:00:11.100> it<00:00:12.100> is<00:00:12.280> a<00:00:12.310> basic<00:00:12.970> adder<00:00:13.410> basically

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
made this it is a basic adder basically

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.349 
made this it is a basic adder basically
it<00:00:14.530> takes<00:00:14.770> binary<00:00:15.400> and<00:00:15.610> converts<00:00:16.150> it<00:00:16.240> into

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:16.359 
it takes binary and converts it into

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.400 
it takes binary and converts it into
math<00:00:16.750> and<00:00:17.699> what<00:00:18.699> it<00:00:18.850> does<00:00:19.060> is<00:00:19.390> if<00:00:19.839> you<00:00:19.960> flip<00:00:20.230> a

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
math and what it does is if you flip a

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.029 
math and what it does is if you flip a
switch<00:00:21.269> it'll<00:00:22.269> send<00:00:22.660> a<00:00:22.779> redstone<00:00:23.079> pulse<00:00:23.529> over

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
switch it'll send a redstone pulse over

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.169 
switch it'll send a redstone pulse over
to<00:00:24.160> here<00:00:24.900> basically<00:00:25.900> I<00:00:26.230> have<00:00:26.380> XOR<00:00:27.279> gates<00:00:27.609> there

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:28.179 
to here basically I have XOR gates there

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.319 
to here basically I have XOR gates there
and<00:00:28.419> here<00:00:29.199> meaning<00:00:29.919> that<00:00:29.949> if<00:00:30.579> either<00:00:30.999> one<00:00:31.269> of

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
and here meaning that if either one of

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.620 
and here meaning that if either one of
those<00:00:31.689> flashes<00:00:32.560> on<00:00:32.710> it<00:00:32.980> will<00:00:33.130> send<00:00:33.340> a<00:00:33.489> pulse<00:00:33.670> to

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
those flashes on it will send a pulse to

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.569 
those flashes on it will send a pulse to
that<00:00:34.810> light<00:00:35.170> right<00:00:35.350> there<00:00:35.379> and<00:00:35.770> this<00:00:36.340> means

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
that light right there and this means

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.670 
that light right there and this means
that<00:00:36.789> there<00:00:37.690> is<00:00:37.840> one<00:00:37.870> output<00:00:38.260> there<00:00:38.980> is<00:00:39.190> one

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
that there is one output there is one

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.349 
that there is one output there is one
the<00:00:41.680> solution<00:00:42.579> is<00:00:42.940> one<00:00:43.590> now<00:00:44.590> if<00:00:44.980> I<00:00:45.820> go<00:00:45.850> and<00:00:46.210> turn

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
the solution is one now if I go and turn

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:51.689 
the solution is one now if I go and turn
it<00:00:46.570> off<00:00:46.690> and<00:00:48.329> flip<00:00:49.329> this<00:00:49.510> one<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.980> solution<00:00:51.309> is

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
it off and flip this one the solution is

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.610 
it off and flip this one the solution is
is<00:00:52.030> still<00:00:52.449> one<00:00:52.660> and<00:00:54.420> if<00:00:55.420> I<00:00:55.719> come<00:00:55.960> and<00:00:56.199> turn<00:00:56.410> it

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
is still one and if I come and turn it

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.939 
is still one and if I come and turn it
on<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.960> solution<00:00:59.260> is<00:00:59.739> now<00:01:00.089> not<00:01:01.089> one<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:02.620> two

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
on the solution is now not one but two

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.219 
on the solution is now not one but two
because<00:01:03.699> as<00:01:03.940> you<00:01:04.180> see<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:05.410> end<00:01:05.800> gates<00:01:06.280> came

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
because as you see the end gates came

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.640 
because as you see the end gates came
turn<00:01:08.229> this<00:01:08.530> on<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:09.750> went<00:01:10.750> to<00:01:10.900> this<00:01:11.079> or<00:01:11.350> gate

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
turn this on and went to this or gate

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.770 
turn this on and went to this or gate
which<00:01:12.400> sent<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.939> output<00:01:13.450> on<00:01:13.720> to<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.710> next<00:01:14.890> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
which sent the output on to the next and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.039 
which sent the output on to the next and
the<00:01:16.780> sum<00:01:17.079> is<00:01:17.350> two<00:01:17.770> times<00:01:18.130> this<00:01:18.759> output<00:01:19.450> plus

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
the sum is two times this output plus

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.039 
the sum is two times this output plus
that<00:01:20.530> output<00:01:21.040> gets<00:01:21.310> your<00:01:21.579> map<00:01:21.759> so<00:01:22.390> this<00:01:22.600> output

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
that output gets your map so this output

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.780 
that output gets your map so this output
will<00:01:23.290> go<00:01:23.439> on<00:01:23.619> to<00:01:23.860> another<00:01:24.009> one<00:01:24.250> of<00:01:24.369> these<00:01:24.490> if<00:01:24.700> I

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
will go on to another one of these if I

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.880 
will go on to another one of these if I
were<00:01:24.939> to<00:01:25.030> set<00:01:25.240> up<00:01:25.390> another<00:01:25.600> one<00:01:25.869> of<00:01:25.990> these<00:01:26.110> this

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
were to set up another one of these this

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.080 
were to set up another one of these this
output<00:01:27.549> would<00:01:27.880> carry<00:01:28.270> in<00:01:28.799> right<00:01:29.799> here<00:01:30.220> and<00:01:30.399> it

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
output would carry in right here and it

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.709 
output would carry in right here and it
would<00:01:31.270> go<00:01:31.450> along<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.770> right<00:01:32.950> here<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.939> would<00:01:34.360> be

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
would go along to right here it would be

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.310 
would go along to right here it would be
this<00:01:35.020> second<00:01:35.530> XOR<00:01:36.280> gate<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:37.509> second<00:01:38.140> solution

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
this second XOR gate the second solution

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.520 
this second XOR gate the second solution
into<00:01:38.770> this<00:01:38.920> XOR<00:01:39.369> gate<00:01:39.549> right<00:01:39.700> here<00:01:39.759> it<00:01:40.630> would

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
into this XOR gate right here it would

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.359 
into this XOR gate right here it would
also<00:01:41.700> light<00:01:42.700> up<00:01:42.729> this<00:01:43.149> and<00:01:43.420> gate<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:43.869> if<00:01:43.990> this

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
also light up this and gate so if this

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.410 
also light up this and gate so if this
was<00:01:45.369> on<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:46.060> one<00:01:46.990> of<00:01:47.140> these<00:01:47.289> outputs<00:01:48.039> was<00:01:49.030> also

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
was on and one of these outputs was also

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.380 
was on and one of these outputs was also
on<00:01:49.600> I<00:01:49.899> would<00:01:50.860> have<00:01:51.039> a<00:01:51.070> solution<00:01:51.399> of<00:01:51.820> four

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
on I would have a solution of four

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.080 
on I would have a solution of four
because<00:01:52.869> this<00:01:52.899> solution<00:01:53.619> would<00:01:53.950> be<00:01:54.009> on<00:01:54.250> the

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
because this solution would be on the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.850 
because this solution would be on the
previous<00:01:55.600> solution<00:01:55.899> would<00:01:56.229> be<00:01:56.289> on<00:01:56.560> and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
previous solution would be on and

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.569 
previous solution would be on and
therefore<00:01:57.579> i<00:01:57.610> would<00:01:58.090> have<00:01:58.299> a<00:01:58.600> or<00:01:59.380> this<00:02:00.070> torch

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
therefore i would have a or this torch

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:01.679 
therefore i would have a or this torch
would<00:02:00.729> be<00:02:00.850> on<00:02:00.939> that<00:02:01.090> tortured<00:02:01.450> beyond

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
would be on that tortured beyond

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.120 
would be on that tortured beyond
therefore<00:02:01.990> i<00:02:02.020> would<00:02:02.200> have<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.380> solution<00:02:02.619> of<00:02:02.859> two

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
therefore i would have a solution of two

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.130 
therefore i would have a solution of two
and<00:02:04.619> basically<00:02:05.619> it<00:02:06.039> is<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.729> binary<00:02:07.240> calculator

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
and basically it is a binary calculator

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.680 
and basically it is a binary calculator
and<00:02:08.440> that's<00:02:09.430> all<00:02:09.610> i<00:02:09.640> have<00:02:09.880> for<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:10.149> guys<00:02:10.240> i

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
and that's all i have for you guys i

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.430 
and that's all i have for you guys i
hope<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:11.080> enjoyed<00:02:11.410> we'll<00:02:11.830> see<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.069> next<00:02:12.190> time
