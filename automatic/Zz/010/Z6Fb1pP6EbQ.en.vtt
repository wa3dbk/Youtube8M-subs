I walked in and there's just candy
sitting<00:00:27.550> on<00:00:27.610> every<00:00:27.880> single<00:00:28.210> table<00:00:29.850> would

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
sitting on every single table would

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.420 
sitting on every single table would
basically<00:00:31.090> taste<00:00:31.930> our<00:00:32.140> way<00:00:32.320> through<00:00:33.100> all<00:00:33.400> of

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
basically taste our way through all of

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.070 
basically taste our way through all of
the<00:00:33.640> commercial<00:00:34.030> candies<00:00:34.390> that<00:00:34.420> I<00:00:34.570> can<00:00:34.810> find

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
the commercial candies that I can find

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.570 
the commercial candies that I can find
never<00:00:35.860> would<00:00:36.010> have<00:00:36.070> thought<00:00:36.130> that<00:00:36.490> would

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
never would have thought that would

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.220 
never would have thought that would
happen<00:00:36.760> and<00:00:37.150> I'd<00:00:37.240> be<00:00:37.480> getting<00:00:37.690> credit<00:00:37.780> for<00:00:37.960> it

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
happen and I'd be getting credit for it

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.070 
happen and I'd be getting credit for it
I<00:00:38.530> was<00:00:38.800> like<00:00:38.950> I<00:00:39.040> think<00:00:39.190> this<00:00:39.340> is<00:00:39.520> gonna<00:00:39.700> work

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
I was like I think this is gonna work

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.030 
I was like I think this is gonna work
it's<00:00:41.080> like<00:00:41.140> Halloween<00:00:41.410> in<00:00:41.860> here<00:00:42.160> every<00:00:43.090> day

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
it's like Halloween in here every day

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.530 
it's like Halloween in here every day
basically<00:00:45.040> monday<00:00:45.460> we<00:00:45.579> sit<00:00:45.730> down<00:00:45.850> in<00:00:45.970> a<00:00:46.030> circle

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
basically monday we sit down in a circle

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.410 
basically monday we sit down in a circle
he<00:00:46.690> candy<00:00:47.079> talk<00:00:47.260> about<00:00:47.470> candy<00:00:47.880> Tuesday<00:00:48.880> we

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
he candy talk about candy Tuesday we

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.990 
he candy talk about candy Tuesday we
come<00:00:49.660> in<00:00:49.840> make<00:00:50.290> candy<00:00:50.710> you<00:00:51.220> candy<00:00:51.579> talk<00:00:51.760> about

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
come in make candy you candy talk about

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.330 
come in make candy you candy talk about
candy<00:00:52.390> and<00:00:52.570> then<00:00:53.020> Wednesday<00:00:53.260> we<00:00:53.620> come<00:00:53.829> in<00:00:54.010> and

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
candy and then Wednesday we come in and

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.430 
candy and then Wednesday we come in and
look<00:00:55.030> at<00:00:55.150> the<00:00:55.270> candy<00:00:55.510> we<00:00:55.600> made<00:00:55.750> on<00:00:55.870> Tuesday<00:00:56.020> and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
look at the candy we made on Tuesday and

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.880 
look at the candy we made on Tuesday and
then<00:00:56.560> eat<00:00:56.710> it

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
then eat it

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.960 
then eat it
so<00:00:57.489> it<00:00:57.610> went<00:00:57.730> from<00:00:57.940> being<00:00:58.180> liquid<00:00:59.170> to<00:00:59.350> being

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
so it went from being liquid to being

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.550 
so it went from being liquid to being
solid<00:01:00.970> as<00:01:01.630> they<00:01:01.870> eat<00:01:02.079> their<00:01:02.350> way<00:01:02.530> through

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 
solid as they eat their way through

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.520 
solid as they eat their way through
class<00:01:03.010> they<00:01:03.520> become<00:01:03.880> experts<00:01:04.570> by<00:01:04.960> making

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
class they become experts by making

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.370 
class they become experts by making
every<00:01:06.010> kind<00:01:06.310> of<00:01:06.520> candy<00:01:06.880> imaginable<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:08.170> last

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
candy and cotton candy sure the class is

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.250 
candy and cotton candy sure the class is
delicious<00:01:20.890> but<00:01:21.580> it's<00:01:21.700> also<00:01:22.030> demanding<00:01:22.600> no<00:01:23.049> one

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
delicious but it's also demanding no one

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.200 
delicious but it's also demanding no one
believes<00:01:23.620> me<00:01:23.740> no<00:01:24.100> I<00:01:24.310> come<00:01:24.490> home<00:01:24.580> with<00:01:24.700> bags<00:01:24.970> of

believes me no I come home with bags of

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.270 
believes me no I come home with bags of
candy<00:01:25.420> my<00:01:25.750> roommates<00:01:26.110> just<00:01:26.200> like<00:01:26.500> another

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
candy my roommates just like another

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.640 
candy my roommates just like another
hard<00:01:27.549> day<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:27.880> candy<00:01:28.270> wasn't<00:01:28.659> it<00:01:28.810> yeah<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:32.409> may

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
hard day and candy wasn't it yeah it may

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.070 
hard day and candy wasn't it yeah it may
not<00:01:32.920> look<00:01:33.220> like<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.670> but<00:01:33.880> this<00:01:34.060> is<00:01:34.420> actually<00:01:34.630> a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
not look like it but this is actually a

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.039 
not look like it but this is actually a
rigorous<00:01:35.830> science<00:01:36.250> class<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:37.750> basically

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
rigorous science class we basically

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.210 
rigorous science class we basically
learned<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.619> chemistry<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.100> the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
learned the chemistry and the

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.219 
learned the chemistry and the

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.690 
engineering of food products food
engineering<00:01:41.380> is<00:01:41.799> basically<00:01:42.100> a<00:01:42.190> mix<00:01:42.490> between

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
engineering is basically a mix between

it<00:01:49.750> actually<00:01:50.229> is<00:01:50.320> a<00:01:50.350> really<00:01:50.439> challenging

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
it actually is a really challenging

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
do the research part and really

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.170 
do the research part and really
understand<00:02:20.540> ingredient<00:02:21.080> functionalities<00:02:21.739> I

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
understand ingredient functionalities I

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.250

without<00:02:24.590> analyzing<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:25.670> could<00:02:25.790> go<00:02:25.910> into

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000

precise old-time candy makers they could
just<00:02:35.630> look<00:02:35.780> at<00:02:35.900> their<00:02:36.110> candy<00:02:36.650> mass<00:02:36.950> as<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.340> was

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
just look at their candy mass as it was

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.190 
just look at their candy mass as it was
cooking<00:02:37.850> or<00:02:38.000> something<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.540> say<00:02:38.780> oh<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:39.049> needs
