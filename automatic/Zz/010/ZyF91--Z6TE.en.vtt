00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
ok so and this is the animation software

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.310 
ok so and this is the animation software
you<00:00:54.059> use<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.510> order<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.809> create<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.140> plan

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
you use in order to create the plan

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.900 
you use in order to create the plan
right<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.980> right<00:00:56.160> over<00:00:56.190> here<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
right this right over here is the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.180 
right this right over here is the
animation<00:00:57.390> software<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.079> use<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.410> create

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
animation software that I use to create

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.959 
animation software that I use to create
the<00:00:59.930> plans<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.260> start<00:01:01.949> out<00:01:02.100> with<00:01:02.340> essentially

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
the plans I start out with essentially

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.410 
the plans I start out with essentially
the<00:01:03.329> layout<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.680> from<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.400> magazine<00:01:05.610> ok

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the layout of the from the magazine ok

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.060 
the layout of the from the magazine ok
and<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:06.720> that's<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:07.200> Rick<00:01:07.560> Johnson's

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
and so that's like Rick Johnson's

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.410 
and so that's like Rick Johnson's
original<00:01:08.549> illustrator<00:01:09.000> file<00:01:09.240> yeah

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
original illustrator file yeah

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.810 
original illustrator file yeah
underneath<00:01:09.869> all<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.140> grid<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.830> stuff<00:01:11.130> is

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
underneath all that grid and stuff is

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.090 
underneath all that grid and stuff is
the<00:01:12.360> original<00:01:12.869> plan<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.320> Rick<00:01:13.470> Johnson<00:01:13.710> puts

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
the original plan that Rick Johnson puts

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.640 
the original plan that Rick Johnson puts
together<00:01:14.250> ok<00:01:14.909> cool<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.420> fortunately<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.530> is

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
together ok cool and fortunately this is

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.530 
together ok cool and fortunately this is
an<00:01:16.770> illustrator<00:01:17.220> file<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.970> extract<00:01:18.299> all

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
an illustrator file so I can extract all

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.320 
an illustrator file so I can extract all
sorts<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.869> shapes<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.500> stuff<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.700> ok

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
sorts of shapes and stuff like that ok

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.899 
sorts of shapes and stuff like that ok
so<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> kind<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.920> 2d<00:01:23.310> view<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.759> it

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
so this is the kind of a 2d view of it

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.420 
so this is the kind of a 2d view of it
and<00:01:24.090> basically<00:01:24.600> what<00:01:24.840> i<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.939> is<00:01:26.939> something

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
and basically what i do is something

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.210 
and basically what i do is something
nice<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:30.470> now<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.590> has<00:01:31.740> got<00:01:31.920> some

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
nice like this now this has got some

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.100 
nice like this now this has got some
special<00:01:32.579> stuff<00:01:32.820> going<00:01:33.240> into<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.600> like<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.930> can

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
special stuff going into it like you can

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.910 
special stuff going into it like you can
see<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:35.310> little<00:01:35.820> bit<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.090> got<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.020> approach<00:01:37.710> to

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
see a little bit of got the approach to

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.100 
see a little bit of got the approach to
the<00:01:38.040> float<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.000> piercer<00:01:39.540> yeah<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.840> got<00:01:40.079> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the float on the piercer yeah you got a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.050 
the float on the piercer yeah you got a
little<00:01:40.409> extra<00:01:40.680> geometry<00:01:41.280> here<00:01:41.610> kind<00:01:42.000> of

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
little extra geometry here kind of

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.960 
little extra geometry here kind of
dropping<00:01:42.479> down<00:01:42.780> into<00:01:42.840> what<00:01:43.430> what<00:01:44.430> would<00:01:44.729> be

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
dropping down into what what would be

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.780 
dropping down into what what would be
the<00:01:45.840> water<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.470> see<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.460> view

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the water you can see that in this view

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.789 
the water you can see that in this view
yeah<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.509> there's<00:01:49.020> your<00:01:49.140> elevation<00:01:49.470> sure

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
yeah so you there's your elevation sure

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.870 
yeah so you there's your elevation sure
all<00:01:50.549> right<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.939> said<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:53.189> 3d

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
all right so you said that the the 3d

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.179 
all right so you said that the the 3d
track<00:01:54.119> plan<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.930> 14th<00:01:55.380> sub<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:55.979> about

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
track plan of the 14th sub is just about

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.130 
track plan of the 14th sub is just about
done<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:57.240> see<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> little<00:01:57.750> bit<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.930> it

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
done so can we see a little bit of it

the actual building we're just kind of

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.140 
the actual building we're just kind of
representing<00:02:20.519> what<00:02:20.670> they<00:02:20.790> are<00:02:20.939> actually

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
representing what they are actually

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.850 
representing what they are actually
really<00:02:21.480> easy<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.840> spot<00:02:22.049> cars<00:02:22.379> then<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.739> know
