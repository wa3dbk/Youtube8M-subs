just get these out this one here or

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.880 
just get these out this one here or
using<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.600> America<00:00:58.910> and<00:00:59.910> then<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.440> corner

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
using in America and then in this corner

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.280 
using in America and then in this corner

so nice that you can use the remote

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.640 
so nice that you can use the remote
controller<00:04:44.909> as<00:04:45.090> well<00:04:45.120> and<00:04:45.509> where<00:04:46.050> this<00:04:46.259> device

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
controller as well and where this device

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.770 
controller as well and where this device
really<00:04:47.069> comes<00:04:47.280> into<00:04:47.490> its<00:04:47.580> own<00:04:47.849> is<00:04:48.150> that<00:04:48.720> you

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
really comes into its own is that you

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.270 
really comes into its own is that you
can<00:04:49.020> actually<00:04:49.229> if<00:04:49.530> I<00:04:49.590> go<00:04:49.740> back<00:04:49.919> out<00:04:50.069> to<00:04:50.250> the

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
can actually if I go back out to the

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.300 
can actually if I go back out to the
home<00:04:50.490> screen<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:51.090> then<00:04:51.599> on<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.900> videos<00:04:52.310> let's

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
home screen and then on to videos let's

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.689 
home screen and then on to videos let's
set<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.550> video<00:04:53.819> playing<00:04:54.150> back<00:04:55.099> so<00:04:56.099> we<00:04:56.520> can

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
set a video playing back so we can

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.990 
set a video playing back so we can
actually<00:04:57.259> turn<00:04:58.259> the<00:04:59.129> speaker<00:04:59.520> on<00:04:59.610> its<00:04:59.759> side

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
actually turn the speaker on its side

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.029 
actually turn the speaker on its side
and<00:05:00.960> play<00:05:01.319> in<00:05:01.530> this<00:05:01.680> former<00:05:02.129> yes<00:05:02.970> and<00:05:03.360> this

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039

little<00:05:05.039> stand<00:05:05.490> on<00:05:05.789> the<00:05:06.180> back<00:05:06.360> actually

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
little stand on the back actually

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.800 
little stand on the back actually
rotates<00:05:07.409> round<00:05:07.940> so<00:05:08.940> it's<00:05:09.270> gone<00:05:09.449> from<00:05:09.599> this

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
rotates round so it's gone from this
