itself it's one of the lights like

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.110 
itself it's one of the lights like
pretty<00:00:34.890> much<00:00:34.980> every<00:00:35.310> other<00:00:35.400> son<00:00:35.760> way<00:00:35.910> light

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
pretty much every other son way light

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.120 
pretty much every other son way light
except<00:00:36.390> for<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.600> L<00:00:36.720> Series<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.920> have<00:00:38.100> a

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
except for the L Series you have a

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.889 
except for the L Series you have a
selector<00:00:38.700> ring<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.360> use<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.720> to

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
selector ring that you use this to

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.750 
selector ring that you use this to
switch<00:00:40.110> between<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.560> modes<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.610> one

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
switch between the modes and this one

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.889 
switch between the modes and this one
actually<00:00:41.850> doesn't<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> switch<00:00:42.720> on<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
actually doesn't have a switch on the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.930 
actually doesn't have a switch on the
back<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.220> selector<00:00:44.610> ring<00:00:44.760> does

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
back so the selector ring does

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.150 
back so the selector ring does
everything<00:00:45.239> include<00:00:45.720> turning<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.290> off<00:00:46.380> so

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
everything include turning it off so

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.620 
everything include turning it off so
let's<00:00:47.280> go<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.550> take<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.790> head<00:00:47.970> off<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
let's go and take that head off and

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.090 
let's go and take that head off and
we'll<00:00:48.840> put<00:00:49.020> some<00:00:49.170> batteries<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> battery

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
we'll put some batteries in the battery

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.069 
we'll put some batteries in the battery
carrier<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.820> I'll<00:00:50.940> show<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.149> how<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.390> works

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.569 

here's<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> battery<00:00:55.500> carrier<00:00:55.980> nice<00:00:56.280> sturdy

then we'll show you the operation of it

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:21.080 
then we'll show you the operation of it
so<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.279> said<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.579> ring<00:01:20.729> controls

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
so like I said the ring controls

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.879 
so like I said the ring controls
everything<00:01:21.389> so<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.499> three<00:01:22.740> different

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:22.889 
everything so you have three different

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:27.529 
everything so you have three different
brightnesses<00:01:23.429> 1<00:01:24.299> 2<00:01:25.079> 3<00:01:25.469> and<00:01:26.340> then<00:01:27.240> your<00:01:27.359> last

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
brightnesses 1 2 3 and then your last

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.779 
brightnesses 1 2 3 and then your last
position<00:01:27.749> is<00:01:28.109> stroke<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:29.249> you<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.459> use<00:01:29.639> the

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
position is stroke so you can use the

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.459 
position is stroke so you can use the
Rings<00:01:29.969> you<00:01:30.090> control<00:01:30.359> everything<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.439> way

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
Rings you control everything all the way

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.709 
Rings you control everything all the way
over<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.039> left<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.459> going<00:01:32.609> to<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:32.759> off<00:01:32.880> so

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
over to the left is going to be off so

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.349 
over to the left is going to be off so
three<00:01:33.929> different<00:01:34.200> brightnesses<00:01:35.179> and<00:01:36.179> there's

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
three different brightnesses and there's

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.730 
three different brightnesses and there's
your<00:01:36.509> stroke

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
your stroke

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.020 
your stroke
you<00:01:39.740> can<00:01:39.890> see<00:01:40.010> the<00:01:40.130> reflector<00:01:40.550> and<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.760> LED

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
you can see the reflector and the LED

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.450 
you can see the reflector and the LED
down<00:01:41.390> in<00:01:41.540> there<00:01:41.690> it's<00:01:42.110> using<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.440> cree<00:01:42.680> xr-e<00:01:43.070> are

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
down in there it's using a cree xr-e are

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.580 
down in there it's using a cree xr-e are
to<00:01:43.730> zoom<00:01:44.720> in<00:01:44.900> so<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:45.050> can<00:01:45.140> get<00:01:45.230> a<00:01:45.290> little<00:01:45.440> bit

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
to zoom in so you can get a little bit

backyard with the m30 a and we're going
to<00:02:16.550> use<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.000> standard<00:02:17.290> 40<00:02:18.290> maglite<00:02:18.740> to

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
to use the standard 40 maglite to

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.170 
to use the standard 40 maglite to
compare<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.430> with<00:02:19.460> so<00:02:19.940> we'll<00:02:20.030> give<00:02:20.150> that
