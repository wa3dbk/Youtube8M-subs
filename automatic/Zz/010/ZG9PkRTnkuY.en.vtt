00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.059
 development of the first drugs specifically designed for

 have not been on the word of people stuttering now our head 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.980
 and should start in early 2009 thanks to this asceticism since it led 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:55.520
 more will receive tsang 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.940

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.770
 suggests a new initiative launched last Tuesday by several 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.180
 global giants of telecom and IT this icon view status 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.190

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.860
 internet and on laptops then right now 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 the use of 3g cards to connect to broadband on the aisles 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.340
 park table and talk to god because too complicated at all levels 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.860
 especially when compared to other connection systems as is 6 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.240
 popular wifi could remedy a new brand has just been 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.170
 created and sandrine bailly val-de-marne the project brings a lot of 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.740
 participants hardly that she spiegel 18 chiba 'microstart' orange and the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.670
 panicked even vodafone they actually all committed to investing 100 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.300
 billions of dollars in total and after to install on the consumer indics 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.210
 drivers that will manage 3g devices 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.340
 so what to say but actually I think that all this shows how much 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.619
 big boxes are trying to take advantage of tons of supports have already been 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.680
 invested in developing the 3g connection

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.630
 tantalizing flow that I saw from an imac iphone 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.560
 as you see in the photos this model fauji saves allows to 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.010
 separate screen keyboard and this can be used separately gomis but 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.890
 thanks to magnets one of the two screens these keyboard slides actually it 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.080
 is tactile and then configures itself according to the position according to which 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.520
 very large royal ball that contains software functions among which 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.950
 are the video recordings and the young the keyboard by contrÃ© 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.430
 responsible for the communication functions among which the 3g and the 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.960
 radio so you say what christine hope it will become a day 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.749
 reality 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:47.550
 no return to the cybernetic future saturday the loop is complete 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.560
 thanks to tell you 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.430
 having scooped whale decades she just launched a version of 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.219
 its search engine the one that existed in 2000 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.650
 with packages this year with about 9% and 3 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.189
 a wine of honor offered a trip of seven years back it is worth noting that 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.899
 these three defendants were tolerated at the time 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:08.699
 alassane ouattara six points no but what do you want me to find 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:11.219
 it's great me I had fun 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.279
 looking for stuff was still wrong today we will have some 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:15.369
 surprises 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:20.060
 so I do not know me ipod was not referring to an mp3 player 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.839
 have been standing up since Monday 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.729
 summer wikipedia 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:26.509
 bowling 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.239
 do you remember the books of which you are the hero 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.080
 but if you know those little cards that tell you a story and a half 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.109
 to choose from the different options was not possible but 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.889
 know that now you can do the same thing but with a movie 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.059
 it's called working it's an interactive zombie movie for as much 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:48.159
 of participating spectators they should decide what the 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.469
 pay the pair at the end of each set frankly it's really nice 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:54.469
 tried I leave you the deloitte units 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.289
 so I leave you these options between two things continue with this 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:01.729
 nebula in the past to the next 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:06.029
 how then cruelly realistic scene there is no choice but 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:09.859
 take definitely finished the panel called the rain is already nipping 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.809
 so if like me you hate her tried for rape umbrellas 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:18.589
 that's its attributable part will allow us to create sme can not 

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.729
 unfortunately not do much more for the notaries the truce 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.990

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.920
 possible no 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.830
 nadja kamer the video that follows ah yes I forgot we know there will be 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.910
 mobile phone losses know that you incite p55 story that you 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.680
 can see us from anywhere 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.730
