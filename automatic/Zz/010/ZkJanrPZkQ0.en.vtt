00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Here I introduce the alkali metals 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.850
 these are the elements of the group 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.010
 one in the periodic table and that 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.059
 starting with lithium then comes 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.030
 sodium and then comes potassium that is 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.740
 this group one in the periodic table the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.500
 elements in there are all have 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.640
 similar features but are still 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.380
 move easily 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.320
 and that's what I'll show right away 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.039
 three of me, although the leftmost here to the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.390
 atrium I sort that first lithium 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.790
 then we have here 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.130
 sodium then we have last 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.040
 potassium in this order 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.110
 They are also arranged in the periodic table 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.730
 and that has a definite reason and 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.250
 I'll show you the example of 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.200
 We'll start communicating with these three 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.629
 First, we examine the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.820
 Hardness of these three metals and here 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.449
 at the lithium that the dirt layer 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.340
 tuned 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.840
 this is because it is their all but 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.640
 I'll cut off such a piece now 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.370
 this is really a soft metal 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.780
 in the ratio 2 1 for example and here 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.339
 we now see the typical 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.299
 metallic gloss so next 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.470
 we come to the sodium 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.479
 Here too I cut with the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.540
 scissors, and what did not realize the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.979
 is already much softer here too 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.500
 I briefly see the metallic sheen 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.210
 but it reacts again with the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.380
 quickly hurry up again 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.130
 that maybe the metallic one 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.470
 music here 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.509
 and as soon as the air comes ran it will 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.450
 again knows that about then pulls 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.979
 with a layer of sodium oxide that 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.799
 Metal is much softer in any case 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.520
 the nature and yes we really the potassium 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:42.360
 that is buttery soft you can do so 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.770
 Express that too is already remembered 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.409
 no longer metal on it 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.390
 but of course, too 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.920
 metallic gloss we here, however 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.350
 not see the course he now also 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.909
 disappear again because that with the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.770
 Oxygen reacts next 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.960
 Let 's take a look at them here 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.240
 characteristics that weight can do that 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.770
 you can not see it now but here 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.630
 that explains I like 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.149
 the lithium here is all that 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.039
 easiest if we are just the same 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.140
 hunk up so how can they 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.970
 is the sodium a little heavier and that 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.950
 Potassium is here of the three 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.610
 heaviest that is from top to bottom 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:25.440
 in the group the elements always become 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:29.129
 heavier and make all the elements 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.720
 together with water, a liquor they 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.680
 All of them also react with water 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.720
 all together 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.330
 but they all react differently 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.310
 strong with water and I show that now 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.950
 times the responsiveness of this 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.370
 here with these metals with water 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.019
 Here we have three of the total me 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.750
 just a little bit of lithium into it 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.000
 second sodium and the third potassium 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.370
 each the same amount I versehe 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.950
 hall 3 test tubes with something 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.680
 phenolphthalein solution that it is 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.950
 imitator and he shows us if one 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.620
 The result is that everyone is born 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.190
 Alkali metals image in the reaction with 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.440
 water a run and it also arises 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.049
 in the reaction of ak never metals that 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.670
 gas hydrogen and that is what we have 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.780
 same with the knallers sample after that 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.000
 I do as I up here equal 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.150
 just hold a lighter on it and 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.220
 Although as the first practical piece 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.560
 lithium into the test tube and you can see it 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.920
 starts to bubble and a little bit 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.560
 it immediately forms the euro its the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.540
 pink coloring of the indicator and that is 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.450
 the proof that all this now 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.019
 an arbor forms here above and 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.019
 lighter hit 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.799
 gazprom is positive that the hydrogen 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:51.180
 has arisen next I take 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:53.720
 Now something sodium and will this here 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.880
 in the second 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.560
 that has already reacted much more violent 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.560
 we can trace his tracks 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:09.890
 that worked really well for me 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:14.980
 beech dress and into the third deer ins 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:18.079
 glas comes now a bit potassium and 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.209
 That's where the reactions really start 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.510
 In contrast, no longer sick in the vehicle 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:32.380
 proving the hydrogen there goes immediately 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:36.230
 Hydrogen is already gone here 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.640
 We see the lithium in all three 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.720
 reacts the weakest 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:44.150
 second best is sodium and potassium 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.730
 that gets in contact with water 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.890
 get started here and all three of them 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.210
 the gas hydrogen we now again 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.010
 a larger amount, and indeed in 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.130
 neat lumps of sodium 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:59.780
 Really just and realize that 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:03.020
 are exactly 17 7 grams so about 18 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:06.500
 gram and then we have 38 again 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:10.190
 potassium and everything I wrap 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:14.479
 now here in a cloth and fixed 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.160
 that then with a little bit and then 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.870
 Let's just leave it with water 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.570
 react the cloth namely as a small 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.160
 Delay because here sucks then 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.660
 the water slowly through otherwise 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.070
 that would react immediately 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.600
 that's why I take that as a small one 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.479
 Delay and we'll throw it right away 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.910
 a little head with water like that 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.400
 first comes the potassium and as 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.700
 second station atrium that comes as mine 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.700
 beard 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.340
 so next the sodium that is the 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:59.080
 larger quantity but that is minimal 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.830
 less reactive, however, does the 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.830
 flock off again
