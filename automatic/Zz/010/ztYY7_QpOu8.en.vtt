00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
installation or so give or take very

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.000 
installation or so give or take very
easy<00:00:23.880> not<00:00:24.570> too<00:00:24.990> much<00:00:25.320> having<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:25.920> with

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
easy not too much having to do with

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.310 
easy not too much having to do with
electrical<00:00:26.779> even<00:00:27.779> though<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.930> do<00:00:28.080> have<00:00:28.230> to

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
electrical even though you do have to

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.689 
electrical even though you do have to
kind<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.529> mess<00:00:28.710> with<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.980> electrical<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.640> a

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
kind of mess with the electrical it's a

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.200 
kind of mess with the electrical it's a
very<00:00:29.960> simple<00:00:30.960> process<00:00:31.289> as<00:00:31.650> will<00:00:31.830> show<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.520> for

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
very simple process as will show so for

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.030 
very simple process as will show so for
the<00:00:33.450> first<00:00:33.630> step<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.469> get<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:34.920> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the first step here and we get on the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.470 
the first step here and we get on the
other<00:00:35.130> side<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:36.980> we<00:00:37.980> have<00:00:38.100> just<00:00:38.219> removed<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
other side here we have just removed the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.830 
other side here we have just removed the
one<00:00:39.690> bolt<00:00:40.070> to<00:00:41.070> loosen<00:00:41.820> up<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.940> gas<00:00:42.210> tank<00:00:42.570> so

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
one bolt to loosen up the gas tank so

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.350 
one bolt to loosen up the gas tank so
now<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.160> lift<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.460> up<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:47.270> that's<00:00:48.270> going

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
now we can lift this up and that's going

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.819 
now we can lift this up and that's going
to<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:48.539> for<00:00:48.750> putting<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.110> fuel<00:00:49.410> gage<00:00:49.590> on

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
to be for putting that fuel gage on

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.400 
to be for putting that fuel gage on
there<00:00:50.010> by<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> way<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.840> get<00:00:51.960> back<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.289> here

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
there by the way so we get back to here

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.590 
there by the way so we get back to here
in<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> second

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.490 

so<00:00:58.600> you<00:00:58.660> just<00:00:58.870> got<00:00:59.200> to<00:00:59.320> get<00:00:59.410> them<00:00:59.650> wires<00:00:59.950> out

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
so you just got to get them wires out

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.079 
so you just got to get them wires out
which<00:01:02.500> Gabe<00:01:02.860> is<00:01:03.040> doing<00:01:03.220> a<00:01:03.310> stand-up<00:01:03.670> job<00:01:03.910> of

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
which Gabe is doing a stand-up job of

hardest part which is removing the wires

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.940 
hardest part which is removing the wires
from<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.780> SST<00:01:32.619> housing<00:01:33.190> yeah<00:01:34.410> or<00:01:35.410> the<00:01:35.560> housing

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
from the SST housing yeah or the housing

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.889 
from the SST housing yeah or the housing
is<00:01:36.340> this<00:01:36.430> called<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.759> SST<00:01:37.210> housing<00:01:37.570> over<00:01:37.690> here

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
is this called the SST housing over here

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.620 
is this called the SST housing over here
as<00:01:37.990> well<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.380> don't<00:01:39.280> know

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
anyways removing those wires as little

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.120 
anyways removing those wires as little
they're<00:01:42.759> like<00:01:42.910> a<00:01:42.940> little<00:01:43.320> fitting<00:01:44.320> clip<00:01:44.680> on

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
they're like a little fitting clip on

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.109 
they're like a little fitting clip on
the<00:01:46.030> end<00:01:46.060> of<00:01:46.180> a<00:01:46.300> wire<00:01:46.509> a<00:01:46.840> little<00:01:47.229> connector<00:01:47.770> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
the end of a wire a little connector and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.920 
the end of a wire a little connector and
they're<00:01:49.119> just<00:01:49.240> kind<00:01:49.390> of<00:01:49.450> a<00:01:49.539> little<00:01:49.660> bit<00:01:49.750> of<00:01:49.869> a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
they're just kind of a little bit of a

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
they're just kind of a little bit of a
pain<00:01:50.080> you<00:01:50.140> just<00:01:50.289> kind<00:01:50.500> of<00:01:50.530> have<00:01:50.649> to<00:01:50.680> get<00:01:50.860> them

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
pain you just kind of have to get them

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.350 
pain you just kind of have to get them
you<00:01:51.280> have<00:01:51.369> to<00:01:51.460> figure<00:01:51.640> out<00:01:51.729> their<00:01:51.910> sweet<00:01:52.090> spot

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
you have to figure out their sweet spot

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.700 
you have to figure out their sweet spot
to<00:01:52.509> pull<00:01:52.690> them<00:01:52.810> out<00:01:52.869> they<00:01:53.080> should<00:01:53.530> pull<00:01:53.680> up

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
to pull them out they should pull up

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.990 
to pull them out they should pull up
pretty<00:01:54.039> smoothly<00:01:54.460> right

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
pretty smoothly right

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.990 
pretty smoothly right
yeah<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:56.649> getting<00:01:56.920> them<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.399> pull<00:01:57.610> out<00:01:57.789> is

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
yeah but getting them to pull out is

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.139 
yeah but getting them to pull out is
pretty<00:01:58.270> difficult<00:01:58.509> so<00:01:59.789> one<00:02:00.789> of<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:00.940> hardest

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
pretty difficult so one of the hardest

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.429 
pretty difficult so one of the hardest
pots<00:02:01.299> you<00:02:01.450> have<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:01.659> actually<00:02:01.900> rewire<00:02:02.229> this

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
pots you have to actually rewire this

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.870 
pots you have to actually rewire this
tree<00:02:02.680> crimp<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.040> nothing<00:02:03.369> no<00:02:03.909> okay<00:02:04.630> cool

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
tree crimp it nothing no okay cool

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.750 
tree crimp it nothing no okay cool

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
you see this thing there's four groups

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.630 
you see this thing there's four groups
right<00:03:50.030> here<00:03:50.270> and<00:03:51.080> if<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.320> can<00:03:51.440> see<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:51.830> a

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
right here and if you can see it a

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.870 
right here and if you can see it a
little<00:03:52.970> bit<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:54.100> this<00:03:55.100> has<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.520> go<00:03:55.640> in<00:03:55.760> the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
little bit so this has to go in the

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.480 
little bit so this has to go in the
middle<00:03:56.200> but<00:03:57.200> then<00:03:57.320> we<00:03:57.470> when<00:03:57.890> you<00:03:58.010> turn<00:03:58.310> it

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
middle but then we when you turn it

middle but then we when you turn it
that's<00:03:59.240> what's<00:03:59.540> going<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.690> hold<00:03:59.870> it<00:04:00.080> in<00:04:00.940> even

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
that's what's going to hold it in even

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
if you pull it out it's not going to

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.190

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
point what we've done is taken a picture

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.780 
point what we've done is taken a picture
of<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:58.960> actual<00:04:59.260> wiring<00:04:59.500> and<00:04:59.890> how<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:00.520> sat<00:05:00.760> in

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
of the actual wiring and how it sat in

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.460 
of the actual wiring and how it sat in
the<00:05:01.000> original<00:05:01.330> housing<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.020> now<00:05:02.290> we're

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
the original housing and now we're

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.590 
the original housing and now we're
trying<00:05:02.800> to<00:05:02.950> match<00:05:03.130> that<00:05:03.370> up<00:05:03.580> always<00:05:03.940> a<00:05:04.210> smart

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
trying to match that up always a smart

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.030 
trying to match that up always a smart
idea<00:05:04.810> especially<00:05:05.140> with<00:05:05.410> technology<00:05:05.590> today

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
idea especially with technology today

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.000 
idea especially with technology today
take<00:05:06.910> pictures<00:05:07.330> along<00:05:07.630> the<00:05:07.690> way<00:05:07.860> with<00:05:08.860> each

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
take pictures along the way with each

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.340 
take pictures along the way with each
step<00:05:09.310> before<00:05:09.520> you<00:05:09.760> do<00:05:10.000> anything<00:05:10.210> so<00:05:11.110> that<00:05:11.170> way

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
step before you do anything so that way

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.730 
step before you do anything so that way
you<00:05:11.410> can<00:05:11.560> replicate<00:05:11.880> what<00:05:12.880> was<00:05:13.060> already<00:05:13.740> there

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
you can replicate what was already there

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.360 
you can replicate what was already there
in<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:14.920> first<00:05:15.130> place<00:05:15.280> so<00:05:16.890> what<00:05:17.890> it<00:05:18.010> the<00:05:18.130> same

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
in the first place so what it the same

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.800 
in the first place so what it the same
wiring<00:05:18.910> I<00:05:19.150> mean<00:05:20.010> there's<00:05:21.010> no<00:05:21.360> yes<00:05:22.360> all<00:05:22.660> the

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
wiring I mean there's no yes all the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.270 
wiring I mean there's no yes all the
same<00:05:23.080> wiring<00:05:23.410> you<00:05:23.590> don't<00:05:23.740> actually<00:05:23.890> really

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
same wiring you don't actually really

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.010 
same wiring you don't actually really
mess<00:05:24.610> with<00:05:24.790> too<00:05:24.940> much<00:05:25.060> electrical<00:05:25.480> stuff<00:05:25.840> you

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
mess with too much electrical stuff you

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.000 
mess with too much electrical stuff you
just<00:05:26.050> make<00:05:26.500> sure<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:26.710> bike's<00:05:26.920> off<00:05:27.190> and<00:05:29.010> you

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
just make sure the bike's off and you

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.110 
just make sure the bike's off and you
know<00:05:30.130> like<00:05:30.370> I<00:05:30.460> said<00:05:30.610> I'll<00:05:30.700> probably<00:05:31.060> the

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
know like I said I'll probably the

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.550 
know like I said I'll probably the
hardest<00:05:31.420> part<00:05:31.450> of<00:05:31.660> this<00:05:31.720> whole<00:05:31.780> installation

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
hardest part of this whole installation

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.830 
hardest part of this whole installation
is<00:05:32.770> removing<00:05:33.700> the<00:05:33.730> little<00:05:34.120> wires<00:05:34.540> from<00:05:34.750> the

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
is removing the little wires from the

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.040 
is removing the little wires from the
Hat<00:05:35.080> the<00:05:35.290> old<00:05:35.560> housing<00:05:36.100> and<00:05:36.810> putting<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:37.900> new

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
Hat the old housing and putting the new

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.660 
Hat the old housing and putting the new
wires<00:05:38.290> are<00:05:38.680> the<00:05:38.800> old<00:05:38.950> wires<00:05:39.130> back<00:05:39.430> into<00:05:39.460> the

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
wires are the old wires back into the

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.120 
wires are the old wires back into the
new<00:05:39.880> housing<00:05:40.270> it's<00:05:40.360> not<00:05:40.480> difficult<00:05:40.690> at<00:05:40.930> all<00:05:41.130> is

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
new housing it's not difficult at all is

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.470 
new housing it's not difficult at all is
that<00:05:42.280> upside<00:05:42.490> down<00:05:42.610> or<00:05:42.760> is<00:05:42.820> it<00:05:42.940> right-side<00:05:43.210> up

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
that upside down or is it right-side up

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.860 
that upside down or is it right-side up
that's<00:05:44.080> right<00:05:44.760> side<00:05:45.760> up<00:05:46.000> so<00:05:46.330> right<00:05:46.690> now<00:05:46.810> we

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
that's right side up so right now we

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.840 
that's right side up so right now we
just<00:05:46.990> have<00:05:47.230> the<00:05:47.260> one<00:05:47.350> unit<00:05:47.890> installed<00:05:48.520> nice

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
just have the one unit installed nice

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.450 
just have the one unit installed nice

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.020 
with a new digital digital yeah I'm
probably<00:06:04.720> gonna<00:06:05.080> try<00:06:05.320> to<00:06:05.380> get<00:06:05.590> it<00:06:05.740> blue<00:06:06.130> gives

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
probably gonna try to get it blue gives

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.610 
probably gonna try to get it blue gives
one<00:06:07.180> gallon<00:06:07.540> batches<00:06:07.840> do<00:06:08.200> you<00:06:08.290> think<00:06:08.560> about

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
one gallon batches do you think about

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.340 
one gallon batches do you think about
the<00:06:08.860> only<00:06:09.160> the<00:06:09.550> hard<00:06:09.730> water<00:06:09.910> no<00:06:10.480> the<00:06:10.690> Dakota

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
the only the hard water no the Dakota

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.320 
the only the hard water no the Dakota
digital<00:06:11.620> Dakota<00:06:12.310> digital<00:06:12.760> so<00:06:12.970> we're<00:06:13.090> probably

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
digital Dakota digital so we're probably

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.460 
digital Dakota digital so we're probably
doing<00:06:13.510> to<00:06:13.690> code<00:06:13.870> a<00:06:13.900> digital<00:06:14.790> speedometer

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
doing to code a digital speedometer

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.360 
doing to code a digital speedometer
replacement<00:06:17.470> down<00:06:17.620> the<00:06:17.770> road<00:06:17.950> to<00:06:18.130> kind<00:06:18.310> of

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
replacement down the road to kind of

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.370 
replacement down the road to kind of
match<00:06:18.520> up<00:06:18.550> with<00:06:18.940> this<00:06:19.240> as<00:06:19.630> long<00:06:19.870> as<00:06:20.020> the<00:06:20.170> Blues

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
match up with this as long as the Blues

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.030 
match up with this as long as the Blues
kind<00:06:20.650> of<00:06:20.710> match<00:06:20.830> up<00:06:21.300> that'll<00:06:22.300> look<00:06:22.390> real<00:06:22.570> sharp

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
kind of match up that'll look real sharp

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.890 
kind of match up that'll look real sharp
so<00:06:24.040> remove<00:06:24.280> the<00:06:24.460> old<00:06:24.580> gas<00:06:24.850> cap<00:06:25.210> and<00:06:25.420> then

so remove the old gas cap and then

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.150 
so remove the old gas cap and then
you'll<00:06:26.080> want<00:06:26.290> to<00:06:26.350> go<00:06:26.470> ahead<00:06:26.560> and<00:06:26.740> clean<00:06:27.130> off

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
you'll want to go ahead and clean off

it's a you know has no gasoline remnants
sitting<00:06:32.500> on<00:06:32.620> there<00:06:32.860> and<00:06:33.040> that<00:06:33.130> it's<00:06:33.250> just<00:06:33.430> kind

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
sitting on there and that it's just kind

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.990 
sitting on there and that it's just kind
of<00:06:34.620> ready<00:06:35.620> for<00:06:35.860> some<00:06:35.980> adhesive<00:06:36.520> mainly

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 
of ready for some adhesive mainly

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.900 
of ready for some adhesive mainly
setting<00:06:37.720> the<00:06:38.260> the<00:06:38.860> newest<00:06:39.190> cushon<00:06:39.580> on<00:06:39.700> the

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
setting the the newest cushon on the

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.320 
setting the the newest cushon on the
bike<00:06:40.270> here<00:06:40.630> or<00:06:40.810> whatever<00:06:41.050> it<00:06:41.200> is<00:06:41.320> the<00:06:42.330> it

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
bike here or whatever it is the it

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.480 
bike here or whatever it is the it
doesn't<00:06:43.540> fit<00:06:44.020> in<00:06:44.290> all<00:06:44.530> areas<00:06:44.980> so<00:06:45.130> you<00:06:45.250> usually

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
doesn't fit in all areas so you usually

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.750 
doesn't fit in all areas so you usually
have<00:06:45.880> to<00:06:46.150> kind<00:06:46.570> of<00:06:46.660> turn<00:06:47.410> it

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
have to kind of turn it

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.420 
have to kind of turn it
and<00:06:48.300> find<00:06:48.660> the<00:06:49.170> best<00:06:49.380> fit<00:06:49.710> for<00:06:49.740> it<00:06:50.100> to<00:06:50.220> where<00:06:50.370> it

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
and find the best fit for it to where it

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.290 
and find the best fit for it to where it
fits<00:06:50.670> the<00:06:51.090> most<00:06:51.680> flush<00:06:52.680> with<00:06:53.520> the<00:06:53.640> system<00:06:54.090> so

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 
fits the most flush with the system so

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.670 
fits the most flush with the system so
you<00:06:54.870> don't<00:06:54.900> have<00:06:55.170> a<00:06:55.230> gap<00:06:55.530> and<00:06:56.180> and<00:06:57.180> so<00:06:57.810> for<00:06:58.440> this

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
you don't have a gap and and so for this

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.110 
you don't have a gap and and so for this
what<00:06:58.920> we're<00:06:59.040> going<00:06:59.160> to<00:06:59.220> use<00:06:59.430> is<00:06:59.640> gaffers<00:07:00.090> tape

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
what we're going to use is gaffers tape

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.570 
what we're going to use is gaffers tape
or<00:07:00.840> painters<00:07:01.380> tape<00:07:01.620> or<00:07:01.920> you<00:07:02.190> know<00:07:02.280> just<00:07:02.310> some

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 
or painters tape or you know just some
