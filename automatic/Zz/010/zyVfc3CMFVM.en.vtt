00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
guiding a lot then you're going to be

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.780 
guiding a lot then you're going to be
into<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.780> or<00:02:18.989> into<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.380> then<00:02:19.590> get<00:02:20.040> i<00:02:20.310> don't<00:02:20.700> know

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
into it or into it then get i don't know

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.280 
into it or into it then get i don't know
i<00:02:20.970> don't<00:02:21.000> really<00:02:21.300> grind<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:21.690> much<00:02:21.870> like<00:02:22.140> I've

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
i don't really grind that much like I've

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.140 
i don't really grind that much like I've
a<00:02:22.319> little<00:02:22.739> bit<00:02:22.950> like<00:02:23.730> 5050<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.959> little<00:02:25.739> tiny<00:02:26.150> but

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
a little bit like 5050 a little tiny but

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.530 
a little bit like 5050 a little tiny but
yeah<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.220> that's<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.459> alright<00:02:30.270> we're<00:02:30.420> going

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
yeah so that's that alright we're going

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.240 
yeah so that's that alright we're going
on<00:02:30.720> two<00:02:30.810> wheels<00:02:31.190> my<00:02:32.190> wheels<00:02:32.400> are<00:02:32.730> like<00:02:33.860> ever<00:02:34.860> at

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
on two wheels my wheels are like ever at

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.760 
on two wheels my wheels are like ever at
tea<00:02:35.489> or<00:02:35.640> something<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.209> have<00:02:36.300> no<00:02:36.420> clue<00:02:36.770> it's

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
tea or something I have no clue it's

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.250 
tea or something I have no clue it's
just<00:02:37.950> wheel<00:02:38.100> sizes<00:02:38.400> we<00:02:38.760> just<00:02:38.880> go<00:02:39.030> from<00:02:39.330> 50<00:02:39.930> all

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
just wheel sizes we just go from 50 all

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.240 
just wheel sizes we just go from 50 all
the<00:02:40.410> way<00:02:40.530> up<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.680> probably<00:02:41.569> really<00:02:42.569> big<00:02:42.810> like

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
the way up to probably really big like

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.130 
the way up to probably really big like
60s<00:02:44.250> maybe<00:02:44.850> but<00:02:45.540> those<00:02:45.690> are<00:02:45.810> for<00:02:45.930> longboarding

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
60s maybe but those are for longboarding

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.199 
60s maybe but those are for longboarding
so<00:02:46.739> if<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:46.920> get<00:02:47.010> little<00:02:47.250> wheels<00:02:47.610> like<00:02:47.910> tiny

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
so if you get little wheels like tiny

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.790 
so if you get little wheels like tiny
wheels<00:02:48.510> you'll<00:02:48.660> get<00:02:48.810> stuck<00:02:49.050> on<00:02:49.200> every<00:02:49.500> crack

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
wheels you'll get stuck on every crack

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.199 
wheels you'll get stuck on every crack
fall<00:02:50.790> down<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.450> if<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.930> get<00:02:52.290> big<00:02:53.190> wheels<00:02:53.580> yomo

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
fall down and if you get big wheels yomo

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.240 
fall down and if you get big wheels yomo
over<00:02:54.720> crash<00:02:54.989> but<00:02:55.319> you<00:02:55.470> won't<00:02:55.680> be<00:02:55.800> able<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.100> flip

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
over crash but you won't be able to flip

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.789 
over crash but you won't be able to flip
it<00:02:56.310> because<00:02:56.730> they're<00:02:56.880> too<00:02:57.030> heavy<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.569> I'd<00:02:58.470> say

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
it because they're too heavy and I'd say

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.740 
it because they're too heavy and I'd say
go<00:02:59.040> with<00:02:59.250> about<00:02:59.549> 50<00:03:00.360> 51<00:03:01.370> 52<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:03.120> think<00:03:03.569> these<00:03:03.690> are

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
go with about 50 51 52 I think these are

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.990 
go with about 50 51 52 I think these are
like<00:03:03.959> 50<00:03:04.260> threes<00:03:04.530> they<00:03:05.069> were<00:03:05.130> there<00:03:05.580> good<00:03:05.790> I

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
like 50 threes they were there good I

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.110 
like 50 threes they were there good I
like<00:03:06.239> them<00:03:06.420> all<00:03:06.660> right<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.470> then<00:03:08.120> bushings

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
like them all right and then bushings

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.500 
like them all right and then bushings
nothing<00:03:09.840> really<00:03:10.200> major<00:03:10.380> just<00:03:10.860> get<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.510> any

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
nothing really major just get and any

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.560 
nothing really major just get and any
ones<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.870> want<00:03:13.049> and<00:03:13.320> then<00:03:13.769> um<00:03:14.579> these<00:03:15.090> hardware

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
ones you want and then um these hardware

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.020 
ones you want and then um these hardware
I<00:03:15.810> like<00:03:16.079> mine<00:03:16.320> because<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.739> have<00:03:17.100> black<00:03:17.730> on<00:03:17.970> the

I like mine because I have black on the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.180 
I like mine because I have black on the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
back and then like silver on the front

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.620 
back and then like silver on the front
looks<00:03:20.549> cool<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.239> then<00:03:21.810> last<00:03:22.709> um<00:03:23.040> bearings<00:03:23.970> so

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
looks cool and then last um bearings so

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.460 
looks cool and then last um bearings so
just<00:03:24.870> bearings<00:03:25.380> I<00:03:25.859> have<00:03:26.160> bones<00:03:26.400> there<00:03:27.470> well

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
just bearings I have bones there well

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.410 
just bearings I have bones there well
that's<00:03:28.620> crappy<00:03:29.010> wheel<00:03:29.190> they're<00:03:29.940> pretty<00:03:30.120> good

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
that's crappy wheel they're pretty good

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.240 
that's crappy wheel they're pretty good
I<00:03:30.750> mean<00:03:31.019> I<00:03:31.549> like<00:03:32.549> them<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:34.560> doesn't<00:03:35.130> really

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
I mean I like them and it doesn't really

yeah you know they spin for they're
still<00:03:51.239> spinning<00:03:51.599> right<00:03:51.720> now<00:03:51.750> there's<00:03:52.080> been

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
still spinning right now there's been

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.149 
still spinning right now there's been
for<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.500> long<00:03:52.530> time<00:03:52.980> but<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:54.709> don't<00:03:55.709> know<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:55.829> hope
