00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:09.719
 then another video then showing how 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:13.920
 play guarÃ¢nia and rasqueado 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.529
 we have two shapes I like the bass 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.520
 sun but also has a low marking 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.750
 rhythm that I think is also 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.750
 interesting the bass would only look like 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.369
 i 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.760
 and hey 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.800
 is 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.470
 and is 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.589
 it's already bass as the rhythm stays there 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.340
 ae 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.020
 ae 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:41.700
 it is you have these two options is that the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:41.700
 people and conditions you have 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.330
 It does not change anything to prove if the pain you 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.330
 only accelerates the carioca rhythm 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:32.770
 and he but he did not have time
