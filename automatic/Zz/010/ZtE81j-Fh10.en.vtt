00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:15.570 

okay<00:00:09.969> we're<00:00:10.480> going<00:00:10.719> to<00:00:11.019> do<00:00:13.709> four<00:00:14.709> linked

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
okay we're going to do four linked

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.830 
okay we're going to do four linked
triples<00:00:16.360> in<00:00:16.660> a<00:00:16.869> square<00:00:17.290> now<00:00:18.250> so<00:00:19.060> the<00:00:19.630> first

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
triples in a square now so the first

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:30.210 
triples in a square now so the first
thing<00:00:20.050> we<00:00:20.169> do<00:00:20.349> is<00:00:20.619> to<00:00:20.830> draw<00:00:21.099> a<00:00:21.310> square<00:00:29.220> I'm

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
thing we do is to draw a square I'm

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.240 
thing we do is to draw a square I'm
going<00:00:30.490> to<00:00:30.580> use<00:00:30.789> a<00:00:30.820> set<00:00:31.269> scrap<00:00:31.920> simply<00:00:32.920> because

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
going to use a set scrap simply because

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.200 
going to use a set scrap simply because
it<00:00:33.430> makes<00:00:34.269> it<00:00:34.510> I<00:00:35.850> do<00:00:36.850> it<00:00:37.030> more<00:00:37.420> quickly<00:00:39.210> that

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
it makes it I do it more quickly that

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.070 
it makes it I do it more quickly that
way<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:42.100> probably<00:00:42.519> possible<00:00:42.729> to<00:00:43.210> do<00:00:43.390> a

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:56.030 

square<00:00:47.080> without<00:00:48.659> without<00:00:49.659> a<00:00:49.720> set<00:00:50.080> square<00:00:53.100> but

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
square without without a set square but

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:05.510 
square without without a set square but
it's<00:00:57.040> quicker<00:00:57.369> this<00:00:57.610> way<00:00:58.949> and<00:01:00.750> I'm<00:01:01.750> going<00:01:02.080> to

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:17.889 

do<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.670> diagonals

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:24.200 

now<00:01:21.289> you're<00:01:22.289> going<00:01:22.469> to<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.679> doing<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.369> trifle<00:01:24.030> in

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
now you're going to be doing a trifle in

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.639 
now you're going to be doing a trifle in
a<00:01:24.240> different<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.749> is<00:01:24.929> nice<00:01:25.109> ah<00:01:25.350> Solis

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
a different this is nice ah Solis

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:32.440 
a different this is nice ah Solis
triangle<00:01:26.250> isn't<00:01:26.429> it<00:01:26.869> it's<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:29.090> 90-degree<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
triangle isn't it it's a 90-degree a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.429 
triangle isn't it it's a 90-degree a
right-angled<00:01:33.450> triangle<00:01:33.829> here<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:37.319> an

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
right-angled triangle here so it's an

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.289 
right-angled triangle here so it's an
isosceles<00:01:37.740> triangle<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.789> curves<00:01:39.090> are

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
isosceles triangle so the curves are

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.399 
isosceles triangle so the curves are
going<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.539> be<00:01:39.630> different<00:01:40.140> you're<00:01:40.229> going<00:01:40.259> to

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
going to be different you're going to

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.740 
going to be different you're going to
have<00:01:40.500> two<00:01:40.679> different<00:01:40.859> types<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.399> curves<00:01:41.750> it's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
have two different types of curves it's

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.510 
have two different types of curves it's
deadly<00:01:43.079> talking<00:01:43.319> about<00:01:43.439> ninety<00:01:43.859> degrees<00:01:43.890> do

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
deadly talking about ninety degrees do

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.599 
deadly talking about ninety degrees do
you<00:01:44.609> know<00:01:44.759> how<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.969> make<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> 90-degree<00:01:45.689> angle

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
you know how to make a 90-degree angle

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:53.800 
you know how to make a 90-degree angle
very<00:01:47.609> quickly<00:01:51.110> get<00:01:52.110> any<00:01:52.319> old<00:01:52.530> piece<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.829> paper

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
very quickly get any old piece of paper

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.959 
very quickly get any old piece of paper
fold<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.759> right<00:01:56.759> up<00:01:57.439> okay<00:01:58.670> fold<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.849> again

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
fold it right up okay fold it again

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.339 
fold it right up okay fold it again
along<00:02:00.539> that<00:02:00.780> straight<00:02:01.110> edge<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.319> a

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
along that straight edge that is a

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:08.569 
along that straight edge that is a
90-degree<00:02:05.009> angle<00:02:06.799> there<00:02:07.829> do<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.459> with

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:08.579 
90-degree angle there do it with

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:15.849 
90-degree angle there do it with
anything<00:02:08.970> do<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.420> leaf<00:02:10.670> useful<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.879> know<00:02:12.030> that

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:15.859 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:20.360 

so<00:02:16.859> I<00:02:17.359> think<00:02:18.359> I'm<00:02:18.750> going<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.069> just<00:02:20.069> put<00:02:20.340> a

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
so I think I'm going to just put a

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:43.530 
so I think I'm going to just put a
little<00:02:22.489> gap<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:30.709> separate<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:32.239> triangles

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.040 

okay<00:02:45.640> that's<00:02:46.640> not<00:02:46.880> very<00:02:47.209> good<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.420> one<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:47.990> a

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
okay that's not very good that one is a

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:57.550 
okay that's not very good that one is a
bit<00:02:48.380> too<00:02:48.650> wide<00:02:50.590> take<00:02:51.590> that<00:02:51.860> out<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:56.380> should<00:02:57.380> have

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
bit too wide take that out I should have

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.170 
bit too wide take that out I should have
missed<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:58.069> well<00:02:58.370> now<00:02:58.610> shouldn't<00:02:58.910> have<00:02:59.060> messed

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
missed it well now shouldn't have messed

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
missed it well now shouldn't have messed
it<00:02:59.420> why<00:02:59.630> should<00:02:59.840> i<00:02:59.959> what<00:03:00.739> should<00:03:00.800> I<00:03:01.010> measure<00:03:01.220> it

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
it why should i what should I measure it

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:11.040 
it why should i what should I measure it
do<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.230> like<00:03:04.720> okay<00:03:07.690> now<00:03:08.690> that<00:03:09.440> we<00:03:09.620> string<00:03:10.130> this

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
do I like okay now that we string this

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.610 
do I like okay now that we string this
curve<00:03:12.050> out<00:03:12.320> now<00:03:12.940> so<00:03:13.940> starting<00:03:14.570> here<00:03:14.620> I'm

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
curve out now so starting here I'm

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.560 
curve out now so starting here I'm
coming<00:03:16.130> up<00:03:16.280> over<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:16.970> top<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:18.820> ball<00:03:19.820> as<00:03:20.420> it

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
coming up over the top of the ball as it

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.140 
coming up over the top of the ball as it
were<00:03:23.019> coming<00:03:24.019> up<00:03:24.230> merging<00:03:25.220> about<00:03:25.550> a<00:03:25.580> third<00:03:26.000> of

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
were coming up merging about a third of

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.009 
were coming up merging about a third of
the<00:03:26.269> way<00:03:26.450> up<00:03:27.280> like<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.550> do<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.150> on<00:03:29.360> all<00:03:29.600> of

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
the way up like that do that on all of

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:38.710 
the way up like that do that on all of
them<00:03:31.959> over<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.110> top<00:03:36.220> merging<00:03:37.220> you<00:03:38.030> can't<00:03:38.390> do

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
them over the top merging you can't do

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.809 
them over the top merging you can't do
this<00:03:38.989> with<00:03:39.290> during<00:03:39.650> instance<00:03:40.010> actually<00:03:40.580> the

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
this with during instance actually the

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:48.370 
this with during instance actually the
Glee's<00:03:41.300> curves<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:43.250> too<00:03:43.720> complex<00:03:46.959> you<00:03:47.959> can<00:03:48.170> do

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
Glee's curves the too complex you can do

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.270 
Glee's curves the too complex you can do
the<00:03:48.560> ones<00:03:48.799> in<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:50.410> equilateral<00:03:51.410> triangle

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
the ones in the equilateral triangle

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.140 
the ones in the equilateral triangle
with<00:03:52.459> drawing<00:03:52.910> in<00:03:53.090> strength<00:03:53.570> as<00:03:54.519> you<00:03:55.519> will<00:03:55.760> see

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
with drawing in strength as you will see

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.699 
with drawing in strength as you will see
in<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:57.250> later<00:03:58.250> tutorial<00:04:00.400> but<00:04:02.049> these<00:04:03.049> you<00:04:03.470> are

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
in a later tutorial but these you are

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.819 
in a later tutorial but these you are
doing<00:04:03.920> freehand<00:04:04.489> there's<00:04:04.760> no<00:04:05.230> two<00:04:06.230> ways<00:04:06.560> about

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
doing freehand there's no two ways about

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:13.150 
doing freehand there's no two ways about
it<00:04:09.370> so<00:04:10.370> there's<00:04:10.910> those<00:04:11.150> four<00:04:11.989> curves<00:04:12.500> there

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
it so there's those four curves there

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.640 
it so there's those four curves there
now<00:04:13.970> we've<00:04:14.269> got<00:04:14.359> to<00:04:14.480> do<00:04:14.630> this<00:04:14.780> awkward<00:04:15.440> one

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
now we've got to do this awkward one

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.279 
now we've got to do this awkward one
which<00:04:15.890> is<00:04:16.039> going<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.220> come<00:04:16.489> from<00:04:16.669> here<00:04:17.289> like

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
which is going to come from here like

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:24.310 
which is going to come from here like
this<00:04:18.590> so<00:04:19.209> let's<00:04:20.209> start<00:04:20.539> there

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.190 

bring<00:04:25.040> it<00:04:25.160> round<00:04:25.600> merging<00:04:26.600> again<00:04:26.900> about

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
bring it round merging again about

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.550 
bring it round merging again about
two-thirds<00:04:27.980> of<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:29.660> way<00:04:29.960> like<00:04:30.500> that<00:04:32.440> now<00:04:33.440> I'm

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
two-thirds of the way like that now I'm

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.320 
two-thirds of the way like that now I'm
going<00:04:33.710> to<00:04:33.770> cut<00:04:34.010> while<00:04:34.250> I<00:04:34.280> do<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.730> rest<00:04:34.760> of<00:04:35.150> them

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
going to cut while I do the rest of them

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.400 
going to cut while I do the rest of them
just<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.410> save<00:04:36.680> time<00:04:37.130> and<00:04:37.160> boredom<00:04:37.940> for<00:04:38.120> you

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.860 

there<00:04:42.440> that's<00:04:42.980> those<00:04:43.340> four<00:04:44.090> put<00:04:44.450> in<00:04:46.870> roughly

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
there that's those four put in roughly

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.370 
there that's those four put in roughly
then<00:04:48.470> you<00:04:48.890> double<00:04:49.280> it<00:04:49.400> up<00:04:49.640> as<00:04:50.090> you<00:04:50.450> have<00:04:50.660> on<00:04:50.960> the

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
then you double it up as you have on the

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.040 
then you double it up as you have on the
other<00:04:51.410> one<00:04:51.890> so<00:04:51.920> trying<00:04:52.610> to<00:04:52.790> make<00:04:53.060> sure<00:04:53.090> that

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
other one so trying to make sure that

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:04.590 
other one so trying to make sure that
your<00:04:56.980> your<00:04:57.980> lines<00:04:58.250> are<00:04:58.900> parallel<00:05:02.200> for<00:05:03.200> the

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
your your lines are parallel for the

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.950 
your your lines are parallel for the
ribbon<00:05:06.370> oops<00:05:07.370> oh<00:05:07.700> that's<00:05:07.940> not<00:05:08.210> parallel<00:05:08.720> then

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
ribbon oops oh that's not parallel then

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.320 
ribbon oops oh that's not parallel then
it's<00:05:09.230> come<00:05:09.470> down<00:05:09.680> further<00:05:09.980> tis<00:05:10.340> man<00:05:10.550> but<00:05:11.000> there

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
it's come down further tis man but there

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:21.830 
it's come down further tis man but there
and<00:05:15.550> like<00:05:16.550> that

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.900 

so<00:05:22.500> I'm<00:05:22.560> just<00:05:22.710> cutting<00:05:22.980> down<00:05:23.430> on<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.790> other

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
so I'm just cutting down on the other

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:34.510 
so I'm just cutting down on the other
four<00:05:28.970> there<00:05:29.970> we<00:05:30.090> are<00:05:30.210> roughly<00:05:32.750> got<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:33.840> four

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
four there we are roughly got the four

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.810 
four there we are roughly got the four
basic<00:05:35.520> truffles<00:05:36.180> that<00:05:37.080> so<00:05:37.530> now<00:05:37.740> what<00:05:38.160> we<00:05:38.310> do<00:05:38.550> is

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
basic truffles that so now what we do is

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.900 
basic truffles that so now what we do is
to<00:05:39.480> join<00:05:39.810> the<00:05:41.060> tops<00:05:42.230> together<00:05:43.430> like<00:05:44.430> that<00:05:44.730> the

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
to join the tops together like that the

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.800 
to join the tops together like that the
apex<00:05:45.419> is<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:45.990> then<00:05:46.500> the<00:05:46.860> inner<00:05:47.190> apex<00:05:47.970> joins

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
apex is and then the inner apex joins

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:56.180 
apex is and then the inner apex joins
across<00:05:49.669> to<00:05:50.669> there<00:05:51.139> can<00:05:52.139> you<00:05:52.200> see<00:05:52.230> that<00:05:54.950> and<00:05:55.950> do

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
across to there can you see that and do

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:14.790 
across to there can you see that and do
that<00:05:56.400> on<00:05:56.580> all<00:05:56.850> four<00:05:57.000> of<00:05:57.389> them

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.820 

so<00:06:15.800> you<00:06:15.920> got<00:06:16.280> that<00:06:16.490> little<00:06:17.590> thing<00:06:18.590> in<00:06:18.710> the

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
so you got that little thing in the

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.160 
so you got that little thing in the
middle<00:06:18.860> there<00:06:19.310> then<00:06:20.000> it's<00:06:20.450> a<00:06:20.690> simple<00:06:20.930> matter

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
middle there then it's a simple matter

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:30.720 
middle there then it's a simple matter
of<00:06:23.320> taking<00:06:24.320> out<00:06:24.620> the<00:06:24.770> ones<00:06:24.980> you<00:06:25.070> don't<00:06:25.430> want<00:06:25.700> so

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.530 

for<00:06:31.730> instance<00:06:32.210> if<00:06:32.360> we<00:06:32.390> start<00:06:32.900> here<00:06:34.030> if<00:06:35.030> I<00:06:35.210> say

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540 
for instance if we start here if I say

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.270 
for instance if we start here if I say
that<00:06:35.780> this<00:06:36.290> strand

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
that this strand

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.770 
that this strand
I<00:06:37.430> mean<00:06:37.610> it's<00:06:37.730> arbitrary<00:06:37.910> isn't<00:06:38.510> it<00:06:38.630> could

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
I mean it's arbitrary isn't it could

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.480 
I mean it's arbitrary isn't it could
have<00:06:38.870> gone<00:06:39.020> under<00:06:39.350> but<00:06:39.530> I'm<00:06:39.650> having<00:06:39.890> it<00:06:40.130> over

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
have gone under but I'm having it over

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.610 
have gone under but I'm having it over
it<00:06:41.000> just<00:06:41.030> be<00:06:41.390> a<00:06:41.420> mirror<00:06:41.690> image<00:06:41.750> if<00:06:42.200> you<00:06:42.320> do<00:06:42.530> it

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
it just be a mirror image if you do it

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.500 
it just be a mirror image if you do it
the<00:06:42.740> other<00:06:42.890> way<00:06:43.010> around

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
the other way around

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.510 
the other way around
so<00:06:44.510> that's<00:06:45.020> going<00:06:45.230> over<00:06:45.440> there<00:06:45.860> so<00:06:46.040> therefore

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
so that's going over there so therefore

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.630 
so that's going over there so therefore
it's<00:06:46.640> going<00:06:46.790> under<00:06:47.510> here<00:06:50.290> okay<00:06:51.400> so<00:06:52.400> therefore

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:52.640 
it's going under here okay so therefore

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:58.720 
it's going under here okay so therefore
it's<00:06:53.210> going<00:06:53.480> over<00:06:54.040> here<00:06:56.980> okay<00:06:57.980> so<00:06:58.400> therefore

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:58.730 
it's going over here okay so therefore

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:06.490 
it's going over here okay so therefore
it's<00:06:59.330> going<00:06:59.770> over<00:07:00.770> here<00:07:01.370> and<00:07:03.760> over<00:07:04.760> here<00:07:05.500> so

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500 
it's going over here and over here so

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.610 
it's going over here and over here so
you've<00:07:06.680> got<00:07:06.890> that<00:07:07.160> interesting<00:07:08.000> little

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
you've got that interesting little

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.470 
you've got that interesting little
opener<00:07:09.620> and<00:07:09.890> then<00:07:10.160> basically<00:07:11.000> you<00:07:11.090> just<00:07:11.330> got

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:11.480 
opener and then basically you just got

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.870 
opener and then basically you just got
to<00:07:11.570> go<00:07:11.720> through<00:07:11.990> all<00:07:12.380> of<00:07:12.410> them<00:07:12.890> over<00:07:13.220> and<00:07:13.550> under

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:13.880 
to go through all of them over and under

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.400 
to go through all of them over and under
and<00:07:14.150> then<00:07:15.400> Bob's<00:07:16.400> your<00:07:16.670> uncle<00:07:16.930> so<00:07:17.930> I'll<00:07:18.200> just

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.410 
and then Bob's your uncle so I'll just

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:24.870 
and then Bob's your uncle so I'll just
cut<00:07:18.800> and<00:07:21.640> do<00:07:22.640> that

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 
cut and do that

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.900 
cut and do that
so<00:07:25.880> there<00:07:26.120> we<00:07:26.360> are<00:07:26.740> then<00:07:27.740> put<00:07:28.280> the<00:07:28.430> unders

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:28.910 
so there we are then put the unders

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.760 
so there we are then put the unders
Nova's<00:07:29.330> in<00:07:29.599> and<00:07:30.280> a<00:07:32.259> little<00:07:33.259> bit<00:07:33.380> of<00:07:33.470> shading

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:33.770 
Nova's in and a little bit of shading

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.540 
Nova's in and a little bit of shading
and<00:07:34.430> fairly<00:07:34.970> crude<00:07:35.240> but<00:07:35.569> you<00:07:35.780> get<00:07:35.990> the<00:07:36.139> idea<00:07:36.550> so

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:37.550 
and fairly crude but you get the idea so

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.820 
and fairly crude but you get the idea so
that's<00:07:38.000> some<00:07:38.419> for<00:07:39.430> shuffles

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:41.830 
that's some for shuffles

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:48.039 
that's some for shuffles
linked<00:07:42.830> in<00:07:43.130> a<00:07:45.039> square
