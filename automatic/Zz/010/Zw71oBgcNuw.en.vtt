00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
now and keep getting better from game to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.799 
now and keep getting better from game to
game<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.190> think<00:00:41.820> as<00:00:42.210> far<00:00:42.270> as<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> team

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
game and I think as far as the team

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.750 
game and I think as far as the team
performance<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:44.100> know<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.430> take<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> lot

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
performance you know we can take a lot

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.580 
performance you know we can take a lot
of<00:00:44.789> positives<00:00:45.270> from<00:00:45.329> tonight<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.110> really

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
of positives from tonight and and really

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.930 
of positives from tonight and and really
look<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.039> second<00:00:47.340> game<00:00:47.430> now<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.730> think<00:00:47.850> we

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
look to the second game now I think we

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.979 
look to the second game now I think we
have<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.120> continue<00:00:48.450> doing<00:00:48.629> little<00:00:48.930> things

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
have to continue doing little things

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.080 
have to continue doing little things
connect<00:00:49.710> our<00:00:49.800> passes<00:00:50.219> being<00:00:50.520> sharp<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
connect our passes being sharp and

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.510 
connect our passes being sharp and
continue<00:00:52.050> our<00:00:52.140> movement<00:00:52.530> when<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:53.190> move<00:00:53.370> off

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
continue our movement when we move off

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.040 
continue our movement when we move off
the<00:00:53.640> ball<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.820> think<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.120> really<00:00:54.270> makes<00:00:54.930> us

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
the ball I think that really makes us

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.200 
the ball I think that really makes us
dangerous<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.860> hard<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.399> mark<00:00:56.579> guys<00:00:57.000> are

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
dangerous and hard to mark guys are

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.090 
dangerous and hard to mark guys are
making<00:00:57.510> good<00:00:57.539> runs<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.230> taking<00:00:58.710> their<00:00:58.829> chance

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
making good runs and taking their chance

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.950 
making good runs and taking their chance
as<00:00:59.309> well<00:00:59.489> balls<00:01:00.180> are<00:01:00.359> being<00:01:00.539> put<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.840> good

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
as well balls are being put in good

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.709 
as well balls are being put in good
spots<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.789> you<00:01:02.789> know<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:03.300> that's<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
spots and you know I think that's a

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.990 
spots and you know I think that's a
testament<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.339> work<00:01:05.460> we've<00:01:05.700> been<00:01:05.729> doing

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
testament to the work we've been doing

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.850 
testament to the work we've been doing
and<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.600> type<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.810> types<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.409> players<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.680> we

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and the type of types of players that we

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.950 
and the type of types of players that we
have<00:01:08.010> really<00:01:08.820> creative<00:01:09.240> players<00:01:09.720> going

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
have really creative players going

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.899 
have really creative players going
forward<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.530> if<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.860> keep<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.369> we

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
forward so if we can keep that going we

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.010 
forward so if we can keep that going we
know<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.180> games<00:01:12.360> are<00:01:12.510> going<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.689> get<00:01:12.840> harder

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
know the games are going to get harder

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.870 
know the games are going to get harder
and<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:14.070> know<00:01:14.159> we're<00:01:14.460> not<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> score

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
and you know we're not going to score

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
six in every game we know that but if we

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.170 
six in every game we know that but if we
can<00:01:17.100> create<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.460> amount<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.759> chances<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
can create that amount of chances and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.510 
can create that amount of chances and
take<00:01:18.689> some<00:01:18.869> goals<00:01:19.080> it'll<00:01:19.680> help<00:01:19.830> us<00:01:19.979> as<00:01:20.220> we<00:01:20.250> go
