00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 I had great problems with this replay. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 I tried on several computers and every time the crosshair was traveling. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Therefore, this whole battle was played using a free camera. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Hence, there may (and will be) some inaccuracies ... 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 ... when playing replay I could not keep up with the shooting of the tower while playing. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 What about the battle. 33% chance of winning and 14 bots in the team. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 A city lost in advance, as well as the entire battle. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 The first thought was to go on the tracks. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 But I realized that it would not do anything because the city will fall ... 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 ... I will have to come back, then the tracks will fall ... 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 ... I will stay alone and I will die last. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 So I changed my mind and went to the middle. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 I have Binocular Telescope, Coated Optics and Improved Ventilation. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 In addition, each crew member has 5 per cent of 59%. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 I have 100 Recon, just like Situational Awareness. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 When you have 92 mm penetration on AP and 126 mm on APCR ... 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 ... hopeless depression works (a few patches ago) ... 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 ... and the missile spatter like a manure spreader ... 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 ... passive meeting is the only thing you can use this pile of scrap. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Oh, I'm sorry. This amazing gift from WG ... 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 ... which only the involved beta testers got. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Thanks to this, I can nail WN or effa against opponents. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 For example, the red KV, which only fuks I can break through. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 The problem is that the opponent has 3 KV, in addition far from red. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 The city fell a long time ago. Fortunately, I do not have to go back from a distance. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 And as long as I keep on the tracks, I have my back covered. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 I'll go to the bush, put out the tower and meet. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 APCR already prepared. If KV is perfectly aligned with the side or front ... 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 ... and if I hit it, I will beat it. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 It is enough, however, even a small angle and after ptokach. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Chi-Nu calls for defense. 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Go ahead, lay, your four and help in a good work. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Ha! 10-8! Our good! 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 There is no chance for the side of the KV tower. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 See how pathetic depression in the American medus. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 I will have to show if I want to shoot. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 In this isthmus between buildings ... 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Sure. 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Of course. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 Oho, the rascal is looking. Gait. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 I will change the bushes and try again. 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 I'm on the first line now. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 So I devote to Chi-Nu and arty. 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Because Hetzer is probably just taking a mud bath. 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 No, I did not delude myself. But it was worth a try. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 She's looking again. Gait. 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Something is still shooting at me. 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Oh, one KV went to beat the artists. 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 And the other one? 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 And the other is charging at me. 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Chi-Nu has already fallen, Hetzer is gone. 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 I can not beat the tacker. 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 If he was going straight to me, it was different. 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 I go back, I go back to get out of Stuart, and maybe Hetzer will help. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Just in case, I will sing the Song of Death. 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 And now quickly escape the second. 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Clean the city and hit the city if it entered the cap. 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 no risk, no fun I'm here, you're gone 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 I think I'll let you down 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 You should have me, I think I'll make you leave 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 'Cause you have lost control 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 You've pushed the line too far, Bye-bye 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Turn over, there's no need to try 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 You waste your time 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 You're absolutely useless, baby 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 1877 dmg, 1402 exp Mastery Badge "Ace Tanker", Top Gun, Defender, High Caliber, Steel Wall 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 41 shots, 21 entered. Dooobrze ...
