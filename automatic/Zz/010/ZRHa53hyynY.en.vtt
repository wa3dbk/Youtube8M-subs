 nelson brand senior make-up artist in 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.009
 Spain 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.589
 here I am with lorena winner of the 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.360

 she present to you what is going to be this 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.380
 season in relation to tans 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.930
 this spring / summer season the 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.240
 tans will justify the 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.720
 use of colors related to 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.370
 this tan or golden champagne 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.250
 bronzes or the whole decalogue of 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.410
 colorful near the metals 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.390
 precious and semi precious with which 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.550
 let's go over there let's see how these shades 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.559
 metallic embellish sublimates the 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.929
 tanned in a very practical way and 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.239
 especially very enriching with the skin 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:45.039
 we have been strategically soft we have 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.050
 applied makeup base there where 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.850
 the skin needs it without recharging 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.499
 corrector sculpting 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.560
 illuminating are interior of the eyes 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:56.280
 high part of the cheekbones and already 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.860
 let's start by applying all this 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.329
 golden appeal on the skin and we're going to 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.430
 start with a pigment 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.890
 this pigment is one of our great 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.790
 Famous colorful for summer is called and 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.659
 I'm going to apply the pigment for 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.659
 all the eyelid mobile 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.790
 and physical eyelid this pigment is a 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.680
 pigment chromatic tube this wants 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.130
 say that depending on where you give the 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.500
 light 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.430
 we are going to see golden reflections and reflections 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.430
 peach 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.990
 without leaving the pigment let's take a 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.729
 blusher brush and let's try 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.310
 distribute the pigment throughout the brush 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.180
 let's apply it from the eyes to 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.170
 the cheekbone this time from the cheekbone 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.170
 in the upper part as inferior 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.539
 I'm going to apply this shadow the shadows will 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:57.950
 they call under lights is an amber tone 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:59.840
 warm with which we're going to sculpt the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.950
 basin 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.950
 for him 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.770
 Y 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.200
 outline the lower part of the eye 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.660
 yes 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.780
 it's a very subtle, very subtle tone but 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.660
 returns to the look a reflection with a 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.480
 low honey tone 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.670
 what warmth of the structures 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.510
 and also goes with this satin effect 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.510
 which has the pigment 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.790
 then a black pencil this will be 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.530
 the key to transforming a look 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.130
 predominantly subtle in something else 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.400
 special 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.230
 a feline but delicate look based on 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.800
 the great focus of this look not only the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.050
 shines the eyes 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.820
 I'm going to start profiling with a little 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.810
 eyeliner very subject to the root of the 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.840
 tabs 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.270
 very thin on the inside and 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.280
 slightly thicker towards the part 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.650
 outside we will try that the 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.380
 eyeliner end where the eye ends and not 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.890
 finishing it before will allow the eye not to 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.890
 lose 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.100
 dimension 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.670
 and we can project the look more 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.670
 elongated 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.950
 now let's profile 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.360
 just also in the root 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.360
 and getting a little bit in 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.410
 we join in the outside 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.410
 yes 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.760
 with the intention of harmonizing these 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.830
 tones and especially of the students of the 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.860
 golden coherence and these warm tones 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.780
 with this low orange honey tone we have 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.640
 chosen the bichi looks is a gloss in a 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.750
 coral tone with golden reflections also 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.750
 for the lips 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.890
 Here is an example of how to delineate 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.690
 the eyes but especially what there is 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.200
 behind the eyeliner is a game 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.610
 harmonious that plays in favor of this one 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.950
 this chromatic journey through the 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.950
 gold bronzes melon shades
