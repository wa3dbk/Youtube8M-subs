00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
and and that's evidenced by the fact

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.950 
and and that's evidenced by the fact
that<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.439> hasn't<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:26.099> know<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.580> when<00:00:26.960> all

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
that it hasn't I know that when all

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.660 
that it hasn't I know that when all

tangling who came through he visited

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.490 
tangling who came through he visited
through<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> number<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.510> times<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:31.109> think

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
through a number of times I think

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.110

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
probably he would have said that his

probably he would have said that his

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
about this yeah but whether it's the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.270 
about this yeah but whether it's the
right<00:01:00.840> one<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.170> all<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.620> then<00:01:01.890> there<00:01:02.070> has<00:01:02.190> to

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
right one and all and then there has to

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.680 
right one and all and then there has to

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.539 
business in California so Chum anybody
that's<00:01:10.290> closely<00:01:10.500> will<00:01:10.799> say<00:01:10.920> well<00:01:11.189> yeah<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that's closely will say well yeah it's a

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.310 
that's closely will say well yeah it's a
great<00:01:11.640> idea<00:01:11.729> would<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.330> cool<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.900> obvious

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
great idea would be cool it's obvious

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.560 
great idea would be cool it's obvious
that<00:01:13.619> happened<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.100> does<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.030> have

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
that happened but does that have

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.789 
that happened but does that have
any<00:01:15.720> idea<00:01:16.020> how<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.200> ever<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> get<00:01:16.619> down

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
any idea how it's ever going to get down

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.289 
any idea how it's ever going to get down
so<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.340> where<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.330> think<00:01:19.259> even<00:01:19.380> talking<00:01:19.799> to

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
so it's where I think even talking to

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.230 
so it's where I think even talking to
him<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.420> if

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
him but if

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.510 
him but if
he's<00:01:22.930> always<00:01:23.290> been<00:01:23.439> interested<00:01:23.860> always<00:01:24.340> been

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
he's always been interested always been

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.490 
he's always been interested always been
a<00:01:24.549> tune<00:01:24.820> it's<00:01:25.390> just<00:01:25.570> such<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:25.750> logical<00:01:26.350> thing

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
a tune it's just such a logical thing

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.260 
a tune it's just such a logical thing
but<00:01:26.710> it's<00:01:26.829> just<00:01:27.070> so<00:01:27.310> challenging<00:01:27.880> because

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
but it's just so challenging because

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.789 
but it's just so challenging because
there<00:01:28.479> is<00:01:28.600> no<00:01:28.750> single<00:01:29.079> body<00:01:29.259> that<00:01:29.530> you<00:01:29.649> can

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
there is no single body that you can

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.590 
there is no single body that you can
feel<00:01:29.979> really<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:31.000> can<00:01:31.210> direct<00:01:31.450> you're

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
feel really you can direct you're

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.260 
feel really you can direct you're
focused<00:01:31.630> or<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.950> get<00:01:33.189> this<00:01:33.310> thing<00:01:33.369> well<00:01:33.790> you

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
focused or to get this thing well you

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.050 
focused or to get this thing well you
know<00:01:34.360> it's<00:01:34.509> a<00:01:34.630> it's<00:01:35.500> just<00:01:36.250> a<00:01:36.520> bunch<00:01:36.909> of<00:01:37.000> people

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
know it's a it's just a bunch of people

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.639 
know it's a it's just a bunch of people
out<00:01:37.420> there<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.750> are<00:01:37.810> that<00:01:38.020> are<00:01:38.079> involved<00:01:38.350> is

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
out there that are that are involved is

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.499 
out there that are that are involved is
it<00:01:38.770> getting<00:01:38.860> harder<00:01:39.189> not<00:01:39.580> easier<00:01:39.640> no<00:01:40.270> I<00:01:40.299> think

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
it getting harder not easier no I think

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.749 
it getting harder not easier no I think
it's<00:01:40.810> closer<00:01:41.080> because<00:01:41.409> it<00:01:41.679> has<00:01:41.890> come<00:01:42.490> together

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
it's closer because it has come together

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:43.859 
it's closer because it has come together
with<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:42.939> really<00:01:43.210> good<00:01:43.330> plan<00:01:43.509> i<00:01:43.539> think<00:01:43.780> it's

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
with a really good plan i think it's

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.919 
with a really good plan i think it's
reliable<00:01:44.560> there's<00:01:45.429> a<00:01:45.520> plan<00:01:45.850> in<00:01:45.880> mind<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.750> might

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
reliable there's a plan in mind it might

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.359 
reliable there's a plan in mind it might
not<00:01:46.960> be<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.350> one<00:01:47.470> that<00:01:47.619> going<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.950> choose<00:01:48.189> but

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
not be the one that going to choose but

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.820 
not be the one that going to choose but
there<00:01:48.549> is<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:49.000> stadium<00:01:49.270> plan<00:01:49.830> design

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
there is a stadium plan design

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.130 
there is a stadium plan design
structured<00:01:51.580> his<00:01:51.729> way<00:01:52.090> down<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.420> road<00:01:52.600> he's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
structured his way down the road he's

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.960 
structured his way down the road he's
ready<00:01:53.409> to<00:01:53.619> do<00:01:53.799> it<00:01:53.920> do<00:01:54.189> it<00:01:54.220> at<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:54.490> park<00:01:54.670> beat<00:01:54.850> he

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
ready to do it do it at the park beat he

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.580 
ready to do it do it at the park beat he
wants<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.330> bring<00:01:55.479> a<00:01:55.600> team<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.899> LA<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.200> all<00:01:56.350> that
