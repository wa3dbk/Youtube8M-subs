00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
for now and to me coz BJ Baldwin's car

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.809 
for now and to me coz BJ Baldwin's car
is<00:02:17.349> quite<00:02:17.500> clean<00:02:17.770> there's<00:02:17.980> no<00:02:18.099> sort<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.400> things

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
is quite clean there's no sort of things

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.940 
is quite clean there's no sort of things
on<00:02:18.970> top<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:19.390> or<00:02:19.480> anything<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.680> wheels

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
on top of it or anything and the wheels

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.589 
on top of it or anything and the wheels
we<00:02:21.190> are<00:02:21.280> actually<00:02:21.400> going<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.819> go<00:02:21.970> for<00:02:22.180> off-road

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
we are actually going to go for off-road

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.360 
we are actually going to go for off-road
wheels<00:02:22.840> now<00:02:23.380> this<00:02:23.560> does<00:02:23.739> actually<00:02:23.860> give<00:02:24.160> more

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
wheels now this does actually give more

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.190 
wheels now this does actually give more
grip<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:24.910> we're<00:02:25.000> going<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.209> get<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.720> nervous

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
grip and we're going to get the nervous

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.809 
grip and we're going to get the nervous
wheels<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.950> we're<00:02:27.099> going<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.280> make<00:02:27.370> them<00:02:27.550> lime

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
wheels and we're going to make them lime

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.970 
wheels and we're going to make them lime
green<00:02:28.090> as<00:02:28.300> well<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:29.200> now<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.470> know<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:29.739> guys<00:02:29.890> are

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
green as well so now I know you guys are

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.260 
green as well so now I know you guys are
probably<00:02:30.010> gonna<00:02:30.310> say<00:02:30.459> it's<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.580> bit<00:02:30.700> racy<00:02:30.940> for

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
probably gonna say it's a bit racy for

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.930 
probably gonna say it's a bit racy for
it<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:31.959> sort<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.290> livery<00:02:33.040> drifting<00:02:33.640> type

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
it is that sort of livery drifting type

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.820 
it is that sort of livery drifting type
that<00:02:34.180> we're<00:02:34.300> going<00:02:34.540> for<00:02:34.750> it'd<00:02:35.140> be<00:02:35.319> cool<00:02:35.650> if<00:02:35.680> we

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
that we're going for it'd be cool if we

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.140 
that we're going for it'd be cool if we
could<00:02:35.920> have<00:02:36.160> some<00:02:36.190> livery<00:02:36.670> on<00:02:36.700> top<00:02:36.940> of<00:02:37.060> this

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
could have some livery on top of this

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.030 
could have some livery on top of this
car<00:02:37.390> as<00:02:37.569> well<00:02:37.750> we'll<00:02:37.959> put<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.170> limo<00:02:38.440> tint<00:02:38.680> on<00:02:38.860> to

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
car as well we'll put a limo tint on to

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.400 
car as well we'll put a limo tint on to
finish<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.400> off<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:40.000> match<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.330> body<00:02:40.510> but<00:02:41.379> I

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
finish it off to match the body but I

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.110 
finish it off to match the body but I
have<00:02:41.620> put<00:02:41.800> opera<00:02:42.069> tires<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.550> this<00:02:42.700> because<00:02:42.879> we

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
have put opera tires on this because we

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.000 
have put opera tires on this because we
want<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.480> grip<00:02:43.750> when<00:02:43.959> we're<00:02:44.110> drifting<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.650> it

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
want the grip when we're drifting and it

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.339 
want the grip when we're drifting and it
helps<00:02:45.220> our<00:02:45.400> off-road<00:02:45.670> as<00:02:45.940> well<00:02:46.120> obviously<00:02:46.750> if

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
helps our off-road as well obviously if

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.750 
helps our off-road as well obviously if
we<00:02:47.560> lower<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:47.920> wheels<00:02:48.129> we<00:02:48.340> can<00:02:48.370> lower<00:02:48.670> it

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
we lower the wheels we can lower it

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.910 
we lower the wheels we can lower it
twice<00:02:49.060> on<00:02:49.330> either<00:02:49.450> side<00:02:49.810> if<00:02:50.080> we<00:02:50.230> lower<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.560> and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
twice on either side if we lower it and

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.069 
twice on either side if we lower it and
we<00:02:51.340> get<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.520> slide<00:02:51.910> on<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.209> wheels<00:02:52.420> but<00:02:52.989> we

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
we get the slide on the wheels but we

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.690 
we get the slide on the wheels but we
can<00:02:53.230> also<00:02:53.409> use<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.769> offer<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.159> ties<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.549> get

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
can also use the offer it ties to get

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.610 
can also use the offer it ties to get
grip<00:02:55.000> when<00:02:55.180> we<00:02:55.299> want<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.689> and<00:02:55.900> also<00:02:56.260> when<00:02:56.469> it's

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
grip when we want it and also when it's

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.720 
grip when we want it and also when it's
high<00:02:56.769> as<00:02:56.950> well<00:02:57.099> we're<00:02:57.219> not<00:02:57.280> going<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.459> put<00:02:57.579> the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
high as well we're not going to put the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.089 
high as well we're not going to put the
suspension<00:02:58.239> on<00:02:58.360> so<00:02:58.840> when<00:02:59.319> it's<00:02:59.470> high<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.709> body

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
suspension on so when it's high the body

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.160 
suspension on so when it's high the body
can<00:03:00.370> roll<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.640> lot<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.269> gives<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.810> chance

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
can roll a lot so it gives the chance

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.589 
can roll a lot so it gives the chance
for<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.709> car<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.159> sort<00:03:03.459> of<00:03:03.519> switch<00:03:04.030> direction

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
for the car to sort of switch direction

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.600 
for the car to sort of switch direction
a<00:03:04.810> lot<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.560> gives<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.830> car<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.069> lot<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.340> lean

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
a lot and it gives the car a lot of lean

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.399 
a lot and it gives the car a lot of lean
in<00:03:06.879> the<00:03:07.000> direction<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.599> the<00:03:07.720> drift<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.110> keep<00:03:08.290> it

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
in the direction of the drift to keep it

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.009 
in the direction of the drift to keep it
going<00:03:08.560> for<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:09.159> while<00:03:09.549> and<00:03:09.790> also<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.599> car<00:03:10.780> has<00:03:10.989> a

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
going for a while and also the car has a

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.440 
going for a while and also the car has a
great<00:03:11.470> mid<00:03:11.709> drive<00:03:11.920> speed<00:03:12.220> boost<00:03:12.519> so<00:03:13.299> this

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
great mid drive speed boost so this

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.420 
great mid drive speed boost so this
helps<00:03:13.720> out<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.870> lot<00:03:14.110> for<00:03:14.290> drifting<00:03:14.769> especially

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
helps out a lot for drifting especially

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.580 
helps out a lot for drifting especially
women<00:03:15.730> exiting<00:03:16.390> drifts<00:03:16.660> we<00:03:17.019> can<00:03:17.170> just<00:03:17.349> get<00:03:17.500> the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
women exiting drifts we can just get the

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.130 
women exiting drifts we can just get the
power<00:03:17.830> on<00:03:18.069> and<00:03:18.250> get<00:03:19.000> on<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.330> next<00:03:19.540> sort<00:03:20.080> of

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
power on and get on to the next sort of

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.559 
power on and get on to the next sort of
terrific<00:03:21.010> picks<00:03:21.400> up<00:03:21.580> speed<00:03:21.819> a<00:03:21.970> lot<00:03:22.150> coming<00:03:22.420> out

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
terrific picks up speed a lot coming out

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.030 
terrific picks up speed a lot coming out
with<00:03:22.690> drifts<00:03:22.989> it's<00:03:23.319> probably<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.620> fastest

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
with drifts it's probably the fastest

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.059 
with drifts it's probably the fastest
out<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.430> corners<00:03:24.879> and<00:03:25.750> also<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:26.739> actually

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
out of corners and also it is actually

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.530 
out of corners and also it is actually
great<00:03:27.250> for<00:03:27.430> drag<00:03:27.610> races<00:03:27.940> as<00:03:28.120> well<00:03:28.329> actually

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
great for drag races as well actually

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.420 
great for drag races as well actually
comes<00:03:28.840> quite<00:03:29.049> close<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.409> the<00:03:29.500> Osiris<00:03:30.099> the<00:03:30.129> old

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
comes quite close to the Osiris the old

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.860 
comes quite close to the Osiris the old
wheel<00:03:30.549> drive<00:03:30.760> supercar<00:03:31.269> which<00:03:31.450> is<00:03:31.569> super

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
wheel drive supercar which is super

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.839 
wheel drive supercar which is super
quick<00:03:32.079> but<00:03:32.769> it<00:03:33.040> does<00:03:33.220> actually<00:03:33.370> come<00:03:33.549> quite

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
quick but it does actually come quite

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.520 
quick but it does actually come quite
close<00:03:33.879> in<00:03:34.269> a<00:03:34.329> drag<00:03:34.540> race<00:03:34.569> it<00:03:34.870> catches<00:03:35.200> up<00:03:35.319> to<00:03:35.349> it

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
close in a drag race it catches up to it

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.229 
close in a drag race it catches up to it
once<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:35.769> engage<00:03:36.099> them<00:03:36.430> at<00:03:36.579> our<00:03:36.760> speed<00:03:36.970> boosts

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
once you engage them at our speed boosts

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.330 
once you engage them at our speed boosts
so<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:38.079> just<00:03:38.290> thought<00:03:38.410> you<00:03:38.500> guys<00:03:38.650> have<00:03:38.859> a<00:03:38.890> listen

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
so I just thought you guys have a listen

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.619 
so I just thought you guys have a listen
to<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.549> sound<00:03:39.849> track<00:03:40.090> that<00:03:40.239> comes<00:03:40.420> with<00:03:40.569> this

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
to the sound track that comes with this

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.750 
to the sound track that comes with this
car<00:03:40.870> now<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.680> suits<00:03:41.980> it<00:03:42.129> quite<00:03:42.340> well<00:03:42.370> there's

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
car now it suits it quite well there's

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.430 
car now it suits it quite well there's
nothing<00:03:43.030> too<00:03:43.120> special<00:03:43.420> but<00:03:44.049> it<00:03:44.140> does<00:03:44.260> sound

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
nothing too special but it does sound

00:03:44.440 --> 00:04:04.839 
nothing too special but it does sound
quite<00:03:44.739> brutal

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.459 

so<00:04:05.849> this<00:04:06.030> car<00:04:06.239> is<00:04:06.269> awesome<00:04:06.569> is<00:04:06.989> an<00:04:07.230> off-road

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:07.469 
so this car is awesome is an off-road

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:09.800 
so this car is awesome is an off-road
drifter<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.189> it<00:04:08.310> is<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.640> feast<00:04:09.030> off-road<00:04:09.569> as

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
drifter and it is a feast off-road as

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.720 
drifter and it is a feast off-road as
well<00:04:10.079> it<00:04:10.530> has<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:10.799> lot<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.040> grip<00:04:11.280> if<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:11.549> keep

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
well it has a lot of grip if you keep

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.550 
well it has a lot of grip if you keep
the<00:04:11.879> accelerator<00:04:12.390> down<00:04:13.019> a<00:04:13.049> little<00:04:13.379> bit<00:04:13.469> you

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
the accelerator down a little bit you

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.080 
the accelerator down a little bit you
don't<00:04:13.709> go<00:04:13.829> full<00:04:14.069> throttle<00:04:14.129> you<00:04:14.670> can<00:04:14.969> actually

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
don't go full throttle you can actually

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.879 
don't go full throttle you can actually
get<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.359> lot<00:04:15.569> of<00:04:15.689> torque<00:04:15.959> out<00:04:16.139> of<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.320> car<00:04:16.530> and

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
get a lot of torque out of the car and

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.379 
get a lot of torque out of the car and
you<00:04:16.949> can<00:04:17.130> make<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.519> stick<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.060> terrain

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
you can make it stick to the terrain

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.270 
you can make it stick to the terrain
really<00:04:18.989> nicely<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.709> obviously<00:04:19.919> if<00:04:20.039> we've<00:04:20.160> got

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
really nicely and obviously if we've got

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.279 
really nicely and obviously if we've got
the<00:04:20.370> body<00:04:20.519> quite<00:04:20.850> high<00:04:21.090> it<00:04:21.539> has<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.690> lot<00:04:21.900> of<00:04:21.930> room

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
the body quite high it has a lot of room

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.540 
the body quite high it has a lot of room
to<00:04:22.470> sort<00:04:22.680> of<00:04:22.740> roll<00:04:22.949> around<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:23.490> the

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
to sort of roll around and the

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.850 
to sort of roll around and the
suspension<00:04:24.060> it's<00:04:24.180> quite<00:04:24.419> soft<00:04:24.690> so<00:04:25.020> yeah<00:04:25.680> guys

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
suspension it's quite soft so yeah guys

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.050 
suspension it's quite soft so yeah guys
that<00:04:25.919> is<00:04:26.130> pretty<00:04:26.400> much<00:04:26.520> all<00:04:26.759> for<00:04:26.789> this

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
that is pretty much all for this

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.480 
that is pretty much all for this
showcase<00:04:27.509> of<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.020> coil<00:04:28.680> brawler<00:04:28.979> I<00:04:29.250> think

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
showcase of the coil brawler I think

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.189 
showcase of the coil brawler I think
it's<00:04:29.639> awesome<00:04:29.850> and<00:04:30.600> I'm<00:04:30.810> probably<00:04:30.930> going<00:04:31.139> to

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
it's awesome and I'm probably going to

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.719 
it's awesome and I'm probably going to
do<00:04:31.350> a<00:04:31.380> different<00:04:31.710> build<00:04:32.160> of<00:04:32.340> this<00:04:32.460> at<00:04:32.699> some

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
do a different build of this at some

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.999 
do a different build of this at some
point<00:04:33.210> because<00:04:33.389> obviously<00:04:34.169> it's<00:04:34.650> sort<00:04:34.860> of<00:04:34.889> a

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
point because obviously it's sort of a

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.310 
point because obviously it's sort of a
livery<00:04:35.370> build<00:04:35.699> and<00:04:36.060> of<00:04:36.449> course<00:04:36.900> we<00:04:37.050> don't<00:04:37.169> have

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
livery build and of course we don't have

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.110 
livery build and of course we don't have
the<00:04:37.410> livery<00:04:37.830> but<00:04:38.250> yeah<00:04:38.340> it's<00:04:38.520> reminiscent<00:04:38.849> of

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
the livery but yeah it's reminiscent of

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.060 
the livery but yeah it's reminiscent of
BJ<00:04:39.419> Baldwin's<00:04:39.840> car<00:04:40.080> we've<00:04:40.470> got<00:04:40.620> that<00:04:40.740> Monster

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
BJ Baldwin's car we've got that Monster

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.560 
BJ Baldwin's car we've got that Monster
