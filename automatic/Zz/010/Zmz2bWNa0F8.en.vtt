00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
bathtub aligned with the seat of the car

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.980 
bathtub aligned with the seat of the car
so<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.470> looks<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:04.680> you're<00:01:04.769> driving<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.549> um<00:01:05.990> so

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
so it looks like you're driving it um so

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.300 
so it looks like you're driving it um so
why<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.409> do<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.830> grab<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.220> from

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
why I like to do I like to grab it from

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.090 
why I like to do I like to grab it from
the<00:01:08.430> front<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.210> bathtub<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.799> drag<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.979> in

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100

the front the bathtub and drag it in
this<00:01:11.220> way<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.939> aligned<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.600> will<00:01:12.720> align

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
this way so it aligned it will align

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.010 
this way so it aligned it will align
easier

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.940 

and<00:01:22.190> then<00:01:23.190> freeze<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.540> by<00:01:24.540> right-clicking<00:01:24.950> now

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and then freeze it by right-clicking now

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.200 
and then freeze it by right-clicking now
that<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:27.420> want<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.930> get<00:01:28.140> weld<00:01:29.210> which

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
that it's in you want to get weld which

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.350 
that it's in you want to get weld which
is<00:01:30.800> in<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:31.920> constraints<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.640> by<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.060> tools

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
is in the constraints up by the tools

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.320 
is in the constraints up by the tools
you<00:01:34.290> want<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.560> make<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.800> weld<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.280> force<00:01:36.030> limit

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
you want to make the weld a force limit

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.900 
you want to make the weld a force limit
at<00:01:36.450> zero<00:01:36.890> make<00:01:37.890> sure<00:01:38.100> as<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:38.460> all<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:38.820> it

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
at zero make sure as you're all so it

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.940 
at zero make sure as you're all so it
won't<00:01:39.060> work<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.290> want<00:01:40.440> to<00:01:40.530> hit<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
won't work and you want to hit the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.620 
won't work and you want to hit the
bathroom<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.580> going<00:01:41.730> from<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:42.060> bottom<00:01:42.390> so

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
bathroom I like going from the bottom so

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.140 
bathroom I like going from the bottom so
it's<00:01:42.870> easier<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.710> find<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:45.000> which

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
it's easier to find in so you know which

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.740 
it's easier to find in so you know which
one<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.570> hit<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.710> hit<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.130> bathtub<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.790> then

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
one you hit so hit the bathtub and then

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.520 
one you hit so hit the bathtub and then
hit<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> car<00:01:49.350> also<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.330> then<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:52.020> test<00:01:52.260> if<00:01:52.410> it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
hit the car also and then the test if it

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.320 
hit the car also and then the test if it
works<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.100> grab<00:01:53.370> the<00:01:53.550> bathtub<00:01:53.910> and<00:01:54.090> if<00:01:54.210> you

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
works you grab the bathtub and if you

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.610 
works you grab the bathtub and if you
can<00:01:54.450> lift<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> car<00:01:54.930> up<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.200> means<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.470> works

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
can lift the car up that means it works

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.880 
can lift the car up that means it works
the<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.150> take<00:01:57.300> a<00:01:57.510> lot<00:01:57.690> of<00:01:57.750> times<00:01:58.050> it<00:01:58.380> will

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the this can take a lot of times it will

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.920 
the this can take a lot of times it will
be<00:01:59.730> a<00:01:59.760> little<00:01:59.880> difficult<00:02:00.150> at<00:02:00.360> first<00:02:00.450> but

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
be a little difficult at first but

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.500 
be a little difficult at first but

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
you'll get eventually on next we want to

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.380 
you'll get eventually on next we want to
do<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.870> add<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.620> rust<00:02:05.220> errs<00:02:05.400> if<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.910> want<00:02:06.150> to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.930 
do is add the rust errs if you want to
have<00:02:06.630> thrusters<00:02:07.229> I'll<00:02:07.890> put<00:02:08.220> one<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.550> for<00:02:08.820> now

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
have thrusters I'll put one on for now

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.640 
have thrusters I'll put one on for now
um<00:02:13.400> make<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:15.390> thruster<00:02:15.810> force<00:02:16.080> as<00:02:16.230> high<00:02:16.380> as<00:02:16.440> I

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
um make the thruster force as high as I

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.950 
um make the thruster force as high as I
want<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.180> put<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.300> on<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.420> car<00:02:20.480> all<00:02:21.480> right<00:02:21.630> now

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
want and put it on the car all right now

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.070 
want and put it on the car all right now
what<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.200> want<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.410> do<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.770> uh<00:02:23.160> go<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.240> tools

what you want to do is uh go to tools

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.190 
what you want to do is uh go to tools
and<00:02:25.440> color<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.540> where<00:02:27.720> how<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:27.900> make

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
and color and this is where how you make

and color and this is where how you make
the<00:02:28.590> car<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.340> thrusters<00:02:29.790> invisible<00:02:30.420> you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
the car and the thrusters invisible you

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.740 
the car and the thrusters invisible you
drag<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.080> opacity<00:02:31.350> bar<00:02:31.830> all<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.070> way<00:02:32.520> down<00:02:32.880> or

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
drag the opacity bar all the way down or

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.340 
drag the opacity bar all the way down or
you<00:02:34.620> can<00:02:34.739> just<00:02:34.800> make<00:02:35.100> this<00:02:35.310> number<00:02:35.730> zero<00:02:36.350> next

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
you can just make this number zero next

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.600 
you can just make this number zero next
we<00:02:37.470> want<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.770> do<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:38.180> hit<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:40.110> car<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.680> the

we want to do is hit the car and the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.900 
we want to do is hit the car and the
thruster<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:43.650> should<00:02:43.980> be<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.190> guys<00:02:44.580> uh

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
thruster and that should be it guys uh

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.870 
thruster and that should be it guys uh
