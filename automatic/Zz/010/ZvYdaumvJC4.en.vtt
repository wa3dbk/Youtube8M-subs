mattifies<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.880> refines<00:01:33.240> pores<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:34.650> don't<00:01:35.640> know

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
mattifies and refines pores I don't know

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.609 
mattifies and refines pores I don't know
really<00:01:36.060> about<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.509> we're<00:01:36.750> finding<00:01:37.079> pores<00:01:37.350> I

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
really about it we're finding pores I

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.100 
really about it we're finding pores I
don't<00:01:37.770> really<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.100> big<00:01:38.340> pores

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
don't really have big pores

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.230 
don't really have big pores
it<00:01:40.110> has<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> natural<00:01:40.619> seamless<00:01:41.369> finish<00:01:41.790> it

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.859 
it has a natural seamless finish it
matches<00:01:42.990> skin<00:01:43.290> tone<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.759> think<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.600> one<00:01:45.840> is

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
matches skin tone so I think this one is

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.690 
matches skin tone so I think this one is
a<00:01:46.130> pretty<00:01:47.130> good<00:01:47.430> shape<00:01:47.790> now<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.689> actual<00:01:49.700> line

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
a pretty good shape now this actual line

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.440 
a pretty good shape now this actual line
only<00:01:51.329> has<00:01:51.630> 12<00:01:52.590> shades<00:01:53.220> I've<00:01:53.700> been<00:01:53.909> told<00:01:54.149> and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
only has 12 shades I've been told and

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.100 
only has 12 shades I've been told and
the<00:01:54.509> original<00:01:54.960> has<00:01:55.079> 18<00:01:55.500> shades<00:01:55.939> and<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.390> you

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the original has 18 shades and so you

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.289

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
wore it for about since I only worked

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.330 
wore it for about since I only worked
half<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:20.040> day<00:02:20.220> today<00:02:20.870> I<00:02:21.870> wore<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.410> for<00:02:22.440> about

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.509 

four<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.760> half<00:02:26.819> five<00:02:27.209> hours<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.220> this<00:02:29.220> is

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
four and a half five hours and this is

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.360 
four and a half five hours and this is
what<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.300> looks<00:02:30.510> like<00:02:30.630> if<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.200> see<00:02:31.470> shine<00:02:31.860> here

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
what it looks like if you see shine here

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.150 
what it looks like if you see shine here
that's<00:02:32.940> just<00:02:33.060> due<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.630> my<00:02:33.780> lights<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.800> up<00:02:34.890> here

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
that's just due to my lights to up here

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.630 
that's just due to my lights to up here
but<00:02:35.510> trust<00:02:36.510> me<00:02:36.569> I'm<00:02:36.900> not<00:02:36.959> shining<00:02:37.620> at<00:02:37.830> all<00:02:38.010> and

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
but trust me I'm not shining at all and

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.350 
but trust me I'm not shining at all and
I<00:02:38.870> think<00:02:39.870> it's<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.349> I'm<00:02:41.340> gonna<00:02:41.550> insert<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:42.000> clip

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
I think it's a I'm gonna insert a clip

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.229 
I think it's a I'm gonna insert a clip
of<00:02:42.569> me<00:02:43.140> applying<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:44.040> foundation<00:02:44.760> first

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
of me applying this foundation first

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.300 
of me applying this foundation first
thing<00:02:45.569> in<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.019> morning<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.890> girl<00:02:47.160> was

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
thing in the morning so the girl was

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.789 
thing in the morning so the girl was
looking<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.670> little<00:02:47.819> rough<00:02:48.180> she<00:02:49.110> woke<00:02:49.319> up<00:02:49.560> like

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
looking a little rough she woke up like

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.759 
looking a little rough she woke up like
that<00:02:50.040> she<00:02:50.489> won't<00:02:50.700> look<00:02:51.150> like<00:02:51.209> that<00:02:51.540> flaws<00:02:52.319> and

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
that she won't look like that flaws and

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.449 
that she won't look like that flaws and
how<00:02:53.069> I'm<00:02:53.549> just<00:02:53.850> saying<00:02:54.120> but<00:02:55.019> yeah<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:56.069> I<00:02:56.430> just

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
how I'm just saying but yeah so I just

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.160 
how I'm just saying but yeah so I just
showed<00:02:57.090> how<00:02:57.330> I<00:02:57.360> applied<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:59.390> did<00:03:00.390> set<00:03:01.019> it

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
showed how I applied it I did set it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.009 
showed how I applied it I did set it
with<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.650> powder<00:03:01.709> just<00:03:02.549> to<00:03:02.849> be<00:03:03.209> on<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:03.630> safe

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
with a powder just to be on the safe

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.350 
with a powder just to be on the safe
side<00:03:04.049> but<00:03:04.709> I<00:03:04.980> really<00:03:05.430> think<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.760> can<00:03:05.970> use<00:03:06.180> this

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
side but I really think you can use this

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.140 
side but I really think you can use this
without<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.780> powder<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:08.040> actually<00:03:08.489> didn't<00:03:09.060> get

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
without a powder I actually didn't get

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.789 
without a powder I actually didn't get
the<00:03:09.330> powder<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:10.019> goes<00:03:10.200> with<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:10.590> because

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
the powder that goes with this because

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.190 
the powder that goes with this because
unfortunately<00:03:11.160> they<00:03:11.910> did<00:03:12.120> not<00:03:12.299> have<00:03:12.540> the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
unfortunately they did not have the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.860 
unfortunately they did not have the
exact<00:03:13.799> shade<00:03:14.190> powder<00:03:14.579> for<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.299> one<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.540> have

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
exact shade powder for this one I have

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:47.440 
exact shade powder for this one I have
which<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.820> 322<00:03:17.820> warm<00:03:18.510> honey

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.589 

yeah

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
yeah

00:03:49.599 --> 00:04:30.300 
yeah
yeah

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.439 

and<00:04:30.729> I<00:04:30.910> thought<00:04:31.120> notice<00:04:31.419> it<00:04:31.509> was<00:04:31.630> a<00:04:31.660> medium<00:04:33.449> to

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
and I thought notice it was a medium to

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.379 
and I thought notice it was a medium to
buildable<00:04:34.810> coverage<00:04:35.410> foundation<00:04:36.360> because<00:04:37.360> I

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
buildable coverage foundation because I

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.540 
buildable coverage foundation because I
