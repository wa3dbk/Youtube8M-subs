00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
Emoto for those of you who don't know he

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.560 
Emoto for those of you who don't know he
did<00:00:16.770> an<00:00:16.890> interesting<00:00:17.430> experiment<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.359> he

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
did an interesting experiment and he

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.040 
did an interesting experiment and he
took<00:00:18.779> plain<00:00:19.619> old<00:00:19.830> tap<00:00:20.100> water<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:21.150> what<00:00:21.779> he<00:00:21.869> did

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
took plain old tap water and what he did

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.640 
took plain old tap water and what he did
was<00:00:22.109> he<00:00:22.939> froze<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:23.990> then<00:00:24.990> he<00:00:25.109> took<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.560> he

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
was he froze it then he took it and he

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.160 
was he froze it then he took it and he
put<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.949> under<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> microscope<00:00:26.750> and<00:00:27.750> he<00:00:27.869> took<00:00:28.109> a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
put it under a microscope and he took a

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.190 
put it under a microscope and he took a
picture<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:29.330> the<00:00:30.330> molecules<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:31.050> water<00:00:31.080> and

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
picture of the molecules of water and

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.020 
picture of the molecules of water and
when<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.320> was<00:00:34.469> frozen<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:35.550> plain<00:00:35.760> tap<00:00:36.000> water

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
when it was frozen just plain tap water

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.090 
when it was frozen just plain tap water
the<00:00:36.660> molecules<00:00:37.140> like<00:00:37.320> something<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:37.860> this

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the molecules like something like this

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.979 
the molecules like something like this
so<00:00:38.879> there<00:00:39.000> was<00:00:39.090> really<00:00:39.120> no<00:00:39.420> shape<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.719> it

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
so there was really no shape to it

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.170 
so there was really no shape to it
there's<00:00:40.379> no<00:00:41.450> you<00:00:42.450> no<00:00:42.590> you<00:00:43.590> no<00:00:44.309> no<00:00:44.579> crystalline

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
there's no you no you no no crystalline

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.760 
there's no you no you no no crystalline
structure<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.110> or<00:00:46.260> anything<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.620> that

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
structure to it or anything like that

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.340 
structure to it or anything like that
then<00:00:47.700> he<00:00:47.820> took<00:00:47.969> other<00:00:48.149> bottles<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.809> water<00:00:48.989> and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
then he took other bottles of water and

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.430 
then he took other bottles of water and
what<00:00:49.710> he<00:00:49.800> did<00:00:49.950> was<00:00:50.010> he<00:00:50.870> put<00:00:51.870> different<00:00:52.199> words

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
what he did was he put different words

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.560 
what he did was he put different words
on<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.550> instance<00:00:53.640> he<00:00:54.149> did<00:00:54.329> one

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
on it like so for instance he did one

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.260 
on it like so for instance he did one
that<00:00:54.899> was<00:00:55.050> lovin<00:00:55.440> thanks<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.850> bottle

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
that was lovin thanks and on this bottle

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.049 
that was lovin thanks and on this bottle
of<00:00:57.360> water<00:00:57.510> with<00:00:57.719> lemon<00:00:58.079> thanks<00:00:58.850> he<00:00:59.850> took<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
of water with lemon thanks he took a

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.689 
of water with lemon thanks he took a
photo<00:01:00.390> again<00:01:00.750> after<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.230> was<00:01:01.320> frozen<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
photo again after it was frozen and the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.429 
photo again after it was frozen and the
crystalline<00:01:03.180> structure<00:01:03.600> showed<00:01:03.960> up<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.290> there

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
crystalline structure showed up so there

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.310 
crystalline structure showed up so there
was<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> form<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:06.030> he<00:01:06.180> saw<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.840> with

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
was a form to it so he saw that with

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.890 
was a form to it so he saw that with
intention<00:01:07.979> he<00:01:08.220> also<00:01:08.369> prayed<00:01:08.760> over<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.180> the

intention he also prayed over the the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.530 
intention he also prayed over the the

seventy<00:01:32.310> percent<00:01:32.460> water<00:01:32.790> right<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.900> she's

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
seventy percent water right so she's

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.640 
seventy percent water right so she's
going<00:01:34.259> oh<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.650> made<00:01:34.799> me<00:01:34.920> suck<00:01:35.159> I'm<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.549> okay

interesting<00:01:37.650> projection<00:01:38.840> then<00:01:39.840> he<00:01:39.930> did<00:01:40.110> an

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
interesting projection then he did an

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.460 
interesting projection then he did an
energy<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.680> joy<00:01:40.860> that's<00:01:41.430> joy<00:01:42.079> joy<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.229> one<00:01:43.380> of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
energy of joy that's joy joy is one of

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.030 
energy of joy that's joy joy is one of
the<00:01:43.560> higher<00:01:43.740> frequencies<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.460> we<00:01:44.790> can<00:01:44.939> go

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
the higher frequencies that we can go

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.399 
the higher frequencies that we can go
you<00:01:47.040> fool<00:01:47.659> so<00:01:48.659> how<00:01:48.840> many<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.140> how<00:01:49.350> many

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
you fool so how many of how many

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.770 
you fool so how many of how many
