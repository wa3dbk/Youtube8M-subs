00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hi to all those damn I hope that 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.910
 you're fine then we end up on 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:14.670
 the youtube channel to make a small 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:16.230
 top readings indeed as I you 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.420
 warned in my last video 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.640
 Since I'm on vacation I have 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.100
 still could read a lot on his 15 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.480
 first days of July and the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.550
 I decided to present you my 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.320
 first five readings as you have 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.519
 most certainly could see him on the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.410
 video size 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.270
 the first three readings I'm going 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.770
 wanted to introduce to a package being 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.120
 given that it's the same collection and 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.550
 that it's pretty much the same thing 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.980
 so this is the house editions the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.379
 musardine so we dared the first time 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.090
 marie minnelli then is dared 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.680
 to make love everywhere except in a nest 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.989
 marc dannam and he dared a lesson 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.780
 Horny trinh thi blowjob 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.190
 I hope to say all that then 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.590
 why am I introducing you to these 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.910
 three books at the same time although 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.100
 I read the separate course 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.439
 it's just because for me 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.049
 they are in the same vein ie 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.330
 that I had the same feeling about 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.580
 three the three years u13 out of 5 because 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.430
 I found the educational side anyway 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.979
 nice enough it's pretty good to take the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.659
 authors aboard her in a way so 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.820
 natural fact there is no taboo and 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.229
 so that's why I found that very 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.170
 very well after it's true that by 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.570
 example on that of dare the fellatio 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.170
 it is still really detailed etc 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.400
 etc. 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.320
 so this is not to be put between all 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.970
 hands I think but if I take by 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.470
 example the first who dared the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.509
 first time I really found it 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.560
 great if it must be placed in the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.600
 teen hands simply because we 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.970
 the author is really trying to say if you 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.619
 not want you do not accept you 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.340
 first and it's really very good 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.470
 advice 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.240
 so nothing for her am here I think 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.030
 it's my favorite of the three given 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.860
 that it is not you take the head te 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.560
 force to nothing and suddenly I think that if 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.909
 this audience is really for the neck 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.100
 to people who are virgins I 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.259
 think it's still a very, very 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.960
 good start with regard to pink and 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.250
 make love everywhere are in 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.709
 I know the one I found the most 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.600
 funny because it's a small 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.240
 little to spice up the couple's life it's 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.250
 to know so no longer make love in 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.860
 his bed but in a small place 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.270
 little unusual hence the cover that 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.970
 did it anyway I hope you 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.709
 see that reflection a lot laughed here 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.330
 so this one is the one who made me 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.500
 most laugh and why not that's true 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.970
 that when we fall into a certain 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.620
 routine it can be nice to have a 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.810
 book like this on hand for 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.850
 from time to time innovate and then there is 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.530
 had to cause a blowjob lesson 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.989
 so this one as I said it is 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.380
 the one that already is the thickest and 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.660
 which is the most complete complex where I have 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.890
 took the least pleasure actually to the 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.950
 read because as much these two there 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.160
 were a little more lightness was 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.080
 nice this one for once it seemed to me 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.700
 more condensed etc etc 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.950
 plus it's really when alone and 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.150
 same subject to know the blowjob then 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.220
 that for sure these two there 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.420
 it was the first time and there 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.100
 it was really different places 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.300
 so here I am here it is the one that 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.670
 I liked it the least but for the moment 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.800
 can still be used to 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.880
 people so as I said everyone 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.430
 had three out of five 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.930
 in a totally different kind of 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.120
 am immersed in the help of 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.400
 skyfall of shannon messenger to 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.680
 lumens editions so this book 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.590
 I sincerely passed in very very very 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.180
 very good time the author really knew 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.560
 capture me in his universe since 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.810
 for me it was the first time I 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.750
 put in the universe of cif and there in 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.160
 the occurrence the site fire master wind 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.470
 master of the air no matter 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.780
 and suddenly all the mythology around 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.190
 that but completely delighted me he 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.530
 must be said that in addition to the sheets that is 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.560
 the main female character is a 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.480
 hyper strong character she is she did not 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.459
 not afraid she's fighting etc she's fighting at 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.230
 way to sell so I found that but 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.000
 simply huge 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.459
 and opposite there was the that there is a 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.930
 teenager who has about a normal life 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.700
 off well past more or less tragic 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.940
 and it turns out that bell and 2 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.230
 have to join forces to try to 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.750
 defeat in quotation marks the big 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.250
 naughty and I admit that here is the author 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.680
 made me take a loan finally it's a 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.000
 beautiful bricks and yet we devour it 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.310
 we do not see past pages ago 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.870
 a lot of action we realize a 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.609
 little bit of anything that can hide 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.790
 between place behind the unspoken of this 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.979
 book and it bodes very very good 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.560
 suites the end of the novel left me a 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.360
 bittersweet bit as ben for 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.139
 I would have really liked 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.520
 to have the following 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.220
 Ben here already in my library 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.840
 given that for once the author does 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.190
 weary a little bit like this 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.260
 while there is a lot of 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.580
 twists and my little heart 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.600
 here I do not know if he will survive 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.370
 until I have volume 2 that 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.960
 do you want for a very good time of 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.360
 reading I put him in four on five 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.100
 and finally the last reading I'm going 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.520
 introduce yourself it is a 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.470
 visibility in dh kremer and david levitte 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.910
 n editions michel lafon 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.470
 so this first volume is true 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.460
 had heard a lot about 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.800
 further Atlantic 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.120
 and he had intrigued me a lot 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.340
 know this boy totally down 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.470
 invisible since always who is under 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.479
 the stroke of a curse and this 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.979
 young girl who arrives from day to day 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.720
 next day in his life and who can the 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.940
 see it's the only one ever to have seen 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.500
 so in fact it's true that the trick me 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.360
 enormously pleased I was like wow 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.330
 expect from them has only one vizille and 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.610
 serves to it can even be great and at 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.330
 final even though the story is still 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.880
 well I admit that I come out of there a little 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.460
 a little mixed given that already this is 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.960
 a one shot for me the end brings when 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.250
 even a lot of questions and I know that 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.900
 for once I would not have them 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.880
 already it's a big negative end 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.490
 open I can not stand that and then 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.840
 I really found that the side 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.990
 invisibility really was not 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.820
 exploit the magical side either so 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.620
 in fact it was a little I did 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.210
 I'm tired a little too little I do not know 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.710
 how better to explain it than that 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.229
 say that authors with m 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.030
 a good thing a good sitting a good 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.349
 theme and in the end they failed to 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.090
 carry me as I could have 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.440
 imagine that he would have done so in 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.590
 more of that as I say there are two 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.330
 authors to frame 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.370
 will write the point of view of Elizabeth 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.590
 who is our main daughter and david 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.070
 will write the point of view of steven who 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.420
 so is our boy and suddenly it's 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.350
 feels a lot in fact in the 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.930
 given time chapters which is a 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.000
 alternating points of view because 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.350
 so I liked the style 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.180
 David's writing that is a lot 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.370
 more incisive which goes a lot more in 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.860
 action and squeeze whileandrea is 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.660
 a lot more thoughtful we really feel 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.430
 that it's a girl who writes for a 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.740
 girl in fact that's mostly what got me 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.120
 we are more in the length in the 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.320
 descriptions and so on says that 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.030
 it's almost a chapter in two 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.530
 it is true that it brakes is also a 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.410
 little reading and I was looking forward to 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.660
 come back to the chapter that david so from 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.910
 steven because I knew it was going 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.710
 bring back a little bit of rhythm so 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.390
 here I am the first to be a 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.030
 little bit disgusted at not having been 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.460
 packed by this book but it's like that 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.470
 so I put a 3 out of 5 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.240
 well here's my marauder you know 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.950
 everything for the first five readings of the 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.080
 July I hope that some 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.150
 will have given you desire do not hesitate to 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.890
 leave me in comment if you have 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.100
 want to read them or rather what you 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:08.200
 have read I'm sorry to advance if you 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.790
 hear some background noise on the 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.170
 video I hope to edit that I do not 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.020
 will not walk the ears to see that 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.920
 it was absolutely she woman all 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.050
 simply because it actually makes 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.550
 so hot today that I have the 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.890
 fan that's right there I hope 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.240
 however not too much I'm not either 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.860
 makeup what with the heat that makes 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.020
 it's just not possible not dripping 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.630
 literally so excused 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.640
 the presentation but I'll try to 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.410
 do better next time on this 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.850

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.530

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.700

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.030
