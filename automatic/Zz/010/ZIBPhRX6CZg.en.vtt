out<00:01:16.490> of<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.640> box<00:01:16.880> that<00:01:17.630> will<00:01:17.780> work<00:01:18.020> in<00:01:18.229> true

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
out of the box that will work in true

out of the box that will work in true
trackball<00:01:19.370> mode<00:01:19.840> with<00:01:20.840> this<00:01:20.960> trackball<00:01:21.440> and

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
trackball mode with this trackball and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.260 
trackball mode with this trackball and
that's<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.280> missile<00:01:22.580> command<00:01:22.760> that<00:01:22.970> came<00:01:23.120> out

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
that's the missile command that came out

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.170 
that's the missile command that came out
with<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.420> Atari<00:01:23.750> 8-bit<00:01:23.840> machine<00:01:25.180> doesn't

with the Atari 8-bit machine doesn't
work<00:01:26.420> with<00:01:26.570> centipede<00:01:26.960> doesn't<00:01:27.290> work<00:01:27.409> with

work with centipede doesn't work with

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.179 
work with centipede doesn't work with
millipede<00:01:28.100> unless<00:01:29.000> it's<00:01:29.180> in<00:01:29.299> joystick<00:01:29.840> mode

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.760 
millipede unless it's in joystick mode
and<00:01:31.360> in<00:01:32.360> fact<00:01:32.540> joystick<00:01:33.110> mode<00:01:33.290> will<00:01:33.469> work<00:01:33.619> with

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
and in fact joystick mode will work with

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.380 
and in fact joystick mode will work with
any<00:01:33.950> game<00:01:34.159> technically<00:01:34.610> that<00:01:35.000> uses<00:01:35.360> a

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
any game technically that uses a

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.840 
any game technically that uses a
joystick<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.409> difference<00:01:36.799> is<00:01:37.130> with<00:01:37.820> a

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
joystick the difference is with a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.899 
joystick the difference is with a
joystick<00:01:38.149> in<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:38.810> joystick<00:01:39.229> mode<00:01:39.789> when<00:01:40.789> you

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
joystick in the joystick mode when you

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.340 
joystick in the joystick mode when you
move<00:01:41.090> this<00:01:41.439> it<00:01:42.439> moves<00:01:42.649> at<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:42.860> same<00:01:43.130> speed<00:01:44.350> no

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
move this it moves at the same speed no

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.350 
move this it moves at the same speed no
matter<00:01:45.560> how<00:01:45.710> fast<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.219> spin<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.640> ball<00:01:46.789> if<00:01:47.000> you

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
matter how fast you spin the ball if you

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.420 
matter how fast you spin the ball if you
have<00:01:47.689> it<00:01:47.840> in<00:01:47.930> true<00:01:48.110> trackball<00:01:48.649> mode<00:01:48.890> the

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
have it in true trackball mode the

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.940 
have it in true trackball mode the
faster<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:50.000> spin<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.960> faster<00:01:51.409> your<00:01:51.560> cursor

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
faster you spin the faster your cursor

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.410 
faster you spin the faster your cursor
will<00:01:52.130> move<00:01:52.280> on<00:01:52.460> screen<00:01:52.789> so<00:01:53.000> it's<00:01:53.149> a<00:01:53.240> big

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
will move on screen so it's a big

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.730 
will move on screen so it's a big
advantage<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:53.899> have<00:01:54.140> games<00:01:54.439> that<00:01:54.530> use

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
advantage to have games that use

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.429 
advantage to have games that use
trackball<00:01:55.280> mode<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.420> I'm<00:01:56.539> gonna<00:01:56.659> hook<00:01:56.869> up<00:01:57.109> the

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
trackball mode so I'm gonna hook up the

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.980 
trackball mode so I'm gonna hook up the
atari<00:01:57.770> 8-bit<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.520> 800<00:01:58.939> XL<00:01:59.270> i'm<00:01:59.659> going<00:01:59.840> to<00:01:59.899> hook

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
atari 8-bit the 800 XL i'm going to hook

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.389 
atari 8-bit the 800 XL i'm going to hook
this<00:02:00.170> up<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.619> we're<00:02:00.950> going<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.130> look<00:02:01.250> at

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
this up and we're going to look at

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:02.980 
this up and we're going to look at
Missile<00:02:01.729> Command<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.270> I'll<00:02:02.479> try<00:02:02.630> to<00:02:02.689> show<00:02:02.930> you

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
Missile Command and I'll try to show you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.899 
Missile Command and I'll try to show you
the<00:02:03.049> differences<00:02:03.649> between<00:02:03.859> joystick<00:02:04.700> mode

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
the differences between joystick mode

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.480 
the differences between joystick mode
and<00:02:05.119> trackball<00:02:05.659> mode<00:02:06.039> okay<00:02:07.039> here<00:02:07.340> we<00:02:07.460> have

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
and trackball mode okay here we have

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.130 
and trackball mode okay here we have
Missile<00:02:08.000> Command<00:02:08.090> up<00:02:08.390> on<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.630> screen<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:08.899> hope

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
Missile Command up on the screen I hope

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.630 
Missile Command up on the screen I hope
you<00:02:09.259> can<00:02:09.380> see<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.710> ok<00:02:09.950> maybe<00:02:10.130> I'll<00:02:10.310> turn<00:02:10.490> the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
you can see that ok maybe I'll turn the

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.540 
you can see that ok maybe I'll turn the
light<00:02:10.759> off<00:02:11.830> make<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:12.980> little<00:02:13.100> easier<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.520> see

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
light off make it a little easier to see

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.870 
light off make it a little easier to see
the<00:02:13.790> screen<00:02:14.740> right<00:02:15.740> now<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:15.950> have<00:02:16.490> it<00:02:16.640> in

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
the screen right now I have it in

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.930 
the screen right now I have it in
joystick<00:02:17.540> mode<00:02:17.800> now<00:02:18.800> joystick<00:02:19.280> mode<00:02:19.490> will<00:02:19.730> act

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
joystick mode now joystick mode will act

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.310 
joystick mode now joystick mode will act
like<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.180> regular<00:02:20.390> joystick<00:02:21.020> if<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.230> were

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
like a regular joystick if you were

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
like a regular joystick if you were
playing<00:02:21.470> Missile<00:02:21.860> Command

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
playing Missile Command

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.480 
playing Missile Command
so<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.150> means<00:02:23.360> when<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:23.540> move<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:25.250> ball<00:02:25.460> on

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
so that means when I move the ball on

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.970 
so that means when I move the ball on
the<00:02:25.790> controller<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:27.110> cursor<00:02:27.470> will<00:02:27.620> move<00:02:27.650> at

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
the controller the cursor will move at

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.789 
the controller the cursor will move at
the<00:02:28.070> same<00:02:28.220> speed<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:28.760> let's<00:02:28.940> demonstrate<00:02:29.180> that

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.110 

there's<00:02:33.799> your<00:02:34.010> cursor<00:02:34.280> see<00:02:34.459> as<00:02:34.549> I'm<00:02:34.700> moving<00:02:35.000> it

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
there's your cursor see as I'm moving it

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.110 
there's your cursor see as I'm moving it
it<00:02:35.510> moves<00:02:35.750> an<00:02:36.280> ascetic<00:02:37.280> steady<00:02:37.579> pace<00:02:37.819> across

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
it moves an ascetic steady pace across

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.170 
it moves an ascetic steady pace across
the<00:02:38.390> screen<00:02:38.599> and<00:02:39.489> this<00:02:40.489> is<00:02:40.549> not<00:02:40.819> to<00:02:41.000> say<00:02:41.150> that

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
the screen and this is not to say that

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.030 
the screen and this is not to say that
this<00:02:41.480> doesn't<00:02:41.840> work<00:02:42.019> well<00:02:42.230> in<00:02:42.260> joystick<00:02:42.859> mode

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
this doesn't work well in joystick mode

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.319 
this doesn't work well in joystick mode
it<00:02:43.189> works<00:02:43.310> just<00:02:43.579> fine<00:02:43.700> but<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.659> have<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:45.140> move

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
it works just fine but you have to move

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.399 
it works just fine but you have to move
you<00:02:47.329> have<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.510> be<00:02:47.599> a<00:02:47.629> lot<00:02:47.810> quicker<00:02:47.989> with<00:02:48.260> your

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
you have to be a lot quicker with your

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.349 
you have to be a lot quicker with your
hands<00:02:48.650> because<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:49.609> cursor<00:02:49.939> is<00:02:50.000> not<00:02:50.150> going<00:02:50.299> to

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
hands because the cursor is not going to

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:59.530 
hands because the cursor is not going to
move<00:02:50.450> as<00:02:50.659> fast<00:02:50.689> as<00:02:51.049> you<00:02:51.139> want<00:02:51.170> it<00:02:51.469> to<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:59.510> you

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
move as fast as you want it to so you

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.920 
move as fast as you want it to so you
can<00:02:59.750> see<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.049> plays<00:03:00.260> well<00:03:00.790> but<00:03:01.790> not<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.510> way<00:03:02.689> it

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
can see it plays well but not the way it

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.429 
can see it plays well but not the way it
was<00:03:03.049> originally<00:03:03.139> meant<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.709> be<00:03:08.290> okay

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
was originally meant to be okay

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.970 
was originally meant to be okay
now<00:03:09.620> let's<00:03:09.919> flip<00:03:10.159> the<00:03:10.340> switch<00:03:10.579> on<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.790> back

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
now let's flip the switch on the back

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.860 
now let's flip the switch on the back
put<00:03:12.980> it<00:03:13.069> into<00:03:13.280> trackball<00:03:13.730> mode<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.629> put<00:03:14.780> it

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
put it into trackball mode and to put it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.300 
put it into trackball mode and to put it
into<00:03:15.019> trackball<00:03:15.470> for<00:03:15.650> missile<00:03:15.889> commands<00:03:16.159> you

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
into trackball for missile commands you

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.289 
into trackball for missile commands you
have<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.609> hit<00:03:16.730> ctrl<00:03:17.120> T<00:03:17.419> on<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.980> keyboard<00:03:19.299> on

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
have to hit ctrl T on the keyboard on

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.080 
have to hit ctrl T on the keyboard on
the<00:03:20.419> Atari<00:03:20.689> 800<00:03:20.870> XL<00:03:21.469> or<00:03:21.680> whichever<00:03:22.609> computer

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
the Atari 800 XL or whichever computer

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.330 
the Atari 800 XL or whichever computer
you're<00:03:23.299> using<00:03:23.329> now<00:03:24.319> it's<00:03:24.560> in<00:03:24.709> true<00:03:24.859> trackball

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
you're using now it's in true trackball

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.890 
you're using now it's in true trackball
mode<00:03:25.579> now<00:03:26.030> you'll<00:03:26.239> be<00:03:26.359> able<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:26.659> see<00:03:26.780> the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
mode now you'll be able to see the

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.629 
mode now you'll be able to see the
difference<00:03:28.120> now<00:03:29.120> watch<00:03:29.329> the<00:03:29.510> cursor<00:03:30.549> see<00:03:31.549> how

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
difference now watch the cursor see how

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.449 
difference now watch the cursor see how
the<00:03:31.700> cursor<00:03:31.969> really<00:03:32.359> zips<00:03:32.629> across<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:33.169> screen

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
the cursor really zips across the screen

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.979 
the cursor really zips across the screen
this<00:03:34.459> is<00:03:34.519> true<00:03:34.909> trackball<00:03:35.449> mode<00:03:35.659> you<00:03:35.810> get<00:03:35.959> a

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
this is true trackball mode you get a

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.289 
this is true trackball mode you get a
lot<00:03:36.199> more<00:03:36.409> precision<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:37.069> a<00:03:37.970> lot<00:03:38.180> more<00:03:40.299> speed

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
lot more precision and a lot more speed

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.379 
lot more precision and a lot more speed
which<00:03:42.229> really<00:03:42.650> helps<00:03:43.129> now<00:03:43.729> as<00:03:43.879> I<00:03:44.030> said<00:03:44.090> it's

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
which really helps now as I said it's

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.240 
which really helps now as I said it's
unfortunate<00:03:44.959> that<00:03:44.989> this<00:03:45.349> is<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.620> only<00:03:45.769> game

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
unfortunate that this is the only game

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.039 
unfortunate that this is the only game
out<00:03:46.400> of<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.549> box<00:03:46.790> that<00:03:47.000> uses<00:03:47.479> this<00:03:47.720> true

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
out of the box that uses this true

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.490 
out of the box that uses this true
trackball<00:03:48.620> mode<00:03:48.889> and<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:50.720> works<00:03:50.930> very<00:03:51.319> very

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
trackball mode and it works very very

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.349 
trackball mode and it works very very
well<00:03:51.919> this<00:03:51.949> is<00:03:52.250> a<00:03:52.280> great<00:03:52.609> little<00:03:52.790> trackball

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
well this is a great little trackball

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.050 
well this is a great little trackball
and<00:03:53.599> it's<00:03:54.439> just<00:03:54.650> really<00:03:54.859> unfortunate<00:03:55.099> that

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
and it's just really unfortunate that

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.849 
and it's just really unfortunate that
Atari<00:03:56.479> didn't<00:03:56.900> utilize<00:03:57.319> it<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.560> little<00:03:57.709> bit

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
Atari didn't utilize it a little bit

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.770 
Atari didn't utilize it a little bit
better<00:03:58.040> there<00:03:58.669> are<00:03:58.819> no<00:03:59.030> games<00:03:59.299> on<00:03:59.569> the<00:03:59.689> atari

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
better there are no games on the atari

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.800 
better there are no games on the atari
2600<00:04:00.560> or<00:04:00.919> 7800<00:04:01.759> that<00:04:02.389> will<00:04:02.509> use<00:04:02.659> this

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
2600 or 7800 that will use this

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.809 
2600 or 7800 that will use this
trackball<00:04:03.319> and<00:04:03.349> trackball<00:04:03.859> mode<00:04:04.099> again<00:04:04.699> it

trackball and trackball mode again it

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.599 
trackball and trackball mode again it
will<00:04:04.879> work<00:04:05.060> fine<00:04:05.269> and<00:04:05.479> joystick<00:04:05.870> mode

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
will work fine and joystick mode

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.849 
will work fine and joystick mode
there<00:04:07.609> are<00:04:07.819> however<00:04:08.120> hacks<00:04:08.720> such<00:04:09.709> as<00:04:09.829> a

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.710 
millipede hooked up just to quickly show
you<00:04:24.590> that<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:25.130> trackball<00:04:25.550> does<00:04:25.849> work<00:04:26.150> but<00:04:26.539> in

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
you that the trackball does work but in

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.010 
you that the trackball does work but in
joystick<00:04:27.199> mode<00:04:27.409> only

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.120 

so<00:04:33.010> it<00:04:33.190> does<00:04:33.400> work<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:34.660> it<00:04:35.650> is<00:04:35.830> pretty

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
so it does work and it is pretty

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.490 
so it does work and it is pretty
responsive<00:04:36.820> but<00:04:37.150> it<00:04:37.300> is<00:04:37.450> not<00:04:37.630> true<00:04:37.930> trackball

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
responsive but it is not true trackball

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.600 
responsive but it is not true trackball
mode<00:04:39.540> so<00:04:40.540> if<00:04:40.720> you<00:04:40.840> do<00:04:41.020> find<00:04:41.230> a<00:04:41.380> trackball<00:04:41.620> you

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
mode so if you do find a trackball you

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.220 
mode so if you do find a trackball you
still<00:04:42.910> will<00:04:43.060> be<00:04:43.180> able<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.510> use<00:04:43.660> it<00:04:43.840> even<00:04:44.050> if<00:04:44.140> you

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
still will be able to use it even if you

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.050 
still will be able to use it even if you
don't<00:04:44.350> have<00:04:44.530> Missile<00:04:44.860> Command<00:04:44.980> and<00:04:45.340> can't<00:04:45.910> use

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
don't have Missile Command and can't use

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.030 
don't have Missile Command and can't use
true<00:04:46.300> trackball<00:04:46.720> mode<00:04:46.990> it's<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.800> very

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
true trackball mode it's a very

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.550

well-built<00:04:48.570> very<00:04:49.570> good<00:04:49.840> piece<00:04:50.020> of<00:04:50.170> hardware

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
well-built very good piece of hardware

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.520 
well-built very good piece of hardware
it's<00:04:51.550> just<00:04:51.820> unfortunate<00:04:52.480> that<00:04:52.510> Atari<00:04:53.230> didn't

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
it's just unfortunate that Atari didn't

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.550 
it's just unfortunate that Atari didn't
utilize<00:04:53.920> it<00:04:54.100> to<00:04:54.130> its<00:04:54.250> full<00:04:54.550> potential<00:04:55.560> well

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
utilize it to its full potential well

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.440 
utilize it to its full potential well
