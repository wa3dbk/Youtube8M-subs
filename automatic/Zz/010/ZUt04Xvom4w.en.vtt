00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
wide apart so if you draw one sort of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.150 
wide apart so if you draw one sort of
circle<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.469> another<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:52.590> over<00:00:52.920> here

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
circle here and another one over here

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.090

lines coming in from the top of the
shape<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:05.380> basically<00:02:06.380> is<00:02:06.500> Joe

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
shape and that basically is Joe

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.160 
shape and that basically is Joe
Griffin's<00:02:07.070> face

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
Griffin's face

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.630

moving on to his body the easiest way to

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.090 
moving on to his body the easiest way to
do<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.300> if<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:11.900> do<00:02:12.080> like<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.320> rectangle

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
do it is if you do like a rectangle

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.449 
do it is if you do like a rectangle
coming<00:02:13.520> off<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.820> center<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.900> his<00:02:15.140> face<00:02:15.459> down

coming off the center of his face down

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.390 
coming off the center of his face down
sort<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.090> here<00:02:17.709> it's<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:18.770> little<00:02:19.040> bit<00:02:19.160> long<00:02:19.370> so

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
sort of here it's a little bit long so

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.860 
sort of here it's a little bit long so
it's<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.820> shorten<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.300> up<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.510> touch<00:02:21.490> and<00:02:22.870> just

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
it's a shorten it up a touch and just

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.300 
it's a shorten it up a touch and just
come<00:02:24.050> up<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.230> little<00:02:24.320> bit<00:02:24.530> into<00:02:24.680> another<00:02:25.040> line

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
come up a little bit into another line

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.980 
come up a little bit into another line
because<00:02:25.670> his<00:02:25.820> bottom<00:02:26.209> piece<00:02:26.450> it's<00:02:26.780> going<00:02:26.870> to

buckles on his dungarees and you do two

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.780 
buckles on his dungarees and you do two
straight<00:02:45.530> lines<00:02:45.680> one<00:02:46.070> you<00:02:46.250> can<00:02:46.400> just<00:02:46.430> thicken

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
straight lines one you can just thicken

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.140 
straight lines one you can just thicken
up<00:02:46.850> there<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.720> never<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:48.700> another<00:02:49.700> one<00:02:49.880> here

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
up there and never and another one here

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.910 
up there and never and another one here
and<00:02:50.800> one

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
and one

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.280
