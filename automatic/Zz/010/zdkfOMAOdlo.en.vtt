00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.720
 Vacation except life lost as people age 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.990
 Yeah 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.539
 Ahh Ahh Ahh 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.330
 Ah ah ah ah ah 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.330
 Ah 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.440
 ie2 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.570
 The 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.350
 Starcraft Zatto Need more words? 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.350
 I respect you. 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.530
 Having recently that many people enjoy a more colorful graphics and made five tons Beta 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:03.899
 The one drawback is keeping 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:08.840
 It is a high oasis due to the right estrogen o How long it will take 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.840
 I decided to test it to see if it was optimized. 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.590
 I want to hear rumors here and there , 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.680
 I do. 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:33.700
 So I selected my enlargement. 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:38.020
 Just two cpu Intel Wolfdale 5300 and Core i7 929 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:43.030
 Gyeongchang just unimaginable only one similar operating speed 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:46.570
 Anyway, the core is able to cpu other preparation too much such as Achiecter bandwidth 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:52.400
 I used to compare 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:59.000
 The other parts are prepared the same except for main board and memory 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:02.000
 The next thing to say is that the graphics card is also customized based on price. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.060
 First rh Force gtx OST 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.959
 gt seo cte accident 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:13.160
 a Gandalf hd 5850 o hd 5750 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:18.170
 hd 5670 hd 5770 How exciting 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:22.390
 So I do not know, you really cpu * peuraeng according to each graphics card 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.390
 Let's see how this works. 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:33.610
 Ah lead 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:37.660
 Star pitcher of the game, to be used for testing one but God about the error specifying one gang 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:42.519
 The other is a two-to- two battle for about 30 minutes . 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:45.129
 In the battle for the volume, put a little bit of real combat around and take a frame of about 1 minute 30 seconds 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:50.670
 Measured 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.670
 Graphics quality is set to the highest highest 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.800
 Low and very high Yes my style makes a completely different game in my car 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.800
 You throw it away. 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.800
 U 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:11.340
 You can share after the first snowfall of food each graphic in 5300 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.340
 Card Let's look at the environment frame 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:22.760
 wang gtx feed mong and hd 5850 should pull the palm frame 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:27.950
 Well, then you'll see the average frame on the i7 920. 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:31.459
 What items are 9 times 9th floor 2 gtx Aion and HD 5850 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:38.030
 The average play is heard over pc frames 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:42.710
 In this regard, a2 5300, these two are not financially engaged 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:48.020
 But it's also known as the Star 4 Dual Forer. 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:50.870
 What would be the result if i7 920 is set to July cow ? 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:56.170
 There is almost no difference in existing fees. 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.170
 Does not it also support multithreading properly? 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.440
 This time before the volume . 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:11.830
 The average frames of all six Perl graphics cards are similar 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:14.410
 Star Choo that this impact is occurring, regardless of graphics card shipments in the former 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.380
 Is it a cpu bottleneck? 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:22.030
 What about the results of the ice cream ball? 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.740
 The difference is a little bit different, but the frame difference is as rush as possible. 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.450
 I can not. 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:33.790
 This is because there is no rush unit, so the CPU is a bottleneck. 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:39.190
 Although the unit has become a lot eh entire volume all the cpu bottleneck 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:42.810
 Graphics card would show a similar frame graphics we at this point 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.810
 You need to check your settings 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:51.460
 Alcohol Bonita directly reflects the physical effect of these three items are dependent on the cpu 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:57.340
 There is 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:05:03.190
 If you give these items to the graphics card, then these divisions will be better off. 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:08.530
 Let's look at one example: The best option is to transfer colors exclusively from abroad 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:12.150
 Set the physical items to low and in 5300 ps2 candidate pretzel week 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.150
 Let's track the average frame 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:21.520
 I was able to see about 7 francs synergies 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.390
 If you adjust the other options appropriately, you will see a larger frame synergy effect. 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.650
 There you go. 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.650
 We should not be frustrated . 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:37.110
 What happens when I increase the speed of the hand cpu through the overclock ? 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:45.280
 First of all, there is no difference between the overclock and average play 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.600
 Yo 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:55.240
 I thought this 5300 would be different. 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:06:00.640
 Go to the top of the page GTX Feed Dreams and HD 5850 2 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:03.460
 I started looking for my skills, but still has to show against Hong i7 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:08.290
 It looks like a bunch. 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:12.040
 Now the transition volume shipments will receive a lot of influence on the cpu listed ago 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:17.500
 As the block went up, the brake went up. 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:24.089
 Unfortunately, even though I went to 5309 and while the clock is up in the volume section 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:29.879
 The combination of the tx 5850 was not able to re- engage 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:35.699
 4 4 As a final test, I have added a little bit of code to the 8400 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:38.849
 Compared to the 5,300, the operating speed system bus and especially the cache 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:43.830
 There are a lot of differences in 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:48.539
 How does gts 250 differ from existing results when you snap 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:54.620
 i7 shows average frame similar to 920 2 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:54.620
 The squat video e8400 seems to show a re-performance 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:05.860
 Well, we finished the experiment today. 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:09.610
 The unit has to be more to play our wake a lot depending on the cpu performance 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:13.360
 Also, high performance graphics card 1 2 cpu should have high performance . 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:19.120
 I once again confirmed that it can deliver performance 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:23.650
 Then it hits the screens frustrated after the volume before you know Dean Get in appropriate options 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:26.789
 I'm sorry to have noticed that I could not test more cpu. 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.789
 Then ,
