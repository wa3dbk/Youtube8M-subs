thought was a really good deal so i went
in<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.350> i<00:02:55.620> bought<00:02:55.860> these<00:02:56.040> two<00:02:56.280> products<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:56.820> got

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
in and i bought these two products I got

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.980 
in and i bought these two products I got
the<00:02:57.630> barium<00:02:58.080> 129<00:02:58.710> and<00:02:59.150> then<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.330> barium<00:03:00.720> lip

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.990 
the barium 129 and then the barium lip
gloss<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.590> think<00:03:01.770> this<00:03:01.830> is<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:02.040> number<00:03:02.310> five
