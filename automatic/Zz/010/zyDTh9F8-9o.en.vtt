quality of the light you know if I want
to<00:01:11.459> just<00:01:11.759> try<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.740> copy<00:01:13.740> every<00:01:14.039> single

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
to just try and copy every single

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.580 
to just try and copy every single
building<00:01:14.639> that's<00:01:14.850> there<00:01:15.119> it'd<00:01:15.959> just<00:01:16.319> be<00:01:16.530> a

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
building that's there it'd just be a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.739 
building that's there it'd just be a
very<00:01:16.829> different<00:01:17.039> type<00:01:17.399> of<00:01:17.600> experience<00:01:18.600> and

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:18.749 
very different type of experience and

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:21.859 
very different type of experience and
painting<00:01:19.189> when<00:01:20.189> you're<00:01:20.310> outdoors<00:01:20.429> and<00:01:21.060> you

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
painting when you're outdoors and you

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.629 
painting when you're outdoors and you
get<00:01:22.259> kind<00:01:22.469> of<00:01:22.499> a<00:01:22.590> feeling<00:01:22.829> of<00:01:23.039> the<00:01:23.130> movement<00:01:23.549> of

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:23.639 
get kind of a feeling of the movement of

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:26.090 
get kind of a feeling of the movement of
the<00:01:23.759> cars<00:01:23.969> going<00:01:24.959> back<00:01:25.109> and<00:01:25.289> forth<00:01:25.529> the<00:01:25.770> people

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the cars going back and forth the people

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.580 
the cars going back and forth the people
walking<00:01:26.399> up<00:01:26.639> and<00:01:26.729> down<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.990> buildings<00:01:28.409> as

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
walking up and down the buildings as

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.059 
walking up and down the buildings as
they<00:01:28.619> change<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.189> sunlight<00:01:31.069> I'm

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
they change in the sunlight I'm

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:33.649 
they change in the sunlight I'm
interested<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.639> suggesting<00:01:33.119> those<00:01:33.240> types<00:01:33.539> of

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
interested in suggesting those types of

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.919 
interested in suggesting those types of
things<00:01:33.899> kind<00:01:34.709> of<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:35.009> snapshot<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.819> how<00:01:36.689> life

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
things kind of a snapshot of how life

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.480 
things kind of a snapshot of how life
really<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.409> not<00:01:37.740> something<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.219> is<00:01:38.579> static

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
really is not something that is static

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.709 
really is not something that is static
so<00:01:41.490> I've<00:01:41.639> done<00:01:41.819> I've<00:01:41.999> kind<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.299> put<00:01:42.479> all<00:01:42.599> these

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
so I've done I've kind of put all these

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.899 
so I've done I've kind of put all these
masses<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.529> color<00:01:44.099> next<00:01:44.459> to<00:01:44.520> each<00:01:44.579> other<00:01:44.729> and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
masses of color next to each other and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.199 
masses of color next to each other and
haven't<00:01:45.179> modified<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.779> edges<00:01:46.079> at<00:01:46.229> all<00:01:47.209> I'm

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
haven't modified the edges at all I'm

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:49.669 
haven't modified the edges at all I'm
just<00:01:48.419> going<00:01:48.569> to<00:01:48.599> quiet<00:01:49.049> down<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.289> few<00:01:49.529> things

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
just going to quiet down a few things

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.449 
just going to quiet down a few things
just<00:01:49.889> to<00:01:50.069> make<00:01:50.249> sure<00:01:50.459> my<00:01:50.909> value<00:01:51.270> pattern<00:01:51.630> is

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:52.459 
just to make sure my value pattern is

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.119 
just to make sure my value pattern is
where<00:01:53.459> I<00:01:53.490> want<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.849> to<00:01:53.969> be
