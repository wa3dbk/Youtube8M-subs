the<00:03:03.120> deck<00:03:03.590> actually<00:03:04.590> needs<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.100> new<00:03:05.220> blade<00:03:05.460> one

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
the deck actually needs a new blade one

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.870 
the deck actually needs a new blade one
of<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.540> blades<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:07.140> bent<00:03:07.410> very<00:03:07.740> badly<00:03:08.010> so<00:03:08.430> I'm

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
of the blades is bent very badly so I'm

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.810 
of the blades is bent very badly so I'm
going<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.150> replace<00:03:09.360> it's<00:03:10.170> almost<00:03:10.470> $20.00<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:11.490> I

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
going to replace it's almost $20.00 so I

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.240 
going to replace it's almost $20.00 so I
was<00:03:12.510> thinking<00:03:12.750> those<00:03:13.200> ten<00:03:13.590> dollars<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.130> know

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
was thinking those ten dollars you know

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.480 
was thinking those ten dollars you know
I'd<00:03:14.340> replace<00:03:14.670> both<00:03:14.940> but<00:03:15.710> it's<00:03:16.710> not<00:03:16.920> it's<00:03:17.310> nice

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
I'd replace both but it's not it's nice

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.230 
I'd replace both but it's not it's nice
not<00:03:17.670> gonna<00:03:17.850> happen<00:03:18.240> and<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:20.100> have<00:03:20.790> talked<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.090> my

her out with it whatever what I want to
do<00:03:39.120> now<00:03:39.680> since<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.800> gotta<00:03:40.950> wait<00:03:41.130> for<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.340> blade

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
do now since I gotta wait for the blade

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.160 
do now since I gotta wait for the blade
to<00:03:41.760> come<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.390> tire<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.750> come

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
to come and the tire to come

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.140 
to come and the tire to come
it's<00:03:43.800> I<00:03:44.040> figure<00:03:44.340> out<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.580> problem<00:03:44.910> if<00:03:45.030> you

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
it's I figure out the problem if you

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.520 
it's I figure out the problem if you
remember<00:03:45.540> what<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.840> shouldn't<00:03:46.140> because<00:03:46.380> you

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
remember what you shouldn't because you

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.520 
remember what you shouldn't because you
just<00:03:46.709> saw<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.760> last<00:03:48.000> part<00:03:48.360> or<00:03:48.930> well<00:03:49.170> actually

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
just saw the last part or well actually

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.830 
just saw the last part or well actually
the<00:03:49.620> beginning<00:03:49.739> videos<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:51.150> saw<00:03:51.360> it<00:03:51.540> was<00:03:51.630> hard

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
the beginning videos you saw it was hard

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.090 
the beginning videos you saw it was hard
to<00:03:51.900> start<00:03:52.820> maybe<00:03:54.230> just<00:03:55.230> maybe<00:03:55.410> it's<00:03:55.709> cuz<00:03:55.920> the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
to start maybe just maybe it's cuz the

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.390 
to start maybe just maybe it's cuz the
fuel<00:03:56.340> line<00:03:56.550> I<00:03:57.590> don't<00:03:58.590> really<00:03:58.860> know<00:03:59.100> about<00:03:59.250> that

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
fuel line I don't really know about that

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.229 
fuel line I don't really know about that
I<00:03:59.880> mean<00:04:00.570> it's<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.810> crack<00:04:01.080> there<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:02.760> certainly

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
I mean it's a crack there it certainly

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.920 
I mean it's a crack there it certainly
will<00:04:03.750> not<00:04:03.959> hurt<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.410> replace<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:05.570> so<00:04:06.570> actually

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
will not hurt to replace it so actually

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.780 
will not hurt to replace it so actually
I'm<00:04:07.019> gonna<00:04:07.140> have<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.380> do<00:04:07.530> is<00:04:07.830> take<00:04:08.130> all<00:04:08.610> this

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
I'm gonna have to do is take all this

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.340 
I'm gonna have to do is take all this
apart<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.390> actually<00:04:09.510> have<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.870> take<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.140> gas

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
apart and actually have to take the gas

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.790 
apart and actually have to take the gas
tank<00:04:10.620> off<00:04:11.930> which<00:04:12.930> might<00:04:13.230> not<00:04:13.350> be<00:04:13.410> -<00:04:13.769> horned

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
tank off which might not be - horned

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.110 
tank off which might not be - horned
asleep<00:04:14.670> bad<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:16.220> then<00:04:17.220> I'll<00:04:17.400> replace<00:04:17.730> all<00:04:18.000> the

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
asleep bad and then I'll replace all the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.180 
asleep bad and then I'll replace all the
fuel<00:04:18.390> line<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:18.959> we'll<00:04:19.530> see<00:04:19.680> if<00:04:19.769> that<00:04:19.799> makes<00:04:20.040> a

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
fuel line and we'll see if that makes a

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.890 
fuel line and we'll see if that makes a
difference<00:04:20.220> although<00:04:20.970> I'm<00:04:21.419> not<00:04:21.720> really

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
difference although I'm not really

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.010 
difference although I'm not really
thinking<00:04:23.060> next<00:04:24.060> I<00:04:24.210> will<00:04:24.360> probably<00:04:24.570> replace

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
thinking next I will probably replace

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.390 
thinking next I will probably replace
the<00:04:25.760> fuel<00:04:26.760> filter<00:04:27.270> if<00:04:27.660> that<00:04:27.870> doesn't<00:04:28.320> work<00:04:28.440> and

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
the fuel filter if that doesn't work and

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.490 
the fuel filter if that doesn't work and
after<00:04:29.820> that<00:04:30.030> I'm<00:04:30.270> not<00:04:30.330> really<00:04:31.020> sure<00:04:31.350> where

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
after that I'm not really sure where

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.360 
after that I'm not really sure where
I'll<00:04:31.620> go<00:04:31.800> from<00:04:32.010> there<00:04:32.310> because<00:04:33.350> what's<00:04:34.370> there

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
I'll go from there because what's there

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.029 
I'll go from there because what's there
wasn't<00:04:35.729> a<00:04:35.820> any<00:04:36.210> valve<00:04:36.570> that<00:04:37.169> stopped<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:37.919> gas

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
wasn't a any valve that stopped the gas

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:39.340 
wasn't a any valve that stopped the gas
from<00:04:38.250> flowing<00:04:38.550> back

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
from flowing back

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.220 
from flowing back
instead<00:04:40.310> it<00:04:40.880> was<00:04:40.970> actually<00:04:41.390> exactly<00:04:42.050> like

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
instead it was actually exactly like

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.150 
instead it was actually exactly like
this<00:04:42.440> and<00:04:42.500> it<00:04:42.830> started<00:04:43.900> was<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:45.050> last<00:04:45.800> year<00:04:46.010> or

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
this and it started was it last year or

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.860 
this and it started was it last year or
two<00:04:46.310> years<00:04:46.670> ago<00:04:46.880> whenever<00:04:47.090> it<00:04:47.360> was<00:04:47.480> that<00:04:47.540> it

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
two years ago whenever it was that it

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.600 
two years ago whenever it was that it
was<00:04:47.960> last<00:04:48.200> used<00:04:48.520> it<00:04:49.520> had<00:04:49.820> started<00:04:50.270> great<00:04:51.610> so

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
was last used it had started great so

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.360 
was last used it had started great so
I'm<00:04:52.850> not<00:04:52.970> I'm<00:04:53.180> not<00:04:53.210> really<00:04:53.390> sure<00:04:53.780> so<00:04:54.220> I'll<00:04:55.220> just

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
I'm not I'm not really sure so I'll just

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.090 
I'm not I'm not really sure so I'll just
have<00:04:55.520> to<00:04:55.610> do<00:04:55.670> a<00:04:55.700> little<00:04:55.940> investigating<00:04:57.100> so

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
have to do a little investigating so

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.710 
have to do a little investigating so
we'll<00:04:58.280> replace<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.610> fuel<00:04:58.970> line<00:04:59.150> right<00:04:59.330> now

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.450 

all<00:05:02.720> right<00:05:02.960> it's<00:05:03.080> several<00:05:03.650> days<00:05:03.980> it's<00:05:04.250> not<00:05:04.430> a

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
all right it's several days it's not a

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.840 
all right it's several days it's not a
week<00:05:04.700> later<00:05:05.230> you<00:05:06.230> got<00:05:06.380> the<00:05:06.620> new<00:05:06.980> gas<00:05:07.430> holes<00:05:07.700> in

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
week later you got the new gas holes in

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.540
