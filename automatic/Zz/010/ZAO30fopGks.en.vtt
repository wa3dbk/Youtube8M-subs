different<00:01:47.220> cuz<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.729> real<00:01:47.880> life<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.479> think

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
different cuz it's real life and I think

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.810 
different cuz it's real life and I think
that<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> lot<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.990> us<00:01:49.170> take<00:01:49.350> for<00:01:49.409> granted<00:01:49.820> what

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
that a lot of us take for granted what

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.380 
that a lot of us take for granted what
we<00:01:50.939> do<00:01:51.060> online<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.220> things<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.549> we<00:01:53.729> we

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
we do online and the things that we we

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.050 
we do online and the things that we we
