00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.780 

these<00:00:01.170> are<00:00:01.560> three<00:00:01.770> of<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:02.040> best<00:00:02.310> new<00:00:02.580> bows

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
these are three of the best new bows

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.599 
these are three of the best new bows
from<00:00:03.240> Matthews<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.230> Hoyt<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:05.279> left<00:00:05.490> you've

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
from Matthews and Hoyt the left you've

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.750 
from Matthews and Hoyt the left you've
got<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:06.029> carbon<00:00:06.540> element<00:00:06.960> with<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.010> rkt<00:00:08.400> cams

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
got the carbon element with the rkt cams

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.629 
got the carbon element with the rkt cams
in<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.719> middle<00:00:10.080> you've<00:00:10.260> got<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.679> vector<00:00:11.160> with

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
in the middle you've got the vector with

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.360 
in the middle you've got the vector with
the<00:00:11.849> same<00:00:12.090> cams<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.960> on<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.710> far<00:00:13.889> right

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
the same cams and on the far right

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.290 
the same cams and on the far right
you've<00:00:14.460> got<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.120> Matthews<00:00:16.020> helium<00:00:17.240> so<00:00:18.240> I'm

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
you've got the Matthews helium so I'm

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.150 
you've got the Matthews helium so I'm
just<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.690> closer<00:00:19.080> look<00:00:19.380> at<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.590> bow

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.029 

cool-looking<00:00:24.199> carbon-fiber<00:00:25.199> composite<00:00:25.890> look

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
cool-looking carbon-fiber composite look

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.130 
cool-looking carbon-fiber composite look
to<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> limb<00:00:29.330> then<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.480> one's<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> vector

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
to the limb then this one's the vector

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.860 
to the limb then this one's the vector
if<00:00:31.260> not<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.590> vector<00:00:31.890> plus<00:00:32.600> but<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.690> still

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
if not the vector plus but it still

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.780 
if not the vector plus but it still
seems<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.320> shoot<00:00:34.559> just<00:00:35.040> as<00:00:35.190> fast

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
seems to shoot just as fast

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.190 
seems to shoot just as fast
we'll<00:00:35.969> shoot<00:00:36.120> these<00:00:36.270> two<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> chronograph<00:00:36.809> just

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
we'll shoot these two a chronograph just

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.310 
we'll shoot these two a chronograph just
a<00:00:37.290> second<00:00:38.090> and<00:00:39.090> there's<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> helium<00:00:39.719> brand

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
a second and there's the helium brand

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.470 
a second and there's the helium brand
new<00:00:40.850> Matthews<00:00:41.850> bow<00:00:42.980> more<00:00:43.980> machined<00:00:44.430> riser<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
new Matthews bow more machined riser the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.910 
new Matthews bow more machined riser the
new<00:00:45.829> dampeners<00:00:47.480> comes<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.690> three<00:00:49.320> point<00:00:49.649> five

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.939 
new dampeners comes in three point five
five<00:00:50.579> pounds<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:55.110> there's<00:00:55.320> our<00:00:55.440> chronograph

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
five pounds so there's our chronograph

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.010 
five pounds so there's our chronograph
just<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:56.940> we've<00:00:57.090> done<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.300> years<00:00:57.449> past<00:00:57.780> we'll

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
just like we've done in years past we'll

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.920 
just like we've done in years past we'll
shoot<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.199> through<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:59.010> got<00:00:59.129> James<00:00:59.370> from

him for us resident pro seventy pounds

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.560 
him for us resident pro seventy pounds
was<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:22.130> 396<00:01:23.130> Green<00:01:23.460> Arrow<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.970> pretty<00:01:24.210> close<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
was a 396 Green Arrow so pretty close to

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:40.569 
was a 396 Green Arrow so pretty close to
400<00:01:25.369> so<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.759> go<00:01:26.880> first<00:01:27.210> shot<00:01:35.360> f3o<00:01:36.530> 6.4

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.830 

that's<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.729> first<00:01:41.939> shot<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.509> element

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that's the first shot with the element

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.730 
that's the first shot with the element
yeah

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.010 

that<00:01:48.740> era<00:01:48.950> was<00:01:49.250> just<00:01:49.460> about<00:01:49.670> 400<00:01:50.090> rooms<00:01:50.299> 397

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
that era was just about 400 rooms 397

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.370 
that era was just about 400 rooms 397
like<00:01:51.409> he<00:01:51.530> said<00:01:51.770> we<00:01:52.429> measured<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.990> draw<00:01:54.200> length

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
like he said we measured the draw length

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.260 
like he said we measured the draw length
on<00:01:54.560> all<00:01:54.710> of<00:01:54.799> them<00:01:54.950> all<00:01:55.130> of<00:01:55.250> them<00:01:55.369> are<00:01:55.609> supposed

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
on all of them all of them are supposed

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.649 
on all of them all of them are supposed
to<00:01:56.359> be<00:01:56.479> 29<00:01:56.929> inches<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.819> they're<00:01:58.819> about<00:01:59.000> 29<00:01:59.630> and

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
to be 29 inches and they're about 29 and

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.050 
to be 29 inches and they're about 29 and
a<00:01:59.840> quarter<00:02:00.200> every<00:02:01.069> one<00:02:01.219> we<00:02:01.549> put<00:02:01.759> them<00:02:01.880> all<00:02:01.939> at

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
a quarter every one we put them all at

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:22.539 
a quarter every one we put them all at
seventy<00:02:02.390> pounds<00:02:20.170> three<00:02:21.170> oh<00:02:21.200> nine<00:02:21.430> point<00:02:22.430> three

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
seventy pounds three oh nine point three

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.210 
seventy pounds three oh nine point three
and<00:02:24.280> for<00:02:25.280> some<00:02:25.489> reason<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:26.980> vectors<00:02:27.980> been

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
and for some reason that vectors been

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.539 
and for some reason that vectors been
coming<00:02:28.579> in<00:02:28.730> at<00:02:28.880> about<00:02:29.709> four<00:02:30.709> feet<00:02:30.920> per<00:02:31.220> second

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
coming in at about four feet per second

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.140 
coming in at about four feet per second
faster<00:02:31.730> than<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.450> element<00:02:33.049> yeah<00:02:34.090> even<00:02:35.090> though

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
faster than the element yeah even though

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.119 
faster than the element yeah even though
they've<00:02:35.299> got<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.569> same<00:02:35.750> cam<00:02:36.049> same<00:02:36.530> draw<00:02:36.920> way

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
they've got the same cam same draw way

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.990 
they've got the same cam same draw way
same<00:02:37.489> founded<00:02:37.910> they<00:02:38.720> both<00:02:38.900> should<00:02:39.110> be<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.290> tune

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
same founded they both should be in tune

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.240 
same founded they both should be in tune
can't<00:02:41.000> figure<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:41.420> one<00:02:41.569> out<00:02:44.829> just<00:02:45.829> smoking

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
can't figure that one out just smoking

00:02:46.250 --> 00:03:11.340 
can't figure that one out just smoking

- 98.7 3300 mark that's pretty

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.050 
- 98.7 3300 mark that's pretty
