used for attack and defense but 2004's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.510 
used for attack and defense but 2004's
defense<00:01:10.439> really<00:01:10.650> won't<00:01:10.890> help<00:01:11.070> him<00:01:11.130> out<00:01:11.280> so

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.569 
it's a really good card it should be
higher<00:04:14.709> but<00:04:15.010> there's<00:04:15.190> some<00:04:15.340> better<00:04:15.519> things

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
higher but there's some better things

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.020 
higher but there's some better things
out<00:04:15.940> there<00:04:16.180> so<00:04:16.870> this<00:04:17.019> is<00:04:17.139> number<00:04:17.289> seven

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030

number<00:04:20.030> six<00:04:22.180> we're<00:04:23.180> grossing<00:04:24.160> this<00:04:25.160> is<00:04:25.310> a

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
number six we're grossing this is a

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.180

spell<00:04:25.759> for<00:04:25.910> Rob<00:04:26.349> now<00:04:27.349> the<00:04:27.410> reason<00:04:27.620> this<00:04:27.860> one<00:04:28.069> is

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
spell for Rob now the reason this one is

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.450 
spell for Rob now the reason this one is
good<00:04:28.400> is<00:04:28.550> because<00:04:29.319> it<00:04:30.319> gives<00:04:30.500> 4,000<00:04:31.190> drops

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
good is because it gives 4,000 drops

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.540 
good is because it gives 4,000 drops
which<00:04:31.729> isn't<00:04:32.030> too<00:04:32.180> much<00:04:32.419> he'll<00:04:32.930> be<00:04:33.550> 7,000

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
which isn't too much he'll be 7,000

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.100 
which isn't too much he'll be 7,000
toward<00:04:34.729> the<00:04:34.819> end<00:04:34.940> but<00:04:35.120> if<00:04:35.360> he<00:04:35.449> wins<00:04:35.630> he<00:04:35.810> gets<00:04:35.840> an

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
toward the end but if he wins he gets an

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.710 
toward the end but if he wins he gets an
option<00:04:36.530> which<00:04:36.800> is<00:04:36.919> pretty<00:04:37.069> cool<00:04:37.310> is<00:04:37.460> like
