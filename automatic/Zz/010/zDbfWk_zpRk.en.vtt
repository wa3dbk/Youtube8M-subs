00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.500 

your<00:00:46.190> turn<00:00:46.490> sir

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.729 

and<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.379> land

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.040 

interesting

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.660 

this<00:00:59.590> is<00:00:59.710> a<00:00:59.770> car<00:00:59.920> to<00:01:00.040> actually<00:01:00.280> kind<00:01:00.430> of<00:01:00.520> want

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
this is a car to actually kind of want

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.860 
this is a car to actually kind of want
them<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:00.850> counter<00:01:01.120> which<00:01:01.239> is<00:01:01.360> why<00:01:01.480> I<00:01:01.540> played<00:01:01.780> it

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
them to counter which is why I played it

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.750 
them to counter which is why I played it
first<00:01:02.079> I<00:01:02.379> think<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:02.950> room<00:01:03.100> Blaster<00:01:03.489> is<00:01:03.520> much

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
first I think the room Blaster is much

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.410 
first I think the room Blaster is much
more<00:01:03.910> important<00:01:04.390> since<00:01:04.690> he<00:01:04.839> has<00:01:06.150> got<00:01:07.150> stuck<00:01:07.330> on

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
more important since he has got stuck on

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.540 
more important since he has got stuck on
lands<00:01:07.869> and<00:01:08.110> I<00:01:08.440> think<00:01:08.619> gladiators<00:01:09.040> really<00:01:09.430> good

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
lands and I think gladiators really good

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:32.260 
lands and I think gladiators really good
against<00:01:09.760> them<00:01:09.940> to<00:01:12.659> play<00:01:13.659> another<00:01:13.720> Phoenix

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.880 

that's<00:01:32.899> pretty<00:01:33.170> good

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.940 

and<00:01:36.580> now<00:01:36.850> I<00:01:36.909> can<00:01:37.150> feel<00:01:37.390> free<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:38.370> kick<00:01:39.370> this<00:01:39.550> guy

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
and now I can feel free to kick this guy

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:52.700 
and now I can feel free to kick this guy
get<00:01:41.950> rid<00:01:42.070> of<00:01:42.100> a<00:01:42.190> colonnade<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:45.659> attack<00:01:46.659> it<00:01:46.690> in

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.980 

pretty<00:01:53.370> sure<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.520> bolt<00:01:53.909> Gideon<00:01:54.299> here<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:54.840> he

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
pretty sure just bolt Gideon here if he

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.390 
pretty sure just bolt Gideon here if he
plays<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.380> squadron<00:01:55.650> hawk<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.280> have

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
plays like a squadron hawk you can have

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.750 
plays like a squadron hawk you can have
me<00:01:56.549> attack<00:01:56.790> Gideon<00:01:57.210> puts<00:01:57.810> me<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> bad<00:01:58.140> place

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
me attack Gideon puts me in a bad place

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.130 
me attack Gideon puts me in a bad place
so<00:01:59.760> I<00:01:59.790> think<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.150> bolt<00:02:00.900> Gideon<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:03.140> be

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
so I think I just bolt Gideon and be

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.830 
so I think I just bolt Gideon and be
done<00:02:04.350> with<00:02:04.560> it

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.789 

that's<00:02:11.840> fine<00:02:12.049> he's<00:02:12.319> not<00:02:12.469> going<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.650> bounce

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
that's fine he's not going to bounce

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.199 
that's fine he's not going to bounce
this<00:02:13.010> guy<00:02:13.129> clearly<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:15.370> should<00:02:16.370> be<00:02:16.519> in<00:02:16.609> okay

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
this guy clearly so should be in okay

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.709 
this guy clearly so should be in okay
shape<00:02:17.239> I<00:02:17.769> think<00:02:18.769> Cyclops<00:02:19.129> light<00:02:19.310> is<00:02:19.719> pretty

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:20.719 
shape I think Cyclops light is pretty

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:38.790 
shape I think Cyclops light is pretty
good<00:02:20.900> player<00:02:21.280> so

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.520 

um<00:02:42.280> I'm<00:02:43.280> gonna<00:02:43.430> I'm<00:02:43.670> not<00:02:43.700> gonna<00:02:43.940> I'm<00:02:44.380> not<00:02:45.380> gonna

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
um I'm gonna I'm not gonna I'm not gonna

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.830 
um I'm gonna I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
use<00:02:46.460> in<00:02:46.580> our<00:02:46.640> trail<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.090> J<00:02:47.330> so<00:02:47.390> you<00:02:47.600> can<00:02:47.720> have

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
use in our trail on J so you can have

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.860 
use in our trail on J so you can have
another<00:02:47.990> card<00:02:48.290> because<00:02:49.070> if<00:02:49.190> he<00:02:49.250> plays<00:02:49.430> like

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
another card because if he plays like

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.040 
another card because if he plays like
squadron<00:02:50.870> hawk<00:02:50.990> and<00:02:51.470> then<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:53.660> know<00:02:53.750> stone

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
squadron hawk and then you know stone

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.920 
squadron hawk and then you know stone
for<00:02:54.320> it<00:02:54.380> or<00:02:54.500> something<00:02:54.800> that<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:54.980> can<00:02:55.190> actually

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
for it or something that I can actually

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:03.960 
for it or something that I can actually
241<00:02:56.930> them

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.340 

and<00:03:04.970> if<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:05.390> bounce<00:03:05.570> this<00:03:05.720> like<00:03:05.870> gladiator<00:03:06.200> it

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
and if you bounce this like gladiator it

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.330 
and if you bounce this like gladiator it
get<00:03:06.440> sort<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.680> chased<00:03:06.890> by<00:03:07.070> itself<00:03:07.340> too<00:03:07.610> so<00:03:09.340> I'm

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
it's not fine they took significantly

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.280

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.410 

this<00:04:03.510> actually<00:04:03.750> could<00:04:04.050> be<00:04:04.110> really<00:04:04.410> good<00:04:05.420> will

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420

I can't imagine he doesn't this activate

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
guess if you have four cards i have one

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:28.190 
guess if you have four cards i have one
we<00:05:21.310> both<00:05:21.460> have<00:05:21.669> a<00:05:21.820> land

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:35.170 

ah<00:05:28.430> the<00:05:29.430> old<00:05:29.580> gideon<00:05:30.000> jura

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.750 

to<00:05:36.180> phoenix's<00:05:36.719> in<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:36.990> yard

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.430 

yeah<00:05:41.360> I'm<00:05:41.480> just<00:05:41.660> drawn<00:05:41.900> to<00:05:41.930> when<00:05:42.140> he<00:05:42.260> lands

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
yeah I'm just drawn to when he lands

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.230 
yeah I'm just drawn to when he lands
this<00:05:42.620> game<00:05:42.830> felt<00:05:43.730> like<00:05:43.850> I<00:05:43.910> was<00:05:44.030> in<00:05:44.060> a<00:05:44.150> really

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
this game felt like I was in a really

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.340 
this game felt like I was in a really
good<00:05:44.390> position<00:05:44.570> but<00:05:46.930> just<00:05:47.930> block<00:05:48.140> with<00:05:48.320> the

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
good position but just block with the

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.880 
good position but just block with the
Nexus<00:05:48.740> here<00:05:48.950> I<00:05:50.290> don't<00:05:51.290> know<00:05:51.350> I<00:05:51.380> wouldn't<00:05:51.740> just

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
Nexus here I don't know I wouldn't just

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.500 
Nexus here I don't know I wouldn't just
take<00:05:51.920> two<00:05:52.280> instead<00:05:52.880> he<00:05:52.970> trades<00:05:53.210> the<00:05:53.300> land

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
take two instead he trades the land

00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:04.540 
take two instead he trades the land
that's<00:05:54.140> fine<00:05:54.830> I<00:05:54.860> guess

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.209 

one<00:06:05.550> two<00:06:05.699> three<00:06:05.909> one<00:06:06.029> two<00:06:06.210> you<00:06:06.749> can<00:06:06.930> actually

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:07.219 
one two three one two you can actually

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:10.969 
one two three one two you can actually
equip<00:06:08.219> it<00:06:08.340> to<00:06:08.370> Gideon<00:06:08.729> I<00:06:09.860> think<00:06:10.860> I'm<00:06:10.919> just

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
equip it to Gideon I think I'm just

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:13.820 
equip it to Gideon I think I'm just
going<00:06:11.219> to<00:06:11.279> scoop<00:06:11.789> here<00:06:12.689> and<00:06:13.139> maybe<00:06:13.409> we'll<00:06:13.740> just

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
going to scoop here and maybe we'll just

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.920 
going to scoop here and maybe we'll just
see

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.140 

really<00:06:19.889> you<00:06:20.100> don't<00:06:20.190> just<00:06:20.400> play<00:06:20.580> an<00:06:20.729> ickleby<00:06:21.000> to

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
really you don't just play an ickleby to

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:27.839 
really you don't just play an ickleby to
Gideon<00:06:22.580> weird

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:27.849 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:33.419 

I<00:06:27.909> guess<00:06:29.729> to<00:06:30.729> turn<00:06:30.969> clock<00:06:31.270> instead<00:06:31.569> of<00:06:32.309> not<00:06:33.309> all

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:33.429 
I guess to turn clock instead of not all

00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:40.340 
I guess to turn clock instead of not all
I<00:06:33.459> guess

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.690 

block<00:06:41.160> I<00:06:41.750> killed<00:06:43.160> yeah<00:06:44.160> that<00:06:44.340> guy's<00:06:44.520> just

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
block I killed yeah that guy's just

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:54.050 
block I killed yeah that guy's just
going<00:06:44.880> to<00:06:44.940> die<00:06:45.090> so<00:06:52.250> unfortunate<00:06:53.250> I<00:06:53.460> like

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 
going to die so unfortunate I like

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.770 
going to die so unfortunate I like
having<00:06:54.300> Braille<00:06:54.540> off<00:06:54.690> the<00:06:54.810> g's<00:06:54.990> for<00:06:55.380> Gideon's

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
having Braille off the g's for Gideon's

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.920 
having Braille off the g's for Gideon's
so<00:06:57.780> I'll<00:06:58.230> actually<00:06:58.410> take<00:06:58.710> out<00:06:59.360> one<00:07:00.360> more<00:07:00.630> clasp

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
so I'll actually take out one more clasp

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.430 
so I'll actually take out one more clasp
and<00:07:01.670> that<00:07:02.670> one<00:07:03.150> room<00:07:03.450> blaster<00:07:03.900> I<00:07:03.960> was<00:07:04.080> talking

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 
and that one room blaster I was talking

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:12.060 
and that one room blaster I was talking
about

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.600 

so<00:07:12.670> yeah<00:07:13.120> we'll<00:07:13.240> try<00:07:13.390> that
