00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
see what we can put together now for

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.179 
see what we can put together now for
your<00:00:30.840> talents<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:31.529> going<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> revolve

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
your talents it's going to revolve

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.020 
your talents it's going to revolve
heavily<00:00:32.940> around<00:00:33.570> multi-shot<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:35.219> composite

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
heavily around multi-shot this composite

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.690 
heavily around multi-shot this composite
arrows<00:00:36.570> increases<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.620> range<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:38.040> multi<00:00:38.460> shot

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
arrows increases the range of multi shot

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.389 
arrows increases the range of multi shot
by<00:00:38.940> twenty<00:00:39.390> percent<00:00:39.719> which<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.860> large

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
by twenty percent which is a large

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.790 
by twenty percent which is a large
distance<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.290> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.620> your

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
distance so this is going to be your

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.860 
distance so this is going to be your
main<00:00:44.010> attack<00:00:44.340> especially<00:00:44.670> when<00:00:45.480> clearing

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
main attack especially when clearing

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.459 
main attack especially when clearing
most<00:00:46.260> about<00:00:46.530> everything<00:00:47.660> next<00:00:48.660> up<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.110> your

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
most about everything next up is your

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.920 
most about everything next up is your
level<00:00:49.770> for<00:00:50.250> talent<00:00:50.820> now<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.239> can<00:00:51.660> go<00:00:51.870> two

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
level for talent now you can go two

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.750 
level for talent now you can go two
different<00:00:52.440> directions<00:00:52.559> here<00:00:53.219> puncturing

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
different directions here puncturing

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.240 
different directions here puncturing
arrow<00:00:54.180> increases<00:00:55.140> targets<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.680> range<00:00:56.070> of

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
arrow increases targets and range of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.790 
arrow increases targets and range of
Hungary<00:00:56.610> narrow<00:00:56.850> or<00:00:57.180> multi<00:00:57.960> shot<00:00:58.260> launches

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
puncturing arrow and I'll go over some

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.030 
puncturing arrow and I'll go over some
of<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> reasons<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:04.650> one

allowing<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.850> hit<00:01:09.000> multiple<00:01:09.479> times

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
allowing this to hit multiple times

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.810 
allowing this to hit multiple times
especially<00:01:10.770> with<00:01:10.860> some<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> later<00:01:11.400> skills

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
especially with some of the later skills

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.210 
especially with some of the later skills
