had trouble cutting down like any parts
out<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:18.029> because<00:00:18.359> it's<00:00:18.539> constant<00:00:18.990> action

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
out of this because it's constant action

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.870 
dexterity I'm sure you guys have heard
the<00:00:33.329> entire<00:00:33.809> spiel<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:35.250> perk<00:00:35.520> setup

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the entire spiel on that perk setup

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.030 
the entire spiel on that perk setup
because<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.149> lot<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> people<00:00:36.600> use<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.680> I

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
because a lot of people use it so I

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.979 
because a lot of people use it so I
don't<00:00:38.730> really<00:00:38.850> need<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.210> go<00:00:39.329> into<00:00:39.480> depth<00:00:39.840> about

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
don't really need to go into depth about

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.889 
don't really need to go into depth about
that<00:00:40.379> or<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.340> depth<00:00:41.640> about<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.780> is

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
that or in depth about that but this is

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.060 
that or in depth about that but this is
a<00:00:43.280> 47<00:00:44.280> gunstreak<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:44.879> well<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.680> I<00:00:46.680> get<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
a 47 gunstreak as well and I get a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.190 
a 47 gunstreak as well and I get a
nuclear<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> first<00:00:48.629> round<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
nuclear just in the first round the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.990 
nuclear just in the first round the
second<00:00:49.559> round<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.890> shorter<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> first<00:00:50.820> one

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
second round is shorter the first one

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.220 
second round is shorter the first one
because<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.390> isn't<00:00:51.629> one<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.780> those<00:00:51.870> super

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
because this isn't one of those super

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.410 
because this isn't one of those super
long<00:00:52.500> games<00:00:52.860> where<00:00:53.280> both<00:00:53.820> rounds<00:00:54.059> are<00:00:54.270> five

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
long games where both rounds are five

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.110 
long games where both rounds are five
minutes<00:00:54.860> second<00:00:55.860> rounds<00:00:56.160> about<00:00:56.399> three

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
minutes second rounds about three

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.910 
minutes second rounds about three
minutes<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.570> think<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.109> there's<00:00:58.500> two<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.680> course

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
minutes I think so there's two of course

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.049 
minutes I think so there's two of course
a<00:00:59.160> little<00:00:59.579> bit<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.760> cap<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:01.789> then<00:01:02.789> I

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
a little bit of cap going on and then I

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.609 
a little bit of cap going on and then I
also<00:01:03.559> get<00:01:04.559> five<00:01:04.949> swarms<00:01:05.430> soap<00:01:05.610> into<00:01:05.850> swarms<00:01:06.360> so

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
also get five swarms soap into swarms so

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.410 
also get five swarms soap into swarms so
it's<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> pretty<00:01:07.830> long<00:01:08.549> list<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.210> achievements

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
it's a pretty long list of achievements

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.969 
it's a pretty long list of achievements
for<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.020> gameplay<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.560> think<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:10.830> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
for this gameplay and I think it's a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.469 
for this gameplay and I think it's a
really<00:01:11.280> good<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:11.670> guys<00:01:12.090> are<00:01:12.299> definitely

it's<00:03:06.010> so<00:03:06.220> simple<00:03:06.520> and<00:03:07.709> something<00:03:08.709> that<00:03:08.920> if<00:03:09.280> you

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
it's so simple and something that if you

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.270 
it's so simple and something that if you
watch<00:03:10.290> during<00:03:11.290> somebody's<00:03:11.530> livestream

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.890 
watch during somebody's livestream
you'll<00:03:12.760> notice<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.120> they're<00:03:13.330> constantly

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
you'll notice that they're constantly

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.229 
you'll notice that they're constantly

moving back and forth and that's not

just from scanning the map it's from

tool that you can use in call of duty

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.680 
tool that you can use in call of duty
because<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.799> reveals<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.489> position<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.180> your

enemies<00:03:35.670> constantly<00:03:36.670> in<00:03:36.970> so<00:03:37.269> many<00:03:37.480> different

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
enemies constantly in so many different

ways like when you've got a V set of
course<00:03:39.549> in<00:03:40.510> I<00:03:40.870> don't<00:03:41.080> stop<00:03:41.320> looking<00:03:41.709> at<00:03:41.980> my

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
course in I don't stop looking at my

look at my radar more than I look at the

look at my radar more than I look at the
actual<00:03:45.750> screen<00:03:46.750> I<00:03:46.959> just<00:03:47.470> constantly<00:03:48.040> looked

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
actual screen I just constantly looked

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.890 
actual screen I just constantly looked
at<00:03:48.459> my<00:03:48.610> radar<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.209> I<00:03:49.239> just<00:03:49.450> kind<00:03:49.630> of<00:03:49.690> run

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
at my radar and I just kind of run

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.170 
at my radar and I just kind of run
around<00:03:50.019> just<00:03:50.350> kind<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.650> it's<00:03:50.860> like<00:03:51.070> it's<00:03:52.030> in

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
around just kind of it's like it's in

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.970 
around just kind of it's like it's in
just<00:03:52.480> in<00:03:52.660> my<00:03:52.780> peripheral<00:03:53.200> vision<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.769> way<00:03:53.860> I'm

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
just in my peripheral vision the way I'm

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.500 
just in my peripheral vision the way I'm
running<00:03:54.010> around<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.519> map<00:03:54.700> I'm<00:03:54.970> looking<00:03:55.269> at

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
running around the map I'm looking at

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.940 
running around the map I'm looking at
the<00:03:55.570> radar<00:03:55.750> but<00:03:56.080> I'm<00:03:56.200> just<00:03:56.320> kind<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.590> guiding

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
the radar but I'm just kind of guiding

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.710 
the radar but I'm just kind of guiding
myself<00:03:57.310> around<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.670> map<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:58.150> at<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.540> same

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
myself around the map the at the same

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.759 
myself around the map the at the same
time<00:03:58.900> through<00:03:59.170> my<00:03:59.200> peripheral<00:03:59.739> vision

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
time through my peripheral vision

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.160 
time through my peripheral vision
because<00:04:00.610> I<00:04:00.880> know<00:04:01.120> where<00:04:01.330> every<00:04:01.630> single<00:04:01.900> person

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
because I know where every single person

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.600 
because I know where every single person
on<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.350> map<00:04:02.530> is<00:04:02.709> so<00:04:02.920> there's<00:04:03.100> no<00:04:03.250> reason<00:04:03.430> for

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
on the map is so there's no reason for

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.580 
on the map is so there's no reason for
me<00:04:03.670> to<00:04:03.730> not<00:04:03.970> look<00:04:04.180> away<00:04:04.299> from<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.660> radar<00:04:05.019> so

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
me to not look away from the radar so

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.100 
me to not look away from the radar so
you<00:04:06.280> know<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.700> looking<00:04:07.150> away<00:04:07.299> from<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.720> radar

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
you know and looking away from the radar

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.069 
you know and looking away from the radar
might<00:04:08.590> get<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.070> killed<00:04:09.190> because<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:10.510> enemies

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
might get you killed because the enemies

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.350 
might get you killed because the enemies
will<00:04:11.320> you<00:04:12.220> know<00:04:12.310> though<00:04:12.549> though<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:13.120> spawns

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
will you know though though the spawns

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.729 
will you know though though the spawns
can<00:04:13.570> be<00:04:13.660> pretty<00:04:13.870> crazy<00:04:14.140> sometimes<00:04:14.380> and<00:04:14.680> they

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
can be pretty crazy sometimes and they

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:15.900 
can be pretty crazy sometimes and they
might<00:04:14.890> flip<00:04:15.070> behind<00:04:15.310> us<00:04:15.489> you<00:04:15.519> got<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:15.820> keep

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
might flip behind us you got to keep

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.670 
might flip behind us you got to keep
your<00:04:16.030> where<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.359> stuff<00:04:16.570> and<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:17.349> only<00:04:17.500> time

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
your where and stuff and the only time

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.529 
your where and stuff and the only time
that<00:04:17.709> I<00:04:17.890> look<00:04:18.070> away<00:04:18.340> or<00:04:18.849> look<00:04:19.150> away<00:04:19.239> from<00:04:19.390> the

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
that I look away or look away from the

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.120 
that I look away or look away from the
radar<00:04:19.840> course<00:04:20.109> is<00:04:20.320> when<00:04:20.620> I'm<00:04:20.709> shooting<00:04:20.859> at<00:04:21.070> an

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
radar course is when I'm shooting at an

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.599 
radar course is when I'm shooting at an
enemy

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
enemy

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.100 
enemy
and<00:04:22.120> that's<00:04:22.360> what<00:04:22.539> really<00:04:22.569> helped<00:04:22.930> me<00:04:22.990> get

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
and that's what really helped me get

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.570 
and that's what really helped me get
this<00:04:23.259> flawless<00:04:23.680> of<00:04:23.800> course<00:04:24.009> because<00:04:24.219> you<00:04:24.490> know

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
this flawless of course because you know

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.149 
this flawless of course because you know
I<00:04:24.639> we<00:04:25.270> have<00:04:25.449> a<00:04:25.479> constant<00:04:26.080> ray<00:04:26.229> are<00:04:26.409> up<00:04:26.620> that's

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:27.159 
I we have a constant ray are up that's

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:30.510 
I we have a constant ray are up that's
what<00:04:27.930> keeps<00:04:28.930> you<00:04:29.050> from<00:04:29.199> dying<00:04:29.409> and<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:30.430> know

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
of course if there's time to be set up

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.439 
of course if there's time to be set up
and<00:04:32.379> you've<00:04:32.560> got<00:04:32.620> a<00:04:32.680> UAV<00:04:33.039> you<00:04:33.789> want<00:04:34.360> to

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
and you've got a UAV you want to

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.600 
and you've got a UAV you want to
constantly<00:04:34.810> check<00:04:35.259> that<00:04:35.560> as<00:04:35.740> well<00:04:36.069> because

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
constantly check that as well because

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.520 
constantly check that as well because
it's<00:04:37.150> constantly<00:04:37.659> scanning<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.379> you

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
it's constantly scanning and you

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.140 
it's constantly scanning and you
constituted<00:04:39.310> where<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.490> enemies<00:04:39.789> are<00:04:39.819> but

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
constituted where the enemies are but

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.610 
constituted where the enemies are but

don't let it fool you too much don't
rely<00:04:41.919> on<00:04:42.039> you<00:04:42.189> ate<00:04:42.340> too<00:04:42.729> much<00:04:42.969> because<00:04:43.569> there

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
rely on you ate too much because there

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.659 
rely on you ate too much because there
are<00:04:43.990> people<00:04:44.439> that<00:04:44.469> run<00:04:44.800> ghost<00:04:45.159> so<00:04:45.370> you<00:04:45.460> got<00:04:45.580> to

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
are people that run ghost so you got to

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.670 
are people that run ghost so you got to
watch<00:04:45.789> out<00:04:45.969> for<00:04:46.030> that<00:04:46.180> and<00:04:46.509> then<00:04:47.379> of<00:04:47.650> course

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
watch out for that and then of course

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.830 
watch out for that and then of course
one<00:04:48.069> of<00:04:48.099> the<00:04:48.219> biggest<00:04:48.400> things<00:04:48.729> is<00:04:49.000> the

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
one of the biggest things is the

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.399 
one of the biggest things is the
position<00:04:50.560> of<00:04:50.949> your<00:04:51.639> team<00:04:51.879> now<00:04:52.719> you<00:04:52.780> can<00:04:53.259> see

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
position of your team now you can see

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:55.589 
position of your team now you can see
the<00:04:53.530> green<00:04:53.770> triangles<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:54.550> where<00:04:55.180> are<00:04:55.360> they

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
the green triangles and where are they

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.469 
the green triangles and where are they
you<00:04:56.169> can<00:04:56.319> predict<00:04:56.770> that<00:04:57.129> based<00:04:57.939> on<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.270> spawn

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
you can predict that based on the spawn

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.119 
you can predict that based on the spawn
system<00:04:58.779> oh<00:04:59.110> by<00:04:59.409> the<00:04:59.439> way<00:04:59.560> look<00:04:59.800> at<00:04:59.889> all<00:05:00.009> these

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
in this build no god there's a swarm in

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.580 
in this build no god there's a swarm in
there<00:05:03.219> they<00:05:03.490> all<00:05:03.610> just<00:05:03.849> become<00:05:04.810> just<00:05:05.080> having<00:05:05.379> a

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
there they all just become just having a

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.730 
there they all just become just having a
freaking<00:05:06.719> meeting<00:05:07.719> in<00:05:07.870> there<00:05:08.050> about<00:05:08.259> what<00:05:08.590> to

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
freaking meeting in there about what to

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.379 
freaking meeting in there about what to
do<00:05:08.830> about<00:05:08.979> this<00:05:09.250> swarm<00:05:09.550> which<00:05:10.210> ultimately

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
do about this swarm which ultimately

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.809 
do about this swarm which ultimately
they<00:05:10.900> die<00:05:11.050> but<00:05:11.650> I<00:05:11.680> thought<00:05:12.219> it's<00:05:12.400> hilarious

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
they die but I thought it's hilarious

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:13.890 
they die but I thought it's hilarious
that<00:05:12.849> they're<00:05:13.090> all<00:05:13.300> just<00:05:13.509> sitting<00:05:13.689> by<00:05:13.840> the

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
that they're all just sitting by the

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.679 
that they're all just sitting by the
fires<00:05:14.199> when<00:05:14.500> chilly<00:05:14.740> outside<00:05:14.949> and<00:05:15.400> to<00:05:15.539> warm<00:05:16.539> up

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:16.689 
fires when chilly outside and to warm up

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:18.959 
fires when chilly outside and to warm up
what<00:05:17.229> now<00:05:17.830> whatever<00:05:18.069> I<00:05:18.250> warmed<00:05:18.610> them<00:05:18.699> up<00:05:18.789> with

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:18.969 
what now whatever I warmed them up with

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:21.649 
what now whatever I warmed them up with
death<00:05:19.240> so<00:05:19.840> anyway<00:05:20.229> I<00:05:20.259> wear<00:05:20.830> your<00:05:20.979> team<00:05:21.219> is

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
death so anyway I wear your team is

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.629 
death so anyway I wear your team is
that's<00:05:22.659> the<00:05:22.750> way<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:22.900> enemy<00:05:23.229> team<00:05:23.409> isn't<00:05:23.650> so

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
that's the way the enemy team isn't so

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:25.829 
that's the way the enemy team isn't so
you<00:05:24.669> can<00:05:24.879> pretty<00:05:25.060> much<00:05:25.150> keep<00:05:25.449> up<00:05:25.599> with<00:05:25.750> that

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:25.839 
you can pretty much keep up with that

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:27.329 
you can pretty much keep up with that
unless<00:05:26.050> you<00:05:26.169> have<00:05:26.289> really<00:05:26.319> bad<00:05:26.680> teammates<00:05:27.159> in

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:27.339 
unless you have really bad teammates in

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:29.129 
unless you have really bad teammates in
Cajun<00:05:27.639> aaliyah<00:05:27.789> there<00:05:28.089> might<00:05:28.300> be<00:05:28.330> a<00:05:28.509> enemy

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
Cajun aaliyah there might be a enemy

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.899 
Cajun aaliyah there might be a enemy
that's<00:05:29.349> like<00:05:29.529> sitting<00:05:30.009> with<00:05:30.219> your<00:05:30.430> teammate

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909 
that's like sitting with your teammate

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.629 
that's like sitting with your teammate
because<00:05:31.120> he's<00:05:31.240> that<00:05:31.479> dumb<00:05:31.690> but<00:05:32.639> ninety-five

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
because he's that dumb but ninety-five

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.459 
because he's that dumb but ninety-five
percent<00:05:33.879> of<00:05:34.180> the<00:05:34.240> time<00:05:34.419> where<00:05:34.839> your<00:05:35.020> team<00:05:35.229> is

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:35.469 
percent of the time where your team is

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:37.320 
percent of the time where your team is
the<00:05:35.680> enemy<00:05:35.949> isn't<00:05:36.159> so<00:05:36.699> you<00:05:36.789> can<00:05:36.940> know<00:05:37.089> that

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
the enemy isn't so you can know that

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.749 
the enemy isn't so you can know that
it's<00:05:37.449> basically<00:05:37.779> safe<00:05:38.139> in<00:05:38.409> that<00:05:38.440> area<00:05:38.860> and<00:05:39.219> you

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
it's basically safe in that area and you

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.209 
it's basically safe in that area and you
can<00:05:39.909> also<00:05:40.379> discern<00:05:41.379> from<00:05:41.620> that<00:05:41.830> where<00:05:42.069> the

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:42.219 
can also discern from that where the

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:44.010 
can also discern from that where the
enemy<00:05:42.460> team<00:05:42.639> is<00:05:42.819> spawning<00:05:43.150> and<00:05:43.389> spawned

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
enemy team is spawning and spawned

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.809 
enemy team is spawning and spawned
there's<00:05:44.289> such<00:05:44.469> a<00:05:44.500> huge<00:05:44.830> factor<00:05:45.219> in<00:05:45.460> getting

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:45.819 
there's such a huge factor in getting

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:48.059 
there's such a huge factor in getting
these<00:05:46.029> gameplays<00:05:46.509> and<00:05:46.560> working<00:05:47.560> them<00:05:47.770> so<00:05:48.039> that

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:48.069 
these gameplays and working them so that

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:51.659 
these gameplays and working them so that
you<00:05:48.310> can<00:05:48.520> maximize<00:05:48.789> your<00:05:49.539> kills<00:05:49.810> and<00:05:50.669> that's

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
you can maximize your kills and that's

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.540 
you can maximize your kills and that's
just<00:05:51.819> really<00:05:52.060> that's<00:05:52.509> the<00:05:52.750> whole<00:05:52.779> fuel<00:05:53.289> on<00:05:53.550> the

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
just really that's the whole fuel on the

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.249 
just really that's the whole fuel on the
radar<00:05:54.729> you<00:05:55.180> know<00:05:55.270> it's<00:05:55.479> something<00:05:55.870> that<00:05:56.050> I

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:56.259 
radar you know it's something that I

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:59.399 
radar you know it's something that I
kind<00:05:56.830> of<00:05:57.099> overlooked<00:05:57.939> when<00:05:58.689> telling<00:05:59.169> tips

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
kind of overlooked when telling tips

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.309 
kind of overlooked when telling tips
because<00:05:59.830> it's<00:06:00.250> something<00:06:00.520> that's<00:06:00.849> just<00:06:01.319> so

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
because it's something that's just so

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.860 
because it's something that's just so
it's<00:06:02.879> second<00:06:03.879> nature<00:06:03.909> for<00:06:04.180> me<00:06:04.389> it's<00:06:04.659> it's

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
it's second nature for me it's it's

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.679 
it's second nature for me it's it's
something<00:06:05.349> that<00:06:05.500> I'm<00:06:05.620> always<00:06:06.009> doing<00:06:06.879> it's

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:07.689 
something that I'm always doing it's

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:09.510 
something that I'm always doing it's
just<00:06:07.930> like<00:06:07.990> drop<00:06:08.319> shotting<00:06:08.620> I<00:06:08.919> drop<00:06:09.310> shotting

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
just like drop shotting I drop shotting

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.850 
just like drop shotting I drop shotting
I<00:06:09.699> never<00:06:09.909> consciously<00:06:10.509> drop<00:06:10.930> shot<00:06:11.169> I<00:06:11.319> just<00:06:11.500> do

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
I never consciously drop shot I just do

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.769 
I never consciously drop shot I just do
it<00:06:12.009> when<00:06:12.520> the<00:06:12.610> situation<00:06:12.789> comes<00:06:13.330> or<00:06:13.659> I'm

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:13.779 
it when the situation comes or I'm

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:15.809 
it when the situation comes or I'm
startled<00:06:14.199> or<00:06:14.319> something<00:06:14.680> I<00:06:14.830> will<00:06:15.430> just<00:06:15.610> drop

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:15.819 
startled or something I will just drop

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:17.999 
startled or something I will just drop
shot<00:06:16.120> and<00:06:16.389> that's<00:06:16.960> just<00:06:17.050> the<00:06:17.319> way<00:06:17.409> it<00:06:17.529> works<00:06:17.680> so

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:18.009 
shot and that's just the way it works so

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:20.670 
shot and that's just the way it works so
a<00:06:18.039> lot<00:06:18.400> of<00:06:18.430> this<00:06:18.729> second<00:06:19.659> nature<00:06:19.810> stuff<00:06:20.169> I<00:06:20.379> feel

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
a lot of this second nature stuff I feel

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.390 
a lot of this second nature stuff I feel
like<00:06:20.830> that<00:06:21.159> cod<00:06:21.819> veterans<00:06:22.270> already<00:06:22.599> do<00:06:22.750> is

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
like that cod veterans already do is
