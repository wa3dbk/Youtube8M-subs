twirl<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.370> guess<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.760> could<00:03:11.790> say<00:03:12.030> around<00:03:12.330> it

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
twirl I guess you could say around it

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.140 
twirl I guess you could say around it
and<00:03:12.810> this<00:03:13.320> is<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.560> not<00:03:13.830> so<00:03:14.220> good<00:03:14.820> one<00:03:15.000> because

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
and this is a not so good one because

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.300 
and this is a not so good one because
it's<00:03:15.390> like<00:03:15.540> no<00:03:15.750> curl<00:03:16.050> it<00:03:16.200> also<00:03:16.590> i<00:03:16.800> guess<00:03:17.190> i'll

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
it's like no curl it also i guess i'll

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.240 
it's like no curl it also i guess i'll
get<00:03:17.490> better<00:03:17.670> at<00:03:17.850> it<00:03:17.880> um<00:03:18.180> i<00:03:19.010> fluff<00:03:20.010> didn't
