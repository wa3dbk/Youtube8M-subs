hello I'm ivx flicker and today I'm
going<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.669> be<00:00:02.760> talking<00:00:02.909> about<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.240> new<00:00:03.389> world

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
going to be talking about the new world

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.720 
going to be talking about the new world
size<00:00:03.929> options<00:00:04.350> for<00:00:04.529> Minecraft<00:00:04.920> Xbox<00:00:05.069> one<00:00:05.490> and

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
size options for Minecraft Xbox one and

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.120 
size options for Minecraft Xbox one and
ps4<00:00:05.970> that<00:00:06.870> basically<00:00:07.200> allow<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.710> pick<00:00:07.980> a

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
ps4 that basically allow you to pick a

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.530 
ps4 that basically allow you to pick a
size<00:00:08.490> for<00:00:08.670> your<00:00:08.790> world<00:00:08.970> rather<00:00:09.240> than<00:00:09.420> being

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
size for your world rather than being

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.209 
size for your world rather than being
stuck<00:00:09.690> with<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.230> default<00:00:10.530> size<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:11.099> can

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
stuck with this the default size you can

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.009 
stuck with this the default size you can
go<00:00:11.309> anywhere<00:00:11.670> from<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:12.059> last<00:00:12.300> gen<00:00:12.540> size<00:00:12.780> all

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
go anywhere from the last gen size all

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.810 
go anywhere from the last gen size all
the<00:00:13.080> way<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.650> new<00:00:13.799> massive<00:00:14.190> 5<00:00:14.429> past<00:00:14.639> by

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
the way to the new massive 5 past by

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.820 
the way to the new massive 5 past by
5000<00:00:15.420> size<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:15.960> we<00:00:16.020> can<00:00:16.139> be<00:00:16.199> talking<00:00:16.350> about<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
5000 size so we can be talking about the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.740 
5000 size so we can be talking about the
actual<00:00:17.100> direct<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.880> know<00:00:17.940> sizes<00:00:18.390> for<00:00:18.539> all<00:00:18.570> of

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
actual direct you know sizes for all of

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.599 
actual direct you know sizes for all of
these<00:00:18.900> ones<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.410> terms<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.710> blocks<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.189> chunks

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
these ones in terms of blocks and chunks

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.130 
these ones in terms of blocks and chunks
because<00:00:21.000> we<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.270> two<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.510> them<00:00:21.600> confirmed<00:00:22.020> so

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
because we have two of them confirmed so

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.420 
because we have two of them confirmed so
we<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.350> kind<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.650> work<00:00:22.769> out<00:00:23.010> where<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.250> ones

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
we can kind of work out where the ones

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.890 
we can kind of work out where the ones
will<00:00:23.519> be<00:00:23.640> but<00:00:24.090> what<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.330> will<00:00:24.420> tell<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.689> why

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
will be but what it will tell you why

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.359 
will be but what it will tell you why
you<00:00:24.960> might<00:00:25.260> want<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.439> use<00:00:25.650> each<00:00:25.890> world<00:00:26.160> size

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
you might want to use each world size

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.980 
you might want to use each world size
over<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> up<00:00:26.820> ones<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.300> we'll<00:00:27.750> just<00:00:27.900> be

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
over the up ones and we'll just be

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.300 
over the up ones and we'll just be
talking<00:00:28.019> about<00:00:28.199> what<00:00:28.410> size<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.740> general<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.130> if

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
talking about what size in general so if

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.950 
talking about what size in general so if
you're<00:00:29.519> excited<00:00:29.820> about<00:00:29.970> next-gen<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.810> is

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
you're excited about next-gen this is

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.720 
you're excited about next-gen this is
probably<00:00:31.230> exciting<00:00:31.560> video<00:00:31.710> fuse<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.579> is

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
probably exciting video fuse so this is

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.940 
probably exciting video fuse so this is
using<00:00:32.910> Xbox<00:00:33.300> one<00:00:33.450> gameplay<00:00:33.660> from<00:00:33.840> e3<00:00:34.110> but<00:00:34.739> it

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
using Xbox one gameplay from e3 but it

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.040 
using Xbox one gameplay from e3 but it
probably<00:00:35.309> applies<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.850> ps4<00:00:36.120> two<00:00:36.450> at<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.719> exact

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
probably applies to ps4 two at the exact

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.740 
probably applies to ps4 two at the exact
same<00:00:37.260> level<00:00:37.590> because<00:00:38.149> it<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.510> know<00:00:39.600> it's

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
same level because it you know it's

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.660 
same level because it you know it's
limited<00:00:39.899> by<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.230> same<00:00:40.500> size<00:00:40.770> requirements<00:00:41.309> so

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
limited by the same size requirements so

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.369 
limited by the same size requirements so
this<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.940> all<00:00:42.090> very<00:00:42.239> similar<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.660> ps4<00:00:42.989> if<00:00:43.140> not

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
this is all very similar to ps4 if not

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.779 
this is all very similar to ps4 if not
the<00:00:43.469> same<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:43.860> let's<00:00:44.010> jump<00:00:44.250> right<00:00:44.340> into<00:00:44.610> it

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
the same but let's jump right into it

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.090 
the same but let's jump right into it
with<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.809> large<00:00:46.140> mold<00:00:46.469> size<00:00:46.649> because<00:00:46.950> that's

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
with the large mold size because that's

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.670 
with the large mold size because that's
the<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.340> you're<00:00:47.579> probably<00:00:47.879> excited<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
the one you're probably excited so the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.799 
the one you're probably excited so the
large<00:00:49.890> websites<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.180> saw<00:00:51.390> when<00:00:51.539> he<00:00:51.570> went

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
large websites as we saw when he went

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.360 
large websites as we saw when he went
into<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.530> know<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> game<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.160> spent

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
into you know a game and you spent

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.250 
into you know a game and you spent
always<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> edge<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.570> two<00:00:54.780> thousand<00:00:55.170> nine

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
always the edge is two thousand nine

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.290 
always the edge is two thousand nine
hundred<00:00:55.379> five<00:00:55.680> hundred<00:00:55.710> ninety<00:00:56.129> two<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:57.090> each

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
hundred five hundred ninety two in each

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.750 
hundred five hundred ninety two in each
direction<00:00:57.600> from<00:00:58.140> zero<00:00:58.410> zero<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.010> if<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.370> can't

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
direction from zero zero so if you can't

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.549 
direction from zero zero so if you can't
do<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.940> super<00:01:00.210> master<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:01.079> means<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.350> five

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
do the super master that means it's five

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.139 
do the super master that means it's five
thousand<00:01:01.949> one<00:01:02.039> hundred<00:01:02.160> eighty<00:01:02.460> four<00:01:02.730> by<00:01:02.910> five

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
thousand one hundred eighty four by five

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.000 
thousand one hundred eighty four by five
thousand<00:01:03.629> one<00:01:03.750> hundred<00:01:03.930> eighty<00:01:04.320> four<00:01:04.619> blocks

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
thousand one hundred eighty four blocks

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
thousand one hundred eighty four blocks
you<00:01:05.580> know<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.880> world<00:01:06.119> which<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.780> really

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
you know in a world which is really

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.080 
you know in a world which is really
really<00:01:07.470> really<00:01:07.890> big<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.790> put<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.030> in

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
really really big to put that in

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.880 
really really big to put that in
perspective<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.689> think<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.260> means<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.710> have

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
perspective I think that means you have

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.560 
perspective I think that means you have
to<00:01:11.040> make<00:01:11.189> about<00:01:11.580> five<00:01:11.970> Maps<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.479> each

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
to make about five Maps in each

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.719 
to make about five Maps in each
direction<00:01:12.750> from<00:01:13.170> your<00:01:13.350> starting<00:01:13.740> map<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.610> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
direction from your starting map just to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.460 
direction from your starting map just to
even<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.240> an<00:01:15.420> edge<00:01:15.540> which<00:01:16.140> means<00:01:16.350> you'll

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
even get to an edge which means you'll

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.410 
even get to an edge which means you'll
need<00:01:16.590> something<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.040> thirty<00:01:17.369> six<00:01:18.060> maybe

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
need something like thirty six maybe

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.840 
need something like thirty six maybe
more<00:01:18.540> Maps<00:01:19.080> total<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:19.950> ridiculous<00:01:20.580> how<00:01:20.700> many

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
more Maps total it's ridiculous how many

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.420 
more Maps total it's ridiculous how many
maps<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.090> need<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.299> get<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.540> edge<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.869> it's

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
maps you need to get the edge and it's

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.219 
maps you need to get the edge and it's
yeah<00:01:23.460> you're<00:01:24.450> not<00:01:24.570> going<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.750> explore<00:01:25.110> this

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
yeah you're not going to explore this

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.780 
yeah you're not going to explore this
everything<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:25.979> world<00:01:26.250> within<00:01:26.640> a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
everything in this world within a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.609 
everything in this world within a
reasonable<00:01:27.270> amount<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.450> time<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.840> survival<00:01:28.290> so

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
reasonable amount of time in survival so

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.080 
reasonable amount of time in survival so
this<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> world<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.310> want<00:01:29.460> if<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.700> want<00:01:29.909> a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
this is the world you want if you want a

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.580 
this is the world you want if you want a
you<00:01:30.329> know<00:01:30.450> big<00:01:30.630> as<00:01:30.780> well<00:01:30.930> as<00:01:31.020> possible<00:01:31.409> that's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
you know big as well as possible that's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.870 
you know big as well as possible that's
pretty<00:01:31.860> much<00:01:31.979> expansive<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.670> shows<00:01:32.790> you

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
pretty much expansive and shows you

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.819 
pretty much expansive and shows you
everything<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:34.079> give<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> quick<00:01:34.560> number

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
everything just give you a quick number

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.350 
everything just give you a quick number
in<00:01:34.890> terms<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.189> chunks<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.700> over<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.030> hundred

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
in terms of chunks it's over a hundred

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.999 
in terms of chunks it's over a hundred
thousand<00:01:36.780> chunks<00:01:37.049> wide<00:01:37.200> as<00:01:37.500> opposed<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
thousand chunks wide as opposed to the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.530 
thousand chunks wide as opposed to the
Xbox<00:01:38.159> 60s<00:01:38.640> two<00:01:38.850> thousand<00:01:39.240> nine<00:01:39.420> hundred

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
Xbox 60s two thousand nine hundred

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.050 
Xbox 60s two thousand nine hundred
chunks<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.950> yeah<00:01:41.130> there's<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.430> lot<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.729> stuff<00:01:41.909> be

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
chunks so yeah there's a lot of stuff be

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.030 
chunks so yeah there's a lot of stuff be
done<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.780> ever<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.409> any<00:01:43.680> size

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
done if you ever have any size

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.950 
done if you ever have any size
constraint<00:01:44.880> issues<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.299> Xbox<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.840> is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
constraint issues on Xbox this is

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.990 
constraint issues on Xbox this is
probably<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.560> want<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> go<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:47.070> you

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
probably the one you want to go for you

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.370 
probably the one you want to go for you
can<00:01:48.030> let<00:01:48.299> people<00:01:48.600> go<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> their<00:01:48.990> own<00:01:49.079> corners

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
can let people go to their own corners

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.230 
can let people go to their own corners
of<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.500> world<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.610> difficult<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.119> would

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
of the world and the difficult it would

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.810 
of the world and the difficult it would
be<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.420> get<00:01:51.720> which<00:01:51.930> side<00:01:52.200> would<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:53.040> very<00:01:53.369> very

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
be to get which side would be very very

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.499 
be to get which side would be very very
insane

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
insane

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.749 
insane
so<00:01:54.630> also<00:01:55.320> coming<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.950> presumably<00:01:56.460> would<00:01:56.700> be

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
so also coming this presumably would be

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.459 
so also coming this presumably would be
a<00:01:56.880> never<00:01:57.210> change<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.719> make<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> nether<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
a never change to make the nether the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.200 
a never change to make the nether the
same<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> PC<00:01:59.250> where<00:01:59.460> everyone<00:01:59.909> blocking

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
same as the PC where everyone blocking

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.880 
same as the PC where everyone blocking
the<00:02:00.270> number<00:02:00.450> sixteen<00:02:00.899> blocks<00:02:01.049> as<00:02:01.530> opposed<00:02:01.829> to

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the number sixteen blocks as opposed to

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.920 
the number sixteen blocks as opposed to
free<00:02:02.100> blocks<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.520> console<00:02:02.880> edition<00:02:03.210> it's

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
free blocks on the console edition it's

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.700 
free blocks on the console edition it's
gonna<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.170> interesting<00:02:04.320> actually<00:02:04.560> because

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
gonna be interesting actually because

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.719 
gonna be interesting actually because
the<00:02:04.920> neighbors<00:02:05.159> will<00:02:05.280> probably<00:02:05.520> have<00:02:05.610> been

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
the neighbors will probably have been

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.100 
the neighbors will probably have been
different<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.180> each<00:02:06.210> these<00:02:06.420> all<00:02:06.570> sizes<00:02:06.810> but

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
different for each these all sizes but

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.719 
different for each these all sizes but
yet<00:02:07.229> that's<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.560> large<00:02:07.710> boat<00:02:07.950> size<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
yet that's the large boat size it's the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.880 
yet that's the large boat size it's the
big<00:02:08.970> exciting<00:02:09.420> one<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.110> have<00:02:10.410> no<00:02:10.649> doubt

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
big exciting one that I have no doubt

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.250 
big exciting one that I have no doubt
that<00:02:10.920> most<00:02:11.580> people<00:02:12.000> be<00:02:12.150> using<00:02:12.450> most<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.780> time

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
that most people be using most the time

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.070 
that most people be using most the time
and<00:02:13.860> it's<00:02:14.280> probably<00:02:14.459> gonna<00:02:14.610> be<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.180> default

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
and it's probably gonna be the default

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.510 
and it's probably gonna be the default
you<00:02:16.349> know<00:02:16.440> kind<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.680> option<00:02:16.980> with<00:02:17.069> most<00:02:17.250> people

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
you know kind of option with most people

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.850 
you know kind of option with most people
so<00:02:18.180> next<00:02:18.420> we<00:02:18.660> have<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.870> classic<00:02:19.410> well<00:02:19.590> size

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
so next we have the classic well size

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.320 
so next we have the classic well size
the<00:02:20.099> other<00:02:20.130> world<00:02:20.520> size<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:20.940> actually<00:02:21.209> know

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
the other world size we actually know

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.510 
the other world size we actually know
directly<00:02:21.810> how<00:02:22.050> much<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:23.069> presumably

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
directly how much is this presumably

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.250 
directly how much is this presumably
means<00:02:23.819> classic<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:24.390> in<00:02:24.480> X<00:02:24.630> book<00:02:24.810> 60<00:02:25.170> because

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
means classic is in X book 60 because

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.290 
means classic is in X book 60 because
minecraft<00:02:25.650> pc<00:02:26.099> isn't<00:02:26.280> have<00:02:26.370> been<00:02:26.520> limited<00:02:26.640> so

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
minecraft pc isn't have been limited so

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.940 
minecraft pc isn't have been limited so
this<00:02:27.660> means<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.170> we're<00:02:28.260> gonna<00:02:28.349> get<00:02:28.530> an<00:02:28.709> 800

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
this means that we're gonna get an 800

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.280 
this means that we're gonna get an 800
64<00:02:29.640> by<00:02:29.760> hundred<00:02:30.030> 64<00:02:30.420> world<00:02:30.690> size<00:02:30.930> option

entire thing covered in stuff and yeah I

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.190 
entire thing covered in stuff and yeah I
think<00:02:47.519> this<00:02:48.030> mode<00:02:48.330> was<00:02:48.540> option<00:02:48.900> we'll<00:02:49.019> see<00:02:49.170> a

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
think this mode was option we'll see a

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.199 
think this mode was option we'll see a
lot<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.470> use<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.860> because<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.400> really<00:02:50.910> like<00:02:51.090> the

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
lot of use to because I really like the

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.640 
lot of use to because I really like the
fact<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.510> there's<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.840> limited<00:02:52.230> world<00:02:52.440> in

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
fact that there's a limited world in

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.530 
fact that there's a limited world in
some<00:02:53.190> cases<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.910> think<00:02:53.940> I'm<00:02:54.209> probably<00:02:54.330> gonna

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
some cases I think I'm probably gonna

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.479 
some cases I think I'm probably gonna
have<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.720> combination<00:02:55.019> three<00:02:55.380> worlds<00:02:55.650> but<00:02:56.340> this

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
have a combination three worlds but this

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.979 
have a combination three worlds but this
is<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.790> smallest<00:02:57.060> ball<00:02:57.299> size<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.900> again

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
is the smallest ball size and again

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.270 
is the smallest ball size and again
because<00:02:58.230> it's<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.500> other<00:02:58.620> side<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.890> spectrum

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
because it's the other side the spectrum

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.570 
because it's the other side the spectrum
probably<00:02:59.640> one<00:02:59.790> will<00:02:59.970> see<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.150> lot<00:03:00.299> of<00:03:00.330> use<00:03:00.540> from

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
probably one will see a lot of use from

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.240 
probably one will see a lot of use from
so<00:03:02.580> next<00:03:02.819> we're<00:03:03.690> gonna<00:03:03.780> go<00:03:04.019> for<00:03:04.319> small<00:03:04.799> so<00:03:05.220> I

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
so next we're gonna go for small so I

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.580 
so next we're gonna go for small so I
think<00:03:05.370> small<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.209> going<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:06.750> be<00:03:06.959> slightly

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
think small is going to be slightly

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.550 
think small is going to be slightly
bigger<00:03:07.920> than<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.610> classic<00:03:09.299> Technic<00:03:10.200> speaking

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
bigger than the classic Technic speaking

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.900 
bigger than the classic Technic speaking
but<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.010> still<00:03:11.220> means<00:03:11.340> it's<00:03:11.519> probably<00:03:11.610> be<00:03:11.880> a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
but it still means it's probably be a

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.250 
but it still means it's probably be a
lot<00:03:12.120> bigger<00:03:12.390> when<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.660> consider<00:03:12.959> how<00:03:13.230> much

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
lot bigger when you consider how much

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.140 
lot bigger when you consider how much
bigger<00:03:13.739> larges<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:14.519> assume<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:14.850> is<00:03:14.970> going

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
bigger larges so I assume this is going

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.660 
bigger larges so I assume this is going
to<00:03:15.239> be<00:03:15.330> maybe<00:03:15.540> double<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.170> size<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.709> classic

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
to be maybe double the size of classic

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.819 
to be maybe double the size of classic
so<00:03:17.880> we're<00:03:18.030> talking<00:03:18.120> 1600<00:03:18.900> by<00:03:18.989> 1600<00:03:19.590> blocks

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
so we're talking 1600 by 1600 blocks

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.650 
so we're talking 1600 by 1600 blocks
which<00:03:20.370> means<00:03:20.579> you<00:03:20.670> can<00:03:20.790> fit<00:03:20.880> four<00:03:21.209> Maps<00:03:21.450> you

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
which means you can fit four Maps you

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.030 
which means you can fit four Maps you
have<00:03:21.810> four<00:03:22.019> players<00:03:22.170> have<00:03:22.530> their<00:03:22.620> own<00:03:22.769> you

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
have four players have their own you

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.830 
have four players have their own you
know<00:03:23.160> X<00:03:23.340> 60<00:03:23.700> world<00:03:23.880> central<00:03:24.090> essentially<00:03:24.630> and

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
know X 60 world central essentially and

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.630 
know X 60 world central essentially and
I<00:03:25.320> would<00:03:25.590> imagine<00:03:25.739> this<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.400> can

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
I would imagine this is so you can

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.310 
I would imagine this is so you can
guarantee<00:03:26.940> every<00:03:27.510> world<00:03:27.690> will<00:03:27.840> have<00:03:27.959> one<00:03:28.230> of

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
guarantee every world will have one of

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.630 
guarantee every world will have one of
everything<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:28.829> you'll<00:03:28.950> definitely<00:03:29.340> have<00:03:29.430> one

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
everything so you'll definitely have one

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.160 
everything so you'll definitely have one
of<00:03:29.730> each<00:03:29.790> buyer<00:03:30.090> oh<00:03:30.329> you<00:03:30.750> know<00:03:30.840> almost

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
of each buyer oh you know almost

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.170 
of each buyer oh you know almost
definitely<00:03:31.530> as<00:03:32.190> well<00:03:32.430> as<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.670> desert<00:03:32.910> temples

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
definitely as well as the desert temples

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.000 
definitely as well as the desert temples
the<00:03:33.269> jungle<00:03:33.540> temple<00:03:33.870> but<00:03:34.200> still<00:03:34.470> have<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.650> small

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
the jungle temple but still have a small

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.630 
the jungle temple but still have a small
Explorer<00:03:35.730> or<00:03:35.910> completely<00:03:36.269> colonized<00:03:36.720> world

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
Explorer or completely colonized world

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.160 
Explorer or completely colonized world
that<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:38.730> can<00:03:38.910> actually<00:03:39.030> get<00:03:39.239> across<00:03:39.480> kinda

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
that you can actually get across kinda

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.270 
that you can actually get across kinda
like<00:03:40.260> if<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.470> saved<00:03:40.680> my<00:03:40.769> let's<00:03:40.950> play<00:03:41.070> world

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
like if you saved my let's play world

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.380 
like if you saved my let's play world
that<00:03:41.670> kind<00:03:41.820> of<00:03:41.910> thing<00:03:42.090> where<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.269> can

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
that kind of thing where you can

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.789 
that kind of thing where you can
actually<00:03:42.480> transport<00:03:43.200> across<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.470> entire<00:03:43.769> I

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
actually transport across the entire I

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.080 
actually transport across the entire I
think<00:03:44.010> like<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.190> rail<00:03:44.430> network<00:03:44.760> or<00:03:44.910> something

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
think like a rail network or something

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.270 
think like a rail network or something
without<00:03:45.930> having<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.380> go<00:03:46.470> through<00:03:46.500> ridiculous

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
without having to go through ridiculous

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.560 
without having to go through ridiculous
lengths<00:03:47.549> because<00:03:47.640> imagine<00:03:47.940> trying<00:03:48.329> to<00:03:48.420> use<00:03:48.510> a

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
lengths because imagine trying to use a

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.390 
lengths because imagine trying to use a
large<00:03:48.780> world<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.650> getting<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.950> rail<00:03:50.160> car

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
large world and getting a rail car

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.610 
large world and getting a rail car
across<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:50.970> that<00:03:51.299> it's<00:03:51.810> gonna<00:03:51.959> take<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.350> lot

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
across that that it's gonna take a lot

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.900 
across that that it's gonna take a lot
of<00:03:52.650> doing<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.130> in<00:03:53.370> multiplayer<00:03:53.640> it's

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
of doing and in multiplayer it's

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.460 
of doing and in multiplayer it's
essentially<00:03:54.359> just<00:03:54.420> not<00:03:54.810> gonna<00:03:54.959> work<00:03:55.260> because

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
essentially just not gonna work because

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.740 
essentially just not gonna work because
of<00:03:55.709> all<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:55.859> chunks<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.220> tap<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.519> load

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
of all the chunks you tap the load

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.150 
of all the chunks you tap the load
whereas<00:03:57.750> if<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:57.989> have<00:03:58.079> a<00:03:58.109> small<00:03:58.680> world<00:03:58.859> then

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
whereas if you have a small world then

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.860 
whereas if you have a small world then
you<00:03:59.459> get<00:03:59.670> kind<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.000> some<00:04:00.329> of<00:04:00.359> the<00:04:00.480> fun<00:04:00.600> of<00:04:00.630> that

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
you get kind of some of the fun of that

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.080 
you get kind of some of the fun of that
but<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.260> can<00:04:01.470> actually<00:04:01.650> get<00:04:01.890> across<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.370> while

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
but you can actually get across it while

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.759 
but you can actually get across it while
still<00:04:03.329> having<00:04:03.420> all<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:04.019> benefits<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.680> having

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
still having all the benefits of having

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.229 
still having all the benefits of having
a<00:04:04.950> larger<00:04:05.190> world<00:04:05.340> so<00:04:05.579> that's<00:04:05.819> where<00:04:06.090> it's

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
a larger world so that's where it's

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.569 
a larger world so that's where it's
these<00:04:06.359> small<00:04:06.510> fitting<00:04:06.900> in<00:04:07.220> into<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.340> actual

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
these small fitting in into the actual

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.370 
these small fitting in into the actual
grand<00:04:08.790> scheme<00:04:08.910> of<00:04:08.940> things<00:04:09.150> so<00:04:09.630> next<00:04:10.139> let's

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
grand scheme of things so next let's

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.750 
grand scheme of things so next let's
talk<00:04:10.530> about<00:04:10.590> medium<00:04:11.160> which<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.609> course

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
talk about medium which is of course

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.059 
talk about medium which is of course
between<00:04:11.970> small<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:12.480> large<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.290> I'd<00:04:13.889> imagine

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
between small and large and I'd imagine

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.400 
between small and large and I'd imagine
that<00:04:14.549> medium<00:04:14.880> is<00:04:15.000> going<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:15.720> be<00:04:15.870> again

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
that medium is going to be again

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
that medium is going to be again
somewhere<00:04:16.680> in<00:04:16.769> between<00:04:16.829> small<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.310> large

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
somewhere in between small and large

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.969 
somewhere in between small and large
like<00:04:17.729> just<00:04:18.000> as<00:04:18.810> far<00:04:19.049> as<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.169> numbers<00:04:19.380> go<00:04:19.530> which

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
like just as far as the numbers go which

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.860 
like just as far as the numbers go which
means<00:04:20.220> it's<00:04:20.340> gonna<00:04:20.400> be<00:04:20.579> roughly<00:04:20.970> 3,000<00:04:21.690> by

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
means it's gonna be roughly 3,000 by

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.899 
means it's gonna be roughly 3,000 by
3,000<00:04:22.530> assuming<00:04:22.830> these<00:04:22.950> numbers<00:04:23.520> are<00:04:23.700> pretty

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
3,000 assuming these numbers are pretty

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.629 
3,000 assuming these numbers are pretty
accurate<00:04:24.229> because<00:04:25.229> that<00:04:25.680> gives<00:04:25.890> you<00:04:26.099> a<00:04:26.130> real

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
accurate because that gives you a real

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.749 
accurate because that gives you a real
the<00:04:26.729> really<00:04:27.300> large<00:04:27.479> world<00:04:27.870> I<00:04:28.580> think<00:04:29.580> is<00:04:29.669> an

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
the really large world I think is an

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.429 
the really large world I think is an
insane<00:04:30.060> amount<00:04:30.090> blocks<00:04:30.479> that<00:04:31.169> you<00:04:31.259> can

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:31.439 
insane amount blocks that you can

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.890 
insane amount blocks that you can
explore<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:32.249> get<00:04:32.939> to<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.150> edge<00:04:33.270> off<00:04:33.509> but<00:04:33.780> you

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
explore and get to the edge off but you

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.200 
explore and get to the edge off but you
can't<00:04:34.199> really<00:04:34.560> ever<00:04:34.909> understand<00:04:35.909> the<00:04:35.999> entire

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
can't really ever understand the entire

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.059 
can't really ever understand the entire
thing<00:04:36.449> that<00:04:36.810> fit<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.139> entire<00:04:37.439> thing<00:04:37.710> in<00:04:37.830> about

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
thing that fit the entire thing in about

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.580 
thing that fit the entire thing in about
you<00:04:38.310> know<00:04:38.400> I<00:04:38.639> think<00:04:39.240> nine<00:04:39.479> Maps<00:04:39.810> so<00:04:40.110> it's<00:04:40.289> it's

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
you know I think nine Maps so it's it's

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.200 
you know I think nine Maps so it's it's
fairly<00:04:40.860> small<00:04:41.129> as<00:04:41.219> far<00:04:41.370> as<00:04:41.460> that<00:04:41.550> goes<00:04:41.610> but

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
fairly small as far as that goes but

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.730 
fairly small as far as that goes but
there's<00:04:42.360> still<00:04:42.509> so<00:04:42.870> much<00:04:43.080> in<00:04:43.139> each<00:04:43.439> one<00:04:43.650> of

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
there's still so much in each one of

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.100 
there's still so much in each one of
those<00:04:43.830> maps<00:04:44.129> that<00:04:44.629> you're<00:04:45.629> gonna<00:04:45.719> require<00:04:46.050> a

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
those maps that you're gonna require a

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.629 
those maps that you're gonna require a
lot<00:04:46.319> of<00:04:46.349> stuff<00:04:46.620> if<00:04:46.979> you're<00:04:47.129> gonna<00:04:47.219> explore<00:04:47.550> it

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
lot of stuff if you're gonna explore it

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.040 
lot of stuff if you're gonna explore it
all<00:04:47.729> I<00:04:47.999> guess<00:04:48.509> this<00:04:48.659> would<00:04:48.719> be<00:04:48.840> for<00:04:48.990> a

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
all I guess this would be for a

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.149 
all I guess this would be for a
multiplayer<00:04:49.409> project<00:04:49.770> if<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:49.919> want<00:04:50.099> to

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
multiplayer project if you want to

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:52.730 
multiplayer project if you want to
entirely<00:04:50.849> cover<00:04:51.300> the<00:04:51.449> entire<00:04:51.719> thing<00:04:51.749> you<00:04:52.590> can

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
entirely cover the entire thing you can

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.379 
entirely cover the entire thing you can
kind<00:04:53.039> of<00:04:53.099> have<00:04:53.249> your<00:04:53.340> stuff<00:04:53.669> separate<00:04:54.180> but

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
kind of have your stuff separate but

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.600 
kind of have your stuff separate but
connected<00:04:54.620> while<00:04:55.620> still<00:04:55.860> feeling<00:04:56.189> like<00:04:56.310> kind

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
connected while still feeling like kind

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.969 
connected while still feeling like kind
of<00:04:56.819> apart<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.509> don't<00:04:57.990> know<00:04:58.169> that<00:04:58.379> it's<00:04:58.680> it's

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
of apart I don't know that it's it's

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.649 
of apart I don't know that it's it's
hard<00:04:59.189> to<00:04:59.279> see<00:04:59.400> entirely<00:04:59.879> these<00:05:00.150> four<00:05:00.419> medium

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
hard to see entirely these four medium

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:01.999 
hard to see entirely these four medium
and<00:05:00.930> small<00:05:01.229> but<00:05:01.349> I'm<00:05:01.469> just<00:05:01.590> trying<00:05:01.830> to<00:05:01.860> come<00:05:01.979> up

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
and small but I'm just trying to come up

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.640 
and small but I'm just trying to come up
with<00:05:02.069> now<00:05:02.430> so<00:05:03.360> yeah<00:05:03.509> that's<00:05:03.779> all<00:05:04.259> the<00:05:04.500> world

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
with now so yeah that's all the world

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.619 
with now so yeah that's all the world
sizes<00:05:05.099> and<00:05:05.279> what<00:05:05.490> I<00:05:05.520> think<00:05:05.849> saw<00:05:06.029> me<00:05:06.180> can<00:05:06.330> be<00:05:06.479> as

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:06.629 
sizes and what I think saw me can be as

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:08.179 
sizes and what I think saw me can be as
well<00:05:06.810> as<00:05:06.840> what<00:05:06.960> we<00:05:07.169> know<00:05:07.199> classic<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:08.009> large

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:08.189 
well as what we know classic and large

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:10.369 
well as what we know classic and large
will<00:05:08.340> be<00:05:08.460> let<00:05:09.180> me<00:05:09.240> know<00:05:09.360> what<00:05:09.689> you<00:05:09.840> guys<00:05:09.990> think

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:10.379 
will be let me know what you guys think

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.649 
will be let me know what you guys think
you'll<00:05:10.740> be<00:05:10.830> using<00:05:10.979> because<00:05:11.449> I've<00:05:12.449> been

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
you'll be using because I've been

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.110 
you'll be using because I've been
considering<00:05:13.229> it<00:05:13.439> and<00:05:13.710> I<00:05:13.919> really<00:05:14.819> think<00:05:14.909> what<00:05:15.090> I

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
considering it and I really think what I

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.909 
considering it and I really think what I
prefer<00:05:15.419> is<00:05:15.629> honestly<00:05:16.080> a<00:05:16.169> smaller<00:05:16.469> size<00:05:16.710> than

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
prefer is honestly a smaller size than

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.589 
prefer is honestly a smaller size than
classic<00:05:17.340> for<00:05:17.520> doing<00:05:17.789> my<00:05:17.939> multiplayer<00:05:18.360> stuff

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
classic for doing my multiplayer stuff

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.079 
classic for doing my multiplayer stuff

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:33.509 
you have to build a bedrock all around

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:34.939 
you have to build a bedrock all around
it<00:05:33.659> which<00:05:33.810> is<00:05:33.960> pretty<00:05:34.169> really<00:05:34.409> ethical<00:05:34.500> and

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:38.990 
you know just having the world automatic
you<00:05:37.229> cut<00:05:37.409> up<00:05:37.620> could<00:05:37.860> seem<00:05:38.099> like<00:05:38.129> a<00:05:38.460> much<00:05:38.729> much

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
you cut up could seem like a much much

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.659 
you cut up could seem like a much much
easier<00:05:39.110> tactic<00:05:40.110> we'll<00:05:40.800> have<00:05:40.889> to<00:05:41.009> see<00:05:41.189> if<00:05:41.219> they

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
easier tactic we'll have to see if they

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.459 
easier tactic we'll have to see if they
do<00:05:41.729> open<00:05:42.060> that<00:05:42.419> side<00:05:42.659> ty<00:05:42.960> you<00:05:43.020> doubt<00:05:43.229> they<00:05:43.379> will

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:43.469 
do open that side ty you doubt they will

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:45.829 
do open that side ty you doubt they will
bloke<00:05:43.740> very<00:05:44.009> much<00:05:44.189> like<00:05:44.399> that<00:05:44.610> now<00:05:45.029> again<00:05:45.509> let

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:45.839 
bloke very much like that now again let

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:46.999 
bloke very much like that now again let
me<00:05:45.870> know<00:05:45.960> what<00:05:46.080> you<00:05:46.139> says<00:05:46.349> you<00:05:46.529> will<00:05:46.680> probably

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
me know what you says you will probably

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.429 
me know what you says you will probably
be<00:05:47.129> using<00:05:47.509> for<00:05:48.509> survival<00:05:49.020> I'm<00:05:49.110> probably<00:05:49.259> is

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:49.439 
be using for survival I'm probably is

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:50.959 
be using for survival I'm probably is
gonna<00:05:49.589> have<00:05:49.740> large<00:05:50.069> world<00:05:50.370> so<00:05:50.580> I<00:05:50.639> can<00:05:50.669> be<00:05:50.849> like

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:50.969 
gonna have large world so I can be like

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:53.629 
gonna have large world so I can be like
eh<00:05:51.149> that's<00:05:51.779> that's<00:05:52.169> a<00:05:52.289> fair<00:05:52.529> need<00:05:52.740> right<00:05:52.949> for

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
eh that's that's a fair need right for

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:54.980 
eh that's that's a fair need right for
creative<00:05:54.060> I<00:05:54.240> probably<00:05:54.539> just<00:05:54.750> be<00:05:54.839> using

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
creative I probably just be using

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.649 
creative I probably just be using
classic<00:05:55.469> or<00:05:55.589> small<00:05:55.919> because<00:05:56.189> I<00:05:57.120> can't<00:05:57.569> imagine

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:57.659 
classic or small because I can't imagine

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:59.659 
classic or small because I can't imagine
you<00:05:58.020> ever<00:05:58.199> needing<00:05:58.649> to<00:05:58.680> use<00:05:59.039> that<00:05:59.250> world<00:05:59.460> size

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
you ever needing to use that world size

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.790 
you ever needing to use that world size
to<00:05:59.819> creative<00:06:00.210> because<00:06:00.539> even<00:06:00.899> in<00:06:01.050> a<00:06:01.169> current

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
to creative because even in a current

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.309 
to creative because even in a current
microbe<00:06:02.610> Dexter<00:06:02.849> sixty<00:06:03.149> world<00:06:03.330> if<00:06:03.509> you<00:06:03.930> craft

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 
microbe Dexter sixty world if you craft

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:05.990 
microbe Dexter sixty world if you craft
over<00:06:04.560> the<00:06:04.740> entire<00:06:05.039> thing<00:06:05.279> that's<00:06:05.550> all<00:06:05.759> a<00:06:05.789> lot

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
over the entire thing that's all a lot

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.420 
over the entire thing that's all a lot
of<00:06:06.089> crafting<00:06:06.599> maybe<00:06:07.500> it's<00:06:07.680> so<00:06:07.860> your<00:06:08.039> friends

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
of crafting maybe it's so your friends

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.309 
of crafting maybe it's so your friends
can<00:06:08.580> have<00:06:08.729> separate<00:06:09.149> grits<00:06:09.419> and<00:06:09.629> creative<00:06:10.080> but

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 
can have separate grits and creative but

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.540 
can have separate grits and creative but
really<00:06:10.620> I<00:06:10.649> don't<00:06:10.860> see<00:06:11.039> the<00:06:11.159> useful<00:06:11.399> for

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
really I don't see the useful for

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.119 
really I don't see the useful for
outside<00:06:11.879> a<00:06:11.909> create<00:06:12.240> a<00:06:12.270> survival<00:06:12.919> it<00:06:13.919> just

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:14.129 
outside a create a survival it just

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:16.249 
outside a create a survival it just
seems<00:06:14.520> like<00:06:14.610> you'd<00:06:14.819> get<00:06:15.000> lost<00:06:15.180> a<00:06:15.449> lot<00:06:15.750> lot<00:06:16.020> more

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
seems like you'd get lost a lot lot more

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.070 
seems like you'd get lost a lot lot more
so<00:06:17.250> here's<00:06:17.430> one<00:06:17.969> fun<00:06:18.180> thing<00:06:18.360> about<00:06:18.389> this<00:06:18.750> is<00:06:18.810> if

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
so here's one fun thing about this is if

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.570 
so here's one fun thing about this is if
you<00:06:19.199> enjoy<00:06:19.500> a<00:06:19.529> friends<00:06:19.860> world<00:06:20.099> the<00:06:20.279> problem

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
you enjoy a friends world the problem

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.920 
you enjoy a friends world the problem
where<00:06:20.759> you<00:06:20.939> currently<00:06:21.120> spawn<00:06:21.539> like<00:06:21.719> in<00:06:21.839> the

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
where you currently spawn like in the

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.240 
where you currently spawn like in the
middle<00:06:22.169> all<00:06:22.289> the<00:06:22.439> way<00:06:22.529> away<00:06:22.649> from<00:06:22.740> where<00:06:22.889> he<00:06:23.099> is

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
middle all the way away from where he is

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.490 
middle all the way away from where he is
that<00:06:23.879> gets<00:06:24.000> a<00:06:24.060> lot<00:06:24.210> worse<00:06:24.270> now<00:06:24.719> because<00:06:25.169> if<00:06:25.409> you

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
that gets a lot worse now because if you

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.779 
that gets a lot worse now because if you
think<00:06:25.680> about<00:06:25.740> if<00:06:25.919> he's<00:06:26.069> all<00:06:26.399> the<00:06:26.550> way<00:06:26.639> at<00:06:26.759> the

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
think about if he's all the way at the

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.540 
think about if he's all the way at the
edge<00:06:26.969> of<00:06:27.289> 2500<00:06:28.289> blocks<00:06:28.469> away<00:06:28.620> that's<00:06:29.250> gonna<00:06:29.399> be

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
edge of 2500 blocks away that's gonna be

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.369 
edge of 2500 blocks away that's gonna be
a<00:06:29.580> real<00:06:29.789> fun<00:06:30.060> trick<00:06:30.330> to<00:06:30.479> make<00:06:30.629> at<00:06:30.839> nighttime

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:31.379
