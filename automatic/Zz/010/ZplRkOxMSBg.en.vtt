00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.830
 since October in so that's it 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.580
 left 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:21.689
 so first there are two doors 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.949
 so a smooth there there like that one in 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.480
 water 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:30.830
 and then a down there and even a full 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.290
 so we will start from below 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.000
 then here we have the ball 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.629
 sand for them to wash themselves 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.989
 disinfects removes bacteria next 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.930
 and if we have their cac 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.730
 and its rows anyway but 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.680
 love you can not change it 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.309
 so here and if we have a small 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.030
 ladder there that arrives on the first floor 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:02.129
 so here we have a ruble for 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.650
 they let off steam a little bit like 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:10.409

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.750
 the one on the second floor 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:20.970
 so here we have the bottle of water 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:23.040
 do you like flying ntamack tidying a hammock 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.960

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.960
 a little not spice the another one 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:33.790
 there for them to put on the bottom 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.240
 we have a little toy 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.870
 to arrange next to a year before m from 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.480
 climbing wall here and there there was 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.210

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.420
 tidy up to his old but he loves 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.900
 then a little pop third scale that 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.570
 arrive on the third floor 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.330
 so here we have two bowls a 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.020
 small bowl and a big bowl the 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.160
 big bowl 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.960
 you will tell yourself why 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.720
 bowls already owed nor 102 and secondly 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.350
 but he adores allies dance put in 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.090

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.370
 a lot of things here and here we have 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.030
 a little hen young they love 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.680
 go for a look at the men you have 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:34.510
 they do that the up the wii and where does a 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:42.370
 little bit the demonstration that's it 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:47.019
 it's felix hop there so here I am 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.840
 start here the ball the hut then 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.510
 the blue road the bottle the little wood 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.090
 tidy the hammock the two ladders the wall 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.890
 climbed the mud john and both 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.680
 small bowls with two bimbos 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.680
 of course is clear and felix in full 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.810
 so here is the first part is 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.390
 completed now i'm going to move on to 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.540
 everything that is all that is 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.660
 essential for the cage so for the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.930
 change of the cage so at all of 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.420
 after 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.640
 so that's all that's essential 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.769
 for the cage then we will start 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.170
 so here we have a cozy nest 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.380
 for the winter very very very soft and 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:38.350
 very very hot kitchen then here we 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:40.510
 have a cage disinfectant here very 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.500
 as well as they illustrate themselves in very 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.430
 well and if we have 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.320
 the chila sand getting it's the same and 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.640
 if we have the chips then the 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.180
 wooden grameen litter this is 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.250
 much better 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.830
 there are three it's too much more 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.570
 absorbent three times more effective 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.860
 in odor retention and three 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.209
 times less dust 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.610
 it's true I prefer the better it goes 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.170
 than compared to the cuts of wood when 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.340
 he sells dance to a crazy a little bit 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.100
 from wherever you are the cage and that's 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.380
 pretty unpleasant must clean all the 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.250
 time so here it is much better and 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.790
 if we have the carrying case 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.709
 which is great for me that I love 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.810
 which is very practical is very small 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.790
 but the two of them come back 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.320
 a lot it is very very very practical 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.200
 very beautiful cage 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:35.360
 I find for the price very very beautiful 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:39.410
 then and if we have a box where he 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:44.780
 y to the natural straw of the national weight 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:47.990
 I mean natural weight with 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.790
 little natural treats with sounds 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.950
 powerful apples with no added sugar 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:05:03.430
 in place is fine here we have the 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:03.430
 seeds for their complete meal here 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.789
 then going to the last last 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:18.479
 box a little box 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:24.060
 so here we have three tubes rang 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:26.219
 to tidy up my nuts they 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.110
 arrive very well to break itself the 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.090
 have eaten in this box 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:34.830
 if I can open it it would be rather 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:42.409
 well here we have little tips 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:46.460
 of two dry bananas and finally we have 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:47.849
 hazelnuts already opened and 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.419
 raisins 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:52.590
 he loves the raisin he has left without 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.509
 he loves it 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:06:03.020
 here it is I'll eat after that so here we go 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:06.469
 already essential for the cage and that's it 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.909
 that's it for this video 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:11.009
