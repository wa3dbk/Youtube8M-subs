00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.260 
clan wars attack strategy for townhall 7
this<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.230> actually<00:00:16.830> from<00:00:17.310> back<00:00:17.609> when<00:00:17.640> right

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
this is actually from back when right

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.990 
this is actually from back when right
after<00:00:18.539> clan<00:00:18.990> wars<00:00:19.230> started<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.789> was

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
after clan wars started and this was

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.820 
after clan wars started and this was
actually<00:00:21.240> before<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.810> even<00:00:22.170> started<00:00:22.619> using

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
actually before I even started using

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.720 
actually before I even started using
Dragons<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.600> was<00:00:24.960> actually<00:00:25.310> still<00:00:26.310> only

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
Dragons so I was actually still only

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.250 
Dragons so I was actually still only
using<00:00:27.000> giants<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.449> healers<00:00:27.720> at<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.019> point

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
using giants and healers at this point

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.500 
using giants and healers at this point
and<00:00:28.500> that's<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.580> reason<00:00:29.970> why<00:00:30.090> I'm<00:00:30.330> actually

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
and that's the reason why I'm actually

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.600 
and that's the reason why I'm actually
only<00:00:30.810> going<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.050> be<00:00:31.109> showing<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.529> one<00:00:32.160> raid<00:00:32.399> in

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
only going to be showing you one raid in

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.870 
only going to be showing you one raid in
this<00:00:32.730> video<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.809> only<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.610> clan<00:00:35.610> wars

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
this video this is the only of clan wars

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.040 
this video this is the only of clan wars
video<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.840> have<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.800> raid<00:00:38.010> where<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.809> was<00:00:39.809> not

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
video I have of a raid where I was not

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.030 
video I have of a raid where I was not
using<00:00:40.290> dragons<00:00:40.820> so<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.170> definitely

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
using dragons so this is definitely

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.350 
using dragons so this is definitely
going<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.520> different<00:00:44.760> from<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:44.940> you've

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
going to be different from what you've

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.299 
going to be different from what you've
been<00:00:45.629> seeing<00:00:45.960> from<00:00:46.469> all<00:00:46.590> my<00:00:46.680> other<00:00:46.710> recent

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
been seeing from all my other recent

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.180 
been seeing from all my other recent
uploads<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.289> what<00:00:49.289> I'm<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> do<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.039> is

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
uploads and what I'm going to do here is

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.520 
uploads and what I'm going to do here is
send<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.059> Giants<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.840> take<00:00:52.199> out<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> air

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
send in Giants to take out the air

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.010 
send in Giants to take out the air
defense<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.460> did<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.420> my<00:00:54.539> townhall

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
defense like I did with all my townhall

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.920 
defense like I did with all my townhall
six<00:00:55.820> giant<00:00:56.820> healer<00:00:57.149> videos<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:57.809> I've

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
six giant healer videos and then I've

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.380 
six giant healer videos and then I've
got<00:00:58.109> three<00:00:58.140> healers<00:00:58.949> three<00:00:59.820> level<00:01:00.239> two

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
got three healers three level two

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.500 
got three healers three level two
healers<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.550> totally<00:01:02.550> forgot<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.910> lure<00:01:03.329> out

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
healers so I totally forgot to lure out

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.479 
healers so I totally forgot to lure out
the<00:01:03.629> clan<00:01:03.840> castle<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.439> attack<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.979> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the clan castle in this attack and it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.580 
the clan castle in this attack and it
doesn't<00:01:05.909> even<00:01:05.970> matter<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.780> those<00:01:07.290> three

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
doesn't even matter because those three

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.770 
doesn't even matter because those three
healers<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.280> enough<00:01:08.580> power<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.000> save<00:01:09.600> my

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
healers have enough power to save my

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.539 
healers have enough power to save my
Giants<00:01:10.200> despite<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> fact<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.159> dragon

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
Giants despite the fact that the dragon

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.469 
Giants despite the fact that the dragon
was<00:01:12.049> breathing<00:01:13.049> fire<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.530> them<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:15.060> then<00:01:15.330> I

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
was breathing fire on them and then I

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.080 
was breathing fire on them and then I
also<00:01:15.659> do<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.710> dragon<00:01:17.549> from<00:01:17.670> my<00:01:17.729> clan

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
also do have a dragon from my clan

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.499 
also do have a dragon from my clan
castle<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.369> I<00:01:20.369> deploy<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.330> this

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
castle and I deploy that and this

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.760 
castle and I deploy that and this
actually<00:01:21.840> might<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.080> one<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> reasons<00:01:22.530> I

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
actually might be one of the reasons I

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.520 
actually might be one of the reasons I
started<00:01:22.979> using<00:01:23.250> dragons<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:23.939> much<00:01:24.119> was

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
started using dragons so much was

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.289 
started using dragons so much was
watching<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.710> dragon<00:01:26.100> do<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:27.000> work<00:01:27.270> like

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
watching this dragon do do work like

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.880 
watching this dragon do do work like
crazy<00:01:27.780> around<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.920> base<00:01:30.110> but<00:01:31.110> yeah<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
crazy around the base but yeah it's a

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.649 
crazy around the base but yeah it's a
pretty<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.340> pretty<00:01:32.670> standard<00:01:33.180> giant<00:01:33.479> healer

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
pretty a pretty standard giant healer

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.700 
pretty a pretty standard giant healer
attack<00:01:34.189> I<00:01:35.720> also<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:36.990> barb<00:01:37.170> King<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
attack I also have the barb King and the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.980 
attack I also have the barb King and the
healers<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.130> obviously<00:01:38.490> also<00:01:38.689> do<00:01:39.689> work<00:01:39.840> on

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
healers can obviously also do work on

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.350 
healers can obviously also do work on
the<00:01:40.110> barb<00:01:40.290> King<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:41.610> that's<00:01:41.820> something<00:01:42.030> else

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the barb King so that's something else

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.130 
the barb King so that's something else
to<00:01:42.720> think<00:01:42.990> about<00:01:43.229> when<00:01:43.890> you're<00:01:44.009> using<00:01:44.220> a

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
to think about when you're using a

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.880 
to think about when you're using a
healer<00:01:46.159> related<00:01:47.159> strategy<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.799> so<00:01:50.000> it<00:01:51.000> really

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
healer related strategy and so it really

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.480 
healer related strategy and so it really
it<00:01:52.890> really<00:01:53.159> was<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> pretty<00:01:54.710> pretty<00:01:55.710> simple<00:01:56.219> and

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
it really was a pretty pretty simple and

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.850 
it really was a pretty pretty simple and
expected<00:01:58.490> style<00:01:58.940> of<00:01:59.360> attack<00:01:59.870> as<00:02:00.140> far<00:02:00.440> as<00:02:00.560> giant

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
expected style of attack as far as giant

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.700 
expected style of attack as far as giant
healer<00:02:01.040> attacks<00:02:01.370> go<00:02:01.580> I<00:02:02.450> guess<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.590> other

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
healer attacks go I guess the other

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.260 
healer attacks go I guess the other
thing<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:04.040> should<00:02:04.100> mention<00:02:04.310> is<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.820> I<00:02:04.880> did<00:02:05.090> use

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
thing I should mention is that I did use

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.820 
thing I should mention is that I did use
three<00:02:05.540> lightning<00:02:05.870> to<00:02:05.960> take<00:02:06.110> out<00:02:06.230> the<00:02:06.380> other

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
three lightning to take out the other

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.160 
three lightning to take out the other
air<00:02:07.040> defense<00:02:07.310> in<00:02:07.490> there<00:02:07.899> similar<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.020> what<00:02:09.110> I

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
air defense in there similar to what I

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.990 
air defense in there similar to what I
do<00:02:09.229> with<00:02:09.440> dragons<00:02:09.979> always<00:02:10.460> using<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.820> three

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
do with dragons always using the three

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.890 
do with dragons always using the three
lightning<00:02:11.240> spells<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.510> take<00:02:11.660> out<00:02:11.750> an<00:02:11.840> air

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
lightning spells to take out an air

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.130 
lightning spells to take out an air
defense<00:02:12.490> obviously<00:02:13.490> in<00:02:14.060> this<00:02:14.210> case<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.660> was<00:02:14.840> to

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
defense obviously in this case it was to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.450 
defense obviously in this case it was to
protect<00:02:15.530> my<00:02:15.860> healers<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:18.110> that<00:02:18.290> my<00:02:19.040> units

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
protect my healers so that my units

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.370 
protect my healers so that my units
would<00:02:19.640> be<00:02:19.760> able<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:20.030> stay<00:02:20.600> alive<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.110> could

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
would be able to stay alive and I could

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.900 
would be able to stay alive and I could
continue<00:02:21.800> running<00:02:22.070> through<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.430> base<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.790> get

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
continue running through the base to get

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.710 
continue running through the base to get
that<00:02:23.120> hundred<00:02:23.390> percent<00:02:23.420> victory<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:25.720> that's

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
that hundred percent victory and that's

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.360 
that hundred percent victory and that's
what<00:02:27.020> I<00:02:27.050> did<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.440> now<00:02:27.800> we're<00:02:27.980> just<00:02:28.130> going<00:02:28.310> to

what I did and now we're just going to
kind<00:02:28.760> of<00:02:28.790> fast-forward<00:02:29.330> through<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.630> end

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
kind of fast-forward through the end

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.870 
kind of fast-forward through the end

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.820 
wars you don't have to use the dragon
strategy<00:02:44.270> but<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.720> don't<00:02:45.260> think<00:02:45.440> it's<00:02:45.560> as<00:02:45.680> good

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
strategy but I don't think it's as good

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.920 
strategy but I don't think it's as good
as<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.070> dragon<00:02:46.370> strategy<00:02:46.850> I<00:02:47.030> don't<00:02:47.690> think

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
as the dragon strategy I don't think

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:48.820 
as the dragon strategy I don't think
you're<00:02:48.020> going<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.200> be<00:02:48.260> able<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:48.440> take<00:02:48.650> down

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830
