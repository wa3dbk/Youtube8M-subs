with<00:00:32.759> all<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.899> playing<00:00:34.170> I've<00:00:34.350> been<00:00:34.380> doing

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
with all the playing I've been doing

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.740 
with all the playing I've been doing
with<00:00:34.710> watercolors<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.520> rather<00:00:36.360> than<00:00:36.540> letting

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
with watercolors so rather than letting

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.260 
with watercolors so rather than letting
them<00:00:36.930> use<00:00:36.989> my<00:00:37.380> expensive<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.640> know<00:00:38.760> paint<00:00:39.090> and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270

all<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.480> kind<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.660> stuff<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.930> thought<00:00:40.079> I'd

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
all that kind of stuff I thought I'd

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.540 
all that kind of stuff I thought I'd
just<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:40.530> them<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> little<00:00:40.800> cheaper<00:00:41.160> set<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.520> I

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
just get them a little cheaper set so I

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.100 
just get them a little cheaper set so I
got<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.910> set<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.570> started<00:00:42.809> playing<00:00:42.930> with

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
around $6.99 I think and of course you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.650 
around $6.99 I think and of course you
can<00:00:49.860> generally<00:00:50.309> use<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.550> coupon<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
can generally use a coupon for it in the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.229 
can generally use a coupon for it in the
States<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.050> know<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.379> quite<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> bit<00:00:52.890> cheaper

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
really liking them I've just been

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.940 
really liking them I've just been
playing<00:01:29.759> with<00:01:30.600> them<00:01:30.900> more<00:01:31.350> than<00:01:31.530> anything<00:01:31.710> I

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
playing with them more than anything I

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.310 
playing with them more than anything I
haven't<00:01:32.220> actually<00:01:32.340> done<00:01:33.210> any<00:01:33.540> water<00:01:33.900> coloring

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
haven't actually done any water coloring

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.920 
haven't actually done any water coloring
with<00:01:34.350> them<00:01:34.740> other<00:01:34.950> than<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.869> kind<00:01:36.869> of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
with them other than just kind of

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.649 
with them other than just kind of
fiddling<00:01:37.439> but<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.100> think<00:01:39.060> they're<00:01:39.180> decent<00:01:39.360> for

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
fiddling but I think they're decent for

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.929 
fiddling but I think they're decent for
the<00:01:39.689> price<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.350> can't<00:01:40.680> really<00:01:41.040> go<00:01:41.250> wrong<00:01:41.610> with

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
the price you can't really go wrong with

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.620 
the price you can't really go wrong with
them<00:01:42.299> they're<00:01:42.540> not<00:01:43.579> they're<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:44.790> super<00:01:45.329> super

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
them they're not they're not super super

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.469 
them they're not they're not super super

can't<00:04:17.340> go<00:04:17.459> wrong<00:04:17.609> so<00:04:17.760> it's<00:04:17.880> great<00:04:18.150> at<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.510> very

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
can't go wrong so it's great at the very

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.259 
can't go wrong so it's great at the very
least<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.320> get<00:04:19.560> just<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.340> play<00:04:20.609> with<00:04:20.790> you<00:04:21.180> know

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.530 
throw things out so this is great and I
forgot<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.550> add<00:04:35.670> because<00:04:35.970> it<00:04:36.150> was<00:04:36.270> actually

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
forgot to add because it was actually

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.270 
forgot to add because it was actually
stuck<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:36.900> something<00:04:37.710> else<00:04:37.890> because<00:04:38.130> there's

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
stuck to something else because there's

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.700 
stuck to something else because there's
a<00:04:38.340> little<00:04:38.520> sticky<00:04:39.000> thing<00:04:39.960> on<00:04:40.110> here<00:04:40.320> so<00:04:40.530> that's

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
a little sticky thing on here so that's

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.410 
a little sticky thing on here so that's
the<00:04:40.860> annoying<00:04:41.130> part<00:04:41.310> but<00:04:41.880> this<00:04:42.060> was<00:04:42.240> actually

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
the annoying part but this was actually

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.630
