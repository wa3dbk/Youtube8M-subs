00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:16.490
 I think that we are used to 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.490
 recall what is happening in the country 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.730
 Moscow March 16, secondly 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.730
 multiple conflicts 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.899
 then how to leave the group last year 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.819
 some other 

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:44.819
 people are sure that it is very difficult 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.420
 but it's a new thing 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.420
 like many many others 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.530
 remember now 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.470
 here we are talking about registration 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.470
 sunlight will still have to show 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.740
 but we were injured 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.220
 but at the same time everyone who wants it 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.220
 had to make a portal and year 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.070
 that is, it turns out 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.070
 in the end this way 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.590
 and finally, probably, but also 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.930
 because not too long further 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.420
 hello cyprus 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.420
 the fruit of Volgograd 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.350
 Besides 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.960
 to third parties 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.570
 for some reason only then 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.010
 this is not true 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.010
 well, just 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.770
 in a statement 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.390
 it does not follow 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.870
 elimination of consequences 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.870
 but still orders reports 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.730
 birth orders 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.810
 in may 45 th 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.810
 and barcelona 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:17.189
 I do not speak 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:18.469
 Dynamo Kiev with a strong team
