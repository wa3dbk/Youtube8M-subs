00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
foot long fresh Harbor rail I got this

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.600 
foot long fresh Harbor rail I got this
for<00:00:50.360> like<00:00:51.360> 20<00:00:51.719> bucks<00:00:53.989> off<00:00:54.989> Craigslist<00:00:55.770> it's

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
for like 20 bucks off Craigslist it's

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.410 
for like 20 bucks off Craigslist it's
like<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> oval<00:00:58.320> bar<00:00:58.620> kind<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.100> because<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.239> top

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
like a oval bar kind of because the top

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.290 
like a oval bar kind of because the top
is<00:01:00.600> flat<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.170> then<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> sides<00:01:01.910> or<00:01:02.910> round<00:01:03.120> it

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
is flat but then the sides or round it

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.880 
is flat but then the sides or round it
off<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.960> makes<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.260> little<00:01:04.379> bit<00:01:04.530> harder<00:01:04.860> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
off so that makes a little bit harder to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:15.020 
off so that makes a little bit harder to
get<00:01:05.129> balanced<00:01:10.189> yeah<00:01:12.049> then<00:01:13.100> after<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.310> we

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
get balanced yeah then after that we

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.870 
get balanced yeah then after that we
have<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.570> little<00:01:16.159> flap<00:01:17.159> our<00:01:17.400> rail<00:01:17.640> right

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
have this little flap our rail right

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.730 
have this little flap our rail right
here

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
here

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.980

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
it was free I guess then sometimes I'll

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.179

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
and use the top part but when it's over

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.190 
and use the top part but when it's over
here<00:02:06.979> I<00:02:07.009> just<00:02:07.310> use<00:02:07.429> it<00:02:07.459> for<00:02:07.580> grinding<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:11.200> then

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
here I just use it for grinding and then

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.699
