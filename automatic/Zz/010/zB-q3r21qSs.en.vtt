we've<00:01:09.390> got<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.170> two<00:01:10.350> dimples<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.950> are<00:01:11.070> in

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
we've got the two dimples that are in

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.649 
we've got the two dimples that are in
here<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.610> want<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.880> make<00:01:12.000> sure<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.270> clean<00:01:12.510> them

here we want to make sure we clean them

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.109 
here we want to make sure we clean them
well<00:01:12.900> along<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.130> front<00:01:14.460> area<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.939> front

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
well along with this front area in front

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.210 
well along with this front area in front
of<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.450> magnet<00:01:15.900> because<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.890> look<00:01:17.070> at

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
of the magnet because if you look at

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.980 
of the magnet because if you look at
your<00:01:17.369> mounting<00:01:17.790> plates<00:01:18.090> there's<00:01:18.479> actually

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
your mounting plates there's actually

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.109 
your mounting plates there's actually
two<00:01:19.530> posts<00:01:20.070> along<00:01:20.159> with<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> little<00:01:20.850> round

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
two posts along with a little round

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.179 
two posts along with a little round
dimple<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.720> will<00:01:21.840> set<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.140> there<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.530> what

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
dimple that will set on there and what

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.120 
dimple that will set on there and what
that's<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.030> create<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.659> plane<00:01:25.130> for

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
that's to do is to create that plane for

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.950 
that's to do is to create that plane for
that<00:01:26.250> plate<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.670> set<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.420> no<00:01:27.659> rock

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
that plate to set so you have no rock

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.990 
that plate to set so you have no rock
nothing<00:01:28.590> happening<00:01:28.979> there<00:01:29.040> no<00:01:29.369> interference

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
nothing happening there no interference

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.999 
nothing happening there no interference
so<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:30.750> really<00:01:31.020> important<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> keep<00:01:31.799> them

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
so it's really important to keep them

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.910 
so it's really important to keep them
areas<00:01:32.340> clean<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.390> actually<00:01:33.680> keep<00:01:34.680> one

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
areas clean so you can actually keep one

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.520 
areas clean so you can actually keep one
side<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.369> dry<00:01:35.579> side<00:01:35.990> hopefully<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
side the dry side hopefully that the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.800 
side the dry side hopefully that the
liquid<00:01:37.770> side<00:01:38.100> will<00:01:38.280> come<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.790> clean<00:01:39.780> that

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
liquid side will come in and clean that

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.770 
liquid side will come in and clean that
off<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:41.909> that'll<00:01:42.180> take<00:01:42.329> care<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.600> your

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
off and so that'll take care of your

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.569 
off and so that'll take care of your
mounting<00:01:43.110> plate<00:01:43.290> surface<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.920> then<00:01:44.460> you're

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
mounting plate surface and then you're

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.249 
mounting plate surface and then you're
going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.030> same<00:01:45.240> thing<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:45.899> go<00:01:46.079> into

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
going to do the same thing as we go into

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.100 
going to do the same thing as we go into
the<00:01:46.500> lower<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.399> come<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.759> here<00:01:48.210> we're

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the lower we can come in here we're

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.780 
the lower we can come in here we're
going<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.290> come<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.649> try<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.009> get<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.250> plaster

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
going to come in try to get this plaster

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.249 
going to come in try to get this plaster
out<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.030> here<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.390> see<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.540> really<00:01:51.840> kick<00:01:52.079> it

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
out of here you can see I really kick it

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.170 
out of here you can see I really kick it
down<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.649> there

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.540 

and<00:01:55.570> you'll<00:01:55.900> see<00:01:56.140> even<00:01:56.860> down<00:01:57.040> in<00:01:57.220> that<00:01:57.340> bottom

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
and you'll see even down in that bottom

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.820 
and you'll see even down in that bottom
or<00:01:58.300> some<00:01:58.540> in<00:01:58.660> the<00:01:58.720> very<00:01:58.930> bottom<00:01:59.140> if<00:01:59.440> you<00:01:59.530> push

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
or some in the very bottom if you push

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.400 
or some in the very bottom if you push
you<00:02:00.430> may<00:02:00.610> not<00:02:00.760> clean<00:02:01.060> it<00:02:01.210> all<00:02:01.360> out<00:02:01.390> but<00:02:02.140> what

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
you may not clean it all out but what

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.530 
you may not clean it all out but what
you're<00:02:02.620> doing<00:02:02.800> is<00:02:03.190> you're<00:02:03.820> cleaning<00:02:04.330> the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
you're doing is you're cleaning the

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.350 
you're doing is you're cleaning the
actual<00:02:04.930> taper<00:02:05.260> edge<00:02:05.590> where<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:07.000> mounting

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
actual taper edge where the the mounting

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.880 
actual taper edge where the the mounting
plate<00:02:07.390> is<00:02:07.630> going<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.810> set<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.110> there<00:02:08.289> and

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
plate is going to set in there and

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.770 
plate is going to set in there and
that'll<00:02:09.100> take<00:02:09.369> care<00:02:09.610> of<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:09.850> so<00:02:10.630> we're

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
that'll take care of that so we're

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.810 
that'll take care of that so we're
actually<00:02:10.960> going<00:02:11.320> to<00:02:11.410> get<00:02:11.770> down<00:02:12.220> in<00:02:12.520> there<00:02:12.760> and

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
actually going to get down in there and

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.600 
actually going to get down in there and
really<00:02:13.630> try<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.230> make<00:02:14.380> sure<00:02:14.680> we<00:02:14.860> have<00:02:15.070> nothing

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
really try to make sure we have nothing

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.910 
really try to make sure we have nothing
in<00:02:15.820> on<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.660> tapering<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.440> get<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.709> nice<00:02:17.860> and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
in on that tapering and get it nice and

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.470 
in on that tapering and get it nice and
clean<00:02:18.840> once<00:02:19.840> we<00:02:20.050> have<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.320> done<00:02:20.770> then<00:02:21.610> then

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
clean once we have that done then then

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.990 
clean once we have that done then then
we've<00:02:22.690> got<00:02:22.720> all<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.140> hard<00:02:23.320> particles<00:02:23.650> out<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
we've got all the hard particles out the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.699 
we've got all the hard particles out the
other<00:02:25.150> thing<00:02:25.420> we<00:02:25.570> need<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.780> do<00:02:25.930> obviously<00:02:26.170> is<00:02:26.500> I

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
other thing we need to do obviously is I

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.260 
other thing we need to do obviously is I
made<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> mess<00:02:27.160> here<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:27.760> can<00:02:27.880> see<00:02:28.090> with

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
made a mess here and you can see with

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.570 
made a mess here and you can see with
the<00:02:28.390> powder<00:02:28.600> coated<00:02:29.020> surface<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:30.100> actually

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
the powder coated surface it actually

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.900 
the powder coated surface it actually
makes<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:30.940> really<00:02:31.209> easy<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:33.130> remove<00:02:33.489> you<00:02:33.730> see

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
makes it really easy to remove you see

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.660 
makes it really easy to remove you see
you<00:02:34.060> can<00:02:34.239> see<00:02:34.450> just<00:02:34.480> by<00:02:34.959> using<00:02:35.200> my<00:02:35.380> thumb<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:36.040> can

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
you can see just by using my thumb I can

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.040 
you can see just by using my thumb I can
remove<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.180> lot<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.660> I<00:02:37.690> can<00:02:37.900> use<00:02:37.930> my

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
remove a lot of that I can use my

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.020 
remove a lot of that I can use my
fingernail<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.709> little<00:02:39.040> bit<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.430> you<00:02:40.000> can

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
fingernail a little bit and you can

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.690 
fingernail a little bit and you can
clean<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.360> lot<00:02:40.570> of<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:40.840> surface<00:02:41.050> off<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:42.459> what

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
clean a lot of that surface off so what

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.030 
clean a lot of that surface off so what
we<00:02:42.850> see<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.690> when<00:02:44.290> these<00:02:44.410> units<00:02:44.800> are<00:02:44.890> out

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
we see and and when these units are out

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.100 
we see and and when these units are out
in<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.280> field<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.480> people<00:02:46.780> like<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.080> use

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
in the field is that people like to use

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.050 
in the field is that people like to use
steam<00:02:47.530> cleaners<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.160> clean<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.489> articulator

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
steam cleaners to clean the articulator

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.940 
steam cleaners to clean the articulator
and<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.750> thing<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:50.080> don't<00:02:50.140> think<00:02:50.530> they<00:02:50.680> realize

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
and the thing I don't think they realize

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.550 
and the thing I don't think they realize
is<00:02:51.520> when<00:02:51.670> you're<00:02:51.850> using<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.270> steam<00:02:52.510> cleaner<00:02:52.690> you

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
is when you're using a steam cleaner you

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.890 
is when you're using a steam cleaner you
can<00:02:53.590> apply<00:02:54.070> a<00:02:54.100> lot<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.550> heat<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.600> lot<00:02:55.780> of

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
can apply a lot of heat and a lot of

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.500 
can apply a lot of heat and a lot of
pressure<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.530> your<00:02:56.680> articulator<00:02:57.220> surface<00:02:57.730> so

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
pressure to your articulator surface so

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.600 
pressure to your articulator surface so
in<00:02:58.660> doing<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.380> get<00:02:59.590> thermal<00:02:59.980> expansion

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
in doing that you get thermal expansion

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.370 
in doing that you get thermal expansion
your<00:03:00.760> material<00:03:01.239> underneath<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.780> coding<00:03:02.230> us

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
your material underneath the coding us

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.000 
your material underneath the coding us
is<00:03:02.680> wanting<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.130> expand<00:03:03.640> due<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.180> heat<00:03:04.450> and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
is wanting to expand due to the heat and

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.070 
is wanting to expand due to the heat and
once<00:03:06.010> it<00:03:06.190> does<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.670> coating<00:03:07.180> on<00:03:07.299> top<00:03:07.420> can

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
once it does that the coating on top can

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.380 
once it does that the coating on top can
expand<00:03:08.620> with<00:03:08.830> it<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:09.730> once<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:10.180> goes<00:03:10.330> through

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
expand with it so once it goes through

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.630 
expand with it so once it goes through
that<00:03:10.600> expand<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.410> retract<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:12.160> can<00:03:12.310> actually

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
that expand and retract you can actually

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.000 
that expand and retract you can actually
cause<00:03:12.820> cracking<00:03:13.269> in<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.780> surface<00:03:14.260> of<00:03:14.440> your

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
cause cracking in the surface of your

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.160 
cause cracking in the surface of your
coding<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.640> that's<00:03:16.600> going<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.870> start

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
coding and that's going to start

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.080 
coding and that's going to start
allowing<00:03:17.350> things<00:03:17.799> to<00:03:18.040> get<00:03:18.549> in<00:03:18.820> underneath

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
allowing things to get in underneath

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.330 
allowing things to get in underneath
that<00:03:19.390> surface<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.080> actually<00:03:20.799> start<00:03:21.100> allowing

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
that surface and actually start allowing

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.699 
that surface and actually start allowing
things<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.970> pop<00:03:22.269> up<00:03:22.299> and<00:03:22.750> starting<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.260> remove

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
things to pop up and starting to remove

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.220 
things to pop up and starting to remove
your<00:03:23.890> coding<00:03:24.280> causing<00:03:25.209> issues<00:03:25.420> in<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:25.989> look

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
your coding causing issues in the look

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.170 
your coding causing issues in the look
of<00:03:26.380> your<00:03:26.500> articulator<00:03:27.040> but<00:03:27.250> also<00:03:27.400> can<00:03:28.150> cause

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
of your articulator but also can cause

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.820 
of your articulator but also can cause
some<00:03:28.630> issues<00:03:28.750> with<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.110> accuracy<00:03:29.709> of<00:03:29.739> your

some issues with the accuracy of your

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.030 
some issues with the accuracy of your
articulator<00:03:30.519> as<00:03:30.640> well<00:03:30.880> so<00:03:31.690> we<00:03:31.930> really<00:03:32.350> want<00:03:32.950> to

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
articulator as well so we really want to

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.870 
articulator as well so we really want to
try<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.690> express<00:03:34.690> as<00:03:35.019> much<00:03:35.230> as<00:03:35.410> we<00:03:35.530> can<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:36.190> try

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
try to express as much as we can to try

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.759 
try to express as much as we can to try
to<00:03:36.910> stay<00:03:37.299> away<00:03:37.600> from<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.989> steam<00:03:38.230> cleaning<00:03:38.560> and

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
to stay away from the steam cleaning and

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.130 
to stay away from the steam cleaning and
just<00:03:38.950> use<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.130> mild<00:03:39.459> soap<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:39.940> water<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.540> there

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
just use a mild soap and water and there

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.630 
just use a mild soap and water and there
again<00:03:41.170> we<00:03:41.560> chose<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:42.010> powder<00:03:42.220> coating

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
again we chose the powder coating

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.539 
again we chose the powder coating
surface<00:03:43.090> so<00:03:43.660> it'd<00:03:43.810> be<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:43.989> little<00:03:44.140> more<00:03:44.410> easy<00:03:44.650> to

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
surface so it'd be a little more easy to

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.550 
surface so it'd be a little more easy to
remove<00:03:45.910> some<00:03:45.970> of<00:03:46.239> this<00:03:46.420> now<00:03:46.989> we<00:03:47.049> will<00:03:47.380> go<00:03:47.530> into

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
remove some of this now we will go into

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.920 
remove some of this now we will go into
some<00:03:47.950> steps<00:03:48.250> that<00:03:48.370> we<00:03:48.610> do<00:03:48.760> here<00:03:49.150> that<00:03:49.780> will

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
some steps that we do here that will

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.710 
some steps that we do here that will
actually<00:03:50.140> help<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.829> in<00:03:51.130> in<00:03:51.880> removing<00:03:52.540> this

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
actually help you in in removing this

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.660 
actually help you in in removing this
much<00:03:53.140> easier<00:03:53.590> as<00:03:53.739> your<00:03:53.920> articulator<00:03:54.489> gets

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
much easier as your articulator gets

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.130 
much easier as your articulator gets
older<00:03:55.030> or<00:03:55.150> surfaces<00:03:55.540> get<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.810> little<00:03:56.049> bit

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
older or surfaces get a little bit

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.020 
older or surfaces get a little bit
rougher<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.769> so<00:03:57.340> we're<00:03:57.459> going<00:03:57.549> to<00:03:57.640> show<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:57.910> a

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
rougher and so we're going to show you a

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.090 
rougher and so we're going to show you a
neat<00:03:58.239> little<00:03:58.390> trick<00:03:58.690> we

neat little trick we

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.670 
neat little trick we
in<00:03:59.310> order<00:03:59.550> to<00:03:59.610> help<00:03:59.850> you<00:04:00.060> do<00:04:00.210> that<00:04:00.410> now<00:04:01.410> while

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
in order to help you do that now while

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.710 
in order to help you do that now while
you're<00:04:01.860> in<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.160> cleaning<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:03.000> can<00:04:03.150> also<00:04:03.330> take

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
you're in and cleaning you can also take

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.800 
you're in and cleaning you can also take
your<00:04:03.900> alcohol<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.740> in<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.730> latch<00:04:05.970> area<00:04:06.480> you

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
your alcohol and in the latch area you

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.690 
your alcohol and in the latch area you
can<00:04:06.990> come<00:04:07.200> in<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:07.560> clean<00:04:07.770> different<00:04:08.100> areas<00:04:08.520> in

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
can come in and clean different areas in

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.220 
can come in and clean different areas in
here<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:09.000> try<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.240> get<00:04:09.390> some<00:04:09.630> of<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.810> gypsum

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
here to try to get some of the gypsum

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.020 
here to try to get some of the gypsum
and<00:04:10.260> out<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.710> has<00:04:11.160> gotten<00:04:11.400> down<00:04:11.640> into<00:04:11.910> your

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
that the alcohol won't hurt any of the

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.310 
that the alcohol won't hurt any of the
surface<00:04:35.070> there<00:04:35.420> another<00:04:36.420> issue<00:04:36.720> in<00:04:37.170> the

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
surface there another issue in the

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.740 
surface there another issue in the
medial<00:04:37.740> is<00:04:38.160> you'll<00:04:38.430> see<00:04:38.610> a<00:04:38.640> little<00:04:39.000> small<00:04:39.450> hole

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
medial is you'll see a little small hole

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.080 
medial is you'll see a little small hole
in<00:04:39.990> there<00:04:40.170> and<00:04:40.380> what<00:04:41.070> that<00:04:41.250> hole<00:04:41.490> does<00:04:41.820> that's

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
in there and what that hole does that's

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.820 
in there and what that hole does that's
where<00:04:42.300> your<00:04:42.480> centric<00:04:42.930> latch<00:04:43.170> comes<00:04:43.560> through

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
where your centric latch comes through

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.790 
where your centric latch comes through
so<00:04:44.580> in<00:04:45.030> using<00:04:45.420> the<00:04:45.540> gypsum<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.020> sometimes<00:04:46.650> you

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
so in using the gypsum and sometimes you

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.740 
so in using the gypsum and sometimes you
can<00:04:46.890> get<00:04:46.980> plaster<00:04:47.430> up<00:04:47.580> in<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:47.880> in<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.150> fauces

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
can get plaster up in the in the fauces

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.600 
can get plaster up in the in the fauces
and<00:04:48.990> that<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.350> you<00:04:49.830> may<00:04:49.980> end<00:04:50.010> up<00:04:50.280> with<00:04:50.430> some

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
and that and you may end up with some

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.000 
and that and you may end up with some
down<00:04:50.790> in<00:04:51.000> there<00:04:51.210> so<00:04:51.570> user<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:52.200> tip<00:04:52.440> get<00:04:52.680> down<00:04:52.830> in

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
down in there so user to tip get down in

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
ways to make it easier to clean an

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.199 
ways to make it easier to clean an
articulator<00:06:09.459> and<00:06:09.610> that's<00:06:09.729> why<00:06:09.849> we<00:06:09.999> have<00:06:10.119> the

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:10.209 
articulator and that's why we have the

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:13.079 
articulator and that's why we have the
silicon<00:06:10.689> and<00:06:10.959> you<00:06:11.619> can<00:06:11.799> use<00:06:11.919> silicon<00:06:12.519> again

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:13.089 
silicon and you can use silicon again

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:15.509 
silicon and you can use silicon again
you<00:06:13.299> can<00:06:13.449> use<00:06:13.479> vaseline<00:06:14.259> it's<00:06:14.889> just<00:06:15.159> all<00:06:15.339> we're

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:15.519 
you can use vaseline it's just all we're

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:17.369 
you can use vaseline it's just all we're
going<00:06:15.610> to<00:06:15.669> do<00:06:15.849> is<00:06:15.999> we're<00:06:16.119> going<00:06:16.209> to<00:06:16.299> use<00:06:17.199> this

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:17.379 
going to do is we're going to use this

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:18.989 
going to do is we're going to use this
