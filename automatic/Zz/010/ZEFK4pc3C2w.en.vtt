00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.740
 or talk to you today let's do the 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.930
 makeup seen bears with that for this 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.620
 the only thing we need mainly 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:18.500
 are two jumbo eye liner 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.649
 I'm going to use the in why is that I have a 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.810
 white and black I also bought two 

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:26.390
 small because the previous time with that 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.910
 come you one that is my favorite 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.309
 and I left it so I did not have many 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.430
 senses or buy these that are from 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.910
 Wellton wild they are a dollar each 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.390
 and they are perfect for this and I put myself 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.640
 a moment and my face is with a first 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.890
 co that will prevent makeup from affecting 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.140
 and between the forums only now I'm going to 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.610
 start I'm going to draw everything and then already 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.610
 start recording again 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.739
 so that the makeup stays in a 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.460
 flat I'm going to stick my eyebrows like a 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.460
 rubber bar 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.180
 and now I'm going to start drawing alone 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.310
 worry about drawing the part 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.140
 around the eyes the rest was not 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.920
 necessary because in the end it was covered 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.920
 with white paint 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:29.720
 Well, I'm going to start filling in the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.690
 white as white and a brush I'm going to 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.430
 start filling everything 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.430
 what I have what is white 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.020
 i 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.750
 and as you will see already already delineates the part 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.830
 white now let's start filling 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.830
 the black part 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.670
 now it is not here 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.640
 as you know 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.560
 and I am I drew almost everything 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.650
 of the spider the skeleton I try to make 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.980
 a skeleton and now we're going to do the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.980
 nose 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.480
 as you will see I drew almost everything fill 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.760
 the dark parts now what I'm going to 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.489
 create is shadow and in the same way that 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.379
 we create our faces, we are going to do it but 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.860
 how can we try to look like a 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.900
 skeleton and let's outline it instead 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.510
 to stay instead of using a sunscreen 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.129
 let's use a dark color so that 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.900
 to make the gaps from where they are 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.900
 our our bones 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.230
 in this sector it looks darker 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.340
 let's use 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.340
 black pencil 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.200
 Mark the lines and now the only thing 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.680
 let's do 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.680
 With our 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.220
 And I think that 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.350
 it's going to be even better if we use the 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.350
 if I use him 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.350
 one 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.110
 the black jumbo 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.200
 now let's paint the bottom part 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.650
 because I finished the makeup 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.060
 I applied false eyelashes 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.150
 and now let's do my hair 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.379
 and now I'm going to use a white to 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.379
 hold hands 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.100
 do not 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.129
 and these roses the summit in dollars 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.129
 one dollar 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.750
 and that's all I hope you have 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.080
 liked and see you soon take care 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.080

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.050
