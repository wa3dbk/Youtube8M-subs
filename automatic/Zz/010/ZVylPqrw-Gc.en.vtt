 all Italian communists will have to put the 3 tg research logo 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.989
 union established an approved law 

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:13.049
 hahaha this summer villa 6 August last from a law not only approved 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.669
 pergolas 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:15.239
 the government but also 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:17.539
 with the opposition site 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.890
 and meanwhile you have everyone's protests from Piedmont to Sicily 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.390
 mayors because the privatization of new services could empty them 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.470
 houses of the municipalities concerned but could also cost a lot 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.210
 to citizens private rentals 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.499
 the first thing I will do is increase 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:39.900
 the cost of the pinot nero bill make the fourth kit for example those ese 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.650
 can't pay 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.650
 my name is service 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.130
 hands down from the piedmont to sicily the protest of the municipalities grows 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.730
 against the privatization of water services 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.410
 effect of an umbrella law that on August 6 opens a hole in the boxes 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.680
 of small and large cities literally breaks the waters and the eggs in the 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.390
 basket of local administrations the norm community obligations put theirs 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.990
 trike origins on the market by 2010 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.220
 with water that in other words ceases to be a fundamental right for 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.640
 become merchandise like many others with all the foreseeable consequences of 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.840
 case like the one that if I don't pay, dry mouth 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.520
 passage tim 1000 minutes and June 26 I have heard of 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.080
 amethyst fox 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.159
 since he sleeps 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.330
 now represents the business of the future 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.719
 first degree systems are increasing 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.010
 seems to be non-recurring unrestrained rules 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.620
 board games 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.420
 price rises steeply without the road to privatization knowing 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.900
 give the desired results and above all respect phrases for the community 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.210
 in this way the private individuals collect the bills, that is, from the pulp of the fruit under discussion 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.120
 while the public remains only red colander colanders indeed dangerous 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.960
 and sometimes poison a situation from the uncertain future which they run through 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.350
 like water under the bridge sequences to say the least paradoxical 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.519
 from Florence after a year of campaign for water saving citizens have 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.420
 received a letter explaining the reduction in consumption 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.399
 the rates will suffer increases in points balance 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:24.369
 uhm to the common that the risk of not being half joy no latitude 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:28.369
 dedicates to aprilia in the province of latina has recorded headlight price increases at 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:33.779
 300% while the spice has seen its bills grow by so much 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:38.819
 to make similar artists gain the title of tabile tubas a tartassed dress 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:39.609
 of Italy 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.869
 in the south that does not deny it touches the singular case of the Apulian aqueduct 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:47.930
 that your with the privatization meaning with finished foreign banks 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.769
 in global financial storms how to make water from all sides is wrong 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.769
 report who knows if the variable 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:02.349
 of this story of the water scandal in our country is thirsty 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.349
 la7 occupied, some time ago 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.759
 run to church 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:10.799
 tell paolo mensitieri is one of the best journalists have the best 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.089
 Italian whites have inside for r2 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.739
 re the inquiries of republic to water spa the revolt of the mayors forum and yes 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.529
 concludes his 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:22.579
 reportage from 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:23.440
 citing 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.129
 giuseppe altamura author of the inquiry book of the of a beautiful investigation book 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.680
 on the subject as water siva 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:36.759
 from work nero alloro blood ties to altamura deputy head of the family 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:37.309
 Christian 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:38.169
 and today 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:42.469
 and here with us thanks for accepting our invitation gf in short, we are at 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:43.579
 water war 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:49.219
 we are related work because after annalisa, 1994 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.219
 trenitalia started a major reorganization process 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:56.479
 we started from 13500 managements 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:01.339
 + then of the municipalities that are 8 milan to simplify all this and bring it 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:04.999
 solo 90 optimal territorial areas and 90 managers 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.349
 and therefore this naturally there is a very disagreeable toaster pump 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.079
 of revolts around the country 144 municipalities for example lombardy that have 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.139
 required 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.949
 referendum women in short there seems to be that you could travel around the country 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.919
 pretty massive organization questionnaire 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.749
 the legend of August 6th to let the water that came before it pass 

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:31.029
 considered an essential good 

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.840
 and therefore 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.050
 payable out of duty even if one doesn't pay the bill to me says I'm here 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.920
 an asset 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.599
 which can be taken away from those who do not pay 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:41.419
 which will be 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.100
 and I think they will pay the citizens for a nice piece on the spot or savato because it is already 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.059
 you give me official 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:52.210
 the courier of the supervisory committee on water resources speak for themselves 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.250
 practically on sale in the bills they will increase by an average of 40% 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.900
 means a mark-up offers persona then per capita of 115 euros per year 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.089
 for a family of four they are more than 500 euros a year 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:09.899
 let's talk about the data with a bit like the statistics of trilussa chicken then 

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:14.529
 in some cases, as already happened, tariffs will increase a lot 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:19.849
 more varesenews review - raise attend and I eat a chicken 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.370
 put the images on the wall 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.810
 we have already reached the head is a theory currently this will have some 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.449
 there are heavy consequences around the country. of the real favorite you already have 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.740
 only 200% facebook modÃ  

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.889
 I tried 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.229
 in the tab 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.810
 ebay ok, but we should also remember that first is not that water 

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:43.219
 was missing we were paying for it completely we feel we can't pay it 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.839
 however the costs are saved on the general tax system hidden 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:48.680
 focus - 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.400
 common parties protest against the privatization terms to those two 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.560
 ikea quite clearly that 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.570
 we do so I would like you and you mt-20 common currently lose revenue 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.230
 they had through the economy management 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:08.599
 but then there are also reasons for the bell tower, I mean there is a bit 'the 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:13.259
 desire the desire to continue to control their water resources 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:16.449
 there are municipalities that are richer in other water resources - rimini 

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:21.139
 protests generally concern more those communists have control 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.649
 direct of its resources it allows to lose the control precisely 

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:29.609
 on its own on the pop economy, in short, the condominium that does not have to pay the 

00:06:29.609 --> 00:06:33.610
 bill wishes that water will become a commodity not of an essential good that 

00:06:33.609 --> 00:06:35.809
 do you have to remove the water 

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:40.299
 probably because this is a badge, it even fits into the picture 

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:41.979
 of the European directive 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:45.430
 if one is in arrears, the water is removed even if we intervene 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.400
 Article 117 of the Constitution which must guarantee the right 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.550
 minimum 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.350
 to this Italian gossip service here can allow 3 a battle 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:57.590
 constitutionality will be on the boat as well we will see the mayor 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.850
 forced to distribute water with tankers, however, I appreciate your mind 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.080
 enough 8 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.849
 I will get away with the parliament does not think about it 

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:10.589
 but I don't think we think about it again because this privatization process 

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:11.990
 of the various body parts 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.110
 for some years now it's like saying there was the dark with this law 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.100
 law frank 100 33 on August 6 cars born four large giants who 

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:24.710
 manage have all the signals are listed on the stock exchange etc. 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.979
 in reality it is something that has already started a few years ago 

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:36.889
 thanks to giuseppe alta dies we now remember hspa your spa from them in their blue 

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:40.669
 his book which explains even better than we could do 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:43.740
 at this moment what happens what is the war 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.469
 around the water thank you for being with us now
