00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.460
 our segment the world is upside down 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.440
 there are several samples but today we want 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.750
 tell them about the concentration of the 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.090
 wealth is given in several cities but in 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.150
 sao paulo for example in brazil reached 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.160
 such level that today is the second 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.930
 city from around the world in greater 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:30.200
 number of helicopters

 saopaulo is only below 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.810
 new york- in the number of these 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.340
 aircraft but because so many good ones 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.120
 they say it 's because there's a transit 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.290
 chaotic that forces to look for alternatives 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.050
 others say that the current bonanza 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.370
 economic of Brazil allows this good 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.870
 but there is a difference with other 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.640
 cities in the rest of the world those 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.370
 helicopters are concentrated in the hands of 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.489
 rental companies in sao change 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.680

 helicopter those who wish to buy one 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.759

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.229
 list and can wait up to four years 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:17.990
 by the great demand this illustrates the the 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.910
 high asked for the high money that moves 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.580
 to buy aircraft by 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.960

 to a company to move it from a 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.000
 yes from one point in the city ​​to another now 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.350
 in the peripheral areas of sao paulo the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.180
 same city concentrates the greatest 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.520
 number of favelas of Brazil 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.410
 this is the other side of the same city 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.230
 they are favelas it is also known as 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.910

 poorest organizations the 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:58.030
 constructions are really precarious 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.370
 sao paulo has more than 1500 favelas are 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.220
 kilometers of mountains of poverty sao 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.770
 paulo has more than double the 700 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.750
 favelas that Rio de Janeiro has more 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.330
 of 2 million people who live there 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.250
 in these favelas of sao paulo it 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.890
 it's about 16 percent of the population 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.420
 of the entire city the figures are from the 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.660
 sao paulo prefecture that is not 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.500
 speculations are studies conducted 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.590

 worldwide that is not data 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.270
 exaggerated here is seen in two worlds 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.670
 antagonistic in the same city maybe 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.160
 they never cross but they are reflected in 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.920
 the social inequality indices of 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.050
 this one that is still remember of 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.200
 fact happened to be the sixth economy of 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.860
 the whole plan 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.280
 the world upside down two worlds in one
