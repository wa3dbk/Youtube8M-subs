I<00:01:08.429> do<00:01:09.119> wish<00:01:09.509> that<00:01:09.539> it<00:01:09.780> had<00:01:09.899> a<00:01:09.929> little<00:01:10.200> bit<00:01:10.350> of

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
I do wish that it had a little bit of

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:11.840 
I do wish that it had a little bit of
jimping<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.130> because<00:01:11.399> I<00:01:11.490> think<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
jimping on it because I think that it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.889 
jimping on it because I think that it
would<00:01:11.909> just<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.179> a<00:01:12.210> little<00:01:12.329> more<00:01:12.570> comfortable

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
would just be a little more comfortable

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.929 
would just be a little more comfortable
you'd<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.469> a<00:01:13.530> better<00:01:13.740> grip<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.579> mean<00:01:14.820> for

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
you'd have a better grip but I mean for

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.469 
you'd have a better grip but I mean for
$23<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.929> what<00:01:16.109> it<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:17.149> let's<00:01:18.149> go<00:01:18.270> over<00:01:18.450> some

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
$23 it is what it is let's go over some

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.910 
$23 it is what it is let's go over some
specs<00:01:18.929> so<00:01:19.469> the<00:01:19.950> blade<00:01:20.249> length<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:21.109> 3<00:01:22.109> and<00:01:22.259> 3/4

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
specs so the blade length is 3 and 3/4

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.810 
specs so the blade length is 3 and 3/4
or<00:01:23.070> 9.8<00:01:23.939> inches<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:25.560> overall<00:01:25.979> length<00:01:26.219> is<00:01:26.460> 7

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
or 9.8 inches the overall length is 7

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.550 
or 9.8 inches the overall length is 7
and<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.969> half<00:01:26.999> inches<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.229> pretty<00:01:28.409> good

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
and a half inches so it's a pretty good

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.399 
and a half inches so it's a pretty good
sized<00:01:28.740> knife<00:01:29.119> now<00:01:30.119> when<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.509> closed<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.140> 4

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
and 7/8 or 12.5 centimeters so let's see

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.090 
and 7/8 or 12.5 centimeters so let's see
the<00:01:37.409> weight<00:01:37.649> on<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:38.039> is<00:01:38.280> 4.6<00:01:39.119> ounces<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.100> the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
sheet that it came with so I I wouldn't

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.000 
sheet that it came with so I I wouldn't
recommend<00:02:55.510> getting<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.990> sheath<00:02:56.230> with<00:02:56.500> with

recommend getting the sheath with with

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.830 
recommend getting the sheath with with
this<00:02:57.130> knife<00:02:57.370> if<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.060> can<00:02:58.180> get<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.420> without<00:02:58.510> it

this knife if you can get it without it

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.780 
this knife if you can get it without it
then<00:02:59.050> I<00:02:59.350> definitely<00:03:00.310> would<00:03:00.460> because<00:03:00.670> the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
then I definitely would because the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.730 
then I definitely would because the
sheets<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.150> kind<00:03:01.360> of<00:03:01.450> garbage<00:03:01.780> but<00:03:02.380> like<00:03:02.650> I

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
sheets is kind of garbage but like I

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.260 
sheets is kind of garbage but like I
said<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:03.130> know<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:03.490> went<00:03:03.790> out<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.000> just<00:03:04.150> bought

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
said you know I went out and just bought

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.150 
said you know I went out and just bought
my<00:03:04.420> own<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:05.170> holds<00:03:05.470> up<00:03:05.560> really<00:03:06.010> really

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
my own and it holds up really really

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.280 
my own and it holds up really really
well<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:06.790> anyways<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:07.870> think<00:03:08.050> that's<00:03:08.170> pretty

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
well so anyways I think that's pretty

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.630 
well so anyways I think that's pretty
much<00:03:08.410> it<00:03:08.710> I<00:03:08.830> think<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.070> went<00:03:09.160> over<00:03:09.400> everything

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
much it I think I went over everything

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.700 
much it I think I went over everything
like<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.180> said<00:03:10.360> there's<00:03:10.540> really<00:03:10.630> not<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:11.200> whole

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
like I said there's really not a whole
