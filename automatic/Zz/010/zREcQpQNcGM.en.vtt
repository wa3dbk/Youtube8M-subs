so<00:00:50.790> I'm<00:00:51.600> not<00:00:51.750> worried<00:00:51.989> about<00:00:52.019> it<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.559> reminds

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
so I'm not worried about it this reminds

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.250 
so I'm not worried about it this reminds
me<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> Odell<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.149> cheaper<00:00:55.019> Dell

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
me of the Odell the cheaper Dell

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.530 
me of the Odell the cheaper Dell
monitors<00:00:55.799> the<00:00:56.040> TN<00:00:56.370> panel<00:00:56.729> instead<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.089> the<00:00:57.149> IPS

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
monitors the TN panel instead of the IPS

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.990 
monitors the TN panel instead of the IPS
because<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> IPS<00:00:58.979> is<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.850> know<00:00:59.879> just

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
because the IPS is just you know just

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.350 
because the IPS is just you know just
beautiful<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:01.469> hey<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:02.190> $40.00<00:01:02.850> I'll<00:01:03.030> live

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.410 
beautiful but hey for $40.00 I'll live
with<00:01:03.479> it<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.780> they<00:01:03.960> ever<00:01:04.110> upgrade<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> panel

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
with it if they ever upgrade the panel

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.389 
with it if they ever upgrade the panel
and<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.659> resolution<00:01:07.320> based<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.009> the<00:01:08.070> reviews

I<00:01:08.550> ran<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.940> YouTube<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:09.750> also<00:01:09.780> because<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
I ran the YouTube but also because the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.570 
I ran the YouTube but also because the
fact<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.819> sucker<00:01:12.090> has<00:01:12.479> DVI<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:14.100> know<00:01:14.220> we

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
fact that the sucker has DVI you know we

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.940 
fact that the sucker has DVI you know we
know<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.909> want<00:01:15.060> DVI<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.539> don't<00:01:15.780> want<00:01:15.929> VGA<00:01:16.319> PGH

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
know we want DVI you don't want VGA PGH

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.200 
know we want DVI you don't want VGA PGH
is<00:01:17.220> going<00:01:17.429> to<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.580> blurry

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
is going to be blurry

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.680 
is going to be blurry
you<00:01:18.600> know<00:01:18.740> DVI<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:20.009> way<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.190> go

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
you know DVI is the way to go

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.370 
you know DVI is the way to go
fortunately<00:01:21.690> there's<00:01:21.899> still<00:01:22.080> gonna<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.350> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
fortunately there's still gonna be a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.260 
fortunately there's still gonna be a
mess<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.860> cable<00:01:23.190> you<00:01:23.220> need<00:01:23.399> the<00:01:23.550> USB<00:01:23.940> to<00:01:24.240> plug

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
mess of a cable you need the USB to plug

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.380 
mess of a cable you need the USB to plug
in<00:01:24.659> because<00:01:24.929> the<00:01:25.080> USB<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.369> digitizer<00:01:26.909> part

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
in because the USB is the digitizer part

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.990 
in because the USB is the digitizer part
and<00:01:27.630> then<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.929> course<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.759> power

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and then of course the power

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.600 
and then of course the power
oh<00:01:30.750> was<00:01:31.229> like<00:01:31.380> if<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.710> applet<00:01:32.220> designed

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
oh was like if this applet designed

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.190 
oh was like if this applet designed
this<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.270> wouldn't<00:01:33.479> have<00:01:33.600> all<00:01:33.750> these<00:01:33.899> wires

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
this you wouldn't have all these wires

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.139 
this you wouldn't have all these wires
so<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.649> like<00:01:34.799> one<00:01:35.009> wire<00:01:35.250> or<00:01:35.520> somehow<00:01:35.940> it

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
so do you like one wire or somehow it

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.240 
so do you like one wire or somehow it
could<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.509> be<00:01:36.659> more<00:01:36.810> elegant<00:01:37.319> but<00:01:37.830> it<00:01:38.099> is

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
could just be more elegant but it is

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.580 
could just be more elegant but it is
what<00:01:38.489> it<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.360> forty<00:01:39.810> dollars<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.319> can't

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
what it is so forty dollars you can't

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.850 
what it is so forty dollars you can't
beat<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.069> I<00:01:41.129> don't<00:01:41.429> put<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.610> back<00:01:41.729> down<00:01:42.860> down

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
beat so I don't put it back down down

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.249 
beat so I don't put it back down down
yeah<00:01:44.039> so<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.610> other<00:01:44.700> thing<00:01:44.910> the<00:01:45.450> pen<00:01:45.690> has<00:01:46.140> to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
yeah so the other thing the pen has to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.040 
yeah so the other thing the pen has to
be<00:01:46.349> charged<00:01:46.739> like<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.099> little<00:01:47.759> power<00:01:48.660> cord

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
be charged like this little power cord

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.990 
be charged like this little power cord
and<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.319> just<00:01:49.500> plug<00:01:49.679> up<00:01:49.860> me<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> us<00:01:50.520> being<00:01:50.759> like

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and you just plug up me a us being like

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:10.540 
and you just plug up me a us being like
that<00:01:51.209> right<00:01:52.280> okay

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.670 

it's<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.640> TN<00:02:11.940> panel<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:12.720> it's<00:02:13.140> not<00:02:13.380> going<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.620> be

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
it's a TN panel so it's not going to be

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.250 
it's a TN panel so it's not going to be
the<00:02:13.800> clearest<00:02:14.400> thing<00:02:14.670> in<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.880> world<00:02:15.090> but<00:02:15.450> it's

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
the clearest thing in the world but it's

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.890 
the clearest thing in the world but it's
of<00:02:16.440> your<00:02:17.010> Mac<00:02:17.250> user<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.820> make<00:02:18.090> sure<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.450> color

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
of your Mac user you make sure you color

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.130 
of your Mac user you make sure you color

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
ability to adjust the color so the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.730 
ability to adjust the color so the
contrast<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.450> contracts<00:02:33.870> at<00:02:34.050> U<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.350> little

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
contrast the contracts at U is a little

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.490 
contrast the contracts at U is a little
too<00:02:35.340> low<00:02:35.580> for<00:02:35.850> me<00:02:36.030> out<00:02:36.570> of<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> box<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.320> had

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
too low for me out of the box so I had

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.670 
too low for me out of the box so I had
to<00:02:37.620> put<00:02:37.830> boost<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.610> up<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.910> little<00:02:39.030> bit<00:02:39.240> I<00:02:40.020> just

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
to put boost that up a little bit I just

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.170 
to put boost that up a little bit I just
set<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.950> brightness<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.670> know<00:02:41.790> use<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
set the brightness you know use the

an ability to adjust the sharpness I

an ability to adjust the sharpness I
just<00:02:59.730> left<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.150> sharpness<00:03:00.780> one<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.410> guess

you<00:03:02.220> can<00:03:02.370> tweak<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.850> see<00:03:03.180> what<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.870> like

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
you can tweak it to see what you like

you can tweak it to see what you like
but<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:04.740> think<00:03:05.040> one<00:03:05.310> is<00:03:05.580> probably<00:03:05.880> fine<00:03:06.450> and

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
but I think one is probably fine and

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.630 
but I think one is probably fine and
that's<00:03:08.130> about<00:03:08.250> it

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
that's about it

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.490 
that's about it
I<00:03:08.670> don't<00:03:09.000> need<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.480> touch<00:03:09.690> any<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:09.989> those<00:03:10.170> stuff

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
I don't need to touch any of those stuff

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.350 
I don't need to touch any of those stuff
sketch<00:03:11.400> around<00:03:11.580> so<00:03:11.970> it's<00:03:12.090> pretty<00:03:12.239> good

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
sketch around so it's pretty good

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.910 
sketch around so it's pretty good
there's<00:03:12.660> no<00:03:12.780> lag<00:03:17.480> is<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.630> something<00:03:18.780> asked<00:03:19.019> she

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
there's no lag is it something asked she

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.780 
there's no lag is it something asked she
said<00:03:19.950> oh<00:03:20.100> quick<00:03:20.220> she<00:03:20.430> idea<00:03:20.640> how<00:03:20.730> many

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
said oh quick she idea how many

publicans<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.160> really<00:03:23.640> good<00:03:23.850> TN<00:03:24.300> panel

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
publicans this is a really good TN panel

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.460 
publicans this is a really good TN panel
very<00:03:26.040> good<00:03:26.310> he<00:03:26.910> just<00:03:27.180> got<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.780> calibrate<00:03:28.380> the

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
very good he just got to calibrate the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.860 
very good he just got to calibrate the
thing<00:03:28.860> caress<00:03:29.220> on<00:03:29.370> it<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.600> glass<00:03:30.810> is

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
thing caress on it and so the glass is

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.990 
thing caress on it and so the glass is
initially<00:03:31.590> very<00:03:31.769> smooth<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.370> think<00:03:32.580> this<00:03:32.730> the

initially very smooth I think this the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.090 
initially very smooth I think this the
pen<00:03:33.209> tip<00:03:33.390> needs<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.750> be<00:03:33.930> broken<00:03:34.170> in<00:03:34.560> after
