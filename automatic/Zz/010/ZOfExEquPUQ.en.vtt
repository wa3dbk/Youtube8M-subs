get<00:00:37.230> behind<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:39.260> then<00:00:40.260> there<00:00:40.680> was<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> cap

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
get behind it and then there was a cap

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.150 
get behind it and then there was a cap
nut<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.059> had<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.420> come<00:00:42.600> off<00:00:42.809> into<00:00:43.170> place<00:00:43.469> it

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
nut that had to come off into place it

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.610 
nut that had to come off into place it
was<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.550> long<00:00:44.730> cleanup<00:00:45.180> process<00:00:45.620> more

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
was just a long cleanup process more

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.930 
was just a long cleanup process more
than<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.860> wanted<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> be<00:00:47.280> involved<00:00:47.760> in

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
than I wanted to be involved in

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.209 
than I wanted to be involved in
something<00:00:48.809> else<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.710> different<00:00:49.890> with

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
something else that I see different with

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.540 
something else that I see different with
this<00:00:50.399> gun<00:00:50.719> these<00:00:51.719> nozzles<00:00:52.110> are<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:53.039> near<00:00:53.399> as

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
this gun these nozzles are not near as

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.299 
this gun these nozzles are not near as
long<00:00:53.850> which<00:00:54.690> means<00:00:55.140> they<00:00:55.559> should<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:56.010> way

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
long which means they should be way

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.970 
long which means they should be way
easier<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.879> clean<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.930> guns<00:00:58.170> with<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.500> nozzle

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
easier to clean the guns with the nozzle

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.060 
easier to clean the guns with the nozzle
like<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> 3-inch<00:00:59.730> nozzle<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.750> -<00:01:01.079> these<00:01:02.010> are

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
like a 3-inch nozzle that - these are

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.939 
like a 3-inch nozzle that - these are
always<00:01:02.430> filling<00:01:02.969> up<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.329> your<00:01:04.290> meeting<00:01:04.589> your

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949

your<00:01:05.580> jerky<00:01:06.090> mechs<00:01:06.439> very<00:01:07.439> unhandy<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.760> these

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
your jerky mechs very unhandy so these

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
are things that we'll see how this works

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.940 
are things that we'll see how this works

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
the back of like just kind of rode free

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.420 
the back of like just kind of rode free
back<00:04:13.880> there<00:04:14.210> okay<00:04:14.870> so<00:04:14.930> that<00:04:15.320> screws<00:04:15.740> in<00:04:16.040> it's

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
back there okay so that screws in it's

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.210 
back there okay so that screws in it's
it's<00:04:17.090> called<00:04:17.390> a<00:04:17.630> jumbo<00:04:18.140> but<00:04:18.380> that's<00:04:18.590> a<00:04:18.770> really

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
fat cell in here yeah that made a

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.620
