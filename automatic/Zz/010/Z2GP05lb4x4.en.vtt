00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
microphone on the back we've got

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.350 
microphone on the back we've got
obviously<00:02:35.950> an<00:02:36.040> eight<00:02:36.159> megapixel<00:02:36.340> camera<00:02:37.239> with

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
obviously an eight megapixel camera with

a dual LED flash and stereo speakers her
that's<00:02:40.569> obviously<00:02:40.810> lower<00:02:40.989> resolution<00:02:41.590> than

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
that's obviously lower resolution than

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.550 
that's obviously lower resolution than
the<00:02:42.340> nokia<00:02:42.970> n8<00:02:43.239> but<00:02:43.599> still<00:02:43.870> pretty<00:02:44.079> high<00:02:44.319> for<00:02:44.379> a

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
the nokia n8 but still pretty high for a

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.979 
the nokia n8 but still pretty high for a
smartphone<00:02:44.890> at<00:02:45.099> the<00:02:45.129> moment<00:02:45.720> underneath<00:02:46.720> the

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
smartphone at the moment underneath the

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.949 
smartphone at the moment underneath the
battery<00:02:47.410> compartment<00:02:48.569> it's<00:02:49.569> room<00:02:49.720> there<00:02:49.930> for

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
battery compartment it's room there for

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.670 
battery compartment it's room there for
sim<00:02:50.950> card<00:02:51.160> obviously<00:02:51.609> and<00:02:52.379> there<00:02:53.379> is<00:02:53.500> also

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.039 

just<00:02:56.680> inside<00:02:57.010> there<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.579> room<00:02:58.030> for<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.329> micro<00:02:58.840> SD

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
just inside there is room for a micro SD

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.789 
just inside there is room for a micro SD
card<00:02:59.980> so<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.280> will<00:03:00.430> fit<00:03:00.459> up<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.379> 32<00:03:02.379> gigabyte

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
card so it will fit up to 32 gigabyte

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.399 
card so it will fit up to 32 gigabyte
microSD<00:03:03.129> cards<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:03.760> thus<00:03:04.170> augmenting<00:03:05.170> the

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
microSD cards and thus augmenting the

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.490 
microSD cards and thus augmenting the
onboard<00:03:05.950> 8<00:03:06.129> gigabytes<00:03:06.609> of<00:03:06.790> storage<00:03:07.209> so<00:03:07.930> that's

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
onboard 8 gigabytes of storage so that's

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.229 
onboard 8 gigabytes of storage so that's
the<00:03:08.650> Nokia<00:03:08.890> c7<00:03:09.040> will<00:03:09.310> get<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.459> battery<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:09.940> sim

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
the Nokia c7 will get a battery and sim

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.789 
the Nokia c7 will get a battery and sim
card<00:03:10.450> in<00:03:10.540> will<00:03:10.750> turn<00:03:11.079> on<00:03:11.260> have<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.500> look<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.739> see

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
card in will turn on have a look and see

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.059 
card in will turn on have a look and see
what<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.909> UI<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.180> like<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:14.049> here's<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.379> c7

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
what the UI is like so here's the c7

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.309 
what the UI is like so here's the c7

maps<00:04:15.609> instructions<00:04:16.180> so<00:04:16.870> just<00:04:17.049> having<00:04:17.169> a<00:04:17.260> look

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
maps instructions so just having a look

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.510 
maps instructions so just having a look
at<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:20.109> two<00:04:20.349> phones<00:04:21.099> here<00:04:21.459> and<00:04:21.579> it's<00:04:21.699> just

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
at the the two phones here and it's just

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.840 
at the the two phones here and it's just
obvious<00:04:24.520> you've<00:04:24.700> got<00:04:24.849> the<00:04:25.000> n8

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
obvious you've got the n8

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.540 
obvious you've got the n8
here<00:04:26.000> which<00:04:26.690> is<00:04:26.840> slightly<00:04:27.040> slightly<00:04:28.040> larger

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
here which is slightly slightly larger

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.090 
here which is slightly slightly larger
so<00:04:28.730> the<00:04:28.850> most<00:04:29.000> squirt<00:04:29.330> off<00:04:29.800> smartphone<00:04:30.800> than

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
so the most squirt off smartphone than

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.940 
so the most squirt off smartphone than
the<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:32.210> c7<00:04:32.720> is<00:04:32.840> it's<00:04:33.500> also<00:04:33.650> thicker<00:04:35.770> as<00:04:36.770> you

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
the the c7 is it's also thicker as you

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.740 
the the c7 is it's also thicker as you
can<00:04:37.040> see<00:04:37.190> no<00:04:37.370> so<00:04:37.430> that<00:04:37.670> camera<00:04:38.240> bulge<00:04:38.420> on<00:04:38.630> the

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
can see no so that camera bulge on the

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.110 
can see no so that camera bulge on the
back<00:04:38.930> of<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.230> inators<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:39.860> to<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.730> thickness

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
back of the inators and to the thickness

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.440 
back of the inators and to the thickness
of<00:04:41.210> it<00:04:41.390> and<00:04:42.170> it's<00:04:42.410> also<00:04:42.620> a<00:04:43.010> little<00:04:43.790> wider<00:04:44.210> as

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
of it and it's also a little wider as

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.350 
of it and it's also a little wider as
well<00:04:44.600> you<00:04:44.720> might<00:04:44.840> alter<00:04:45.230> to<00:04:45.860> see<00:04:46.040> there<00:04:49.060> so<00:04:50.060> the

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
well you might alter to see there so the

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.280 
well you might alter to see there so the
c7<00:04:50.780> is<00:04:50.900> certainly<00:04:51.230> more<00:04:51.760> pocketable<00:04:53.200> than<00:04:54.200> the

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
c7 is certainly more pocketable than the

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.950 
c7 is certainly more pocketable than the
n8<00:04:54.760> just<00:04:55.760> a<00:04:55.850> little<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.180> camera<00:04:56.420> that<00:04:58.810> you<00:04:59.810> do

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
n8 just a little the camera that you do

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.870 
n8 just a little the camera that you do
lose<00:05:00.140> out<00:05:00.320> on<00:05:00.590> mega<00:05:01.010> pixels<00:05:01.430> on<00:05:01.640> the<00:05:01.730> two

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
lose out on mega pixels on the two

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.630 
lose out on mega pixels on the two
cameras<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:03.380> you<00:05:03.980> of<00:05:04.040> course<00:05:04.100> you<00:05:04.340> don't<00:05:04.430> get

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
cameras and you of course you don't get

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.370 
cameras and you of course you don't get
Zelan<00:05:05.360> flash<00:05:05.600> but<00:05:05.870> it<00:05:05.960> does<00:05:06.080> mean<00:05:06.170> that<00:05:06.230> you

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
Zelan flash but it does mean that you

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.620 
Zelan flash but it does mean that you
can<00:05:06.500> use<00:05:06.620> this<00:05:06.800> LED<00:05:07.550> flash<00:05:07.880> as<00:05:08.060> a<00:05:08.090> video<00:05:08.420> light

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
can use this LED flash as a video light

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.740 
can use this LED flash as a video light
during<00:05:08.930> video<00:05:09.080> recording<00:05:09.200> it'll<00:05:09.830> record<00:05:10.070> 720p

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
during video recording it'll record 720p

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.870 
during video recording it'll record 720p
