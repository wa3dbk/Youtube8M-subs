00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.980
 america is true in my plans and the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.140
 I'm really going to go but I still do not know 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.050
 when but I would love to go to Mexico 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.820
 truly as one of my favorite countries 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:16.890
 i love mexico we can tell this where 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:20.850
 mexico was like at 12 13 years old and I love 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.620
 mexico the food is possible but if I 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.840
 I would love to go to mass 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.780
 I asked the English that give 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.120
 you learned it if you know english I learned it 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.700
 more or less at four or five years 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.310
 that was the first opportunity that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.650
 we had to come and live here then 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.300
 Of course that helped me a lot because 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.990
 Littlest between now learns a 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.420
 language so it's easier for you to take that yes it was 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.740
 a scramble with Spanish because I in 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.620
 I had not really learned 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.810
 write or read in Spanish 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.770
 then they taught me how to write and read 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.420
 in English when I arrived here they were like 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.440
 this girl or half sir, you have me 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.240
 scrambled terrible but so like that 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.580
 our whole life has gotten us into 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.260
 bilingual schools academy my eyes 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.660
 they are obsessed in English then 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.730
 we had to practice jazz 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.110
 I had lizárraga my question against 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.630
 inspiration of your life you know for 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.340
 put you in Maria's name good I think 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.520
 who has already told that story I do not know the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.380
 true but that's retelling and it 's 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.660
 what happened was that when my mom that 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.850
 she is pregnant with me she did not know and 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.380
 they began to see the patients of alves 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.060
 they transferred a medication in the 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.580
 other medications can not take it if 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.430
 I was pregnant because I made 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.570
 babies came out with cleft lip 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.410
 then then it was that my mom gave 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.000
 mind that she was pregnant with me and 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.370
 because the doctor gave him how is the 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.320
 risk of your daughter leaving with her lip 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.000
 cleft then now that they are 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.370
 super worried in all 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.050
 ecographs the bad cords so 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.480
 covering my mouth between men 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.680
 they never knew if they were going to be with 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.260
 the cleft lip 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.200
 so if I kiss you very much 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.240
 virgin and more and when I was born it was like 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.940
 a hat we choose the biblio but 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.980
 so that's why my name is Maria 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.190
 Alejandra, my name is going to be Alejandra 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.020
 but thanks to the virgin they handle us 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.850
 then and that's my story 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.350
 name and now I'm also told that what 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.630
 more shameful that has happened in the 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.050
 schools to those from mexico greetings 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.120
 from and bancolombia from usa 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.420
 but more shameful that they have happened to me 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.420
 it was once we have a dance and we're going 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.790
 to dance samba with those of a course and the 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.740
 weapon I 've never been good at dances like 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.750
 I like to dance at parties but not 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:42.730
 in those choreographies that are as above 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.770
 I read and all I do not like so I got there 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.900
 and I remember that all the practices 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.120
 like they do not like attention to the dance 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.170
 joel as a medium I moved as for the 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.880
 note and the day of the dance I do not think that 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.810
 has been in makeup girls 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.120

 in the locker room it was glued ugly and porch 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.200
 then it was already uncomfortable 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.730
 without practice more or less I was doing that 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.940
 dance I do not think that at the entrance I 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.040
 I was first and I, as there was no 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.810

 what happened and what to put in front of 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.130
 we made the entrance as young people to more or 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.400
 except I took it out then we went up or we were 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.310
 imagine / I think that was like a 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.890
 panic shock that those that dried up 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.520
 the search could not breathe well could not 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:55.480
 I did not have saliva in my mouth 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:03.040
 disaster was dancing I did not know anything like 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:04.450
 that the complete bear in orchards asks 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.160
 what is the hardest thing to live for a while 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.750
 in another place good for me the most 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.240
 difficult to leave my family of my 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.760
 friends where I miss that very much 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.260
