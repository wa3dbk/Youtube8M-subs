on<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.570> float<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:45.660> should<00:02:45.900> hear<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.140> click

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
on the float you should hear it click

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.870 
on the float you should hear it click
and<00:02:49.070> that's<00:02:50.070> going<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.370> indicate<00:02:50.820> that

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
and that's going to indicate that

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.030 
and that's going to indicate that
basically<00:02:51.810> our<00:02:52.020> water<00:02:52.260> level<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.740> we<00:02:52.860> have

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
basically our water level that we have

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.150 
basically our water level that we have
here<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:54.230> still<00:02:55.230> within<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.650> acceptable

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
here is still within the acceptable

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.270 
here is still within the acceptable
range<00:02:56.250> because<00:02:57.320> we're<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.470> float<00:02:58.680> sitting<00:03:01.280> it

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
range because we're the float sitting it

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.310 
range because we're the float sitting it
could<00:03:02.459> still<00:03:02.700> go<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> little<00:03:03.450> bit<00:03:03.720> higher<00:03:03.930> and

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
could still go a little bit higher and

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.140 
could still go a little bit higher and
still<00:03:04.830> be<00:03:04.980> in<00:03:05.010> within<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.520> acceptable<00:03:06.090> range

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
still be in within the acceptable range

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.850 
still be in within the acceptable range
this<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:06.930> going<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.110> be<00:03:07.230> just<00:03:07.440> down<00:03:07.590> like<00:03:07.830> a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
this is going to be just down like a

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.380 
this is going to be just down like a
timed<00:03:08.250> fill<00:03:09.120> cycle<00:03:09.410> or<00:03:10.410> if<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.310> water<00:03:12.030> level

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
timed fill cycle or if that water level

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.530 
timed fill cycle or if that water level
reaches<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.290> point<00:03:13.560> where<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.830> float

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
reaches the the point where the float

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.009 
reaches the the point where the float
lifts<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:16.880> removes<00:03:17.880> power<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.540> micro

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
lifts and removes power to the micro

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.170 
lifts and removes power to the micro
switch<00:03:19.230> opens<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.070> micro<00:03:20.400> switch<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:20.880> kills

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
switch opens the micro switch that kills

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.170 
switch opens the micro switch that kills
power<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.840> inlet<00:03:22.170> valve<00:03:22.410> okay<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.670> just

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
power to the inlet valve okay I just

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.270 
power to the inlet valve okay I just
kind<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.420> visually<00:03:24.959> did<00:03:25.230> an<00:03:25.470> inspection<00:03:25.830> on

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
kind of visually did an inspection on

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.100 
kind of visually did an inspection on
the<00:03:26.400> door<00:03:26.580> gasket<00:03:26.820> here<00:03:27.330> made<00:03:27.570> sure<00:03:27.810> there<00:03:27.989> was

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
the door gasket here made sure there was

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.240 
the door gasket here made sure there was
no<00:03:28.290> rips<00:03:28.590> tears<00:03:29.510> looks<00:03:30.510> like<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.840> doors

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
no rips tears looks like the doors

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.509 
no rips tears looks like the doors
seating<00:03:32.250> up<00:03:32.489> properly<00:03:33.030> so<00:03:34.280> basically<00:03:35.280> what

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
seating up properly so basically what

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.920 
seating up properly so basically what
we're<00:03:35.640> going<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.850> do<00:03:35.940> is<00:03:36.209> advise<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.750> customer

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
we're going to do is advise the customer

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.930 
we're going to do is advise the customer
to<00:03:37.200> use<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.380> little<00:03:37.650> bit<00:03:37.709> less<00:03:37.800> soap<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.519> their

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
to use a little bit less soap on their

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.050 
to use a little bit less soap on their
wash<00:03:39.150> cycles<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:40.670> they're<00:03:41.670> still<00:03:41.910> running

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
wash cycles and they're still running

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.110 
wash cycles and they're still running
into<00:03:42.600> leaks<00:03:43.470> then<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.489> next<00:03:44.760> step<00:03:44.910> would<00:03:45.060> be

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
into leaks then the next step would be

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.930 
into leaks then the next step would be
replacement<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.140> door<00:03:46.290> gasket<00:03:46.760> I'm<00:03:47.760> just

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
replacement of the door gasket I'm just

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:56.390 
replacement of the door gasket I'm just
going<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.090> go<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.390> put<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.050> rack<00:03:49.230> back<00:03:49.260> in<00:03:55.400> I'm

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
going to go in put the rack back in I'm

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.680 
going to go in put the rack back in I'm
just<00:03:56.640> going<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:56.850> let<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.090> run<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.239> little<00:03:57.480> bit

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
just going to let it run a little bit

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.090 
just going to let it run a little bit
longer<00:03:57.959> here<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.410> see<00:03:58.590> if<00:03:58.680> we<00:03:58.800> can<00:03:58.920> actually

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
longer here to see if we can actually

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.830 
longer here to see if we can actually
see<00:03:59.519> any<00:03:59.700> kind<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.090> leak

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.780 

okay<00:04:05.840> this<00:04:06.500> is<00:04:06.650> just<00:04:06.829> after<00:04:07.010> running<00:04:07.370> it<00:04:07.549> for<00:04:07.730> a

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
okay this is just after running it for a

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.759 
okay this is just after running it for a
little<00:04:08.030> while<00:04:08.209> we<00:04:08.510> did<00:04:08.689> not<00:04:08.720> add<00:04:09.079> any<00:04:09.110> soap

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
little while we did not add any soap

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.490 
little while we did not add any soap
whatsoever<00:04:10.489> and<00:04:10.790> you<00:04:11.599> see<00:04:11.780> how<00:04:11.930> many<00:04:11.989> suds

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
whatsoever and you see how many suds

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.160 
whatsoever and you see how many suds
there<00:04:12.739> are<00:04:12.950> in<00:04:13.310> here<00:04:14.000> without<00:04:14.120> without<00:04:14.930> even

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
there are in here without without even

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.620 
there are in here without without even
putting<00:04:15.379> any<00:04:15.590> soap<00:04:15.860> in<00:04:16.009> the<00:04:16.130> unit<00:04:16.630> another

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
putting any soap in the unit another

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.120 
putting any soap in the unit another
thing<00:04:17.870> you<00:04:17.959> want<00:04:18.079> to<00:04:18.199> check<00:04:18.350> for<00:04:18.590> is<00:04:18.769> just<00:04:18.979> make

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
thing you want to check for is just make

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.689 
thing you want to check for is just make
sure<00:04:19.160> that<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.870> jet<00:04:20.870> dry<00:04:21.109> isn't<00:04:21.979> leaking<00:04:22.520> out

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:22.699 
sure that the jet dry isn't leaking out

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:25.210 
sure that the jet dry isn't leaking out
which<00:04:23.600> this<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.169> dispenser<00:04:24.650> is<00:04:24.710> still<00:04:24.949> full

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
which this the dispenser is still full

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.360 
which this the dispenser is still full
so<00:04:25.550> this<00:04:25.729> one<00:04:25.910> isn't<00:04:26.180> if<00:04:26.810> a<00:04:27.320> this<00:04:27.800> jet<00:04:28.190> dry

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
so this one isn't if a this jet dry

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.730 
so this one isn't if a this jet dry
dispenser<00:04:28.940> is<00:04:29.060> leaking<00:04:29.479> when<00:04:30.199> you<00:04:30.320> fill<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:30.650> up

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
dispenser is leaking when you fill it up

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.150 
dispenser is leaking when you fill it up
you<00:04:31.669> tip<00:04:31.940> totally<00:04:32.870> dry<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.139> door<00:04:33.470> off<00:04:33.680> then

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
you tip totally dry the door off then

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.010 
you tip totally dry the door off then
tip<00:04:34.490> it<00:04:34.639> up<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:34.940> let<00:04:35.030> it<00:04:35.150> sit<00:04:35.360> for<00:04:35.389> a<00:04:35.600> while<00:04:35.720> and

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
tip it up and let it sit for a while and

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.990 
tip it up and let it sit for a while and
you<00:04:36.770> would<00:04:36.889> see<00:04:37.070> some<00:04:37.280> streaking<00:04:37.760> down<00:04:37.789> the

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
you would see some streaking down the

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.719 
you would see some streaking down the
door<00:04:38.389> if<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:39.350> jet<00:04:39.560> dry<00:04:39.770> dispenser<00:04:40.310> is<00:04:40.370> leaking

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
door if the jet dry dispenser is leaking

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.189 
door if the jet dry dispenser is leaking
that's<00:04:40.940> also<00:04:41.270> going<00:04:41.389> to<00:04:41.449> cause<00:04:41.660> excessive

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
that's also going to cause excessive

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.520 
that's also going to cause excessive
suds<00:04:42.680> which<00:04:43.250> could<00:04:43.490> give<00:04:43.669> you<00:04:43.820> a<00:04:43.850> leak<00:04:44.530> thank
