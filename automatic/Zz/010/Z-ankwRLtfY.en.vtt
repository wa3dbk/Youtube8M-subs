00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.700
 and rational driving and 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.860
 anticipation through anticipation 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.289
 together with an adequate distance of 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.449
 security it is possible to recognize 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.060
 characteristics of traffic and its 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.100
 potential situations with what is 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.260
 will have more reaction time before 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.199
 possible contingencies arising from the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.449
 environment allows warn considered 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.880
 time the dangerous situations and 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.730
 adopt timely measures to 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.160
 dodge impending situations the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.780
 rational and anticipatory driving leads 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.850
 in a generalized way to a 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.760
 considerable increase in safety in 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.370
 the state of the traffic has to be remembered 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.800
 that in the circulation one should never 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.620
 behave in a way that results in 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.140
 or may be an obstacle hazard to 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.690
 other traffic participants 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.790
 It also assumes this attitude 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.390
 anticipatory a break for the 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.370
 driver 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.019
 usually subjected to stress 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.630
 generated by traffic cities 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.700
 dense and complex as well as by the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.520
 aggressiveness that can show the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.240
 surrounding drivers the anticipation 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.920
 It is put into practice when driving 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.330
 with a wide field of view of the road 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.790
 and the circumstances of the 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.650
 circulation an adequate field of vision 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.990
 is the one that allows to see two or three cars 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.159
 in front of one's own one is saved 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.159
 Adequate safety distance 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.660
 panorama of the traffic situation 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.640
 achieve and maintain an adequate field 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.170
 visual when driving is great 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.890
 importance when making a 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.720
 driving based on anticipation is 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.520
 has to pay attention and examine the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.700
 surrounding traffic situation 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.490
 by looking forward to 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.409
 enough distance about 200 meters 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.630
 the constant modification of the field 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.220
 visual looking behind the car by the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.520
 interior rear view mirrors and 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.020
 exteriors an attentive look 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.850
 alternatively to greater or lesser distance 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.759
 contemplate allowing way more 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.979
 wide the circulation of life should be 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.569
 maintain an adequate position both of 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.940
 the rearview mirrors as of the 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.580
 car seats being recommended 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.769
 therefore not hinder the vision with 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.959
 elements such as mats or crystals 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.030
 that prevent vision to vehicles 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.300
 that circulate behind the car that 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.300
 carries
