00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.090
 Toulouse is 17 and just above 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.180
 the zone of relegation it is absolutely necessary 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.000
 do a result against 11th reims of

 the new rookie in defense and already 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.760
 wounded akpa akpro and sylla are not 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.100

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.540
 nations side remois two players 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.780
 can be found in the can

 mendy and hooked first possibility 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.950
 for toulouse with brathwaite alone at 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.110
 second pole he rapped frame it's 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.190
 already a good first opportunity for 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.710
 the players of alain casanova 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.570
 they need to reassure themselves this is the 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.980
 case with this early domination of 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.200
 match 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.860
 the shot is sudden and balloons saved 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.399
 by johny placide a good opportunity 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.640
 for Toulouse the second of the 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.840
 match and he insists 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.480
 with this interesting new touch 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.549
 on the side the possibility of going back 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.399
 in the surface and the balloon wound 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.640
 saved by johny placid the keeper 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.810
 Reims is in great demand for 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.240
 the moment he saves his camp 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.040
 we are approaching the new mid-time 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.630
 Toulouse action with this ball that 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.540
 is not cleared by the defense of 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.140
 reims the possibility of recovery center 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.420
 of the head 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.070
 the rebound is favorable to the attacker 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.290
 is very unfavorable to the guardians 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.170
 Haitian reims the goal is signed 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.520
 aleksandar pezi tch in the 43rd minute 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.500
 this is his fifth goal of season one 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.330
 good gesture to conclude this action is 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.159
 a little bit of success because the 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.830
 ball trajectory is perfect 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:47.270
 that's 1 0 for tfc toulouse which did not 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.530
 won that three victories this 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.250
 home season 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.670
 the stadium does not succeed to the team 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.320
 local 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.490
 you have to win this kind of match is 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.950
 for now this is the case in mid 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.240
 time it is 1 to 0 toulouse that remains 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.880
 on a series of six matches without 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.159
 two-point win from time to time 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.920
 of this series of meetings is too much 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.479
 little and that explains the 17th place 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.879
 race on his side took only one point 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.480
 on the last three games hoping 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.890
 bring back at least 1 from Toulouse 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.409
 it's still possible for the team to 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.450
 jean luc vasseur and in the second half 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.129
 reims has so much trouble getting out of his 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.170
 half of the field that first is 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.480
 always toulouse who master the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.019
 events the center and the balloon 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.970
 grazed by placid recovered balloons 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.680
 with a new possibility of strikes 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.680
 rolled up but it's not framed 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.849
 regatta years to play this free kick 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.190
 this is one of the last chances of 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.690
 double the stake with a possible 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.049
 point-blank recovery it goes to 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.360
 above 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.760
 not a lot of opportunities in the 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.230
 second period and no chance of 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.379
 mark for the stage of reims 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.709
 in the end Toulouse is logical 1 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.709
 0
