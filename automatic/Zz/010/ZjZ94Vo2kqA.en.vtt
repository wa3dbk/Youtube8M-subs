00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.690
 so 

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.690
 today 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.270
 hello and welcome guys I'm axel and today 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.730
 I bring you how to kill the hyper is field 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.980
 this is an enemy that they ask us 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.410
 look for it and give us a reward for it 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.570
 It is located in the Mercator area 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.360
 any part of the good maze I 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.900
 I had already killed him but I took advantage of that 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.360
 they had asked me for help and well recorded 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.000
 fight and I'll explain how to give 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.309
 skill that is not very difficult well what 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.920
 What I recommend is giving yourself the 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.339
 I post first after going to kill the 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.050
 mod 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.910
 so that no no 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.770
 well, it's not hurting us enough 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.530
 because here we find ourselves with 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.570
 three of dry that if we do not kill them then 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.180
 we get the fill on the map 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:07.060
 the black glyphs that and it would be crazy 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.860
 well once we kill the mummy is to give 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.400
 the weakness that we will see how it is 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.370
 it is said that if we do not kill him in less 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.860
 of 10 turns that is if we kill him later 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.620
 of the turn of the 10th is still alive in 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.480
 theory dies the whole group but not what 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.400
 I have tried that is what I have been told and 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.680
 but do not always be killed before 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.310
 it's not that hard to kill him either 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.630
 take so many turns 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.899
 and little else, what I did was to throw 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.700
 all the accompanying enemies of and 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.729
 Perez field southward to one side 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.399
 so that to have them more controlled and 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.990
 Go them more by giving little by little too 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:53.390
 well there we see the little clock I had in this 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.150
 fight is very many times that's why 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.550
 fight a little bit 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.660
 and nothing else we will wait now for 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.660
 more than I soul 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:16.300
 well here as you come I came with panda sacrum 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:19.630
 if you get to the other I look for oval 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.870
 the breeds that I recommend so look at the 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.390
 nor is it mandatory 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.909
 there must be a character that moves 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.890
 can be an in and we can also see 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.650
 with the favor but also a panda 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.569
 facilitates things and software too 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.620
 facilitates a lot because we have the 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.780
 masquerade and 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.620
 and the field interest because we killed him a 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.620
 little bit faster 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.950
 what is this this character does 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.230
 if we look at the limbo that some glyphs 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.099
 blue 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.629
 let us give you the weakness we have to 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.599
 leave it or we have to we 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.890
 finish turn is not worth jumping not by 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.290
 example with him I look for we do not go no 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.810
 we can jump into the blue faucet it 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.500
 wrong and we are there we do not have to 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.500
 go walking 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.330
 and finish the turns with three characters 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.780
 or four depends on the glyphs that 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.380
 invoke 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.300
 and leave the free field diagonally to 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.550
 one of those luxuries and the 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.340
 weakness one turn and we could kill him and 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.750
 right now I have not done it because 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.280
 we are still killing the drive and the 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.950
 income match 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.160
 let's see let's wait a little bit to see 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.160
 yes 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.990
 here already kills the match angrÃ© jo and me 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.890
 I put with the drive 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.890
 I hit him 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:51.069
 from those of the enemies this is sought 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.780
 because I think he 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.280
 the most difficult to the best is the 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.350
 mechanism of that of 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.630
 Acronyms area because others 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.970
 they are relatively easy good too 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.250
 depends on the group with which it appears 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.950
 well here we are going to see the strategy that 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.250
 I already commented there we see that we have three 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.800
 glyphs if the time is already over by 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.300
 example give us 200 of life that 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.489
 it means that we have done well there 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.549
 with the software I put it diagonally with 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.989
 the panda because I already give weakness out in 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.669
 one of the glyphs and they give me 200 of 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.620
 vitality that means that like what 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.900
 we are weakening there the sacrum is 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.300
 is and already when they pay every time when 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.430
 his turn is going to be weak 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.670
 during a shift 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.650
 each free turn is fields return to 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.210
 invoke that info but in other areas 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.470
 and we will have to do the same if not 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.070
 we can kill him in a turn 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.620
 there we see that I still could not 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:50.700
 hit him but once his turn passes 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.670
 it was already there I can already hit it with 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.569
 the fk I give him everything 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.349
 now it's his turn 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:59.349
 he won drop 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.660
 for them it looks hits to anger me 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:09.090
 box that touched the anger with the 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.090
 software I give the masquerade and I hit 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.050
 and that's it 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:18.479
 I do not know how I'm going to kill him in a 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.800
 environment, it does not need to be returned 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.800
 to give the weaknesses because 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.009
 and I'm going to kill him 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:31.370
 well I finish a little bit hurt because 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:35.000
 apart from that sticking just in plan as 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:38.060
 that makes a tremor the lake allowed me 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.510
 can heal me they had nothing 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:45.150
 and apart I have a bet mask 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:48.720
 well there already with the psoe with zeal 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.550
 to paste and 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.880
 I almost kill him I still have 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:57.180
 possibility of killing him with daini 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.820
 and he is already cured and killed 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.160
 Well that's where the fight ended and nothing more 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.780
 I hope it has served you well 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.199
 this video and see you in the next one 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.199
 greeting
