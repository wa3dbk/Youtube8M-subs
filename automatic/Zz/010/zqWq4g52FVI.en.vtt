 This is why I will do this Trials Fusion 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:20.750
 This game can be played with the demo version , so it should be tried now. 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:25.099
 I'm a demo version I'm looking forward to the free version I'll do 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:28.980
 Well then I'm going from training I can clear this in one shot 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:33.059
 Here's where I work and who I like 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.110
 It is easy to understand . The god of the bike machine has finally appeared. 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.210

 Doo that and was go and I do anyway because I do not Toka again 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:05.640
 I think that the tutorial will end soon or not , and it will come back again in such a place 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.409
 It's not like that's why the field of goals is like that 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.439
 Oh 9 I do n't feel it 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:16.789
 By the way, let's go on stage next time 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:18.859
 I made a mistake because it was a tutorial at the previous time, but I think this is one shot 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:22.549
 It was also time for me to 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.890
 Zaiko This time, I do not do When you have so much mistakes because I'm introduction video 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.470
 Hyacher 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:32.490
 The first floor penguins also wait ge 8 god j 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.830
 Yoishotto this time has become a successful road's Te Ube to now laugh how funny 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:42.340
 Or say Canaan say the scenery is beautiful Naa futuristic of the large outer 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:47.229
 I'll wait for a while and come back again 3 Oh Oh, I'll miss you again 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.929
 It's a bad idea, it's a shit, it 's gonna be like it's not just a replay 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.219
 I guess this won't happen 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.219
 Good dismissed jump Jaii 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.400
 Now Tsu Mashi vulgar a lot 10 gold 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:07.420
 No it's not good, why is it this time 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:11.770
 It was a little while, but it was a goal, but it was good Daruma, and it fell again. 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.720
 Wow Ghat'm deliberately by Tsu something of the way to later until a little while ago 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.560
 Because it is production from now 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.990
 You've heard it 's perfect so many times it's something from below 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.130
 I should not have Reimu this time 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.240
 What time being such a thing is good if you are not too much rotation'll keep aside Ikure 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.560
 Is it natural 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.500
 It seems that it is better to be careful because there is a lot of mistakes if you ride too hard and you rotate too much 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.620
 I have fallen 4 but 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.640
 If the main character absolutely falls down, your feet will not clog 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.300
 What it is but to say that if you go with the impression I have about time the wind doing this game 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.790
 Though 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.860
 First of all, the image quality is good. This will be understood if you look at it already. 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.490
 is 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.970
 Because it only moves this with full hd with game note pc It is exaggeration to say that it is light 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.130
 I do not think 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.220
 Finally funny at the end 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.819
 It is usually interesting 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.350
 So the goal is large 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.569
 Well what bran 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.069
