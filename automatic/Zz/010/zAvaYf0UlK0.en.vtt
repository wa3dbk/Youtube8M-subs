the study of agri biodiversity nutrition

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.360 
the study of agri biodiversity nutrition
can<00:00:06.779> be<00:00:06.870> done<00:00:07.049> in<00:00:07.200> many<00:00:07.350> different<00:00:07.620> ways<00:00:07.830> and

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
can be done in many different ways and

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.509 
can be done in many different ways and
many<00:00:08.880> different<00:00:09.059> pathways<00:00:09.750> we've<00:00:10.590> decided<00:00:11.190> to

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
many different pathways we've decided to

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.520 
many different pathways we've decided to
look<00:00:11.730> at<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.910> very<00:00:12.240> important<00:00:12.870> pathway<00:00:13.349> at

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
look at a very important pathway at

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.870 
look at a very important pathway at
least<00:00:13.710> we<00:00:13.860> think<00:00:14.040> it's<00:00:14.190> very<00:00:14.309> important<00:00:14.790> in

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
least we think it's very important in

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.300 
least we think it's very important in
the<00:00:14.970> context<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.750> what<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.560> means<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.099> a

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
the context of what it means to have a

the context of what it means to have a
diet<00:00:17.760> that's<00:00:18.080> sustainable<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:19.739> use<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.099> term

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
diet that's sustainable we use the term

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.890 
diet that's sustainable we use the term
sustainable<00:00:20.759> diets<00:00:21.150> because<00:00:21.269> we<00:00:21.570> want<00:00:21.810> to

sustainable diets because we want to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.679 
sustainable diets because we want to

what those foods for them means they
