00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.640
 what is and will happen today that is 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.980
 first episode of the one by one showdown 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.440
 which is that shock and of which I speak from a 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.330
 little time you users through 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.880
 an inscription made a few weeks ago 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.480
 you will have the chance to inspire me one 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.760
 against one 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.469
 within the league of legends game 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.230

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.360
 Wednesday from 3 to about 6 maybe 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.220
 I will hopefully not a little bit and in the 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.739
 today's episode will challenge the tops 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.210
 eight that is the best 8 of the whole 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.880
 ranking made with members 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.670
 inside the shop these best 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.800
 eight are 5 diamond2 respectively 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.079
 platinum is a gold within the new 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.270
 ram system that to go into 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.570
 Specifically the participants will be Doctor 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:02.140
 matt in phage a khelfa set jake mai dax 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.700
 92 brits are northern and tax rock these 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.280
 players will compete in clashes 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.189
 direct and who will win who in short who 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.539
 will remain last will also remain in the 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.249
 next bet this up to a 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:14.020
 maximum of three episodes as I think 

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:16.270
 you will know by now after the various videos I have 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.649
 done explaining how it will work 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.899
 in the next times then I will prepare a 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.119
 exhaustive video that explains for good how 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.429
 the whole tournament works so face up 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.560
 in short, done with all the necessary trappings 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:28.569
 for now I haven't had much time in 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.590
 this period so I was 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:31.899
 mainly engaged in organizing 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.490
 the thing once the thing starts 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.679
 he thinks he also has time to 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.329
 prepare some sample videos 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.549
 of how everything will work 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.039
 I can tell you it's a novelty let's say ho 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.740
 thought to do some kind of small 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.569
 gift to those who win every bet in short 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.409
 who wins every bet will have in that 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:52.419
 bet on a 975 rp skin with 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.159
 this I simply want to reward 

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:56.439
 a little bit who wins but I wouldn't want that 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.789
 then the people end up turning 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.419
 insults or miscellaneous things then me 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.889
 I recommend 

00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:01.509
 try to keep it always on 

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:02.060
 fun because like I said this 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.220
 it is not 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.380
 a tournament, but it's a show 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.380
 for fun that very often not 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.300
 it will be balanced, in short, look for some 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.560
 to understand this too 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.810
 so the only thing I can add 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.489
 is that it will be a great cool so 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.830
 try to be there you try to be 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.209
 numerous and even if you are perhaps gods 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.140
 players who will play in the next ones 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.880
 bets 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.099
 at least look at how it will work 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.380
 so that since I'm sure that 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.849
 things will not go as planned there 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.319
 will be someone who will not understand etc. in 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.630
 so that then from the following episodes 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.850
 let everything be clear to the participants 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.790
 I greet you see you on my channel 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.819
 of twitter you see said I think but from 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.280
 some part and see you just at 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.170
 15 ie 3 o'clock this afternoon between 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.470
 half an hour maybe depends on when the 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.370
 video 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.370
 Hello
