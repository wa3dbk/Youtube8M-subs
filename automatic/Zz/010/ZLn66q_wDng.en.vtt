those in middle school too but the only

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.330 
those in middle school too but the only
problem<00:03:03.350> with<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.560> is<00:03:03.800> that<00:03:03.830> it<00:03:04.100> doesn't

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
problem with that is that it doesn't

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.590 
problem with that is that it doesn't

the way these like on my face um the

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
only problem is that they're kind of

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.620

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
but if you ever have that kind of

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.710 
but if you ever have that kind of
