00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:12.630
 cigarettes so with you modern said 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:17.310
 uganda him this milk we don't have our 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:24.960
 written republic of belarus and how then 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:33.710
 I read there that the video will be right after 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:36.059
 drinking from the garage drinking coffee 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.390
 Well what I would like in a nutshell 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.010
 tell how people have said a little bit 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.530
 write here saw him onions recorded 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.730
 video then again a little hang out 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.180
 I would like to tell a little about about 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:56.809
 this knife knife just saw everything 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:03.989
 Raven would like to show it on macro 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:08.580
 all did it better by ok here 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:16.950
 such a nose wore it can be said on 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:20.400
 pocket days can be five rude fly 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.939
 I liked all the shoals I told 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.830
 I also want to show my 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.140
 Basically, here I have everything beautiful 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.900
 it is in this place that you look at it all 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:37.590
 exactly here here 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:42.689
 here we see yes that is basically all 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.750
 little knees we say so 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.030
 Togo 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.119
 curve to right a little bit but it's like 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.770
 business is excusable 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.470
 Considering that ours will fix all thousands 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.390
 rubles you can understand and I have a castle 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.440
 so it doesn't close like this 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.700
 closes 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.660
 in a nutshell what was in this countess 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.350
 at first everything was fine 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.360
 the blade stroke was by the way that's what 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.970
 I liked it and the course of the blade at this knife 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.380
 really soft i'm now a little bit all 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.690
 this business pulled on accordingly 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.840
 understood looked spoons these 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.660
 I twist here we mean these are 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.880
 banks they are rolled on one side 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.210
 it turns out flush stand to checkboxes under 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.760
 to this water as it is called to the liner 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.770
 But from this side, just under the screwdriver 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.590
 under the cross and then this type of screw 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.170
 the screw it is hidden exactly like 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.890
 nicely tightened everything was good wedge 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.490
 We have come, in principle, you will not find fault with 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.730
 the center here can be seen that a little bit of the company 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.480
 centered but it is in the process of walking 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:59.300
 He almost do not have liked this wedge 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.300
 This here is polished g10 in this place 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.190
 everywhere there is such a cool transition 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.160
 made here we want we can still with you 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.709
 look and see basically everything there 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.239
 exactly but the problem was shorter 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.970
 this castle in this thing on unwound 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.980
 constantly that is, I first think cho for 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.670
 bullshit 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.980
 I not have been able to penetrate think happened 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.170
 so I dismantled it all when 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.720
 tightened up a little bit anyway 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.730
 all the cogs gave a bit here tightened 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.620
 wine means that the backlash 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.080
 backlash by the way still enjoyed it until 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.150
 the elevator was not at all but a little bit more 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.400
 pull I think it was more reliable because 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.810
 that to me the game is like this with a knife 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.170
 I like it but Iâ€™m for reliability 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.670
 there is suddenly something if you do to 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.650
 construction was the most robust here 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.930
 this one here is a cog he constantly with this 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.459
 hand she spun up and it turns out 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.810
 he concluded this way in 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.959
 back it turns out yes and for may 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.920
 jammed 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.900
 I took it apart took the plate unscrewed 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.450
 dig there 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:17.940
 as it is called well, this is shorter shit 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:20.359
 no which thickener not to 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.760
 spun the point all over the head 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.560
 thread lock yes all done twisted 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.030
 it seems to have leveled it looked exactly 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.060
 beautifully smooth ride 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.310
 there was no such backlash here 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.820
 now some kind of garbage with this knife 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.700
 that is, you walk like this all promod 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.039
 opens closes then bang on not 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:46.770
 accounting attacks here now 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:48.660
 again stuck monsters yes nothing before 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.850
 she is ok then not ok 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.780
 really just such moments 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.700
 when he is straight 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.919
 right now there is such a moment that 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.320
 wedge it apart just already 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.150
 reluctance all sat so well I think but 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.729
 develops with well, it seems to have all 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.830
 to disassemble it is real with this 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.580
 lock, I have a little bit now 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.510
 walks well 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:15.599
 now again he is wedging a knife with character 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.419
 steel is usually everywhere signed here 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.130
 for some reason we have not signed 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:24.810
 Well, in the rest, in principle, in principle 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:27.840
 I am more than pleased with the knife of course 111 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.229
 compare wrong said 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.470
 far far away and we have enough jambs 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:37.620
 but no less pleasantly 111 specialist 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.990
 already quite juice or dog us honeycomb and 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.120
 I would like to say a few words 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:49.150
 it is to be and that is to show how they want 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:51.130
 Once again, I have a little stretched 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.950
 there is a single cant too drown 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:57.910
 here we see this side 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:00.160
 we have more metals so here it should 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:04.210
 be generally good lucky draw out 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.840
 words can be ok but everyone can 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.840
 Thank you for watching 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:15.220
 the whole and no matter how old the faces said in my ear 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:20.460
 kosyachny cover that is, the knife is removed from 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:23.310
 us to the blade here and if we will 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:28.120
 dress it on the right on the right side 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:31.420
 trousers will not be repeated that is 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.850
 take it out but its wrong once 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:38.260
 you have to intercept ethiopia 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:40.720
 you take him for a fool dota yes there is 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.480
 hole on when a hurricane is like this here 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.730
 matt them crawl and a little bit you 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.560
 pulled out then took a fool pulled out a 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:52.140
 then it should be that is 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.140
 show wires pull out give attack 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.700
 This did not cut himself so live 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.650
