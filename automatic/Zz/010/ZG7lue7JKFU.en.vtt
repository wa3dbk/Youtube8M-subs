we<00:00:10.879> need<00:00:11.059> to<00:00:11.180> supplement<00:00:11.840> with<00:00:11.930> it<00:00:12.049> can<00:00:12.200> we<00:00:12.290> get

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
we need to supplement with it can we get

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.360 
we need to supplement with it can we get
enough<00:00:12.620> from<00:00:12.799> our<00:00:12.950> diet

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
enough from our diet

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.669 
enough from our diet
what<00:00:13.520> does<00:00:13.639> calcium<00:00:14.420> actually<00:00:14.900> do<00:00:15.139> for<00:00:15.349> us<00:00:15.469> and

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
what does calcium actually do for us and

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.190 
what does calcium actually do for us and
if<00:00:15.920> we<00:00:16.400> do<00:00:16.670> need<00:00:16.880> to<00:00:17.029> supplement<00:00:17.240> what's<00:00:18.050> the

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
if we do need to supplement what's the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.720 
if we do need to supplement what's the
best<00:00:18.380> kind<00:00:18.560> of<00:00:18.650> supplement<00:00:19.130> to<00:00:19.220> get<00:00:19.369> now<00:00:19.580> it's

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
best kind of supplement to get now it's

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.210 
best kind of supplement to get now it's
clear<00:00:20.119> that<00:00:20.300> our<00:00:20.750> ancient<00:00:21.140> ancestors<00:00:21.800> did<00:00:21.980> get

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
clear that our ancient ancestors did get

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.650 
clear that our ancient ancestors did get
a<00:00:22.399> lot<00:00:22.610> of<00:00:22.759> calcium<00:00:22.939> whether<00:00:23.360> they<00:00:23.509> were

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
a lot of calcium whether they were

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.780 
a lot of calcium whether they were
reaching<00:00:23.810> on<00:00:24.230> bones<00:00:24.560> or<00:00:25.040> domesticating

animals and having a lot of dairy
products<00:00:27.439> there<00:00:27.829> was<00:00:27.980> a<00:00:28.040> lot<00:00:28.640> of<00:00:28.669> calcium<00:00:29.300> in

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
products there was a lot of calcium in

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.540 
products there was a lot of calcium in
the<00:00:29.419> diet<00:00:29.450> above<00:00:30.050> and<00:00:30.320> beyond<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:31.099> probably

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
the diet above and beyond the probably

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.790 
the diet above and beyond the probably
already<00:00:31.759> ample<00:00:32.509> amount<00:00:32.750> of<00:00:32.840> calcium<00:00:33.649> in<00:00:33.739> the

vegetables<00:00:36.110> that<00:00:36.410> made<00:00:36.950> up<00:00:37.130> them<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:37.730> vast

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
vegetables that made up them the vast

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.200 
vegetables that made up them the vast
majority<00:00:38.300> of<00:00:38.840> our<00:00:39.320> ancient<00:00:39.920> ancestors<00:00:40.880> diet

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
majority of our ancient ancestors diet

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.950 
majority of our ancient ancestors diet
okay<00:00:41.810> so<00:00:42.260> what<00:00:42.830> does<00:00:43.040> calcium<00:00:43.820> actually<00:00:44.720> do

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
okay so what does calcium actually do

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.200 
okay so what does calcium actually do
for<00:00:45.200> us<00:00:45.320> well<00:00:45.530> we<00:00:45.590> all<00:00:45.710> know<00:00:45.890> it<00:00:46.310> builds<00:00:46.820> bone

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
for us well we all know it builds bone

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.880 
for us well we all know it builds bone
which<00:00:47.510> is<00:00:47.540> of<00:00:47.780> course<00:00:47.990> very<00:00:48.140> important<00:00:48.650> it

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
which is of course very important it

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.800 
which is of course very important it
helps<00:00:49.190> to<00:00:49.310> buffer<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:50.150> acid<00:00:50.630> in<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.750> stomach

that<00:04:23.370> we<00:04:23.520> get<00:04:23.760> this<00:04:24.060> huge<00:04:24.450> dose<00:04:24.690> of<00:04:24.900> calcium
