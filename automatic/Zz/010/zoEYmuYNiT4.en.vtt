00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
time to do that because again they have

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.760 
time to do that because again they have
pride<00:02:00.400> in<00:02:00.549> their<00:02:00.670> product<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:02.170> a<00:02:02.290> metal<00:02:02.560> ring

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
the difference between real and fake

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.640 
the difference between real and fake
because<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.539> fakes<00:02:10.750> are<00:02:10.929> getting<00:02:11.230> very<00:02:11.470> good

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650
