but today I'm just going to give you the

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.759 
but today I'm just going to give you the
basics<00:00:30.560> first<00:00:31.340> off<00:00:31.700> what<00:00:32.300> is<00:00:32.329> warping<00:00:32.899> it's<00:00:33.589> a

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:33.769 
basics first off what is warping it's a

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:35.650 
basics first off what is warping it's a
process<00:00:34.039> that<00:00:34.280> allows<00:00:34.699> you<00:00:34.910> to<00:00:34.940> take<00:00:35.210> an<00:00:35.359> audio

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
process that allows you to take an audio

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.200 
process that allows you to take an audio
clip<00:00:35.899> that<00:00:36.170> has<00:00:36.350> its<00:00:36.559> own<00:00:36.800> tempo<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:37.519> make<00:00:38.030> it

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
clip that has its own tempo and make it

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.150 
clip that has its own tempo and make it
fit<00:00:38.420> to<00:00:38.600> your<00:00:38.629> project<00:00:39.079> which<00:00:39.649> has<00:00:39.679> another

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
fit to your project which has another

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.029 
fit to your project which has another
tempo<00:00:40.690> we're<00:00:41.690> going<00:00:41.809> to<00:00:41.870> be<00:00:41.989> using<00:00:42.019> this<00:00:42.679> clip

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
tempo we're going to be using this clip

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.360 
tempo we're going to be using this clip
right<00:00:43.309> here<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:44.019> actually<00:00:45.019> this<00:00:45.769> section<00:00:46.249> of

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
right here and actually this section of

00:00:46.370 --> 00:01:01.930 
right here and actually this section of
the<00:00:46.399> clip<00:00:59.530> just<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.620> very<00:01:00.890> basic<00:01:01.190> drum<00:01:01.670> loop

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
the clip just a very basic drum loop

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.210 
the clip just a very basic drum loop
that's<00:01:02.179> actually<00:01:02.690> kind<00:01:02.870> of<00:01:02.929> funky<00:01:03.319> the<00:01:03.979> goal

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
that's actually kind of funky the goal

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.150 
that's actually kind of funky the goal
is<00:01:04.519> to<00:01:04.790> give<00:01:05.059> that<00:01:05.300> at<00:01:05.510> that<00:01:05.570> tempo<00:01:06.410> to<00:01:06.920> fit<00:01:07.130> our

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
is to give that at that tempo to fit our

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:15.670 
is to give that at that tempo to fit our
project<00:01:07.880> at<00:01:08.090> this<00:01:08.630> temple<00:01:13.780> yeah<00:01:14.780> sounds<00:01:15.590> like

to a metronome you want to use warp from
here<00:03:40.739> straight<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:42.030> reason<00:03:42.480> is<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:42.959> temple

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
here straight the reason is that temple

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.009 
here straight the reason is that temple
is<00:03:43.799> less<00:03:44.040> likely<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.579> drift<00:03:44.940> as<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.569> may<00:03:45.720> if<00:03:45.900> it

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
is less likely to drift as it may if it

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.140 
is less likely to drift as it may if it
were<00:03:46.109> played<00:03:46.349> by<00:03:46.379> a<00:03:46.620> human<00:03:46.919> since<00:03:47.790> I'm<00:03:47.970> pretty

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
were played by a human since I'm pretty

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.300 
were played by a human since I'm pretty
sure<00:03:48.359> this<00:03:48.569> was<00:03:48.720> made<00:03:48.930> in<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.109> 60s<00:03:49.620> or<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.799> 70s

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
sure this was made in the 60s or the 70s

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.520 
sure this was made in the 60s or the 70s
and<00:03:50.430> played<00:03:50.970> by<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.239> live<00:03:51.540> drummer<00:03:51.840> we're<00:03:52.410> going

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
and played by a live drummer we're going

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.270 
and played by a live drummer we're going
to<00:03:52.620> use<00:03:52.799> warp<00:03:53.160> from<00:03:53.340> here<00:03:53.720> click<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:54.959> now<00:03:55.769> our

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
to use warp from here click that now our

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:04.189 
to use warp from here click that now our
clip<00:03:56.669> sounds<00:03:57.000> like<00:03:57.180> this<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:03.750> reason<00:04:04.079> it

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
clip sounds like this the reason it

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.080 
clip sounds like this the reason it
sounds<00:04:04.530> like<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:04.919> is<00:04:05.099> because<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:05.879> matches

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
sounds like that is because it matches

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.170 
sounds like that is because it matches
our<00:04:06.329> tempo

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.080 

see<00:04:12.180> how<00:04:12.299> easy<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.659> was<00:04:13.129> once<00:04:14.129> again<00:04:14.310> this<00:04:14.909> is

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
see how easy that was once again this is
