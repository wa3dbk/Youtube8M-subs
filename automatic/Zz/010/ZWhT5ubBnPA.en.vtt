power

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.960 

become<00:02:58.670> more<00:02:58.909> efficient

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:34.660 

better

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.640 

working<00:03:35.390> a<00:03:35.480> speed<00:03:35.750> bag<00:03:35.930> takes<00:03:36.230> a<00:03:36.349> little<00:03:36.530> bit

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
working a speed bag takes a little bit

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.860 
working a speed bag takes a little bit
of<00:03:36.709> time<00:03:36.950> so<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.280> got<00:03:37.490> to<00:03:37.610> be<00:03:37.700> patient<00:03:37.910> every

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
of time so you got to be patient every

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.900 
of time so you got to be patient every
day<00:03:39.020> if<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:39.410> allow<00:03:39.920> yourself<00:03:40.099> every<00:03:40.610> day<00:03:40.640> is

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
day if you allow yourself every day is

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.460 
day if you allow yourself every day is
something<00:03:41.090> you'll<00:03:41.420> become<00:03:41.720> very<00:03:41.959> efficient

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
something you'll become very efficient

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.410 
something you'll become very efficient
at<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.800> so<00:03:43.220> when<00:03:43.400> you<00:03:43.489> try<00:03:43.730> some<00:03:43.970> you<00:03:44.150> start

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
at it so when you try some you start

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.850
