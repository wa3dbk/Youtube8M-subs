about a hundred meters to go to where I

about a hundred meters to go to where I
need<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.660> go<00:00:13.009> and<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.160> didn't<00:00:14.400> bother<00:00:14.490> dropping

a<00:00:15.059> tire<00:00:15.299> pressures<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.960> little<00:00:16.379> bit<00:00:16.560> lower

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
a tire pressures that little bit lower

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.679 
a tire pressures that little bit lower
down<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.789> 16<00:00:18.300> PSI<00:00:18.720> but<00:00:19.320> got<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> really<00:00:20.039> cool

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
down to 16 PSI but got a really cool

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.029 
down to 16 PSI but got a really cool
accessory<00:00:21.689> that's<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.410> get<00:00:22.529> us<00:00:22.590> out<00:00:22.859> of

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
accessory that's going to get us out of

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.609 
accessory that's going to get us out of
this<00:00:23.250> little<00:00:23.430> bog<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.420> our<00:00:24.570> way<00:00:24.750> called

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
this little bog and on our way called

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.990 
this little bog and on our way called
max<00:00:25.949> tracks<00:00:27.410> now<00:00:28.410> these<00:00:29.250> max<00:00:29.580> tracks<00:00:29.760> they're

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
max tracks now these max tracks they're

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.299 
max tracks now these max tracks they're
actually<00:00:30.269> made<00:00:30.480> out<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.900> nylon<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.619> look<00:00:32.160> it's

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
actually made out of nylon and look it's

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.549 
actually made out of nylon and look it's
a<00:00:32.369> pretty<00:00:32.550> simple<00:00:32.790> idea<00:00:33.350> slightly<00:00:34.350> more

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
a pretty simple idea slightly more

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.040 
a pretty simple idea slightly more
refined<00:00:35.520> than<00:00:35.670> throwing<00:00:36.090> sticks<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.690> logs<00:00:36.809> in

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
refined than throwing sticks and logs in

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.530 
refined than throwing sticks and logs in
front<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.380> your<00:00:37.500> tires<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.520> same<00:00:39.149> sort<00:00:39.480> of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
front of your tires but the same sort of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.959 
front of your tires but the same sort of
principle<00:00:40.079> only<00:00:40.320> much<00:00:40.500> cleaner<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.160> much

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
principle only much cleaner and much

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.450 
principle only much cleaner and much
smarter<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.260> really<00:00:43.980> smart

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
smarter this is just a really smart

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.860 
smarter this is just a really smart
design<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> think<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.360> mean<00:00:45.480> you've<00:00:45.600> got<00:00:45.629> your

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
design I think I mean you've got your

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.049 
design I think I mean you've got your
handles<00:00:46.320> here<00:00:46.590> right<00:00:47.280> up<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.550> down<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.879> so

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
handles here right up and down it so

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.020 
handles here right up and down it so
it's<00:00:48.210> dead<00:00:48.420> easy<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.780> grab<00:00:49.020> from<00:00:49.260> any<00:00:49.559> angle

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
it's dead easy to grab from any angle

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.880 
it's dead easy to grab from any angle
obviously<00:00:51.030> you've<00:00:51.420> got<00:00:51.629> your<00:00:51.780> ramp<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.320> both

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
obviously you've got your ramp on both

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.630 
obviously you've got your ramp on both
ends<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.270> really<00:00:54.480> smart<00:00:54.840> thing<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.980> on

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
ends but the really smart thing is on

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.170 
ends but the really smart thing is on
the<00:00:57.149> back<00:00:57.329> end<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.829> works<00:00:59.550> like<00:01:00.149> a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the back end here this works like a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.569 
the back end here this works like a
shovel<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.960> little<00:01:01.170> bit<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.559> shovel<00:01:01.890> work<00:01:02.100> will

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
shovel a little bit of shovel work will

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.090 
shovel a little bit of shovel work will
get<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> long<00:01:03.329> way<00:01:03.470> when<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.619> comes<00:01:04.860> to

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
get you a long way when it comes to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.010 
get you a long way when it comes to
getting<00:01:05.339> out<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.820> bog<00:01:06.060> with<00:01:06.510> one<00:01:06.720> vehicle

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
getting out of the bog with one vehicle

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.929 
getting out of the bog with one vehicle
you<00:01:07.590> don't<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:07.860> need<00:01:08.040> one<00:01:08.250> pair<00:01:08.580> much<00:01:08.790> at

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
you don't really need one pair much at

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.490 
you don't really need one pair much at
the<00:01:09.000> time<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.270> I've<00:01:09.630> got<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> couple<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.260> pairs

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
the time but I've got a couple of pairs

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.219 
the time but I've got a couple of pairs
here<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.580> put<00:01:11.909> them<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.210> all<00:01:12.869> four

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
here so that I can put them on all four

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.980 
here so that I can put them on all four
tires<00:01:13.560> recent<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.670> got<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> bit<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.780> load<00:01:15.960> on

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
tires recent be got a bit of a load on

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.570 
tires recent be got a bit of a load on
the<00:01:16.170> back<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.890> whenever<00:01:17.040> there's<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.400> load<00:01:17.549> on

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the back and whenever there's a load on

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.429 
the back and whenever there's a load on
the<00:01:17.729> back<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.210> makes<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.110> little<00:01:19.320> bit

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
the back that makes it that little bit

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.039 
the back that makes it that little bit
more<00:01:19.650> difficult<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.090> driving<00:01:21.540> wheels<00:01:21.780> of

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
more difficult for the driving wheels of

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.080 
more difficult for the driving wheels of
the<00:01:22.110> vehicle<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.799> we'll<00:01:23.220> pop<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.610> each<00:01:23.790> tire

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the vehicle so we'll pop on each tire

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.969 
the vehicle so we'll pop on each tire
this<00:01:24.479> time<00:01:24.750> around<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.259> there<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.770> go<00:01:25.950> just

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
this time around and there we go just

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.950 
this time around and there we go just
drop<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:27.210> right<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.600> front<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
drop it in there right in front of the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.830 
drop it in there right in front of the
tire<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:29.130> that's<00:01:29.340> budding<00:01:29.820> up<00:01:29.939> ready<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.570> drive

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
tire so that's budding up ready to drive

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.140 
tire so that's budding up ready to drive
straight<00:01:31.590> onto<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> platform<00:01:32.490> now<00:01:32.640> there's

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
straight onto the platform now there's

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.870 
straight onto the platform now there's
no<00:01:33.390> need<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.689> rev<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.170> madly<00:01:34.439> simply<00:01:35.310> idle<00:01:35.579> of

one<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.180> platforms<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.710> should<00:01:37.920> be

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
one of the platforms and you should be
