00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.190
 here is a simple guide 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.100
 that will teach you in a few minutes 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.140
 application of the sentence 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.330
 the case applied to a glass in 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.820
 external position first need to 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.070
 to uniformly wet the glass e 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.090
 with a scraper remove it all 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.390
 dirty present I recommend you insist 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.160
 very well on the edges and dry well in 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.280
 uniformly the frame of the 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.280
 window 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.960
 at this point you can take the 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.390
 film make a lot of roll 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.890
 tight and with the help of teeth or 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.290
 two pieces of Scotch and put 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.260
 at the corner you can separate the wood and 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.309
 protective from the film itself 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.610
 separate the layer from the film 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:05.900
 wet the roll and adhere to the 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:08.360
 protective layer wet vaporising in 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.600
 uniformly your glass e 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.070
 switch to the application of the film 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.350
 take the roll and place it a 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.690
 about a centimeter from the upper side e 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.549
 from the right side of the frame and unrolled 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.740
 taking care that the protective layer 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.939
 stay on the side to extend the film by 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.539
 I recommend removing the layer 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.189
 protective only after completion of operation a 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.170
 this point the film will move 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.159
 again and you can place it in the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.820
 best way possible 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.229
 in the upper side and in the right side 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.109
 make sure the surface of the 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.450
 film always remains wet and with the 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:44.500
 pull the water take the first pass on the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.240
 very light film 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.600
 again wetting the film take the 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.630
 spatula and pressing a little more 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.520
 you can remove more water in 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.369
 so that the film adheres 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.890
 even more to the glass with the spatula 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.479
 in Teflon and the cutter you can define the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.479
 edges of your film 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.659
 with the blue spatula with the spatula in 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.549
 teflon 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:24.290
 at this point we can after 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.760
 wet the film press 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.590
 further on the film itself 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:35.870
 so that almost all the water neither 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:37.719
 a Teflon spatula comes out 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.459
 let's define further 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:42.459
 application of the film on the edges 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.709
 now that the completed application we can 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.040
 wash the glass and dry it with the 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.040
 pulls water 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.900
 this being an installed film 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.250
 to a glass chamber and then in position 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.409
 external 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.049
 we're going to apply a little curbs 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.090
 silicone so that the outer edges of the 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.659
 film are protected by agents 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.659
 weather
