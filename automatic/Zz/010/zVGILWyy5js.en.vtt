00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
library but there's a little bit of a

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.840 
library but there's a little bit of a
workaround<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.160> do<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.550> i'll<00:00:20.640> show

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
workaround that we can do and i'll show

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.580 
workaround that we can do and i'll show
you<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.060> just<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.330> second<00:00:21.750> but<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.470> give

you in just a second but just to give
you<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> brief<00:00:22.949> overview<00:00:25.070> what<00:00:26.070> we're<00:00:26.189> going<00:00:26.310> to

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
you a brief overview what we're going to

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.120 
you a brief overview what we're going to
do<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.730> place<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.510> library<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.650> public

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
do is place the library in a public

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.209 
do is place the library in a public
location<00:00:29.310> because<00:00:30.210> by<00:00:30.390> default<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:31.219> itunes

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
location because by default the itunes

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.110 
location because by default the itunes
library

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
library

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.200 
library
puts<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.540> under<00:00:34.079> your<00:00:34.469> account<00:00:34.680> under<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
puts it under your account under the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.920 
puts it under your account under the
computer<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.960> multiple<00:00:37.829> users<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.610> access

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
computer and multiple users can access

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.200 
computer and multiple users can access
your<00:00:39.930> iTunes<00:00:40.530> library<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:41.520> makes<00:00:41.760> sense

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
your iTunes library that makes sense

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.970 
your iTunes library that makes sense
I<00:00:42.239> think<00:00:42.719> that'll<00:00:42.899> make<00:00:43.020> sense<00:00:43.050> more<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.680> just

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
I think that'll make sense more in just

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.350 
I think that'll make sense more in just
a<00:00:44.040> second<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.550> let's<00:00:44.730> go<00:00:44.820> ahead<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.059> hop<00:00:45.149> into

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
a second so let's go ahead and hop into

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.270 
a second so let's go ahead and hop into
the<00:00:45.510> computer<00:00:45.809> here<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.590> iTunes<00:00:46.800> already

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
the computer here I have iTunes already

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.130 
the computer here I have iTunes already
fired<00:00:47.489> up<00:00:47.899> okay<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.149> also<00:00:51.149> I'm<00:00:51.360> signed<00:00:51.989> in

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
fired up okay so and also I'm signed in
to<00:00:52.289> my<00:00:52.320> account<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.340> go<00:00:53.520> up<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.640> store

see<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> path<00:01:11.189> where<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.360> at<00:01:12.540> where<00:01:13.380> this

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
see the path where this is at where this

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.340 
see the path where this is at where this
file<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.369> located<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:15.270> actually<00:01:15.689> located<00:01:15.840> on

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
file is located it's actually located on

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.810 
file is located it's actually located on
my<00:01:16.710> external<00:01:17.220> hard<00:01:17.790> drive<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.509> not<00:01:18.840> under

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
my external hard drive so it's not under

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.160 
my external hard drive so it's not under
music<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:22.850> iTunes<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:24.479> everything

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
music and iTunes because everything

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.580 
music and iTunes because everything
under<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:26.640> iTunes<00:01:27.240> folder<00:01:27.570> under<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.170> music

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
under the iTunes folder under your music

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.910 
under the iTunes folder under your music
is<00:01:28.799> connected<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.060> your<00:01:30.689> account<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
is connected to your account on the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.999 
is connected to your account on the
computer<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.970> other<00:01:33.210> accounts<00:01:33.810> can't<00:01:34.229> access

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
computer so other accounts can't access

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.789 
computer so other accounts can't access
that<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:36.090> that's<00:01:36.270> why<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:36.630> need<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.810> place<00:01:37.110> your

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
that so that's why we need to place your

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.160 
that so that's why we need to place your
library<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.930> a<00:01:40.159> public<00:01:41.210> folder<00:01:42.210> whether<00:01:42.810> it's

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
library in a public folder whether it's

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.859 
library in a public folder whether it's
on<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.890> computer<00:01:44.040> or<00:01:44.640> an<00:01:44.970> external<00:01:45.360> doesn't

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
on the computer or an external doesn't

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.130 
on the computer or an external doesn't
really<00:01:46.020> matter<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:48.090> way<00:01:48.299> multiple<00:01:48.780> accounts

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
really matter that way multiple accounts

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.530 
really matter that way multiple accounts
can<00:01:49.290> access<00:01:49.710> them<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.399> also<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.360> make

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
can access them but we also have to make

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.649 
can access them but we also have to make
iTunes<00:01:52.140> speak<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:53.030> specific<00:01:54.030> folder<00:01:54.450> as

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
iTunes speak to that specific folder as

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.899 
iTunes speak to that specific folder as
well<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.649> you'll<00:01:56.189> see<00:01:56.340> what<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.520> mean<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.820> a

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
well so you'll see what I mean in a

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.929 
well so you'll see what I mean in a
second<00:01:57.360> if<00:01:57.450> we<00:01:58.170> go<00:01:58.380> back<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.649> iTunes<00:01:59.520> here<00:02:01.939> you

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
second if we go back to iTunes here you

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.060 
second if we go back to iTunes here you
want<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.299> cruise<00:02:03.689> up<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.930> iTunes<00:02:04.409> go<00:02:05.009> to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
want to cruise up to iTunes go to

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.359 
want to cruise up to iTunes go to
preferences<00:02:05.899> okay<00:02:06.899> make<00:02:07.469> sure<00:02:07.500> you're<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.979> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
preferences okay make sure you're on the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.800 
preferences okay make sure you're on the
Advanced<00:02:09.030> tab<00:02:09.239> here<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.910> then<00:02:12.330> we<00:02:12.480> want<00:02:12.690> to

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
Advanced tab here and then we want to

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.520 
Advanced tab here and then we want to
change<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
change the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.250 
change the
folder<00:02:13.920> location<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.570> is<00:02:15.720> basically

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
folder location so this is basically

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.590 
folder location so this is basically
