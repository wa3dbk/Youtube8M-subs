00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.460
 if you have 65,000 euros for a car 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.370
 You could then have disposal 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.169
 Imagine the money for a hyundai 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.199
 why not spend for 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:16.080
 these, such as hyundai genesis, these 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:18.689
 sports sedan is almost five meters long 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.669
 has a 3.8 liter six-cylinder engine 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:25.800
 with 315 ps and is almost complete 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:29.419
 equipped and I would say it 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.320
 It is worthwhile that we look there 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:36.950
 even the door ever quite difficult 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.730
 pretty massive first impression here 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:44.660
 wooden leather everywhere little buttons 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.370
 looks almost like a bentley symbol 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.950
 hyundai genesis is this and not 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.240
 some german class limousine was 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.860
 you might suspect if you are 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.380
 Look around here just like that 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.170
 this little clock here in the 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.310
 middle console looks well but otherwise it 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.310
 everything feels really good 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.500
 fine leather the wood here 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.970
 So that act did really good 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.200
 high quality impression 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.210
 By the way, here is one 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.160
 eight-speed automatic built the action 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.200
 even develops the comes 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.200
 genesis standard with all-wheel drive 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.520
 so you sit here behind then you see 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.800
 also which claim this 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.990
 sports sedan has two here 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.909
 single seats in the middle could be for 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.780
 not even someone else sitting or the 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.240
 very uncomfortable 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.190
 much more important and much more fun 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.810
 what I am here in this console 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.930
 I can hide here 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.420
 sit very loose and then fluffy 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.940
 can drive this seat forward from 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.729
 here on the passenger seat after 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.860
 do it in the front 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.800

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.020
 a really nice lying position and 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.820
 I could also use it from Munich 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.820
 to be driven to hamburg 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.660
 for those who can not believe it 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.850
 this crisp stern is it again 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.040
 hyundai genesis marriage 3 8 liters and 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:32.430
 under this tailgate hides 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.890
 beware a huge black hole almost 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.190
 500 liters of luggage compartment volume and the 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.180
 Seats can also be folded down 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.150

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.980
