00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:21.349

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:25.609

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:30.410

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:34.399
 such covers from the car so as to 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.250
 music today we put away heads with 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:42.100
 penny front board and all factory 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:48.770
 these are the ones I put brought the wires 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:55.850
 there they go here to hide here 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:01:03.670
 go here is the wire and went there here itself 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:12.189
 I put the magnet here and so it goes 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:15.259
 from this column the wires here and here 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:20.560
 there is no house connected but the wiring with 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:23.530
 the monitor is almost kind but ok and here 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.689

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.689
 cord cord to battery plus 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:42.790
 do so connect take red and 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.790
 yellow wire 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:55.020
 done here connected as yellow wire 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:57.090
 and these two wires are + red + yellow 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.620
 it is a memory wire that is when you 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.320
 turn off the mass 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.050
 you have a memory where 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:10.740
 stopped on the hell of music right here 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:16.080
 there is a way out and connect up plus here we are 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:20.250
 let's go and black wire that is mass 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:24.750
 but minus put on the ground on the cab one 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.680
 here you will find bolts to screw everything 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.860
 so I tell if will put 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:37.170
 four columns at once to the front 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.970
 right put 2 gray wires on 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.190
 recorders 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.790
 then put two on the left column 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:49.200

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.530

00:02:49.200 --> 00:03:00.120
 purple wire with coin 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:03.170
 so now turn on the mass here and turn on 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.170
 I myself did not understand it 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.480
