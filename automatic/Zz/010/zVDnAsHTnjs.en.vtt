wanted to first of all change our

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.700 
wanted to first of all change our
dynamic<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:12.960> far<00:01:13.170> as<00:01:13.259> our<00:01:13.380> floats<00:01:13.590> are

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
dynamic as far as our floats are

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.770 
dynamic as far as our floats are
concerned<00:01:14.040> typically<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> past<00:01:15.240> we've

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
concerned typically in the past we've

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.050 
concerned typically in the past we've
had<00:01:15.810> floats<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:17.009> collage<00:01:17.580> kind<00:01:18.000> of

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
had floats that have a collage kind of

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.029 
had floats that have a collage kind of
feel<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.270> them<00:01:18.630> they<00:01:19.110> are<00:01:19.140> hodgepodge<00:01:19.560> there's

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
feel to them they are hodgepodge there's

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.350 
feel to them they are hodgepodge there's
a<00:01:20.100> lot<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.460> different<00:01:20.759> elements<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.180> are

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
a lot of different elements that are

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.359 
a lot of different elements that are
stuffed<00:01:21.539> onto<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.899> float<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.410> they<00:01:22.830> all<00:01:22.979> fins

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
stuffed onto the float and they all fins

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.710 
stuffed onto the float and they all fins
words<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.759> thematic<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.570> they<00:01:24.690> are

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
words that thematic but that they are

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.050 
words that thematic but that they are
all<00:01:25.080> separate<00:01:25.649> and<00:01:25.800> different<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.820> one

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
all separate and different this is one

all separate and different this is one
of<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> very<00:01:27.360> first<00:01:27.479> times<00:01:27.720> we've<00:01:27.930> taken<00:01:28.110> one

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
of the very first times we've taken one

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.609 
of the very first times we've taken one
single<00:01:28.890> piece<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.550> made<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.300> one<00:01:30.570> giant<00:01:31.289> float

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
single piece and made it one giant float

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.830 
single piece and made it one giant float
and<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.490> also<00:01:32.670> wanted<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.180> play<00:01:33.360> into<00:01:33.539> a<00:01:33.570> couple

laid on all of those ribs and they will

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.250 
laid on all of those ribs and they will
actually<00:03:32.040> spin<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.790> change<00:03:33.030> color
