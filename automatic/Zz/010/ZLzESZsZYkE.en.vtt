00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:07.410
 this adapter from apples old 30 pin 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.250
 connector connection on the new 8 pin 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.380
 lightning connection for the iphone 5 for 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.120
 the ipod touch fifth generation ipad 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.539
 mini ipad 4 and probably too 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.690
 future generations of apple 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.670
 Devices are available for about five euros 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.800
 to be purchased from amazon 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.060
 you can find the link to this article 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.800
 As always in the description of this 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.330
 video about buying this or one 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.439
 other articles about this link would 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.719
 I am very happy 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.539
 because with that you support this youtube 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.079
 channel yes what else is adapter yet 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:41.909
 it will load the terminal on it 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.670
 synchronizes the terminal with the 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:47.940
 computer but it does not transmit audio 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.359
 or video signals that's important too 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.120
 knowledge 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.739
 it fits the lightning relatively well 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.809
 connection is up slightly wider the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.269
 means with pockets with cases you will 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.859
 because problems get the depth of the 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.319
 connection is not very big 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.520
 Of course, the purchase only makes sense if 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:07.650
 yes already old accessories from the 30 pin 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.800
 generation owns so you can the field 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.580
 continue to use the new terminals 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.800
 and yes the adapter works it fits 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.010
 of course, then there is quality 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.340
 potential for improvement 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.970
 but the original apple lay it 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.640
 of course much more 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.650
 as well as the actual lightning 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.140
 plug one can the adapter if he 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.840
 because a 30 pin connector is sunk 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.640
 of course in every page in every one 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.050
 direction would have to use it then 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.110
 do not pay attention once again 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.090
 infected is the terminal charging 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.970
 actually as fast as with 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.580
 an original plug and yes how 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.350
 said the link to Amazon 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.870
 her in the description for this video 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.700
 did you use such an adapter the 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.380
 such even it's for you too 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.920
 I would appreciate your own 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.450
 comments and opinions and up to date 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.450
 to the next video ciao
