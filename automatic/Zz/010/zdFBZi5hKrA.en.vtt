with a specific battery charger and

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.080 
with a specific battery charger and
we're<00:03:25.790> seeing<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.540> couple<00:03:27.500> reasons<00:03:27.709> why<00:03:28.129> right

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
we're seeing a couple reasons why right

what happens with this and that this is

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
here this is not an AGM but this is why

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.369 
here this is not an AGM but this is why
even<00:03:50.180> though<00:03:50.359> the<00:03:50.540> book<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:51.019> comes<00:03:51.199> with

even though the book that comes with

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
been on charge for about an hour hour

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.089 
been on charge for about an hour hour
and<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.709> half<00:04:01.599> the<00:04:02.599> battery<00:04:02.959> show<00:04:03.169> in<00:04:03.319> 15<00:04:03.530> point

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
and a half the battery show in 15 point

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.780 
and a half the battery show in 15 point
16<00:04:04.669> volts<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.530> if<00:04:06.530> you<00:04:06.650> charge<00:04:06.979> an<00:04:07.189> AGM

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
16 volts and if you charge an AGM

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.580 
16 volts and if you charge an AGM
battery<00:04:08.299> and<00:04:08.540> you're<00:04:08.720> pushing<00:04:09.169> that<00:04:09.319> much

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
battery and you're pushing that much

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.619 
battery and you're pushing that much
voltage<00:04:09.889> and<00:04:10.519> you<00:04:10.669> can<00:04:10.790> see<00:04:10.970> I<00:04:11.000> got<00:04:11.180> my<00:04:11.239> leads

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
voltage and you can see I got my leads

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.089 
voltage and you can see I got my leads
going<00:04:11.959> right<00:04:12.199> to<00:04:12.319> the<00:04:12.349> battery<00:04:12.769> so<00:04:12.919> that's

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
going right to the battery so that's

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.819 
going right to the battery so that's
where<00:04:13.280> it's<00:04:13.430> hooked<00:04:13.750> here's<00:04:14.750> my<00:04:14.930> test<00:04:15.169> leads

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
where it's hooked here's my test leads

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.819 
where it's hooked here's my test leads
here<00:04:16.310> going<00:04:16.519> up<00:04:16.669> to<00:04:16.849> the<00:04:16.970> bat<00:04:17.090> to<00:04:17.329> my

here going up to the bat to my
multimeter<00:04:18.829> here<00:04:19.810> an<00:04:20.810> AGM<00:04:21.409> battery<00:04:21.799> will<00:04:21.950> dry

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:22.279 
multimeter here an AGM battery will dry

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:24.250 
multimeter here an AGM battery will dry
out<00:04:22.610> because<00:04:22.909> you're<00:04:23.300> overheating<00:04:24.020> it<00:04:24.139> at

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
out because you're overheating it at

out because you're overheating it at
that<00:04:24.409> temperature<00:04:24.800> and

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
that temperature and

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.580 
that temperature and

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
voltage of that thing settled down so it

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.160 
voltage of that thing settled down so it

are<00:05:07.290> a<00:05:07.320> lot<00:05:07.470> more<00:05:07.500> resilient<00:05:08.340> because<00:05:08.460> they

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
are a lot more resilient because they

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.100 
are a lot more resilient because they
have<00:05:08.970> that<00:05:09.090> liquid<00:05:09.570> in<00:05:09.690> there<00:05:09.870> that<00:05:10.020> can

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
have that liquid in there that can

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.470 
have that liquid in there that can

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
batteries don't have that luxury so if

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.450 
batteries don't have that luxury so if
