00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.520 

I've<00:00:00.390> got<00:00:00.539> a<00:00:00.570> few<00:00:00.719> questions<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:01.230> other<00:00:01.380> day

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
I've got a few questions the other day

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.679 
I've got a few questions the other day
about<00:00:01.709> people's<00:00:02.399> crested<00:00:02.760> geckos<00:00:03.090> not<00:00:03.360> moving

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
about people's crested geckos not moving

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.590 
about people's crested geckos not moving
around<00:00:03.899> their<00:00:04.110> tanks<00:00:04.650> now<00:00:05.549> there's<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.210> reason

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
around their tanks now there's a reason

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.390 
around their tanks now there's a reason
this<00:00:06.750> could<00:00:07.049> be<00:00:07.170> happening<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.859> that<00:00:08.220> might

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
this could be happening and that might

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.440 
this could be happening and that might
be<00:00:08.429> because<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.820> haven't<00:00:09.059> got<00:00:09.240> enough

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
be because you haven't got enough

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.320 
be because you haven't got enough
climbing<00:00:09.960> things<00:00:10.260> for<00:00:10.800> your<00:00:11.010> crested<00:00:11.670> gecko<00:00:12.030> I

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
climbing things for your crested gecko I

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.270 
climbing things for your crested gecko I
did<00:00:12.780> want<00:00:12.990> see<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> tank<00:00:13.500> where<00:00:13.830> there<00:00:14.009> was<00:00:14.130> like

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
did want see a tank where there was like

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.609 
did want see a tank where there was like
one<00:00:14.639> artificial<00:00:15.480> plant<00:00:15.719> one<00:00:16.049> side<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.529> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
one artificial plant one side of the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.980 
one artificial plant one side of the
tank<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.490> was<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.539> thought<00:00:18.810> I

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
tank and that was it and I thought I

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.300 
tank and that was it and I thought I
will<00:00:19.080> ask<00:00:19.289> their<00:00:19.410> gonna<00:00:19.560> walk<00:00:19.740> around<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
will ask their gonna walk around the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.779 
will ask their gonna walk around the
walls<00:00:20.570> they're<00:00:21.570> just<00:00:21.840> not<00:00:22.230> going<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.830> climb

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
walls they're just not going to climb

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.400 
walls they're just not going to climb
everywhere<00:00:24.180> not<00:00:24.539> like<00:00:24.720> they<00:00:24.869> would<00:00:25.170> naturally

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
everywhere not like they would naturally

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.460 
everywhere not like they would naturally
do<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.060> would<00:00:27.330> say<00:00:27.599> if<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.869> don't<00:00:28.019> have<00:00:28.289> that

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
do so I would say if you don't have that

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.640 
do so I would say if you don't have that
many<00:00:28.710> vines<00:00:29.400> or<00:00:29.880> branches<00:00:30.480> or<00:00:30.510> plants<00:00:31.230> then

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
many vines or branches or plants then

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.560 
many vines or branches or plants then
your<00:00:31.830> gecko<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.250> probably<00:00:32.610> not<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.270> move

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
your gecko is probably not going to move

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.130 
your gecko is probably not going to move
around<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:33.960> much<00:00:35.570> another<00:00:36.570> thing<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.960> consider

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
around so much another thing to consider

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.959 
around so much another thing to consider
is<00:00:37.500> they<00:00:37.710> probably<00:00:37.890> do<00:00:38.219> move<00:00:38.460> around<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:38.850> you

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
is they probably do move around but you

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.139 
is they probably do move around but you
don't<00:00:39.210> see<00:00:39.420> them<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.370> when<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.550> love<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.850> smaller

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
don't see them so when I love a smaller

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.180 
don't see them so when I love a smaller
I'd<00:00:42.420> rally<00:00:42.780> see<00:00:43.110> her<00:00:43.290> move<00:00:43.500> around<00:00:43.739> she's<00:00:44.040> sort

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
I'd rally see her move around she's sort

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.470 
I'd rally see her move around she's sort
of<00:00:44.250> freeze<00:00:44.520> when<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> light<00:00:44.969> comes<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
of freeze when the light comes on and

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.799 
of freeze when the light comes on and
then<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.320> nothing<00:00:46.969> since<00:00:47.969> I've<00:00:48.149> had<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.360> nearly

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
then do nothing since I've had a nearly

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.529 
then do nothing since I've had a nearly
a<00:00:48.840> year<00:00:49.140> now<00:00:49.379> she<00:00:49.440> has<00:00:49.950> got<00:00:50.190> more<00:00:50.370> use<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.879> me<00:00:51.030> so

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
a year now she has got more use to me so

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.750 
a year now she has got more use to me so
I<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> TV<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.489> room<00:00:53.640> will

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
I can have like the TV on the room will

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.729 
I can have like the TV on the room will
be<00:00:53.850> dark<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> TV<00:00:54.570> you'll<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:54.960> or<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> can

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
be dark but the TV you'll be on or I can

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.920 
be dark but the TV you'll be on or I can
just<00:00:55.949> have<00:00:56.250> my<00:00:56.280> laptop<00:00:56.730> screen<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
just have my laptop screen like the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.080 
just have my laptop screen like the
light<00:00:58.079> from<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.859> she<00:00:59.550> now<00:00:59.789> move

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
light from that on and she now move

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.299 
light from that on and she now move
around<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.050> hear<00:01:01.289> her<00:01:01.469> jumping<00:01:01.980> and

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
around and I can hear her jumping and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.160 
around and I can hear her jumping and
climbing<00:01:02.640> different<00:01:03.329> things<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.080> that's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
climbing different things so that's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.380 
climbing different things so that's
really<00:01:04.470> cool<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.489> think<00:01:05.909> near<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
really cool but I do think near the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.359 
really cool but I do think near the
start<00:01:06.659> when<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.930> first<00:01:07.170> get<00:01:07.380> them<00:01:07.590> they<00:01:08.130> might

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
start when you first get them they might

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.250 
start when you first get them they might
be<00:01:08.610> thinking<00:01:08.790> she<00:01:09.330> could<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> predator<00:01:09.869> or

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
be thinking she could be a predator or

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.380 
be thinking she could be a predator or
he<00:01:10.380> could<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.680> predator<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.909> they're

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
he could be a predator and so they're

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.969 
he could be a predator and so they're
freeze<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.049> not<00:01:13.080> do<00:01:13.290> anything<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.920> think

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
freeze and not do anything and I think

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.380 
freeze and not do anything and I think
after<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.400> while<00:01:14.460> they<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.760> realized<00:01:15.299> that

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
after a while they just realized that

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.450 
after a while they just realized that
you're<00:01:15.570> not<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.780> threat<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.350> then<00:01:16.920> they<00:01:17.250> can

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you're not a threat and then they can

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.190 
you're not a threat and then they can
keep<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.000> moving<00:01:19.070> one<00:01:20.070> time<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.729> was<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
keep on moving one time I was in the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.620 
keep on moving one time I was in the
hallway<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.520> light<00:01:23.729> was<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.030> shining

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
hallway and the light was just shining

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.380 
hallway and the light was just shining
one<00:01:24.900> part<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.409> vilas<00:01:25.740> tank<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.759> my<00:01:27.000> whole<00:01:27.150> room

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
one part of vilas tank but my whole room

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.719 
one part of vilas tank but my whole room
was<00:01:27.570> dark<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.259> could<00:01:28.439> see<00:01:28.680> her<00:01:28.920> run<00:01:29.369> up<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
was dark but I could see her run up the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.490 
was dark but I could see her run up the
wall<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.090> I've<00:01:30.180> never<00:01:30.509> seen<00:01:30.840> him<00:01:30.990> move<00:01:31.140> so

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
wall and I've never seen him move so

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.600 
wall and I've never seen him move so
quickly<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.950> they<00:01:32.040> couldn't<00:01:32.310> believe<00:01:32.430> I

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
quickly and they couldn't believe I

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.219 
quickly and they couldn't believe I
thought<00:01:33.030> she's<00:01:33.210> always<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.600> slow<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.079> she

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
thought she's always so slow and she

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.380 
thought she's always so slow and she
just<00:01:34.380> ran<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.070> wall<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.729> I'm<00:01:35.970> along<00:01:36.240> in

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
just ran up this wall and I'm along in

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.780 
just ran up this wall and I'm along in
the<00:01:36.479> parts<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.079> amazing<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the parts and is amazing and then the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.090 
the parts and is amazing and then the
other<00:01:38.939> day<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.210> decided<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.840> get<00:01:39.930> my<00:01:40.100> infrared

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
other day I decided to get my infrared

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.410 
other day I decided to get my infrared
camera<00:01:41.850> out<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.299> film<00:01:42.869> her<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:44.149> was<00:01:45.149> stood

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
camera out to film her and I was stood

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.600 
camera out to film her and I was stood
in<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.689> pitch-black<00:01:46.020> room<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:47.070> didn't<00:01:47.340> even<00:01:47.460> know

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
in a pitch-black room I didn't even know

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.859 
in a pitch-black room I didn't even know
where<00:01:47.790> she<00:01:47.820> was<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.149> didn't<00:01:48.509> even<00:01:48.600> know<00:01:48.720> where

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
where she was I didn't even know where

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.590 
where she was I didn't even know where
to<00:01:48.899> point<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.439> camera<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.210> think<00:01:51.210> I'm<00:01:51.420> pretty

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
to point this camera I think I'm pretty

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.179 
to point this camera I think I'm pretty
sure<00:01:51.810> she<00:01:52.049> could<00:01:52.259> see<00:01:52.439> me<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:52.860> stood<00:01:53.159> there

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
sure she could see me just stood there

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.069 
sure she could see me just stood there
so<00:01:53.520> she<00:01:53.579> was<00:01:53.850> slower<00:01:54.210> than<00:01:54.479> I've<00:01:54.600> seen<00:01:54.899> her

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
so she was slower than I've seen her

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.080 
so she was slower than I've seen her
move<00:01:55.290> but<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.369> see<00:01:56.520> she<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.939> like

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
move but as you can see she just like

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.440 
move but as you can see she just like
moves<00:01:57.420> along<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.020> background<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:59.450> normal

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
moves along the background just normal

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.959 
moves along the background just normal
and<00:02:00.689> it's<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.829> be<00:02:02.009> quite<00:02:02.219> rare<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.759> see

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
and it's it can be quite rare to see

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.510 
and it's it can be quite rare to see
this

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.360 

so<00:02:10.520> to<00:02:10.580> sum<00:02:11.030> up<00:02:11.240> there's<00:02:11.540> two<00:02:12.200> points<00:02:12.650> about

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
so to sum up there's two points about

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.370 
so to sum up there's two points about
this<00:02:13.670> one<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.480> could<00:02:14.660> just<00:02:14.870> be<00:02:15.020> you<00:02:15.050> don't<00:02:15.260> have

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
this one it could just be you don't have

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.780 
this one it could just be you don't have
enough<00:02:15.620> decorations<00:02:16.220> for<00:02:16.400> them<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.640> move

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
enough decorations for them to move

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.550 
enough decorations for them to move
around<00:02:17.030> in<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.450> they<00:02:17.600> love<00:02:17.870> loads<00:02:18.230> of<00:02:18.440> things

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
around in and they love loads of things

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.160 
around in and they love loads of things
to<00:02:18.830> climb<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:19.580> if<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.540> don't<00:02:20.690> have<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:20.960> add

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
to climb so if you don't have that add

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.500 
to climb so if you don't have that add
some<00:02:21.230> more<00:02:21.590> decorations<00:02:21.710> or<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:23.270> could<00:02:23.390> be

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
some more decorations or it could be

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.810 
some more decorations or it could be
just<00:02:23.720> number<00:02:23.930> two<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.860> just<00:02:25.190> don't<00:02:25.460> see

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
just number two that you just don't see

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.170 
just number two that you just don't see
it

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
it

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.420 
it
