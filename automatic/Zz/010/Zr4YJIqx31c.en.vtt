00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.670 
my faith in them as a band was rekindled
a<00:02:08.790> little<00:02:09.060> bit<00:02:09.210> because<00:02:09.420> with<00:02:09.780> each<00:02:10.020> record<00:02:10.410> of

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
a little bit because with each record of

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.530 
a little bit because with each record of
theirs<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.130> have<00:02:11.340> been<00:02:11.490> following<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.240> far

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
theirs that I have been following so far

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.330 
theirs that I have been following so far
they've<00:02:12.750> always<00:02:12.930> dropped<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.620> three<00:02:14.160> or<00:02:14.310> four

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
they've always dropped to three or four

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.540 
they've always dropped to three or four
songs<00:02:14.880> on<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:15.870> loved<00:02:16.500> but<00:02:17.310> then<00:02:17.430> the

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
songs on to it that I loved but then the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.240 
songs on to it that I loved but then the
rest<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:17.940> record<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.540> can<00:02:19.260> kind<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.740> take<00:02:20.010> or

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
rest of the record I can kind of take or

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.160 
rest of the record I can kind of take or
leave<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.210> was<00:02:21.540> kind<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.840> hoping<00:02:22.020> that

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
leave so I was kind of hoping that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.870 
leave so I was kind of hoping that
singles<00:02:22.590> would<00:02:22.710> just<00:02:22.860> push<00:02:23.130> me<00:02:23.310> over<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.700> edge

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
singles would just push me over the edge

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.630 
singles would just push me over the edge

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
because here with a lot of the tracks I

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.640 
because here with a lot of the tracks I
feel<00:03:02.790> like<00:03:02.910> they<00:03:03.090> play<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.570> kind<00:03:04.110> of<00:03:04.320> safe

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
feel like they play it kind of safe

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.370 
feel like they play it kind of safe
instrumentally<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.760> vocally<00:03:06.690> while<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.019> lot

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
instrumentally and vocally while a lot

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.320 
instrumentally and vocally while a lot
of<00:03:07.500> tracks<00:03:07.769> here<00:03:08.040> are<00:03:08.190> catchy<00:03:08.519> there<00:03:09.239> are

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
of tracks here are catchy there are

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.449 
of tracks here are catchy there are
really<00:03:09.480> only<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.840> few<00:03:09.900> spots<00:03:10.470> where<00:03:10.980> future

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
really only a few spots where future

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.790 
really only a few spots where future
islands<00:03:11.730> come<00:03:11.970> off<00:03:12.090> as<00:03:12.269> fierce<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:13.200> top<00:03:13.590> of

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
islands come off as fierce on top of

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.150 
islands come off as fierce on top of
that<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.280> feel<00:03:15.000> this<00:03:15.239> record<00:03:15.690> does<00:03:16.160> exemplify

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
that I feel this record does exemplify

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.210 
that I feel this record does exemplify
an<00:03:18.060> Achilles<00:03:18.540> heel<00:03:18.570> that<00:03:19.019> I<00:03:19.050> think<00:03:19.590> has<00:03:20.190> been

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
an Achilles heel that I think has been

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.130 
an Achilles heel that I think has been
following<00:03:21.000> future<00:03:21.330> islands<00:03:21.750> through<00:03:21.930> nearly

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
following future islands through nearly

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.650 
following future islands through nearly
every<00:03:22.769> record<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.310> theirs<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.269> that's<00:03:24.480> the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
every record of theirs and that's the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.930 
every record of theirs and that's the
production<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.470> me<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.650> lot<00:03:26.070> of<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.280> songs<00:03:26.580> here

bright<00:03:37.080> I<00:03:37.320> think<00:03:37.650> overall<00:03:37.950> the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
bright I think overall the

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.470 
bright I think overall the
instrumentation<00:03:38.910> on<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.180> thing<00:03:39.330> is<00:03:39.450> a

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
instrumentation on this thing is a

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.930 
instrumentation on this thing is a
little<00:03:39.600> sapped<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.590> color<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.280> beats<00:03:41.519> on<00:03:41.760> this

instrumentation more aggressively

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.130 
instrumentation more aggressively
especially<00:03:55.470> as<00:03:55.620> these<00:03:55.890> songs<00:03:56.299> explode<00:03:57.299> in<00:03:57.660> two

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
especially as these songs explode in two

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.229 
especially as these songs explode in two
choruses<00:03:58.709> where<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.190> seems<00:03:59.519> like<00:03:59.850> it's<00:04:00.120> really

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
choruses where it seems like it's really

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.780 
choruses where it seems like it's really
only<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.780> synthesizers<00:04:01.590> or<00:04:01.799> maybe<00:04:02.370> even<00:04:02.459> some

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
only the synthesizers or maybe even some

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.789 
only the synthesizers or maybe even some
distorted<00:04:03.269> bass<00:04:03.420> that<00:04:03.720> gets<00:04:03.900> louder<00:04:04.139> and<00:04:04.500> I'm

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
distorted bass that gets louder and I'm

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.379 
distorted bass that gets louder and I'm
not<00:04:04.980> that<00:04:05.160> crazy<00:04:05.430> about<00:04:05.639> some<00:04:05.970> of<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.120> synth

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389

in terms of placement I feel like

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.030 
in terms of placement I feel like
there's<00:04:27.570> not<00:04:27.690> a<00:04:27.750> whole<00:04:27.960> ton<00:04:28.140> of<00:04:28.230> precision<00:04:28.830> to

the way these synths are played and the
bass<00:04:30.810> tone<00:04:31.110> leaves<00:04:31.380> a<00:04:31.560> lot<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:31.770> be<00:04:31.950> desired<00:04:32.220> as

sound or kind of this bland distortion

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.070 
sound or kind of this bland distortion
that<00:04:38.010> brings<00:04:38.430> a<00:04:38.550> bit<00:04:38.670> of<00:04:38.700> heaviness<00:04:39.210> when<00:04:39.960> the

occasionally<00:04:42.840> I<00:04:42.870> feel<00:04:43.290> like<00:04:43.410> the

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
occasionally I feel like the

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.080 
occasionally I feel like the
instrumentation<00:04:44.100> here<00:04:44.460> shoots<00:04:44.820> for

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
instrumentation here shoots for

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.020 
instrumentation here shoots for
something<00:04:45.420> sort<00:04:45.630> of<00:04:45.690> quaint<00:04:46.470> light<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.610> little

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
really even give the record a bit of

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.120 
really even give the record a bit of
punch<00:05:45.570> or<00:05:45.750> make<00:05:45.870> it<00:05:45.990> seem<00:05:46.169> like<00:05:46.290> it<00:05:46.440> has<00:05:46.650> a<00:05:46.680> bit
