00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:10.170
 year cis likely to meet in Minsk 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:14.430
 well, Minsk is a holy place for the cis after 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.549
 the collapse of the Soviet Union so I 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.799
 I will initiate in every way 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:23.159
 this will be my function if 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.780
 Minsk will be the venue

 This is a small load for Georgian 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.020
 politicians and you know i'm convinced 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.030
 even if saakashvili had a party 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.869

 season until the president and even if his 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.210
 the party won I am convinced that Michael 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.640
