going back out to the arm I'm taking an

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.479 
going back out to the arm I'm taking an
extra<00:02:20.019> nerve<00:02:20.230> that's<00:02:20.650> still<00:02:20.889> attached<00:02:21.219> to<00:02:21.400> the

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
extra nerve that's still attached to the

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.509 
extra nerve that's still attached to the
brain<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:22.120> jumping<00:02:23.049> it<00:02:23.200> over<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.889> provide<00:02:24.310> the

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
brain and jumping it over to provide the

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.830 
brain and jumping it over to provide the
signal<00:02:24.999> for<00:02:25.569> some<00:02:26.049> hand<00:02:26.349> function<00:02:27.069> or

signal for some hand function or

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.110 
signal for some hand function or
prehension<00:02:28.840> so<00:02:29.260> they<00:02:29.379> can<00:02:29.560> independently

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
prehension so they can independently

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.179 
prehension so they can independently
grasp<00:02:31.120> objects<00:02:31.870> which<00:02:32.109> they<00:02:32.139> weren't<00:02:32.590> able<00:02:32.859> to

surgery and a year of intensive physical
therapy<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:39.219> patient<00:02:39.400> regained<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.299> ability

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:40.419 
therapy the patient regained the ability

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.319 
therapy the patient regained the ability
to<00:02:40.959> pinch<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.560> can<00:02:42.159> now<00:02:42.310> feed<00:02:42.669> himself<00:02:42.879> and

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
to pinch and can now feed himself and

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.050 
to pinch and can now feed himself and
right<00:02:44.079> with<00:02:44.379> some<00:02:44.620> assistance<00:02:44.889> with<00:02:45.819> this

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
right with some assistance with this

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.750 
right with some assistance with this
surgery<00:02:46.359> some<00:02:47.349> patience<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.129> required

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
surgery some patience is required

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.449 
surgery some patience is required
because<00:02:49.389> there's<00:02:50.079> not<00:02:50.290> an<00:02:50.530> immediate<00:02:51.069> result

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
because there's not an immediate result

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.890 
because there's not an immediate result
because<00:02:51.879> when<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.150> cut<00:02:52.449> the<00:02:52.659> nerve

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
because when you cut the nerve

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.830 
because when you cut the nerve
unfortunately<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:54.340> nerve<00:02:54.549> fiber<00:02:54.849> will<00:02:55.359> die

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
unfortunately the nerve fiber will die

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.259 
unfortunately the nerve fiber will die
back<00:02:56.199> so<00:02:56.769> we<00:02:56.949> have<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.370> cut<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:57.730> nerve<00:02:57.879> to

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
back so we have to cut the nerve to

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.869 
back so we have to cut the nerve to
reroute<00:02:58.719> it<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.049> splice<00:02:59.439> it<00:02:59.469> to<00:03:00.189> the<00:03:00.639> nerve

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
reroute it and splice it to the nerve

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.909 
reroute it and splice it to the nerve
that<00:03:00.909> we<00:03:01.359> didn't<00:03:01.659> have<00:03:01.840> control<00:03:02.290> over<00:03:02.319> and

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
that we didn't have control over and

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.699 
that we didn't have control over and
when<00:03:03.579> we<00:03:03.730> cut<00:03:03.969> it<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.329> has<00:03:04.569> to<00:03:04.599> grow<00:03:04.989> back<00:03:05.379> it

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
when we cut it it has to grow back it

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.509 
when we cut it it has to grow back it
will<00:03:06.069> grow<00:03:06.370> back<00:03:06.609> it<00:03:07.209> takes<00:03:07.480> about<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:08.709> month<00:03:09.340> to

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
will grow back it takes about a month to

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.149 
will grow back it takes about a month to
get<00:03:10.030> an<00:03:10.150> inch<00:03:10.419> of<00:03:10.689> growth<00:03:11.109> in<00:03:11.379> that<00:03:11.409> nerve<00:03:11.889> and

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
get an inch of growth in that nerve and

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.399 
get an inch of growth in that nerve and
it<00:03:12.579> will<00:03:12.819> grow<00:03:13.060> back<00:03:13.299> to<00:03:13.569> the<00:03:13.689> muscle<00:03:14.049> that<00:03:14.079> we

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
it will grow back to the muscle that we

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.670 
it will grow back to the muscle that we
want<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:15.219> get<00:03:15.549> control<00:03:15.939> over<00:03:16.079> but<00:03:17.079> it<00:03:17.469> will

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
want to get control over but it will

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.309 
want to get control over but it will
take<00:03:17.919> several<00:03:18.220> months<00:03:18.519> to<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.209> year<00:03:19.299> so<00:03:20.139> they

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
take several months to a year so they

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.080 
take several months to a year so they
won't<00:03:20.439> wake<00:03:20.859> up<00:03:21.099> and<00:03:21.370> all<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.609> a<00:03:21.669> sudden<00:03:21.699> be

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
won't wake up and all of a sudden be

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.899 
won't wake up and all of a sudden be
able<00:03:22.359> to<00:03:22.449> pinch<00:03:22.780> it's<00:03:23.379> usually<00:03:23.680> at<00:03:24.129> about<00:03:24.459> six

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:24.909 
able to pinch it's usually at about six

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.119 
able to pinch it's usually at about six
months<00:03:25.419> that<00:03:25.780> they<00:03:26.019> start<00:03:26.319> developing<00:03:26.590> a

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
months that they start developing a

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.249 
months that they start developing a
flicker<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.549> motion<00:03:28.120> so<00:03:28.479> they<00:03:28.720> do<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.930> lot<00:03:29.049> of

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:29.259 
flicker of motion so they do a lot of

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.229 
flicker of motion so they do a lot of
therapy<00:03:29.829> it's<00:03:30.040> sort<00:03:30.280> of<00:03:30.340> tricking<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.970> brain

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
therapy it's sort of tricking the brain

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.289 
therapy it's sort of tricking the brain
and<00:03:31.629> re-educating<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.799> to<00:03:33.310> say<00:03:33.519> okay<00:03:34.030> what

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
and re-educating it to say okay what

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.119 
and re-educating it to say okay what
used<00:03:34.479> to<00:03:34.599> bend<00:03:34.780> my<00:03:34.930> elbow<00:03:35.259> now<00:03:35.590> bends<00:03:35.859> my

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
used to bend my elbow now bends my

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.640 
used to bend my elbow now bends my
fingers<00:03:36.609> and<00:03:36.879> then<00:03:37.419> that<00:03:37.689> muscle<00:03:38.049> also<00:03:38.439> will

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
fingers and then that muscle also will

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.339 
fingers and then that muscle also will
require<00:03:38.889> some<00:03:39.400> time<00:03:39.669> to<00:03:39.699> strengthen<00:03:40.629> back<00:03:41.109> up

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
require some time to strengthen back up

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.999 
require some time to strengthen back up
it<00:03:41.560> hasn't<00:03:41.919> been<00:03:42.069> used<00:03:42.569> from<00:03:43.569> the<00:03:44.259> time<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.859> the

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:45.009 
it hasn't been used from the time of the

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:47.339 
it hasn't been used from the time of the
spinal<00:03:45.250> cord<00:03:45.519> injury<00:03:45.970> so<00:03:46.209> it's<00:03:46.359> weak<00:03:46.659> and<00:03:46.959> they

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
spinal cord injury so it's weak and they

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.259 
spinal cord injury so it's weak and they
have<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.680> build<00:03:47.889> the<00:03:48.129> muscle<00:03:48.489> back<00:03:48.699> out<00:03:49.000> if

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
have to build the muscle back out if

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.179 
have to build the muscle back out if
they<00:03:49.720> have<00:03:49.840> stiffness<00:03:50.379> in<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.650> fingers<00:03:50.979> they

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:51.189 
they have stiffness in the fingers they

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.369 
they have stiffness in the fingers they
may<00:03:51.370> require<00:03:51.729> a<00:03:51.790> lot<00:03:52.000> of<00:03:52.120> therapy<00:03:52.389> just<00:03:53.109> to<00:03:53.229> get

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
may require a lot of therapy just to get

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.039 
may require a lot of therapy just to get
some<00:03:53.439> points<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.669> in<00:03:54.819> fact<00:03:55.090> we<00:03:55.629> want<00:03:55.840> them<00:03:56.019> to

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
some points and in fact we want them to

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.379 
some points and in fact we want them to
do<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.319> before<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:57.009> surgery<00:03:57.400> because<00:03:57.579> once

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
do that before the surgery because once

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.390 
do that before the surgery because once
a<00:03:58.599> nerve<00:03:58.840> and<00:03:59.079> the<00:03:59.199> muscle<00:03:59.560> starts<00:03:59.769> working<00:04:00.250> we
