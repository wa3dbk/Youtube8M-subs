00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
on it this is the end we're going to

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.269 
on it this is the end we're going to
start<00:00:22.970> on<00:00:23.500> we're<00:00:24.500> going<00:00:24.619> to<00:00:24.710> need<00:00:24.769> your<00:00:24.949> spline

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
start on we're going to need your spline

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.460 
start on we're going to need your spline
tool<00:00:25.550> some<00:00:26.080> tilly<00:00:27.080> knife<00:00:27.410> and<00:00:27.859> your<00:00:28.039> spawn<00:00:29.470> the

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
tool some tilly knife and your spawn the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.009 
tool some tilly knife and your spawn the
spline<00:00:30.859> tool<00:00:32.410> there's<00:00:33.410> two<00:00:33.620> different<00:00:35.019> ends

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
spline tool there's two different ends

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.759 
spline tool there's two different ends
to<00:00:36.199> it<00:00:36.379> you've<00:00:36.589> got<00:00:36.769> one<00:00:37.040> end<00:00:37.960> that<00:00:38.960> is<00:00:39.110> a<00:00:39.140> disc

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
to it you've got one end that is a disc

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.579 
to it you've got one end that is a disc
shape<00:00:40.159> that's<00:00:41.089> basically<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:41.809> you<00:00:42.170> used<00:00:42.409> to

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589 
shape that's basically the you used to

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.369 
shape that's basically the you used to
push<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:42.890> screen<00:00:43.339> down<00:00:43.519> into<00:00:43.729> the<00:00:44.110> track<00:00:45.110> and

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
push the screen down into the track and

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.219 
push the screen down into the track and
then<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.100> other<00:00:46.339> end<00:00:46.610> you'll<00:00:47.540> notice<00:00:47.900> has<00:00:47.989> got

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:48.229 
then the other end you'll notice has got

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:51.759 
then the other end you'll notice has got
a<00:00:48.260> groove<00:00:48.879> that's<00:00:49.879> after<00:00:50.360> you've<00:00:50.629> placed<00:00:51.500> it

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
a groove that's after you've placed it

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.460 
a groove that's after you've placed it
into<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:52.400> screen<00:00:52.729> track<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:54.080> use<00:00:54.290> this

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
into the screen track you use this

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.630 
into the screen track you use this
groove<00:00:54.799> to<00:00:55.040> push<00:00:55.220> the<00:00:55.400> spine<00:00:55.729> in<00:00:57.640> basically

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
groove to push the spine in basically

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.100 
groove to push the spine in basically
what<00:00:58.820> I<00:00:58.850> do<00:00:58.970> I<00:01:01.059> want<00:01:02.059> to<00:01:02.089> angle<00:01:02.479> it<00:01:02.540> away<00:01:02.839> and

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
what I do I want to angle it away and

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
what I do I want to angle it away and
just<00:01:03.229> gently<00:01:04.269> use<00:01:05.269> that<00:01:05.510> disc<00:01:05.869> shaped<00:01:06.439> segment

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
just gently use that disc shaped segment

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.760 
just gently use that disc shaped segment
on<00:01:07.220> it<00:01:07.810> push<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.840> screen<00:01:09.320> down<00:01:09.619> into<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.130> end

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
on it push the screen down into the end

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.929 
on it push the screen down into the end
track<00:01:12.770> like<00:01:13.039> so<00:01:15.009> you're<00:01:16.009> very<00:01:16.280> careful<00:01:16.820> with

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
track like so you're very careful with

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.260 
track like so you're very careful with
this<00:01:17.770> this<00:01:18.770> sometimes<00:01:19.310> has<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.549> tendency<00:01:20.060> to

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
this this sometimes has a tendency to

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.810 
this this sometimes has a tendency to
slip<00:01:20.570> out<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:20.990> you'll<00:01:21.369> fashion<00:01:22.369> your<00:01:22.549> screen

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
slip out and you'll fashion your screen

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.090 
slip out and you'll fashion your screen
and<00:01:22.969> it<00:01:23.030> can<00:01:23.179> crimp<00:01:23.539> it<00:01:23.719> and<00:01:23.749> in<00:01:24.049> it<00:01:24.229> it<00:01:24.890> just

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
and it can crimp it and in it it just

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.120 
and it can crimp it and in it it just
doesn't<00:01:25.399> look<00:01:25.429> nice<00:01:25.789> I<00:01:26.060> like<00:01:26.649> like<00:01:27.649> my<00:01:27.799> screen

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
doesn't look nice I like like my screen

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.109 
doesn't look nice I like like my screen
to<00:01:28.310> be<00:01:28.429> super<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.780> I<00:01:32.810> somewhat<00:01:33.520> angle<00:01:34.520> it<00:01:34.640> away

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
to be super so I somewhat angle it away

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.720 
to be super so I somewhat angle it away
from<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:36.049> scene<00:01:36.409> angle<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.249> in

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
from the scene angle it in

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:46.870 
from the scene angle it in
angle<00:01:37.970> it<00:01:38.090> away<00:01:38.330> so<00:01:38.390> if<00:01:38.690> it<00:01:38.810> does<00:01:45.550> have<00:01:46.550> it<00:01:46.700> look

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
angle it away so if it does have it look

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.050 
angle it away so if it does have it look
like<00:01:46.910> this<00:01:47.920> I'll<00:01:48.920> be<00:01:49.040> doing<00:01:49.310> it<00:01:49.430> in<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:49.610> screen

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
like this I'll be doing it in the screen

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:59.770 
like this I'll be doing it in the screen
will<00:01:50.270> come<00:01:50.450> up<00:01:57.940> so<00:01:58.940> that's<00:01:59.090> basically<00:01:59.510> how<00:01:59.630> you

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
will come up so that's basically how you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.560 
will come up so that's basically how you
want<00:02:00.110> it<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.290> look<00:02:00.470> right<00:02:00.740> there<00:02:01.330> then<00:02:02.330> what<00:02:02.480> we

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
want it to look right there then what we

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.190 
want it to look right there then what we
do<00:02:03.670> I'll<00:02:04.670> rotate<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:05.330> around<00:02:05.450> now<00:02:05.840> I'll<00:02:05.990> take

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
do I'll rotate it around now I'll take

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.440 
do I'll rotate it around now I'll take
these<00:02:06.440> binder<00:02:06.770> clips<00:02:07.040> off<00:02:07.190> I'll<00:02:07.670> go<00:02:08.060> up<00:02:08.270> this

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
these binder clips off I'll go up this

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.650 
these binder clips off I'll go up this
side<00:02:09.190> go<00:02:10.190> that<00:02:10.460> size<00:02:10.730> just<00:02:11.240> repeat<00:02:11.540> the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
side go that size just repeat the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.010 
side go that size just repeat the
process<00:02:11.930> all<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.500> way<00:02:12.620> around<00:02:16.330> okay<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.570> push

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
process all the way around okay I push

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.890 
process all the way around okay I push
the<00:02:18.230> spine<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.310> screen<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.330> track<00:02:20.660> all

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
the spine of the screen to the track all

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.350 
the spine of the screen to the track all
the<00:02:21.020> way<00:02:21.050> around<00:02:21.520> with<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.670> exception<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.210> the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
the way around with the exception of the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.920 
the way around with the exception of the
last<00:02:23.390> portion<00:02:23.960> and<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.380> want<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:25.100> attachment

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
last portion and I want to attachment

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.270 
last portion and I want to attachment
when<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.050> pull<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.440> when<00:02:27.710> you're<00:02:27.860> pushing

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
when you pull it when you're pushing

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.710 
when you pull it when you're pushing
your<00:02:29.000> screen<00:02:29.420> into<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:29.990> track<00:02:31.300> you'll<00:02:32.300> notice

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
your screen into the track you'll notice

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.130 
your screen into the track you'll notice
that<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.020> string<00:02:33.260> will<00:02:33.590> be<00:02:33.710> pulling<00:02:34.990> what<00:02:35.990> you

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
that the string will be pulling what you

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.700 
that the string will be pulling what you
the<00:02:36.470> ideal<00:02:37.120> scenario<00:02:38.120> is<00:02:38.630> that<00:02:38.710> you're

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
the ideal scenario is that you're

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.910 
the ideal scenario is that you're
pulling<00:02:40.160> this<00:02:40.520> excess<00:02:41.150> into<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.320> groove<00:02:42.680> as

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
to just kind of gingerly get it going in

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.930 
to just kind of gingerly get it going in
there<00:03:28.660> until<00:03:28.959> it's<00:03:29.140> in<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.740> then<00:03:30.370> it'll<00:03:30.640> most

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
there until it's in and then it'll most

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.910 
there until it's in and then it'll most
for<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.209> most<00:03:31.420> part<00:03:31.720> it'll<00:03:32.080> pull<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.350> rest<00:03:32.680> of

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
for the most part it'll pull the rest of

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.620 
for the most part it'll pull the rest of
it<00:03:33.010> in<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.310> way<00:03:33.520> rather<00:03:33.730> than<00:03:34.000> pulling<00:03:34.300> this

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
it in that way rather than pulling this

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.420 
it in that way rather than pulling this
out<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:35.230> see<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.530> kind<00:03:35.740> of<00:03:35.830> pulled<00:03:36.070> that<00:03:36.250> one

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
out you see it kind of pulled that one

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:51.300 
out you see it kind of pulled that one
out<00:03:36.580> over<00:03:36.730> here

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.370 

typically<00:03:52.090> I<00:03:52.120> just<00:03:54.990> get<00:03:55.990> the<00:03:56.140> whole<00:03:56.260> thing

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
typically I just get the whole thing

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:06.030 
typically I just get the whole thing
reading<00:03:59.380> before<00:04:00.310> I<00:04:00.340> starts<00:04:00.790> fun<00:04:04.740> there<00:04:05.740> you<00:04:05.890> go

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
reading before I starts fun there you go

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.320 
reading before I starts fun there you go
you've<00:04:06.310> got<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.459> panel<00:04:06.910> now<00:04:09.060> that's<00:04:10.060> placed

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
you've got a panel now that's placed

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.180 
you've got a panel now that's placed
into<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.840> groove<00:04:11.140> so<00:04:11.770> now<00:04:11.920> we're<00:04:12.040> going<00:04:12.130> to

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
into the groove so now we're going to

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:19.650 
into the groove so now we're going to
put<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.459> spline<00:04:12.790> in

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.800 

okay<00:04:20.380> I'm<00:04:21.100> going<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.400> take<00:04:21.580> our<00:04:21.760> spline<00:04:22.060> cut<00:04:22.690> it

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
okay I'm going to take our spline cut it

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.770 
okay I'm going to take our spline cut it
open<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.200> you'll<00:04:23.410> use<00:04:24.150> about<00:04:25.150> a<00:04:25.210> pack<00:04:25.510> and<00:04:25.720> a

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
open and you'll use about a pack and a

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.890 
open and you'll use about a pack and a
half<00:04:25.990> of<00:04:26.200> this<00:04:26.380> you<00:04:27.190> can<00:04:27.340> buy<00:04:27.700> it<00:04:27.760> in<00:04:27.970> 25-foot

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
half of this you can buy it in 25-foot

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.380 
half of this you can buy it in 25-foot
rolls<00:04:29.530> or<00:04:29.830> you<00:04:29.950> can<00:04:30.100> buy<00:04:30.250> it<00:04:30.280> in<00:04:30.520> 50-foot<00:04:31.120> rolls

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
rolls or you can buy it in 50-foot rolls

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.520 
rolls or you can buy it in 50-foot rolls
but<00:04:31.690> you'll<00:04:32.560> need<00:04:32.770> at<00:04:32.950> least<00:04:33.960> one<00:04:34.960> cage<00:04:35.260> you'll

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
but you'll need at least one cage you'll

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.890 
but you'll need at least one cage you'll
have<00:04:35.680> a<00:04:35.710> little<00:04:35.980> excess<00:04:36.400> left<00:04:36.760> over<00:04:37.120> but<00:04:37.270> 25<00:04:37.780> is

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
have a little excess left over but 25 is

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.480 
have a little excess left over but 25 is
not<00:04:38.020> going<00:04:38.170> to<00:04:38.230> be<00:04:38.320> enough<00:04:38.500> basically<00:04:39.250> all

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
not going to be enough basically all

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.690 
not going to be enough basically all
this<00:04:39.640> stuff<00:04:39.910> is<00:04:40.150> a<00:04:40.590> rubber<00:04:41.590> tubing<00:04:42.010> somewhat

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
this stuff is a rubber tubing somewhat

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.090 
this stuff is a rubber tubing somewhat
and<00:04:43.360> it<00:04:43.480> tucks<00:04:43.750> down<00:04:44.020> inside<00:04:44.440> of<00:04:44.470> this<00:04:44.740> groove

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
and it tucks down inside of this groove

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.320 
and it tucks down inside of this groove
and<00:04:45.340> this<00:04:45.430> is<00:04:45.550> what's<00:04:45.730> going<00:04:45.850> to<00:04:45.910> hold<00:04:46.120> the

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
and this is what's going to hold the

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.900 
and this is what's going to hold the
screen<00:04:46.630> in<00:04:46.810> place<00:04:47.400> so<00:04:48.400> what<00:04:48.550> I<00:04:48.610> do<00:04:48.730> now<00:04:50.910> go

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
screen in place so what I do now go

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.540 
screen in place so what I do now go
ahead<00:04:52.090> and<00:04:54.510> you're<00:04:55.510> now<00:04:55.690> going<00:04:55.900> to<00:04:55.990> use<00:04:56.200> the

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
ahead and you're now going to use the

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.850 
ahead and you're now going to use the
grooved<00:04:57.550> edge<00:04:57.850> of<00:04:58.540> your<00:04:58.900> spline<00:04:59.260> tool<00:04:59.560> and

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
grooved edge of your spline tool and

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.310 
grooved edge of your spline tool and
here's<00:05:00.820> where<00:05:01.060> it<00:05:01.180> can<00:05:01.360> pop<00:05:01.600> out<00:05:01.780> and<00:05:02.080> crimp

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
here's where it can pop out and crimp

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.960 
here's where it can pop out and crimp
your<00:05:02.440> screen<00:05:02.860> up<00:05:03.040> you<00:05:03.220> want<00:05:03.370> to<00:05:03.430> be<00:05:03.550> careful<00:05:03.820> to

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
your screen up you want to be careful to

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.330 
your screen up you want to be careful to
angle<00:05:04.660> it<00:05:04.750> away<00:05:05.020> from<00:05:05.350> the<00:05:05.500> center<00:05:05.890> of<00:05:06.070> your

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
angle it away from the center of your

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.140 
angle it away from the center of your
screen

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
screen

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.260 
screen
basically<00:05:08.080> all<00:05:08.320> you<00:05:08.500> do<00:05:08.650> I<00:05:08.950> just<00:05:09.850> kind<00:05:10.180> of

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
basically all you do I just kind of

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.330 
basically all you do I just kind of
stretch<00:05:10.600> ahead<00:05:10.750> a<00:05:10.960> couple<00:05:11.260> like<00:05:11.590> six<00:05:12.040> to<00:05:12.190> eight

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
stretch ahead a couple like six to eight

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.560 
stretch ahead a couple like six to eight
inches

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.700 

and<00:05:17.870> gently<00:05:18.320> roll<00:05:18.590> that<00:05:18.890> using<00:05:19.670> that<00:05:19.850> broom

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
and gently roll that using that broom

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:40.050 
and gently roll that using that broom
roll<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.890> spine<00:05:22.070> down<00:05:22.910> into<00:05:23.300> that<00:05:23.420> trap

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.840 

the<00:05:40.840> spots<00:05:41.260> see<00:05:41.470> that<00:05:41.680> kinda<00:05:42.100> popped<00:05:42.370> off<00:05:42.610> if

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
the spots see that kinda popped off if

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.730 
the spots see that kinda popped off if
that<00:05:42.880> popped<00:05:43.270> in<00:05:43.510> and<00:05:43.690> crimped<00:05:44.080> my<00:05:44.200> screen<00:05:44.530> up

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
that popped in and crimped my screen up

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.340 
that popped in and crimped my screen up
and<00:05:44.950> it<00:05:45.040> just<00:05:45.220> wouldn't<00:05:45.490> look<00:05:45.550> nice<00:05:46.170> so<00:05:47.170> make

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
and it just wouldn't look nice so make

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.740 
and it just wouldn't look nice so make
sure<00:05:47.380> you<00:05:47.710> just<00:05:47.920> got<00:05:48.130> that<00:05:48.310> angle<00:05:48.790> away<00:05:49.420> from

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
sure you just got that angle away from

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.490 
sure you just got that angle away from
the<00:05:50.020> center<00:05:50.440> of<00:05:50.590> your<00:05:51.000> your<00:05:52.000> screen<00:05:52.330> panel<00:05:52.780> you

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
the center of your your screen panel you

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.710 
the center of your your screen panel you
pop<00:05:53.770> in<00:05:54.010> it<00:05:54.580> just<00:05:54.880> doesn't<00:05:55.210> look<00:05:55.240> as<00:05:55.480> nice

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
pop in it just doesn't look as nice

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.970 
pop in it just doesn't look as nice
you've<00:05:56.650> got<00:05:56.830> a<00:05:56.860> crimped<00:05:57.490> up<00:05:57.610> screen<00:05:58.800> and<00:05:59.800> this

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
you've got a crimped up screen and this

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.970 
you've got a crimped up screen and this
spline<00:06:00.280> tool<00:06:00.670> is<00:06:01.660> made<00:06:01.840> out<00:06:02.020> of<00:06:02.050> plastic<00:06:02.350> it's

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 
spline tool is made out of plastic it's

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.740 
spline tool is made out of plastic it's
not<00:06:03.160> really<00:06:03.490> the<00:06:03.610> greatest<00:06:03.760> one<00:06:04.210> I<00:06:04.240> bought<00:06:04.570> it

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
not really the greatest one I bought it

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.700 
not really the greatest one I bought it
because<00:06:04.840> it's<00:06:05.170> cheap

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
because it's cheap

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.680 
because it's cheap
they<00:06:05.980> make<00:06:06.190> wooden<00:06:06.520> ones<00:06:06.700> with<00:06:06.910> metal<00:06:07.330> rollers

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
they make wooden ones with metal rollers

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.200 
they make wooden ones with metal rollers
which<00:06:07.960> are<00:06:08.110> a<00:06:08.140> lot<00:06:08.380> better<00:06:08.880> they're<00:06:09.880> not<00:06:10.060> as

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
which are a lot better they're not as

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.780 
which are a lot better they're not as
likely<00:06:10.450> I<00:06:10.630> think<00:06:10.720> to<00:06:11.050> slip<00:06:11.380> off<00:06:11.620> but<00:06:12.010> either

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
likely I think to slip off but either

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.270 
likely I think to slip off but either
way<00:06:13.060> the<00:06:13.270> work<00:06:13.510> so<00:06:13.960> basically<00:06:14.380> all<00:06:14.710> we<00:06:14.830> do<00:06:15.100> is

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
way the work so basically all we do is

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
way the work so basically all we do is
we<00:06:15.430> just<00:06:15.700> continue<00:06:16.390> this<00:06:17.640> process<00:06:18.640> all<00:06:19.150> the

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
we just continue this process all the

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:29.820 
we just continue this process all the
way

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.560 

corner<00:06:30.830> you<00:06:30.980> might<00:06:31.160> want<00:06:31.370> to<00:06:31.430> use<00:06:31.640> it<00:06:31.880> maybe<00:06:32.450> a

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
corner you might want to use it maybe a

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.690 
corner you might want to use it maybe a
flathead<00:06:33.140> screwdriver<00:06:33.170> or<00:06:34.070> your<00:06:34.250> scissors

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
flathead screwdriver or your scissors

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.890 
flathead screwdriver or your scissors
kind<00:06:35.300> of<00:06:35.390> but<00:06:35.630> it<00:06:35.780> down<00:06:35.960> into<00:06:36.350> that<00:06:36.650> corner

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
kind of but it down into that corner

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.660 
kind of but it down into that corner
some<00:06:38.900> people<00:06:39.200> cut<00:06:39.440> them<00:06:39.560> off<00:06:39.710> I<00:06:40.010> just<00:06:40.040> use<00:06:40.430> one

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
some people cut them off I just use one

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.900 
some people cut them off I just use one
continual<00:06:41.420> loop<00:06:41.690> and<00:06:42.170> this<00:06:42.350> one<00:06:42.710> I'm<00:06:43.490> going<00:06:43.820> to

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910 
continual loop and this one I'm going to

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.790 
continual loop and this one I'm going to
go<00:06:44.150> all<00:06:44.330> the<00:06:44.420> way<00:06:44.480> around<00:06:44.690> with<00:06:44.990> one<00:06:45.170> continual

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
go all the way around with one continual

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.860 
go all the way around with one continual
piece<00:06:46.070> I<00:06:46.400> don't<00:06:47.150> think<00:06:47.420> it<00:06:47.480> really<00:06:47.660> matters

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
piece I don't think it really matters

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:55.470 
piece I don't think it really matters
either<00:06:48.290> way<00:06:51.070> just<00:06:52.070> a<00:06:52.190> matter<00:06:52.400> of<00:06:52.520> preference

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:55.480 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.810 

next<00:06:56.480> thing<00:06:56.630> you<00:06:56.720> do<00:06:57.460> basically<00:06:58.460> is<00:06:58.610> you<00:06:58.700> be

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:58.820 
next thing you do basically is you be

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.180 
next thing you do basically is you be
very<00:06:59.270> careful

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
very careful

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.250 
very careful
you<00:07:01.190> take<00:07:01.370> your<00:07:01.520> utility<00:07:02.000> knife<00:07:02.080> and<00:07:03.080> we'll

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.260 
you take your utility knife and we'll

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.440 
you take your utility knife and we'll
just<00:07:03.410> go<00:07:03.620> on<00:07:03.860> the<00:07:03.980> edge<00:07:04.130> here<00:07:04.430> and<00:07:05.060> we'll<00:07:05.240> cut

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.450 
just go on the edge here and we'll cut

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:18.840 
just go on the edge here and we'll cut
this<00:07:05.600> excess<00:07:06.110> screen<00:07:06.500> off<00:07:16.810> on<00:07:17.810> the<00:07:18.290> ends<00:07:18.620> so

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:18.850 
this excess screen off on the ends so

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.340 
this excess screen off on the ends so
just<00:07:19.850> run<00:07:20.030> your<00:07:20.180> utility<00:07:20.690> knife<00:07:20.720> right<00:07:21.320> down

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.350 
just run your utility knife right down

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.220 
just run your utility knife right down
in<00:07:21.650> that<00:07:21.770> groove<00:07:22.270> cut<00:07:23.270> this<00:07:23.450> excess<00:07:23.870> all<00:07:24.110> the

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.230 
in that groove cut this excess all the

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:25.780 
in that groove cut this excess all the
way<00:07:24.380> and<00:07:24.710> there<00:07:24.890> you<00:07:25.010> go<00:07:25.190> you've<00:07:25.400> got<00:07:25.580> one

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:25.790 
way and there you go you've got one

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.360 
way and there you go you've got one
panel<00:07:26.210> after<00:07:27.110> you<00:07:27.350> get<00:07:27.500> all<00:07:27.620> your<00:07:27.770> panels<00:07:28.010> done

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:28.370 
panel after you get all your panels done

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.770 
panel after you get all your panels done
that<00:07:28.640> we're<00:07:28.760> going<00:07:28.880> to<00:07:28.940> move<00:07:29.090> on<00:07:29.240> to<00:07:29.360> pretty

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.780 
that we're going to move on to pretty

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.210 
that we're going to move on to pretty
much<00:07:29.960> one<00:07:30.170> of<00:07:30.290> the<00:07:30.350> last<00:07:30.560> steps<00:07:30.830> which<00:07:31.070> is

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:31.220 
much one of the last steps which is

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.189 
much one of the last steps which is
assembling<00:07:31.940> everything<00:07:32.330> together

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:34.199 
assembling everything together

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:38.189 
assembling everything together
all<00:07:35.199> right<00:07:35.410> as<00:07:35.530> you<00:07:35.560> can<00:07:35.710> see<00:07:35.980> I've<00:07:36.990> got<00:07:37.990> all<00:07:38.050> my

00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:38.199 
all right as you can see I've got all my

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:40.350 
all right as you can see I've got all my
panels<00:07:38.740> screened<00:07:39.130> in<00:07:39.340> and<00:07:39.669> I've<00:07:39.790> started<00:07:40.150> to

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360 
panels screened in and I've started to

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.170 
panels screened in and I've started to
assemble<00:07:40.900> it<00:07:41.310> what<00:07:42.310> I've<00:07:42.430> basically<00:07:42.669> done<00:07:42.970> is

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:43.180 
assemble it what I've basically done is

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.650 
assemble it what I've basically done is
I<00:07:43.979> mentioned<00:07:44.979> before<00:07:45.070> how<00:07:46.000> I<00:07:46.030> labeled<00:07:46.540> the

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:46.660 
I mentioned before how I labeled the

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.870 
I mentioned before how I labeled the
inside<00:07:47.229> of<00:07:47.800> each<00:07:48.160> panel

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:48.880 
inside of each panel

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.110 
inside of each panel
I've<00:07:49.510> got<00:07:49.750> an<00:07:49.870> old<00:07:50.020> laid<00:07:50.260> out<00:07:50.500> now<00:07:50.970> so<00:07:51.970> that

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.120 
I've got an old laid out now so that

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.850 
I've got an old laid out now so that
each<00:07:52.300> panel<00:07:52.720> goes<00:07:52.900> back<00:07:53.199> into<00:07:53.530> the<00:07:53.650> original

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:53.860 
each panel goes back into the original

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.920 
each panel goes back into the original
screw<00:07:54.400> holes<00:07:54.639> that<00:07:54.970> they<00:07:55.090> were<00:07:55.150> originally

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:55.930 
screw holes that they were originally
