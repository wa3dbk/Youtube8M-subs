00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 in short, we arrived at the station and that 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.460
 the station where you went 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.469
 woodpecker group your last trip 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.240
 the beginning of the route we have about 200 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.940
 kilometers from the station 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.490
 this is our cables all on diesel solera 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.330
 just the outcome of the site so we load and 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.330
 we are going 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:31.220
 thank you, but we drove only five minutes 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:34.730
 cars and something happened we stand take 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:39.370
 seeds and think that we have arrived but our 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.370
 the driver Vladimir did not think so 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.539
 northern tin 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.190
 in the car we had to drive 10 hours 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.649
 but four of us have decided that they will come out 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.290
 earlier and last 50 kilometers they 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.110
 run for cars with the motto then in the car 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.790
 thats weak 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.220
 I will honestly say that looking at it is no longer 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.950
 especially share the optimism of the guys but 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:18.850

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.850

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.409
 underwater remains damn even kilometers 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:46.840
 40 and we will be in place 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:52.310

 long all the same notable in general of course 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:00.619
 hard when you count on 40 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.810
 kilometers it turns out as much as 55 this 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.299
