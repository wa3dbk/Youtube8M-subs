00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.309 

I<00:00:00.110> so<00:00:01.110> got<00:00:02.120> semi<00:00:03.120> I<00:00:03.330> magnets<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:03.870> I<00:00:03.929> got<00:00:04.049> to

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
I so got semi I magnets and I got to

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.660 
I so got semi I magnets and I got to
which<00:00:04.890> is<00:00:05.009> why<00:00:05.130> there's<00:00:05.310> any<00:00:05.600> one<00:00:06.600> arm<00:00:06.859> not<00:00:07.859> to

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:17.300 

here's<00:00:13.340> mechanism<00:00:14.340> for<00:00:14.700> adjusting<00:00:16.100> how<00:00:17.100> much

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
here's mechanism for adjusting how much

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.849 
here's mechanism for adjusting how much
repulsion<00:00:17.699> there<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.150> between<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.470> one

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.820 

melon<00:00:25.340> quite<00:00:26.340> heavy<00:00:26.519> weights<00:00:27.439> so<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.500> comes<00:00:28.680> up

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
melon quite heavy weights so it comes up

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.440 
melon quite heavy weights so it comes up
here<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.340> because<00:00:29.609> my<00:00:29.760> bearings<00:00:30.150> are<00:00:30.390> so

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
here and because my bearings are so

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.240 
here and because my bearings are so
wobbly<00:00:35.960> need<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.020> get<00:00:37.140> new<00:00:37.260> bearings<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.770> had<00:00:38.129> to

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
wobbly need to get new bearings I had to

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.729 
wobbly need to get new bearings I had to
build<00:00:39.110> this<00:00:40.110> little<00:00:40.170> guidance<00:00:40.770> system<00:00:42.739> all

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
build this little guidance system all

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.900 
build this little guidance system all
right<00:00:44.420> since<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.539> goes<00:00:45.660> over<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:46.850> sitting<00:00:47.850> in

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
right since it goes over here sitting in

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.529 
right since it goes over here sitting in
there<00:00:49.219> now<00:00:50.219> I'm<00:00:50.460> not<00:00:50.670> going<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.940> push<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.180> at

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
there now I'm not going to push this at

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.209 
there now I'm not going to push this at
all<00:00:51.660> I'm<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.320> get<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
all I'm just going to get it to the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:03.030 
all I'm just going to get it to the
position<00:00:53.370> where<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.390> releases

I<00:01:03.300> won't<00:01:04.300> go<00:01:04.420> over<00:01:04.470> but<00:01:06.900> let's<00:01:07.900> have<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.080> look<00:01:08.230> at

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
I won't go over but let's have a look at

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:23.790 
I won't go over but let's have a look at
exactly<00:01:08.650> how<00:01:09.130> much<00:01:09.250> he<00:01:09.430> really<00:01:09.580> sing<00:01:09.910> yet<00:01:22.800> no

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
exactly how much he really sing yet no

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:32.880 
exactly how much he really sing yet no

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:32.080 

penis<00:02:27.379> I<00:02:28.629> reckon

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.290 

I<00:02:32.150> mean<00:02:32.950> it's<00:02:33.950> heading<00:02:34.250> works<00:02:34.459> head<00:02:34.700> two<00:02:34.940> kilos

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.490 

that<00:02:39.020> might<00:02:39.200> be<00:02:39.230> about<00:02:39.560> two<00:02:40.040> killers<00:02:40.990> and<00:02:44.050> if<00:02:45.050> I

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
that might be about two killers and if I

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.070 
that might be about two killers and if I
had<00:02:45.830> two<00:02:46.100> pendulums<00:02:48.070> be<00:02:49.070> like<00:02:49.250> adding<00:02:49.550> this<00:02:49.670> to

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
had two pendulums be like adding this to

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.970 
had two pendulums be like adding this to
that<00:02:51.080> end<00:02:52.030> yeah<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:54.110> had<00:02:54.320> two<00:02:54.530> pigeons

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
that end yeah so you had two pigeons

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.880 
that end yeah so you had two pigeons
going<00:02:55.510> make<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.540> loud<00:02:56.750> bang<00:02:57.080> what<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.320> do<00:02:57.440> this

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.740 

and<00:03:00.890> we'll<00:03:01.070> go<00:03:01.190> over

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.630 

so<00:03:08.350> when<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.590> can<00:03:08.740> scrounge<00:03:08.980> some<00:03:09.280> more<00:03:09.430> cash

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
so when I can scrounge some more cash

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.060 
so when I can scrounge some more cash
together<00:03:11.520> to<00:03:12.520> get<00:03:12.700> some<00:03:12.970> more<00:03:13.090> magnets<00:03:13.510> and

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
together to get some more magnets and

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:20.670 
together to get some more magnets and
probably<00:03:15.070> better<00:03:15.250> bearings<00:03:19.290> this<00:03:20.290> should<00:03:20.500> go

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
probably better bearings this should go

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.360 
probably better bearings this should go
fairly<00:03:20.890> well<00:03:21.190> i'm<00:03:21.520> going<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:21.700> might<00:03:21.820> work

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
fairly well i'm going to might work

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.640 
fairly well i'm going to might work
either<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.490> or<00:03:24.790> there's<00:03:25.170> someone<00:03:26.170> posted

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
either that or there's someone posted

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.420 
either that or there's someone posted
too<00:03:26.970> energetic<00:03:27.970> tube<00:03:28.270> a<00:03:31.650> video<00:03:32.650> about<00:03:32.920> am

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
too energetic tube a video about am

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.449 
too energetic tube a video about am
suppressing<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.390> magnetic<00:03:34.840> field<00:03:35.459> with

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
suppressing the magnetic field with

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.010 
suppressing the magnetic field with
alkaline<00:03:37.390> batteries<00:03:39.660> which<00:03:40.660> was<00:03:40.810> really

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
alkaline batteries which was really

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.240 
alkaline batteries which was really
impressive<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.940> if<00:03:43.090> i<00:03:43.180> could<00:03:43.239> suppress<00:03:43.690> the

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
impressive and if i could suppress the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:52.570 
impressive and if i could suppress the
pushing<00:03:45.250> here<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:47.320> only<00:03:47.860> have<00:03:48.160> it<00:03:48.280> there

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.680 

then<00:03:53.240> I<00:03:53.330> could<00:03:53.480> get<00:03:53.600> rid<00:03:53.720> of<00:03:53.780> these<00:03:53.900> latches

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
then I could get rid of these latches

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:02.620 
then I could get rid of these latches
all<00:03:56.690> right<00:03:59.950> on<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.070> pendulum<00:04:01.490> and<00:04:01.640> just<00:04:02.480> have

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
all right on the pendulum and just have

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.050 
all right on the pendulum and just have
it<00:04:02.660> being<00:04:02.960> pushed<00:04:03.380> out<00:04:03.590> further<00:04:04.370> on<00:04:04.670> that<00:04:04.700> side

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
it being pushed out further on that side

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.450 
it being pushed out further on that side
then<00:04:05.360> it<00:04:05.450> is<00:04:05.540> on<00:04:05.600> this<00:04:05.720> side<00:04:07.900> this<00:04:08.900> here<00:04:09.460> at

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
then it is on this side this here at

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.630 
then it is on this side this here at
weill<00:04:10.700> there<00:04:10.940> with<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.150> rubber<00:04:11.300> bands<00:04:11.600> on<00:04:11.810> it
