00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
in gamestats really quick some of these

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.289 
in gamestats really quick some of these
things<00:01:07.710> i<00:01:07.979> agree<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.310> totally<00:01:09.000> some<00:01:09.270> of

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
things i agree with totally some of

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.420 
things i agree with totally some of
these<00:01:09.390> things<00:01:09.750> i<00:01:09.930> think<00:01:10.260> should<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:11.010> bumped<00:01:11.369> up

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
these things i think should be bumped up

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640 
these things i think should be bumped up
at<00:01:11.640> least<00:01:11.850> by<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.060> way<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.510> he<00:01:12.630> plays<00:01:12.900> things

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
at least by the way that he plays things

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.560 
at least by the way that he plays things
like<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.189> agility<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.790> balance<00:01:14.880> i<00:01:15.330> think

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
like the agility and balance i think

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.899 
like the agility and balance i think
they<00:01:15.720> should<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.890> few<00:01:17.100> points<00:01:17.520> because

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
they should be up a few points because

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.090 
they should be up a few points because
this<00:01:18.210> guy<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.600> really<00:01:19.170> balanced<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.860> ball

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
this guy is really balanced on the ball

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.749 
this guy is really balanced on the ball
and<00:01:20.310> he<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.549> pretty<00:01:20.939> quick<00:01:21.240> also<00:01:22.400> his<00:01:23.400> stamina

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
and he is pretty quick also his stamina

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.940 
and he is pretty quick also his stamina
he<00:01:24.210> doesn't<00:01:24.659> seem<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.200> tired<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.560> lot<00:01:25.710> but

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
he doesn't seem to get tired a lot but

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.310 
he doesn't seem to get tired a lot but
his<00:01:26.400> strength<00:01:26.790> again<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.450> can<00:01:27.600> see<00:01:27.780> 78

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320
