00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
passed on beyond Jupiter but will still

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.139 
passed on beyond Jupiter but will still
be<00:01:49.619> close<00:01:49.799> enough<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.340> they<00:01:50.640> can<00:01:50.700> still<00:01:51.030> be

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
be close enough that they can still be

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.300 
be close enough that they can still be
used<00:01:51.360> as<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.630> signpost<00:01:52.020> for<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.829> Jupiter

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
good time to take a look at Jupiter

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.179 
good time to take a look at Jupiter
because<00:01:59.790> it's<00:02:00.240> just<00:02:00.630> past<00:02:00.930> opposition<00:02:01.649> which

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
because it's just past opposition which

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.100 
because it's just past opposition which
means<00:02:02.460> Jupiter<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.090> still<00:02:03.360> very<00:02:03.630> close<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
means Jupiter is still very close to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.020 
means Jupiter is still very close to
Earth<00:02:04.290> which<00:02:04.860> makes<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.189> even<00:02:05.340> brighter<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
Earth which makes it even brighter and

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.600 
Earth which makes it even brighter and
bigger<00:02:06.240> than<00:02:06.570> usual<00:02:07.069> another<00:02:08.069> reason<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.459> take

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
bigger than usual another reason to take

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.550

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
a look at Jupiter this October is that

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
binoculars because Jupiter has
