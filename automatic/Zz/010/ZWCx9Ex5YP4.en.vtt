00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.730
 I was excited he studied the career of 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.830
 biology of the michoacan university of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.660
 san nicolÃ¡s de hidalgo and also is in 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.090
 biochemistry at the national university 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.440
 this is a PhD in biology in the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.559
 sussex university in brighton 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.559
 England 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.629
 good when I was doing the race 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.159
 I had the opportunity to have some 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.519
 approach with research groups 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:50.070
 in Mexico in Morelia, also the 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.649
 wire and practicing with people I 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.149
 they told of acquaintances or themselves 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.449
 they had been abroad and had 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.829
 revised then they told me that there 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.870
 the possibility that was not so hard 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:07.979
 so I decided to give him the opportunity 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.540
 in the case of my biology area what 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.180
 important is to find a supervisor 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.640
 that works on the topic that interests you 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.430
 then you can search everything in 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.930
 Internet can be found in the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.210
 internet pages of the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.880
 researchers and can be contacted by 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.119
 email and then what I 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.619
 I did was send many technical colleges 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.050
 to researchers that interested me 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.990
 some I like to give does not usually consist 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.610
 some of them accepted me saying 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.690
 that took place that I could apply 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.000
 for him 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.520
 since I have the performances of 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.130
 researcher then starts the process 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.750
 of acceptance to the university with the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.680
 acceptance of the university then it 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.230
 You can ask for the definition 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.930
 good to the call comes out twice 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.150
 per year and there are certain requirements that 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.650
 they ask for example the letter deletion of 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.090
 the university of the most important 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.310
 I also have letters from 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.979
 recommendation what is problematic is to have 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.810
 all the time because people if 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.700
 willing to the people who know you then 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.100
 you go in the letter of recommendation and 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.930
 good pass the exam and this the problem 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.020
 it's the times then you have to 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.250
 be very very aware of the dates 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.250
 what do you have with the islands 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.750
 oh sure there are many many 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.709
 worries that happen to you through the 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.870
 head one is the language as you say that 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.459
 do not understand or 11 students 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.140
 in school but one thing is in the 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.870
 school of imports came countries 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.720
 that everyone is useful or the accent is 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.350
 different 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.540
 another thing is to adapt to life in another 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.250
 country and the other one is the academic level there 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.010
 is very afraid because he believes that in the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.490
 abroad the academic level is much 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.610
 higher and that mexico is not so good 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.800
 thing that is not so certain pose at the level 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:04.710
 academic in Mexico is pretty good 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.710
 and you realize when you arrive 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.170
 which is not so different 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.170
 these are 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.939
 if there are many sources actually 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.579
 there are many countries when I was 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:23.019
 PhD and England and with the 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.780
 cec achieve the only sessions had 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:29.109
 other countries where you can have 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.260
 also scholarships for example in germany 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.609
 there are some groups of studies of 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.849
 research that are the max planck and 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.849
 well in the scholarships there are other institutes in 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:48.040
 in many countries of Latinos and those 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.490
 scholarships are generally more generous than 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.750
 the tails and in case of england 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.970
 problems are which bills that 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.210
 they are very high companies the scholarships are more 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.490
 scarce 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.490
 but there are many many opportunities 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.800
 a lot of Mexicans 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.350
 and that also helps us pass the 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.950
 depression when we have our much 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:24.710
 country and that's great support 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:26.090
 there is a fairly extensive network of 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.460
 Mexican student organizations 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.010
 in the united kingdom there is an organization and 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.810
 a general society of students in 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.430
 a united kingdom and there are some 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.980
 universities that have partnerships 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.990
 we have interaction between 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.210
 we organize events there 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:46.330
 congresses of Mexicans 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.330
 and doing United Kingdom 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.690
 Well, I think we're quite diverse 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:56.390
 there are Mexicans from all over the country and in 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.880
 general those of us who come here because 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:02.690
 we have an interest in studying also 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:07.000
 an interest to know the world mexico 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.000
 then we have that vision 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.870
 there are some private universities but 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.870
 if there is everything 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.320
 there are some things that miss the 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.870
 lebanon helped much more 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.810
 the winter is pretty hard, personal 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.330
 but it looks good 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.460
 many people are known 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.250
 Experience of living in a country 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:38.070
 abroad is very enriching and one 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:41.840
 learn many things that allow you 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.840
 value Mexico from another perspective 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:49.270
 English society in general is very 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.210
 tolerant accepts there are many immigrants 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.139
 originals are used to 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.610
 foreigners and are very open to 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:00.300
 different customs of the people 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.300
 that come 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.669
 I do not even know if I want
