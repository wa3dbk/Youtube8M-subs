and going for proxy rushes but in this

and going for proxy rushes but in this

case he's not going for a rush a proxy

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.890 
case he's not going for a rush a proxy
brush<00:02:44.400> at<00:02:44.609> least<00:02:44.640> he's<00:02:45.120> putting<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.480> gateway<00:02:45.690> in

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
brush at least he's putting a gateway in

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.199 
brush at least he's putting a gateway in
this<00:02:46.049> base<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.500> certain<00:02:47.459> peaks<00:02:47.579> of<00:02:47.700> Badou<00:02:47.970> is

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
this base and certain peaks of Badou is

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.420 
this base and certain peaks of Badou is
somewhat<00:02:48.930> difficult<00:02:49.079> to<00:02:49.379> navigate<00:02:49.560> there<00:02:50.280> are

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
somewhat difficult to navigate there are

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.670 
somewhat difficult to navigate there are
four<00:02:51.150> hills<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.109> middle<00:02:52.319> I<00:02:52.379> guess<00:02:52.530> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
four hills in the middle I guess the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.430 
four hills in the middle I guess the
peaks<00:02:52.980> which<00:02:53.970> don't<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.299> any<00:02:54.420> resources<00:02:55.139> on

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
peaks which don't have any resources on

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.110 
peaks which don't have any resources on
them<00:02:55.590> but<00:02:55.799> it<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.459> makes<00:02:56.609> it<00:02:56.730> harder<00:02:57.000> to

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
them but it just makes it harder to

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.599 
them but it just makes it harder to
navigate<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:58.139> there<00:02:58.889> is<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> natural

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
navigate and there is a natural

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.330 
navigate and there is a natural
expansion<00:03:00.329> that<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:01.230> think<00:03:01.709> fairly<00:03:01.950> easy<00:03:02.220> to

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
expansion that is I think fairly easy to

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.420 
expansion that is I think fairly easy to
defend<00:03:03.290> in<00:03:04.290> case<00:03:04.470> here<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:04.769> see<00:03:04.889> now<00:03:05.040> wrong<00:03:05.250> and

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
defend in case here we see now wrong and

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.069 
defend in case here we see now wrong and
now<00:03:05.760> raw<00:03:05.970> in<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:06.359> conflict<00:03:06.780> has<00:03:06.959> been

now raw in this conflict has been

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.990 
now raw in this conflict has been

almost christ-like figure in that in a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
couple of Korean hype videos I've seen

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.280 
couple of Korean hype videos I've seen
I'm<00:03:17.250> not<00:03:17.400> sure<00:03:17.699> why<00:03:17.879> Savior<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.959> villain<00:03:19.230> I

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
I'm not sure why Savior is the villain I

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.650 
I'm not sure why Savior is the villain I
guess<00:03:19.470> um<00:03:20.030> he<00:03:21.030> just<00:03:21.060> has<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.449> play<00:03:21.629> the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
guess um he just has to play the

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.420 
guess um he just has to play the
villains<00:03:21.989> kind<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.290> like<00:03:22.379> a<00:03:22.410> World<00:03:22.769> Wrestling

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
villains kind of like a World Wrestling

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.039 
villains kind of like a World Wrestling
Federation<00:03:24.090> thing<00:03:24.269> or<00:03:24.419> something<00:03:24.599> series

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
Federation thing or something series

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.569 
Federation thing or something series
just<00:03:25.260> portrayed<00:03:25.620> as<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.769> bone<00:03:25.949> and<00:03:26.160> now<00:03:26.400> we're

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
just portrayed as a bone and now we're

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:27.890 
just portrayed as a bone and now we're
actually<00:03:26.730> getting<00:03:26.910> his<00:03:27.120> gasps<00:03:27.329> I<00:03:27.569> just<00:03:27.599> saw

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
actually getting his gasps I just saw

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.780 
actually getting his gasps I just saw
and<00:03:28.079> Savior<00:03:28.349> going<00:03:28.560> for<00:03:28.739> a<00:03:28.769> second<00:03:29.459> hatchery

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
and Savior going for a second hatchery

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.550 
and Savior going for a second hatchery
after<00:03:30.209> he<00:03:30.329> gets<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.629> spawning<00:03:30.870> pool<00:03:30.989> so<00:03:31.500> it

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
after he gets a spawning pool so it

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.930 
after he gets a spawning pool so it
looks<00:03:31.709> like<00:03:31.769> perhaps<00:03:31.949> a<00:03:32.220> twelve<00:03:32.489> pool<00:03:32.730> for

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
looks like perhaps a twelve pool for

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.699 
looks like perhaps a twelve pool for
Savior<00:03:33.180> here<00:03:33.359> sabers<00:03:34.139> playing<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.530> safe

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
Savior here sabers playing it safe

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.259 
Savior here sabers playing it safe
against<00:03:35.040> an<00:03:35.160> era<00:03:35.310> which<00:03:35.549> is<00:03:35.669> I<00:03:35.819> think<00:03:35.849> a<00:03:36.060> good

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
against an era which is I think a good

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.819 
against an era which is I think a good
idea<00:03:36.510> because<00:03:36.690> narrowing<00:03:37.079> is<00:03:37.290> known<00:03:37.530> for<00:03:37.709> its

idea because narrowing is known for its

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.009 
idea because narrowing is known for its
rushes<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.280> Savior<00:03:38.879> um<00:03:39.090> perhaps<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.750> was<00:03:39.870> even

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
rushes and Savior um perhaps it was even

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.689 
rushes and Savior um perhaps it was even
faster<00:03:40.199> than<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.620> twelve<00:03:40.859> pole<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.519> might

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
faster than the twelve pole it might

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.939 
faster than the twelve pole it might
have<00:03:41.790> been<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:42.060> over<00:03:42.690> pool<00:03:42.930> going<00:03:43.650> into<00:03:43.919> a

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
second hatchery so Savior set

we're<00:03:52.859> also<00:03:53.069> this<00:03:53.549> is<00:03:53.669> actually<00:03:54.000> working<00:03:54.120> well

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
we're also this is actually working well

a beast who build he is going for a

a beast who build he is going for a
gateway<00:04:01.769> first<00:04:02.099> and<00:04:02.280> he's<00:04:02.370> ha<00:04:02.579> sort<00:04:02.879> of<00:04:02.909> hiding

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
gateway first and he's ha sort of hiding

gateway first and he's ha sort of hiding
in<00:04:03.389> cybernetics<00:04:03.659> core<00:04:04.019> in<00:04:04.139> the<00:04:04.230> corner<00:04:04.530> of<00:04:04.590> his

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.289 
in cybernetics core in the corner of his
base<00:04:04.859> but<00:04:05.430> I<00:04:05.459> think<00:04:05.639> saviours<00:04:05.940> gonna<00:04:06.090> spot

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
base but I think saviours gonna spot

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.580 
base but I think saviours gonna spot
that<00:04:06.480> quite<00:04:06.690> well<00:04:06.720> with<00:04:06.959> this<00:04:07.019> overlord<00:04:07.440> he's

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
that quite well with this overlord he's

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.860 
that quite well with this overlord he's
gonna<00:04:07.739> know<00:04:07.949> that<00:04:08.190> um<00:04:08.370> now<00:04:08.940> r1<00:04:09.150> forecast<00:04:09.629> first

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
gonna know that um now r1 forecast first

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.330 
gonna know that um now r1 forecast first
and<00:04:10.109> that<00:04:10.229> narrows<00:04:10.470> going<00:04:10.709> for<00:04:10.859> fast<00:04:11.069> tech

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
and that narrows going for fast tech

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.670 
and that narrows going for fast tech
here<00:04:11.579> not<00:04:12.449> deciding<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.959> commit<00:04:13.409> too<00:04:13.500> many

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
here not deciding to commit too many

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.490 
here not deciding to commit too many
zealots<00:04:13.919> and<00:04:14.159> saving<00:04:14.430> only<00:04:14.519> has<00:04:14.729> to<00:04:15.500> choose

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
zealots and saving only has to choose

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.199 
zealots and saving only has to choose
Earthlings<00:04:17.070> going<00:04:17.549> out<00:04:17.639> just<00:04:17.849> a<00:04:17.940> scout<00:04:18.180> I

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
Earthlings going out just a scout I

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.909 
Earthlings going out just a scout I
think<00:04:18.479> just<00:04:18.659> to<00:04:18.720> catch<00:04:19.049> an<00:04:19.229> incoming<00:04:19.530> probe

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
think just to catch an incoming probe

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.430 
think just to catch an incoming probe
and<00:04:20.159> I<00:04:20.579> think<00:04:20.760> Savior<00:04:21.659> is<00:04:21.719> probably<00:04:22.200> going<00:04:22.349> to

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
and I think Savior is probably going to

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.649 
and I think Savior is probably going to
tech<00:04:22.620> fairly<00:04:23.219> quickly<00:04:23.430> now<00:04:23.669> at<00:04:24.030> least<00:04:24.180> Hydra

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
tech fairly quickly now at least Hydra

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:25.430 
tech fairly quickly now at least Hydra
lists

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
lists

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.620 
lists
in<00:04:26.160> order<00:04:26.430> to<00:04:26.490> counter<00:04:26.910> this<00:04:27.210> I<00:04:27.360> don't<00:04:27.480> think

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
in order to counter this I don't think

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.030 
in order to counter this I don't think
he's<00:04:27.720> gonna<00:04:27.840> go<00:04:28.020> for<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.260> serving<00:04:28.620> rush<00:04:28.800> here

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
he's gonna go for a serving rush here

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.610 
he's gonna go for a serving rush here
and<00:04:29.510> yeah<00:04:30.510> Savior<00:04:30.840> is<00:04:30.990> gonna<00:04:31.170> be<00:04:31.260> able<00:04:31.320> Scout

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
and yeah Savior is gonna be able Scout

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.380 
and yeah Savior is gonna be able Scout
narrow<00:04:32.100> space<00:04:32.400> now<00:04:32.550> our<00:04:32.640> only<00:04:32.850> has<00:04:33.120> one

gateway<00:04:33.750> so<00:04:33.810> I'll<00:04:34.560> be<00:04:34.710> interesting<00:04:35.040> to<00:04:35.130> see

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
gateway so I'll be interesting to see

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.430

what<00:04:35.430> techie<00:04:35.700> decides<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.090> go<00:04:36.240> for<00:04:36.510> maybe<00:04:37.320> even

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
what techie decides to go for maybe even

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.460 
what techie decides to go for maybe even
one<00:04:37.680> base<00:04:38.100> Corsairs<00:04:38.820> although<00:04:39.390> that<00:04:39.570> really

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
one base Corsairs although that really

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.260 
one base Corsairs although that really
doesn't<00:04:40.770> make<00:04:40.830> that<00:04:41.010> much<00:04:41.070> sense<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:41.670> hydros

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
doesn't make that much sense a hydros

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.370 
doesn't make that much sense a hydros
will<00:04:42.480> be<00:04:42.570> able<00:04:42.660> to<00:04:42.750> counter<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.080> fairly

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
will be able to counter that fairly

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.530 
will be able to counter that fairly
easily<00:04:43.530> but<00:04:43.890> he<00:04:44.040> is<00:04:44.160> going<00:04:44.400> for<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.610> Stargate<00:04:45.420> so

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
easily but he is going for a Stargate so

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.590 
easily but he is going for a Stargate so
he<00:04:45.660> is<00:04:45.780> going<00:04:45.990> for<00:04:46.020> one<00:04:46.590> base<00:04:46.800> Corsairs<00:04:47.430> and<00:04:48.300> it

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
he is going for one base Corsairs and it

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.150 
he is going for one base Corsairs and it
will<00:04:48.720> be<00:04:48.870> slightly<00:04:49.470> difficult<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.980> pull<00:04:50.130> off

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
will be slightly difficult to pull off

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.620 
will be slightly difficult to pull off
because<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:50.610> really<00:04:50.850> don't<00:04:51.000> have<00:04:51.150> enough<00:04:51.390> gas

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
because you really don't have enough gas

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.660 
because you really don't have enough gas
to<00:04:51.690> go<00:04:52.020> for<00:04:52.230> Dark<00:04:52.650> Templar<00:04:53.010> right<00:04:53.220> afterwards

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
to go for Dark Templar right afterwards

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.520 
to go for Dark Templar right afterwards
perhaps<00:04:54.210> he's<00:04:54.360> gonna<00:04:54.480> go<00:04:54.660> for<00:04:54.810> Reavers<00:04:55.170> also

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
perhaps he's gonna go for Reavers also

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.980 
perhaps he's gonna go for Reavers also
uh<00:04:55.560> if<00:04:56.190> he<00:04:56.430> sees<00:04:56.670> uh<00:04:56.700> well<00:04:57.510> he<00:04:57.630> won't<00:04:57.780> have<00:04:57.900> that

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
uh if he sees uh well he won't have that

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.020 
uh if he sees uh well he won't have that
much<00:04:58.110> gas<00:04:58.260> to<00:04:58.410> do<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.650> anyway<00:04:58.920> but<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.160> guess<00:04:59.370> a

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
much gas to do it anyway but I guess a

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.210 
much gas to do it anyway but I guess a
perhaps<00:05:00.630> Corsairs<00:05:01.230> into<00:05:01.470> reverse<00:05:01.830> could<00:05:02.130> be

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
perhaps Corsairs into reverse could be

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.830 
perhaps Corsairs into reverse could be
an<00:05:02.280> option<00:05:02.610> for<00:05:02.640> him<00:05:02.790> like<00:05:03.390> I<00:05:03.450> said<00:05:03.630> I<00:05:03.660> haven't

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
an option for him like I said I haven't

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.840 
an option for him like I said I haven't
seen<00:05:04.050> this<00:05:04.140> game<00:05:04.320> before<00:05:04.470> um<00:05:04.980> I've<00:05:05.490> seen<00:05:05.520> the

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
seen this game before um I've seen the

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.400 
seen this game before um I've seen the
very<00:05:06.060> very<00:05:06.300> end<00:05:06.540> of<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:06.780> I<00:05:06.840> do<00:05:06.960> know<00:05:07.170> how<00:05:07.380> it

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
very very end of it I do know how it

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.560 
very very end of it I do know how it
ends<00:05:07.800> and<00:05:07.950> it<00:05:08.370> is<00:05:08.520> quite<00:05:08.820> spectacular

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
ends and it is quite spectacular

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.840 
ends and it is quite spectacular
I<00:05:09.600> have<00:05:09.750> to<00:05:09.870> give<00:05:10.020> it<00:05:10.140> to<00:05:10.650> you<00:05:10.770> guys<00:05:10.980> is<00:05:11.640> gonna

Corsairs<00:05:38.970> into<00:05:39.270> Dark<00:05:39.450> Templar<00:05:39.870> I<00:05:40.050> assume<00:05:40.320> and

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
Corsairs into Dark Templar I assume and

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.340 
Corsairs into Dark Templar I assume and
this<00:05:42.150> might<00:05:42.360> not<00:05:42.390> be<00:05:42.510> very<00:05:42.690> successful<00:05:42.960> again

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
this might not be very successful again

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.720 
this might not be very successful again
Savior<00:05:43.650> because<00:05:43.740> saviors<00:05:44.040> decide<00:05:44.310> not<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.550> go

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
Savior because saviors decide not to go

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.340 
Savior because saviors decide not to go
to<00:05:44.790> layer<00:05:45.000> first<00:05:45.180> he's<00:05:45.690> getting<00:05:45.900> his<00:05:46.020> hydrilla

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
to layer first he's getting his hydrilla

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.800 
to layer first he's getting his hydrilla
stand<00:05:46.680> up<00:05:46.830> and<00:05:46.980> he's<00:05:47.610> correctly<00:05:48.270> suspecting

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
stand up and he's correctly suspecting

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.420 
stand up and he's correctly suspecting
or<00:05:48.930> perhaps<00:05:49.020> he's<00:05:49.290> even<00:05:49.500> seen<00:05:49.800> they<00:05:50.010> Stargate

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
or perhaps he's even seen they Stargate

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.010 
or perhaps he's even seen they Stargate
so<00:05:50.550> he<00:05:50.640> knows<00:05:50.850> that<00:05:51.000> these<00:05:51.150> course<00:05:51.750> tires<00:05:51.930> are

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
so he knows that these course tires are

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.840 
so he knows that these course tires are
gonna<00:05:52.140> come<00:05:52.350> so<00:05:52.620> he's<00:05:53.100> gonna<00:05:53.250> get<00:05:53.400> hydrolyse

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
gonna come so he's gonna get hydrolyse

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.190 
gonna come so he's gonna get hydrolyse
out<00:05:54.000> and<00:05:54.150> I<00:05:54.180> feel<00:05:54.360> like<00:05:54.450> this<00:05:54.570> hydros<00:05:54.960> gonna<00:05:55.140> be

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
out and I feel like this hydros gonna be

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.140 
out and I feel like this hydros gonna be
quite<00:05:55.380> successful<00:05:55.590> against<00:05:56.280> whatever<00:05:56.880> an

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
quite successful against whatever an

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.360 
quite successful against whatever an
arrow<00:05:57.420> can<00:05:57.630> throw<00:05:57.840> at<00:05:57.900> him<00:05:58.020> because<00:05:59.010> Savior

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
arrow can throw at him because Savior

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.830 
arrow can throw at him because Savior
decided<00:05:59.730> not<00:05:59.820> to<00:05:59.880> go<00:06:00.060> for<00:06:00.270> spire<00:06:00.480> which<00:06:00.690> would

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
decided not to go for spire which would

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.720 
decided not to go for spire which would
have<00:06:00.930> taken<00:06:01.110> longer<00:06:01.350> and<00:06:01.650> he<00:06:02.370> probably<00:06:02.550> will

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
have taken longer and he probably will

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.060 
have taken longer and he probably will
lost<00:06:02.970> more<00:06:03.240> overlords<00:06:03.720> in<00:06:03.900> any<00:06:04.260> case<00:06:04.410> now<00:06:04.590> save

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
lost more overlords in any case now save

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.140 
lost more overlords in any case now save
you're<00:06:05.190> probably<00:06:05.430> producing<00:06:05.790> a<00:06:05.880> couple

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
you're probably producing a couple

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.150 
you're probably producing a couple
hydras<00:06:06.510> Savior<00:06:07.200> hasn't<00:06:07.560> gone<00:06:07.620> to<00:06:07.770> layer<00:06:07.980> yet

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
hydras Savior hasn't gone to layer yet

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.070 
hydras Savior hasn't gone to layer yet
so<00:06:08.430> now<00:06:08.850> our<00:06:08.880> will<00:06:09.180> have<00:06:09.330> a<00:06:09.360> tech<00:06:09.630> advantage

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
so now our will have a tech advantage

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.900 
so now our will have a tech advantage
but<00:06:10.350> I<00:06:10.530> feel<00:06:10.890> that<00:06:10.920> the<00:06:11.160> Savior<00:06:11.460> gets<00:06:11.640> a<00:06:11.730> couple

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
but I feel that the Savior gets a couple

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.580

below<00:07:13.770> the<00:07:13.889> ridge<00:07:14.039> it<00:07:14.159> looks<00:07:14.310> like<00:07:14.430> he<00:07:14.580> will

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:14.729 
below the ridge it looks like he will

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:16.610 
below the ridge it looks like he will
get<00:07:14.849> that<00:07:15.029> cannon<00:07:15.210> up<00:07:15.419> in<00:07:15.569> time<00:07:15.750> Savior<00:07:16.469> now

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 
get that cannon up in time Savior now

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.369 
get that cannon up in time Savior now
taking<00:07:16.949> that<00:07:17.069> layer<00:07:17.250> and<00:07:17.909> Sabir<00:07:18.629> I<00:07:18.810> think<00:07:19.080> yeah

00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:19.379 
taking that layer and Sabir I think yeah

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:21.610 
taking that layer and Sabir I think yeah
he<00:07:19.560> has<00:07:19.710> been<00:07:20.009> upgrade<00:07:20.310> for<00:07:20.430> his<00:07:20.550> hydrolysis

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:21.620 
he has been upgrade for his hydrolysis

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.629 
he has been upgrade for his hydrolysis
so<00:07:22.620> they<00:07:22.770> will<00:07:22.919> be<00:07:23.009> able<00:07:23.129> to<00:07:23.250> fight<00:07:23.490> those

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 
so they will be able to fight those

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:26.119 
so they will be able to fight those
zealots<00:07:23.939> quite<00:07:24.270> well<00:07:24.449> with<00:07:24.629> saviors<00:07:25.229> good<00:07:26.039> and

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:26.129 
zealots quite well with saviors good and

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:28.790 
zealots quite well with saviors good and
micro<00:07:26.460> those<00:07:26.699> hydraulics<00:07:27.479> and<00:07:27.620> now<00:07:28.620> we're<00:07:28.740> not

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 
micro those hydraulics and now we're not

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.980 
micro those hydraulics and now we're not
getting<00:07:29.039> another<00:07:29.219> pylon<00:07:29.699> and<00:07:29.909> a<00:07:30.210> cannon<00:07:30.750> looks

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990 
getting another pylon and a cannon looks

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.110 
getting another pylon and a cannon looks
like<00:07:31.110> he's<00:07:31.289> gonna<00:07:31.409> try<00:07:31.830> this<00:07:31.889> up<00:07:32.159> a<00:07:32.610> second

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 
like he's gonna try this up a second

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.519 
like he's gonna try this up a second
base<00:07:33.240> there<00:07:33.479> as<00:07:33.599> natural<00:07:33.930> expansion<00:07:34.169> and

Corsair<00:07:36.779> it<00:07:36.870> looks<00:07:36.990> like<00:07:37.110> he<00:07:37.229> hasn't<00:07:37.379> built

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:37.979 
Corsair it looks like he hasn't built

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:39.679
