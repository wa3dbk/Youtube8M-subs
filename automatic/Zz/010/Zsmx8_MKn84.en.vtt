00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
but I only for Depa this season we are

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.160 
but I only for Depa this season we are
very<00:00:50.160> strong<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.489> defense<00:00:50.969> he<00:00:51.480> get<00:00:51.660> has<00:00:51.840> very

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
very strong and defense he get has very

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.990 
very strong and defense he get has very
little<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.500> do<00:00:52.739> during<00:00:53.070> matches<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.850> that

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
little to do during matches and that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.260 
little to do during matches and that
means<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.420> our<00:00:54.539> defense<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.020> strong<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:56.270> think

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
that the key to playing matches at home

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.459 
that the key to playing matches at home
is<00:00:59.399> not<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.910> concede<00:01:00.210> any<00:01:00.390> goals<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.260> try
