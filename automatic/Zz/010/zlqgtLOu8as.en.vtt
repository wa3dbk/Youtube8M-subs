00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.020
 hello friends today we will 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.580
 to consider 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:19.160
 tales fishing gear 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.439
 which will be a little different from that 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:29.800
 which can be shown previous 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:36.050
 video means let's first talk about 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:40.390
 ways of catching a carp that is 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:45.710
 method of catching simple from the surface of the water 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:48.800
 there is a way to catch a carp in the thick 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:54.860
 water that is medium depths and the way 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.530
 new carp names from the bottom mean in 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.050
 This video we will consider 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:04.600
 way of fishing in the water column that is with 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.610
 average depths that for this we need well 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.119
 Basically, everything is the same as 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.920
 in the previous video 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:16.720
 catching thick from the surface that is it 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:22.609
 feeding trough 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.310
 spring and 3 saved but hooks are already here 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:31.280
 I advance 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:35.049
 by tethered and so will we use 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:39.679
 bowl 4 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:43.029
 means what we need for this means 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:47.649
 will need to have a contract weight well which 

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:50.509
 I had to call ourselves we conduct 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:54.020
 then probably got to arrange either 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.650
 Separately , somehow there we show it 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.430
 killed 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:02.290
 music from will help again us 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:07.970
 tubule 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:13.510
 counteractor means initially 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:18.970
 what do you need that is we need cutting 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:23.420
 to hook at the fact that Zaporozhye 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.550
 what we now do well as 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.560
 Shows I already showed in the previous 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:34.970
 video like color cao this this park 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:39.410
 let's show you here again 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:42.320
 if like a petechka mouth jumped in the very 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.690
 foot arm if you like . means and 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.670
 little wood insert in the loop 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:53.270
 and take udobot but I use these 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:57.940
 round nose pliers are not just so convenient then 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.940
 there is a tension 100 turns threshold 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:13.060
 cutting all the way further that we put here 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.330
 we pass the line in the hole near the weights 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:21.050
 pass 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:25.180
 and floor and pass the wood in the holes 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.180
 behind me a tubing counter 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:37.250
 now everything is out of here 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:40.880
 so it turns out such a panel here in 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.930
 weight we have what exactly weapons have 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.870
 such weights if such a hole 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:52.030
 that is, you understand what is permissible 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:55.720
 so that he jumped over the threshold of 100 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:00.470
 that is, the parrot did not bother him 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:04.910
 previous video there as a weight attached 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.850
 to the slider its 100 threshold naturally as 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.690
 he got 100 watered the pipe itself 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:16.250
 Well, of course he did not let sleep 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.810
 crawl or have a weight off yourself here in 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.150
 this method 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.520
 it turns out that the weight of us comes to 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.080
 the tubule itself 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:36.360
 protivozakruchivatel as well, and then we 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.360
 we tie the very potatoes you 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:51.729
 so that 's what we get 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:53.830
 means feed chock tubule here we have 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:57.849
 100 threshold which 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:00.940
 Well, stoparik tubule with tobacco and 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:07.840
 smoke and expose the depth of the whole 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:11.169
 snap these understandable yes and that weights 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:15.729
 we dress on the tubule itself 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:19.169
 finds everything well and now I am also a chain 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.169
 float here 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:32.400
 All you have here is a ready rig 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:37.139
 that is, but that's understandable on such a plan 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:40.389
 that is, it differs previous lubrication 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.440
 Well, by design it is clear that is it 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.490
 everything is used 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.020
 counter feeder 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.710
 the only difference is that it turns out 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:53.159
 attachment of the weight that is, the weight here 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.650
 sliding which is obtained 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:59.199
 jumps off when prompted from the duct then 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.699
 are you when brother throws the whole 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:07.180
 snap-in when it is privately rendered light and 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:08.349
 everything and one falls again decided 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.729
 osnaz. 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:18.909
 This video is obtained that is 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:23.349
 Only in the previous video, well, this is smas. 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:26.969
 permissible she can catch yes somewhere before 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:29.409
 30 centimeters further if you already have 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:31.029
 benefits more than to put that is, 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.990
 inconvenient to throw 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:38.199
 here everything turns out ok then 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:43.449
 is at request can exhibit 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:47.560
 let's say literally the depth 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:51.340
 yes what you like, that is, well, I think 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:54.550
 about three meters to insert and break here 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:57.970
 exactly found it give i want hit 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:01.630
 it is us. why i did exactly 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:06.870
 such equipment because there are reservoirs 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:10.780
 where are we supposed to be from above 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:14.040
 do not peck that is therefore accounted for 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:18.190
 let's look it up on other depth and 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:22.750
 for this you need just such an equipment 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:24.130
 there is no one can own you both from above and from 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.970
 medium depths 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:31.110
 the only thing possible is the principle of pic 1 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:34.840
 catch it that is clean it up hobies 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:39.790
 removed from us. you just 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:46.950
 lies on the bottom of everything in such a plan that is 

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:51.550
 I think that is valid for those reservoirs 

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:54.810
 somewhere on the table they bite but not on top but in 

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:57.810
 thicker than water here is a tackle just 

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.810
 is necessary
