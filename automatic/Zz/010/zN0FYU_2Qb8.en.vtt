 about twenty meters it is 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.359
 still not given by pierre lévesque 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.100
 big coup so with the titan

 he's from swedish morning he's gone to his 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.920

 review now by carisaie recital 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.309
 its exterior it was expected to 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.720
 had the docks come to take 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.040
 the orders of the test is without 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.330
 doubt we will now harden something 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.489
 who wants the race to see in Jeddah blessed 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.199
 who ensured his departure also and 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.239
 for now and penultimate not pay and 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.190
 in the back also had the number 16 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.780
 of soliman gaza that rose to the back of the 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.890
 platoon to small in your line is at 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.899
 rest the other is over so far 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.390
 occagnes risk of everything is very retarded 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.530
 as is tina of citrus number 3 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.850
 there is always a lot of rhythm in 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.470
 this test with a recital carisaie 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.760
 that speeds up outside to tempt 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.350
 to get a foothold 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.360
 very for the moment paris 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.740
 apple 30 days in their wake we are 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.450
 very well passed already with lord lovef 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.759
 on a fourth line rope side 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.409
 accompanied by a high risk of 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.630
 charming princes then coming in 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.400
 reggae company music waiter 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.870
 Kippur 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.310
 position for agathe the abbey as to 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.500
 he finds himself at the back of the pack 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.810
 alongside swedish hand and then among 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.090
 the last departures riders from tagore and 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.439
 so well worn 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.710
 the advantage always for recital 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.940
 carisaie who in turn and 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.740
 we take control of a machine that 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.420
 may be coming now second 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.070
 position to its outside put a small 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.420
 little in the box a mediocre who 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.000
 will have a good journey with a good 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.160
 point 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.700
 in third position rather rope side 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.110
 and 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.149
 that we disqualified from tina of citrus 1 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.680
 which had imposed itself in a quinté to 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.030
 agen and disqualifications beginning of 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.860
 Course tutors what passage 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.140
 in front of the stands with always 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.460
 recital carisaie who has the advantage one have 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.380
 dropped as soon as they prove themselves wrong then 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.299
 that it was becoming so to join the 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.920
 recital carisaie at the head of the event saw 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.840
 that my two

 of the prodeco leader ip operator 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.200
 will disrupt hunting a little on 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.940
 third legal line the osi a very good 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.050
 course in fourth position of debt 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.150
 senior and green and who will know 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.090
 bring closer the number 5 which speeds up 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.660
 now 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.660
 rejoin 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.390
 is followed as his shadow by 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.310
 numbers 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.319
 radjah of the abbey when they thought 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.890
 swedish match 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.400
 since they are among the last 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.959
 records 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.040
 a water the chesnaie campion that go 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.540
 approach in a few moments the one 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.950
 childhood in wood that radjah of the abbey 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.540
 find yourself a little less windward 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.400
 for now he says in third 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.569
 glove thickness for now linked that 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.010
 do not tell me we see some media 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.840
 who is always well placed second 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.269
 position in the rope of a trap 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.260
 Khattabi recitals recital that continues 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.400
 now closed times taken over by 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.319
 third position outside the 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.319
 weaver in terrassa 5th Tuesday 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.329
 in his effort 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.620
 manga my lord lovef who is not 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.810
 very far but who had laperrine 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.819
 still before the singapore brocarde 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.439
 sling that organizes in vampire we go quickly 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.969
 where the opposite line with a recital 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.709
 carisaie which now under the threat of 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.909
 radjah of the abbey in third position 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.319
 we always had is that medoc 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.909
 with also rykiel gains 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.709
 perfect course for the moment that shaves 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.329
 apple still 33 of the highest rated since 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.690
 will know and then a little bit more 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.430
 far 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.170
 Yes 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.150
 it takes a number 4 singapore sling and 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.590
 without risk of happening if such crisis is 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.390
 unfortunately during that time and 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.920
 well 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.110
 which accelerates and puts the pressure 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.310
 on navy radio to address the last 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.420
 straight line is nice 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.500
 closer but still very far from view 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.300
 of all kinds of rajab the abbey 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.680
 also decidedly there are a lot of 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.270
 thirty years to the tic density because they 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.410
 were very prominent and this leaves the 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.700
 free field now to dream of a 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.050
 vehicle for the victory had seen that 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.330
 the notes and in second position to 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.040
 several lengths 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.200
 apple had not missed on chip or 10 months 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.910
 maybe take a good third 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.060
 place of their bus themselves there is 150 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.349
 meters to go with red bull 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.660
 advantage of mistakes that plays discrete and 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.670
 olic who had water up to the medoc 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.380
 will be difficult 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.330
 third place for a tagore actor 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.610
 father tamesna to have then 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.760
 talk to your lawn 2 or number 13 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.010
 senior 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.239
 of rebounding in this step in 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.290
 the week for the first race is 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.180
 income at the end of residency zinc 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.069
 completely missed his retirement game 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.510
 exactly disqualified unfortunately 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.549
 from the first meters of the race 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.540
 we'll see right away the arrival at 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.540
 slowed for dictaure
