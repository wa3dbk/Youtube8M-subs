now you can tell me what this part of

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.020 
now you can tell me what this part of
the<00:03:11.190> plan<00:03:11.430> is<00:03:11.640> called<00:03:14.209> very<00:03:15.209> good<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:16.230> flower

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
the plan is called very good the flower

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.060 
the plan is called very good the flower
the<00:03:18.030> flower<00:03:18.360> is<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.810> colored<00:03:19.440> part<00:03:19.800> of<00:03:19.890> the

is the fruit the flower makes seeds and
these<00:03:37.860> seeds<00:03:38.220> spread<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.150> make<00:03:39.420> new<00:03:39.810> plans

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
these seeds spread and make new plans
