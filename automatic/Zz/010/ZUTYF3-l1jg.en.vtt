00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
actually currently use them in my BBVA

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.090 
actually currently use them in my BBVA
squad<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.940> my<00:00:39.120> main<00:00:39.329> camera<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.230> actually<00:00:40.950> know

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
squad on my main camera so actually know

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.619 
squad on my main camera so actually know
quite<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.340> lot<00:00:41.399> about<00:00:41.520> Bravo<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.239> he<00:00:42.300> seems<00:00:42.540> to

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
quite a lot about Bravo and he seems to

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.750 
quite a lot about Bravo and he seems to
be<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.750> pretty<00:00:42.989> good<00:00:43.110> pick<00:00:43.410> up<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.190> think<00:00:44.520> we

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
be a pretty good pick up and I think we

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.000 
be a pretty good pick up and I think we
won<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.270> about<00:00:45.420> 950<00:00:46.230> coins<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:46.559> not<00:00:46.770> too

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
won but for about 950 coins so not too

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.520 
won but for about 950 coins so not too
much<00:00:47.250> overpriced<00:00:48.180> or<00:00:48.420> overpay<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:48.960> him<00:00:49.260> so

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
much overpriced or overpay for him so

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.319 
much overpriced or overpay for him so
very<00:00:50.039> very<00:00:50.160> good<00:00:50.460> signing<00:00:50.850> right<00:00:50.940> there<00:00:51.180> and

very very good signing right there and

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.850 
very very good signing right there and

page 59 shot and got some nice defensive

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.100 
page 59 shot and got some nice defensive
stats<00:04:30.520> so<00:04:30.669> he<00:04:30.819> can<00:04:31.030> slot<00:04:31.360> in<00:04:31.479> two<00:04:31.599> hours<00:04:31.840> sent<00:04:32.050> a

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
stats so he can slot in two hours sent a

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.930 
stats so he can slot in two hours sent a
mid<00:04:32.289> roll<00:04:32.470> nicely<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:33.190> because<00:04:33.789> we're

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
mid roll nicely and because we're

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.640 
mid roll nicely and because we're
currently<00:04:34.150> playing<00:04:34.509> a<00:04:34.690> cam<00:04:34.930> in<00:04:35.080> center<00:04:35.319> mid<00:04:35.470> so

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
currently playing a cam in center mid so

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.469 
currently playing a cam in center mid so
I<00:04:35.860> think<00:04:36.220> we'll<00:04:36.430> just<00:04:36.460> get<00:04:36.759> equal<00:04:37.120> chemistry

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
I think we'll just get equal chemistry

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:38.850 
I think we'll just get equal chemistry
out<00:04:37.599> even<00:04:37.870> more<00:04:37.900> chemistry<00:04:38.289> as<00:04:38.560> you're<00:04:38.710> about

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
out even more chemistry as you're about

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.740 
out even more chemistry as you're about
to<00:04:38.919> see<00:04:39.039> here<00:04:39.430> are<00:04:39.729> about<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.090> swap<00:04:40.300> Vincent

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.689 
the comments I can still show you me
applying<00:05:17.169> them<00:05:17.409> but<00:05:17.889> there's<00:05:18.099> no<00:05:18.190> point<00:05:18.430> me<00:05:18.520> by

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
applying them but there's no point me by

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.159 
applying them but there's no point me by
in<00:05:18.759> contracts<00:05:19.389> and<00:05:19.539> fitness<00:05:19.780> cards<00:05:20.020> because

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
in contracts and fitness cards because

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:21.779 
in contracts and fitness cards because
that<00:05:20.469> would<00:05:20.590> be<00:05:20.830> an<00:05:20.919> absolute<00:05:21.250> waste<00:05:21.370> of<00:05:21.520> coins

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
that would be an absolute waste of coins

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.719 
that would be an absolute waste of coins
in<00:05:22.060> my<00:05:22.449> opinion<00:05:22.750> but<00:05:23.110> and<00:05:23.349> I<00:05:24.039> don't<00:05:24.400> know<00:05:24.460> maybe

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
in my opinion but and I don't know maybe

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.580 
in my opinion but and I don't know maybe
you<00:05:24.880> guys<00:05:25.060> a<00:05:25.120> disagree<00:05:25.750> but<00:05:25.900> I<00:05:26.199> think<00:05:26.409> it'll<00:05:26.560> be

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
you guys a disagree but I think it'll be

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.020 
you guys a disagree but I think it'll be
the<00:05:26.680> best<00:05:26.830> way<00:05:27.009> for<00:05:27.190> the<00:05:27.250> series<00:05:27.550> so<00:05:27.669> I<00:05:27.699> can<00:05:27.909> get

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
the best way for the series so I can get

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.640 
the best way for the series so I can get
some<00:05:28.090> better<00:05:28.389> players<00:05:28.659> and<00:05:28.930> you<00:05:29.530> know<00:05:29.620> just

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
some better players and you know just

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.290 
some better players and you know just
and<00:05:30.159> keep<00:05:30.340> moving<00:05:30.490> on<00:05:30.669> with<00:05:30.819> series<00:05:31.150> and

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
and keep moving on with series and

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.689 
and keep moving on with series and
getting<00:05:31.539> new<00:05:31.900> players<00:05:32.380> etc<00:05:32.530> and<00:05:32.979> but<00:05:33.490> this

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
getting new players etc and but this

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.159 
getting new players etc and but this
game<00:05:33.849> was<00:05:33.909> so<00:05:34.330> so<00:05:34.539> like<00:05:34.719> it<00:05:34.930> was<00:05:35.020> like<00:05:35.110> a

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
game was so so like it was like a

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.680 
game was so so like it was like a
two-bar<00:05:35.620> latency<00:05:36.159> and<00:05:36.340> but<00:05:36.819> we<00:05:36.880> do<00:05:36.969> out<00:05:37.389> we<00:05:37.569> are

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
two-bar latency and but we do out we are

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.330 
two-bar latency and but we do out we are
actually<00:05:37.930> won<00:05:38.289> a<00:05:38.319> lot<00:05:38.560> without<00:05:38.680> commenting<00:05:39.219> in

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
actually won a lot without commenting in

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.309 
actually won a lot without commenting in
this<00:05:39.580> game<00:05:39.789> and<00:05:39.969> but<00:05:40.509> then<00:05:40.630> we<00:05:40.719> go<00:05:40.840> make<00:05:40.990> it<00:05:41.020> to
