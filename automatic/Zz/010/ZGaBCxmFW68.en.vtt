00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.660
 farmer and farmer friends welcome to the farm and on all TVs 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.690
 for today and I will talk to you quickly due the new helmet of 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.580
 chelsea and zhuge which is called the camp 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.289
 to the statement that's why the insiders well just because 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.390
 that it does not actively to the us as it is a consequence theme of 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.279
 active noise reduction 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.310
 then it is part of the ring road the republic of ireland the amateurs there 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:29.880
 go 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.520
 and then the questions and the south intended for the first hour for the hour 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.830
 no meeting 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.250
 small cardboard box with flap on the tempo 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.880
 we find more lenient are all that explains us 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.880
 many things that I do not understand but in any case 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.810
 so we can immediately that the helmet is provided with the people loved him 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.390
 pettitte pouch which for metroid transport premium so little luck 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 discover the atomic bomb 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.640
 the two biggest cases the court must be happy 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.720
 against the clock to postpone your own fate 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.720
 your child will be born on the packaging 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.390
 so what does one of course find of your help belonging to the junta 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.010
 the deep in wonderland label of tim matthys seats for the great moments 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.670
 and it is important 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.350
 little muggles this quick step 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.430
 so pointed to this historical day 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.190
 it's kind of funny when we open it's the whole team 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.870
 but I'm aware that this is so moving that's why it's because 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.680
 that he is foldable the rogue 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.740
 so it's more a question of perspective 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.660
 since 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.070
 but I'll talk about it in one or the other a microphone boom as 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.390
 jack 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.390
 the current proportions gold-plated social detachable 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.150
 he becomes a producer 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.170
 in a rubberized cable with his own investigation in France 5 the veneered 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.170
 gold the little remote control the power 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.330
 for it is not too classic a fine a little brunette films the tone goes up 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.040
 already vehicles that can reduce his country a small pension 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.040
 the working approach not including a winning team 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.929
 a system that allows 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:15.439
 that's how I will not deny it a priori so it makes sense to submit 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.479
 at three points 5 for the talks have not been confirmed 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:19.349
 officially 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.319
 and that's for the microphone 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.760
 you understand what I'm mom is to tidy up if you do not use 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.379
 Okay 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.379
 very well so could be a small detachable cable 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.109
 I think about the rankings and even now so 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.769
 I think especially at the level of style 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.119
 carbon imitation the game 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:44.409
 look at a villain of the republic vielmur that makes flipper anyway at 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.559
 level of finishing done 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:51.579
 so really not bad we had titled there was still time to him in 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.249
 metal by my poor settings which probably people he scored for a 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.789
 little reminder a judge too much but it's nice the motion covered by what she 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:01.669
 is particularly blurry 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.579
 previous editions that keep doing everything 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.089
 which allow to allow him 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:10.319
 but the headphones as you see we have some freedom in England 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.709
 it is not bad at all 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.599
 despite rations 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:15.899
 cyclical 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:19.329
 when you press and then release the pill okay you have to put a 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.819
 held a little gives that will start the small path of 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.369
 active noise reduction point bar here so the connections 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:30.439
 I guess at a severe system startup or not 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.089
 inside so red for plastic earphones 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:38.009
 a foam covered with very flexible skateboard also a small tour 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.679
 euros acoustic 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:40.180
 m he likes the side 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.349
 in short the tone clearly distributed 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.239
 which is rather rare like what is why excellent student m% a 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.099
 snack 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.060
 if it takes three and a half hours I really like yes 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.260
 in fact I can not talk about the bottom for now if it's not 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.780
 others on the west coast very well on the other hand does everything for but a few 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.730
 news 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.730
 and that globally good that cover a spectrum of ten to twenty thousand people 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.420
 for those who do not pay so take big names in luxury because with 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.040
 this meeting claude puel in the written text coming soon 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.269
 on the farm and I think the people we will test will be very quickly 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.540
 to see if the active system of crude our friend rob huff it works well 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.470
 here but thank you very soon on the farm here
