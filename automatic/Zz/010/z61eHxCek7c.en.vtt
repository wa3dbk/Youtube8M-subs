00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.590
 hello friends of 10 I'm just you 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.480
 copying the idea to sheldon cooper because 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.820
 I've realized that walking is very 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.340
 tired and being this kind of robot is 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.439
 really really fun just to be 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.810
 have to really move what 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.420
 I want to tell you is that I'm in a 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.160
 brothel cesc of this apparatus pretty 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.720
 curious what is called robot blanket and what 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.480
 what works or what you try to do 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.580
 is to facilitate the telepresence of 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.320
 a more interactive way this product 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.129
 which is called robot blanket serves as a 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.180
 kind of physical person being in a 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.129
 videoconference you're going to say good to what 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.210
 this is usually referred to when you're 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.350
 making a video call 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.869
 videoconference then you have to load 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.250
 the laptop to move and in this case if 

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:55.589
 you want to show the room you want to see 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.350
 other people talking not about business but 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.089
 in your house but in this case really 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.040
 what it does is that this product is 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.830
 moves has speakers has a microphone and 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.930
 it seems or pretends that you're basically 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.909
 present in that place for all 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.350
 moms who get tired of your baby being 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.119
 crying three hours straight and 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.990
 suddenly also load it in arms 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.810
 it's heavy 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.930
 you can use this rocking chair 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.119
 in several ways there are many ways by 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.420
 example here we can see that he has the 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.329
 swing mode goes a kangaroo 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.820
 a little faster the car mode 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:33.250
 there is a kangaroo or a car 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.310
 and here you just put the baby obviously 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.409
 safely and also has this 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.300
 I play so that he is entertained 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.650
 while you months will also have 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.640
 music and equipment to be that has 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.640
 speakers 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.700
 a new friend that I found here in 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.760
 the c is his name is bots and justly 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.320
 it's a robot that's going to work like a 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.270
 companion who is going to shit your stuff 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.460
 This is mainly designed for 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.170
 the moms that are in the super or that 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.119
 imagine that they are going to Disneyland or 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.369
 somewhere where they can put everything there 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.530
 if you have children and how interesting 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.840
 of this is that it is following you through 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.640
 of this sensor in this case we unite 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.950
 via manual for example I'm going to walk 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.380
 right now a lot of people 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:20.550
 but we no longer 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.550
 crystallize isabel december 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.120
 and it's going to follow me everywhere it's going to be 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.340
 as a companion that will be 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.260
 carrying things with me and can withstand 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.390
 a weight of up to 22 kilograms 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.190
 Now this is a prototype but wait 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.870
 throw it for kickstarter needs 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.760
 raise approximately 100 thousand 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.770
 dollars I go and for now it does not have 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.330
 speech recognition if you have several 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.150
 commands but you still can not 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.890
 interact simultaneously and you can 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.170
 download an application so that 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.390
 controls everything there from your smartphone 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.860
 but basically you need the sensor 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.860
 so he can move with you 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.440
 Hello 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.770
 hi friends say hello look at me i'm 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.770
