00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
thing I could possibly think of is he

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.960 
thing I could possibly think of is he
was<00:04:26.580> going<00:04:27.000> for<00:04:27.410> those<00:04:28.410> troops<00:04:29.310> that<00:04:29.880> were

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
was going for those troops that were

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.130 
was going for those troops that were
down<00:04:30.120> on<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.330> bottom<00:04:30.420> fighting<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.930> Queen

down on the bottom fighting the Queen

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.290 
down on the bottom fighting the Queen
but<00:04:31.320> there's<00:04:31.470> no<00:04:31.740> way<00:04:31.980> that<00:04:32.430> he<00:04:32.790> would<00:04:33.120> have

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
but there's no way that he would have

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.180 
but there's no way that he would have
been<00:04:33.450> triggered<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.470> go<00:04:34.620> down<00:04:34.830> there<00:04:35.010> he

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
been triggered to go down there he

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.520 
been triggered to go down there he
didn't<00:04:35.580> hit<00:04:35.910> anything<00:04:36.450> that<00:04:37.230> would<00:04:37.410> have

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
didn't hit anything that would have

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.710 
didn't hit anything that would have
changed<00:04:37.560> his<00:04:38.190> AI<00:04:38.400> so<00:04:38.790> that<00:04:38.970> he<00:04:39.120> would<00:04:39.300> go<00:04:39.480> down

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
changed his AI so that he would go down

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.620 
changed his AI so that he would go down
there<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.370> on<00:04:41.370> top<00:04:41.610> of<00:04:41.640> that<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:42.300> jump

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
there and on top of that the jump

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.230 
there and on top of that the jump
because<00:04:43.320> it<00:04:43.590> acts<00:04:43.830> on<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.280> slightly<00:04:44.610> larger

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
because it acts on a slightly larger

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.960 
because it acts on a slightly larger
area<00:04:45.930> then<00:04:46.200> it<00:04:46.350> shows<00:04:46.710> he<00:04:47.520> would<00:04:47.730> have<00:04:47.820> been

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970
