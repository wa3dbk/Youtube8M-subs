00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.989
 here we have youtube welcome once 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.370
 more here to my channel and good as we are 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:06.930
 seeing in the title that I bring you a 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.930
 call of duty watch game 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.200
 we are now in frantic mode let's 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.230
 to see how I'm doing, you know that 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.119
 this wave is very difficult to play 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.449
 and I mean by having a camera 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.039
 opposite and well how difficult is it 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.990
 handle it with your foot psvita because the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.779
 true if it is very difficult those who 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.519
 has the playstation 4 and feet vita and more 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.520
 the game carlos durÃ© ghosts will be given 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.200
 It counts as how the difficult thing does not 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.940
 well maybe there's one you do them 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.220
 difficult because they do not have a camera 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.140
 opposite but then to those who make video 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.300
 well, they should also know what 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.650
 wave let's see what fart to see how we 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.660
 goes 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.580
 Now I know how to get half 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.850
 it's gun remembers that in the other 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.160
 video I did not know then here does as 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.140
 Servet aim will aim chequen 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.960
 we hit the screen and there was e 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.510
 there was now if we are giving lost there 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.270
 that sprouting lost hopefully not 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.460
 blur this shit just like our 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.570
 goal is to kill 5 always our goal is going 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.600
 to be killing 5 because of how difficult this is 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.030
 have already killed the first egg there 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.320
 I do not meddle by looking at what the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.479
 camera that was not there 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.180
 out of focus so that it is the same channel 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.000
 of that first death I did ok 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.760
 then nothing happens and there's going 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.670
 the truth came out all of a sudden 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.470
 that I find one in front in these 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.690
 battles always I think I'm going to 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.900
 lose because they have an advantage 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.020
 the control is the reason that I think that 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.680
 I will always lose the same as the one who wins 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.600
 Well, it's going to be pure luck 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.900
 of why the vato is going to be too 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.170
 no ok then let's see what wave as 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.050
 I told them I'm playing frantically something the 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.020
 It's going to taste just like we're going just mate 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.750
 I killed him and they already kicked me out 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.660
 They destroyed but it took 2 and I have 2 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.360
 At least I already knew how to tie the 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.530
 last video streak that many 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.660
 thanks to all of you for your 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.600
 comments and for me for leaving your line 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.730
 thank you very much we are going to have more than 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.790
 100 likes in each video that we are 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.800
 living of this type why why 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.140
 why then that motivates me the truth 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.860
 motivates to continue raising this type of 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.110
 gameplays and if we are going to follow him to see 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.420
 what's the truth, the best weapon 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.800
 I found of call of duty 2 is the 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.070
 best weapon 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.290
 I have found the one that works best for me 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.360
 good logically on the playstation in 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.200
 playstation 4 true because here if 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.200
 I'm going from the shit 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.359
 I think I've already been 4 I think it's going to 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.799
 kill her team forward is already going to be 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:54.859
 profit is going to be a win and love 5 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:59.739
 call t5 this, I think that 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.739
 I occupy killing more and I'm too good 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.110
 hey how does the teddy bear hear 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.489
 why let's go let's go to jaime de 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.650
 listen to one they discovered me with 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.890
 even look with that of exclusion 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.340
 but nothing happens and I have several 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.340
 deaths 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.780
 and that they have to see that they have it 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.130
 to see slowly and have to return the 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.390
 video 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.460
 and check out how to mate two of a single shot 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.050
 leave it down because the mind started to 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.520
 load the sticks ah no no no not even 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.770
 this did not even need to lower him 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.400
 Do not beat the street a little, do not do not do it 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.410
 finish 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.840

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.850

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.470
 departure that finds me face to face 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.350
 with 13 batum bat will be very difficult 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.540
 earn it 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.820
