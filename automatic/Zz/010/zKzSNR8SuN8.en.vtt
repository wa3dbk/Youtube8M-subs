to move in because you know stims to to

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.710 
to move in because you know stims to to
either<00:02:55.959> move<00:02:56.370> faster<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.030> can<00:02:58.269> closing

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
either move faster so you can closing

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.110 
either move faster so you can closing
the<00:02:58.810> distance<00:02:58.959> on<00:02:59.290> something<00:02:59.709> or<00:03:00.130> it<00:03:00.700> oddly

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
the distance on something or it oddly

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.790 
the distance on something or it oddly
enough<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:01.630> can<00:03:01.750> use<00:03:01.870> student<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.319> run<00:03:02.560> away

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
enough you can use student to run away

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.710 
enough you can use student to run away
from<00:03:03.010> people<00:03:03.550> because<00:03:04.000> you'll<00:03:04.300> be<00:03:04.420> able<00:03:04.510> to

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
from people because you'll be able to

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.220 
from people because you'll be able to
escape<00:03:05.019> them<00:03:05.739> or<00:03:06.550> to<00:03:07.360> be<00:03:07.750> able<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:08.049> shoot

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
escape them or to be able to shoot

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.630 
escape them or to be able to shoot
faster<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:08.739> that<00:03:08.769> lasts<00:03:09.160> tim<00:03:09.280> was<00:03:09.430> really

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
faster so that lasts tim was really

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.800 
faster so that lasts tim was really
unnecessary<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.239> this<00:03:10.329> is<00:03:10.390> something<00:03:10.630> a<00:03:10.690> lot

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
unnecessary and this is something a lot

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.300 
unnecessary and this is something a lot

troops<00:03:16.870> when<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.829> know<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.010> don't<00:03:18.310> need<00:03:18.519> to

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
do that because then your medevacs are

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.120 
do that because then your medevacs are
going<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.200> have<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.380> use<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.650> manner<00:03:20.890> they

fast-forward this a little this is a

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.660 
fast-forward this a little this is a
really<00:03:39.400> good<00:03:39.519> example<00:03:39.579> of<00:03:40.120> how<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.739> kite<00:03:41.739> units

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
really good example of how to kite units

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.920 
really good example of how to kite units
with<00:03:42.850> your<00:03:43.000> Marauders<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.600> your<00:03:43.690> Marines

using stimpack sim pack allows you to

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.170 
using stimpack sim pack allows you to
shoot<00:03:47.290> faster<00:03:47.890> dealing<00:03:48.280> more<00:03:48.370> damage<00:03:48.430> it<00:03:49.000> also

allows<00:03:49.390> you<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.840> move<00:03:50.049> faster<00:03:50.670> which<00:03:51.670> can

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
allows you to move faster which can

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.360 
allows you to move faster which can
enable<00:03:52.299> better<00:03:53.140> kiting<00:03:53.739> of<00:03:53.920> units<00:03:54.310> as<00:03:54.459> well<00:03:55.390> as

it's<00:04:53.800> going<00:04:54.040> to<00:04:54.100> avoid<00:04:55.000> those<00:04:55.750> nail<00:04:56.410> a<00:04:56.560> truth

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
it's going to avoid those nail a truth

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.900 
it's going to avoid those nail a truth
so<00:04:57.040> this<00:04:57.160> is<00:04:57.190> something<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:57.610> want<00:04:57.669> to<00:04:57.760> do<00:04:57.880> a

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
so this is something you want to do a

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.210 
so this is something you want to do a
zealot<00:04:58.389> reserved<00:04:58.810> wings<00:04:59.110> with<00:04:59.470> ultra<00:05:00.010> list

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
zealot reserved wings with ultra list

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.180 
zealot reserved wings with ultra list
especially<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:01.450> it<00:05:01.810> you<00:05:02.290> know<00:05:02.410> allows<00:05:02.800> you<00:05:03.010> to

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
especially and it you know allows you to

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.010 
especially and it you know allows you to
avoid<00:05:03.430> damage

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
avoid damage

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.369 
avoid damage
and<00:05:05.620> the<00:05:06.190> syntax<00:05:06.699> really<00:05:07.120> makes<00:05:07.629> it<00:05:07.840> work<00:05:08.050> so

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
and the syntax really makes it work so

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.320 
and the syntax really makes it work so
effectively<00:05:08.830> because<00:05:09.190> your<00:05:09.699> troops<00:05:09.910> are<00:05:10.060> kind

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
effectively because your troops are kind

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.409 
effectively because your troops are kind
of<00:05:10.419> moving<00:05:10.629> at<00:05:10.870> a<00:05:10.900> double<00:05:11.620> speed<00:05:11.940> so<00:05:12.940> you<00:05:13.300> can

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
of moving at a double speed so you can

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.450 
of moving at a double speed so you can
see<00:05:13.569> this<00:05:13.690> large<00:05:13.930> also<00:05:14.889> this<00:05:15.009> course<00:05:15.250> has<00:05:15.400> been

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
see this large also this course has been

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.610 
see this large also this course has been
whittled<00:05:15.909> down<00:05:15.970> a<00:05:16.090> lot<00:05:16.360> now<00:05:16.810> also<00:05:17.050> they're<00:05:17.409> so

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
whittled down a lot now also they're so

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.899 
whittled down a lot now also they're so
expensive<00:05:17.830> he's<00:05:18.190> already<00:05:18.430> out<00:05:18.520> of<00:05:18.639> money

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
expensive he's already out of money

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.089 
expensive he's already out of money
worth<00:05:19.090> by<00:05:19.270> doing<00:05:19.509> this<00:05:19.629> and<00:05:20.560> then<00:05:20.710> you<00:05:20.740> can<00:05:20.919> see

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
worth by doing this and then you can see

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:22.740 
worth by doing this and then you can see
right<00:05:21.310> here<00:05:21.729> he's<00:05:21.879> going<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.120> clump<00:05:22.389> up<00:05:22.569> his

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
right here he's going to clump up his

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.749 
right here he's going to clump up his
troops<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.319> he's<00:05:23.800> going<00:05:23.919> to<00:05:24.009> stop<00:05:24.280> doing<00:05:24.520> that

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
troops and he's going to stop doing that

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.089 
troops and he's going to stop doing that
now<00:05:25.030> they're<00:05:25.750> not<00:05:25.960> that<00:05:26.500> low<00:05:26.830> on<00:05:27.009> health

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
now they're not that low on health

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:28.740 
now they're not that low on health
they're<00:05:27.370> pretty<00:05:27.610> low<00:05:27.789> on<00:05:27.909> health<00:05:28.060> but<00:05:28.330> they

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
they're pretty low on health but they

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.409 
they're pretty low on health but they
can<00:05:28.930> still<00:05:29.139> stim<00:05:29.530> a<00:05:29.770> couple<00:05:30.250> more<00:05:30.430> times<00:05:30.639> to<00:05:31.210> UM

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
can still stim a couple more times to UM

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.360 
can still stim a couple more times to UM
to<00:05:31.659> be<00:05:31.810> effective<00:05:32.139> but<00:05:32.229> if<00:05:32.440> they<00:05:32.800> don't<00:05:33.129> do

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
to be effective but if they don't do

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.309 
to be effective but if they don't do
that<00:05:33.580> you<00:05:34.060> can<00:05:34.240> see<00:05:34.419> these<00:05:34.690> ultra<00:05:35.169> lyst

money's worth they're completely but you

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.760 
money's worth they're completely but you
can<00:05:55.479> see<00:05:55.630> if<00:05:55.750> he<00:05:55.870> continued<00:05:56.319> to<00:05:56.349> do<00:05:56.590> that

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
can see if he continued to do that

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.370
