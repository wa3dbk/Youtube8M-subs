00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.120
 Pupa is an Italian doll that is said to move by itself and that its 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.210
 facial expressions as well as your arms and legs change 

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:12.719
 change is said to move the things that surround it on the closed shelf where 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:13.919
 Is stored 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.330
 Since the death of its owner in 2005 the activities of whore have increased 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.560
 considerably and it seems that she wanted to be released from her prison 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.810
 he still uses his original blue felt suit as well as some other 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.310
 original accessories and despite their delicate appearance 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.779
 it is said that his activities are rough 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.149
 their owners report that when they pass near their shelf they hear small blows 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.030
 in the glass and when they turn around, they discover the hand of the doll touching the glass 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.730
 besides observing the doll in different positions inside the shelf 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.620
 The particularity of this doll is that it was made in the image and likeness of its 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.570
 owner in trieste italia 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.890
 a custom deeply rooted in many parts of the world so much so that some 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.780
 of these dolls have real hair provided by the boy or girl 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.770
 which emulate human hair sold to the doll maker as is the case 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.840
 of whore 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.940
 for unknown reasons the spirits are very attracted to these 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.230
 toys and especially that dolls are very likely to create links 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.370
 very strong emotional feelings with their owners which have been shown to 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.770
 Although their owners have grown or even died 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.880
 the original owner had a whore from her five or six years 1920 until her death 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.100
 in 2005 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.009
 the doll survived the horrors of World War II as well as 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.300
 several attempts of destruction in later dates 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.170
 even so the doll always stayed next to its owner during the trips 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.570
 out of Italy towards the eu and back 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.120
 currently the activities of whore are only in the circle 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.680
 family although her previous owner said that her doll spoke with her and 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.600
 warned him of some danger during his childhood although he never felt 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.400
 scared with a fear reaction towards his wrist however in these 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.280
 days the owners declare that when they pass close to the wrist they feel that their 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.090
 look at it and that sometimes you can see changes in the factions of 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.740
 the face of Cuba 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.430
 This doll lives with her owner Marie Ford in the state of Washington 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.729
 eua this is a very active and proven doll that there is something strange with her 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:15.559
 The doll has been heard whispering to the people when their ears are 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:17.319
 close to the wrist face 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.379
 has a very heavy and icy look that follows people 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.809
 the doll is kept in a closed shelf and belonged to the 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:28.099
 grandmother of the gÃ¼eria who said that the doll is possessed by the spirit 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.290
 of your grandmother's best friend who died as a child and that was formed 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.729
 strange link 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:37.679
 in some of the psychophonies that have been able to capture the phrase of 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.679
 I want to stay here and suffer alone 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:45.509
 joliet's story goes back four generations ago ana g la 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:49.209
 current object's fist says that this doll came to her from her 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.639
 mother who in turn received her from her own and she from her own 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.339
 mother 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:57.039
 every daughter of the family carries the curse of having a boy and a girl 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.519
 and from which the child would die irremediably within three days of 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.509
 born 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:05.029
 the family has the belief that it will be so until the end of the family and that 

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:08.029
 the doll is keeping the soul of those dead children 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.389
 over the years, family members declare that they have listened to 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.689
 jolie will explore and sob with different baby voices at the same 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.280
 time and that on certain nights you hear a heartbreaking scream I wanted to go 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:22.769
 to the blood in the room where the doll is 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.000
 Ana says that she already suffered the loss of her son after three days as well as 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:30.669
 her predecessors and that she would also pass the doll to her daughter to follow the 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:34.419
 sad tradition the family is fond of him as they take care of the souls of their 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.009
 lost children 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.799
 He also relates that the doll came to his family when a neighbor of his 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.949
 Grandma gave him the object when she was pregnant with his genders 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.079
 and that over time they told their grandmother that the neighbor with envy 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.079
 waiting to affect her had given him the damn object 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.680
 this doll of more than 100 years was a gift made by the king and humberto 1st 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.419
 the daughter one of his most beloved and faithful guards ubaldo velina captain 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.699
 of the royal guard who also died killed like his king 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:07.729
 the doll survived both world wars losing its arms and part 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:11.559
 of his hair during a bomb attack on a railroad that was traveling 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:12.339
 audina 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:16.139
 for being a gift from his father and the king the doll had high sentimental value 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.220
 for marie so he took a chance to rescue her from the rubble 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.890
 but a woman offered to go by the wrist and having rescued her died 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.439
 during his escape by another explosion 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:30.059
 from that day it is said that the doll encloses the soul of that 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:31.340
 disdainful woman 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.139
 it is said that the doll opens and closes its eyes for no apparent reason and that 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.590
 He listens and whines the wrist calling his mother at night to 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.970
 Although its sound box has been ruined for years 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.110
 amanda lives very reluctantly in closed in a place in atlanta georgia where by 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.509
 now he rests since they have moved a lot since three years ago that he went out to the 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:52.809
 sale on ebay 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:56.759
 This is not any toy, much less to have it near their children 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.320
 declares reggie jacobs 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.060
 researcher of the paranormal center of atlanta 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.010
 has passed through many hands and is said to be one of the most possessed dolls 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.830
 of the world 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.919
 the biscayne style the doll was very famous several years ago so 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.280
 there are very few of these dolls and the few survivors are too expensive 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.400
 or too possessed to play with them 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.610
 this particular face was designed by henry chen durk but since 1885 the 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.960
 bisque heads were made by the famous company Simon and the bid 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.930
 grace and not in Thuringia germany which was founded in 1869 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.500
 many of the heads of the surviving dolls have the signature simona 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.870
 levi 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.639
 but what makes this doll special is that within the style and time 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.349
 has any brand 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:44.099
 Amanda's recent life can be traced back to Eva and since she came out 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:45.449
 sale three years ago 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.470
 it is said that the ghost that owns it is very active and destructive and you are not from 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:52.949
 your liking and will continue to do so until you change your owner 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.970
 amanda moves by herself and there have been heard scratches that come from inside 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:58.919
 of the places where you are saved 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.689
 others talk about bad luck since the doll has entered their lives and 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:06.400
 many of the owners point out that the doll moves and performs mischief in 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.610
 their houses almost harassing them when they live alone 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.449
 when asked why not get rid of the wrist ana notes that the family 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.310
 He carries the curse of losing his children and that losing souls would be 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.589
 too 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:20.409
