00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
really it's been a few years so he's a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.620 
really it's been a few years so he's a
guy<00:00:17.369> who<00:00:17.430> actually<00:00:17.640> played<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.240> position<00:00:18.330> in

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
guy who actually played that position in

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.970 
guy who actually played that position in
high<00:00:18.750> school<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.109> we<00:00:19.260> project<00:00:19.439> him<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.800> play

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980
