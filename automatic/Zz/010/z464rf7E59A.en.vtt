00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.540
 you know how much time you need to 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.150
 form an opinion of another person 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:17.439
 communication experts like allan 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:20.020
 pease say 7 seconds in only 7 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.759
 seconds of form is an opinion of another 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.310
 person 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.279
 this means that you as a presenter 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.470
 when you go on stage you have only 7 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.680
 seconds to try to cause a good 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.660
 first impression and all this without even so 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.050
 I have not even uttered a single 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.050
 word 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.910
 but what can you do in such a short time 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.920
 to make that good first impression 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.739
 and start your speech on the right foot 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.670
 There are three aspects that influence how 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.670
 others perceive you 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.090
 the first aspect is your way of dressing 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.520
 If you wear formal or informal wear suit 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.290
 American wearing the tie you wear 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.440
 women wear jackets costumes 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:09.250
 colorful skirts you use bright colors 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:13.210
 muted colors worn watch 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.920
 all these different elements add up and 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.460
 affect the perception that others 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.460

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.229
 the second aspect is your appearance 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:27.200
 physical you do not choose the face you have but 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.440
