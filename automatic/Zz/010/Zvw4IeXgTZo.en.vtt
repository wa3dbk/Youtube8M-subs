00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.010 
the blue one is actually going to be for
a<00:02:17.180> very<00:02:17.569> sensitive<00:02:18.560> skin<00:02:18.830> type<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:20.060> any<00:02:20.569> skin

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
a very sensitive skin type so any skin

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.170 
a very sensitive skin type so any skin
type<00:02:21.200> that<00:02:21.410> is<00:02:21.530> super<00:02:22.069> super<00:02:22.250> or<00:02:22.580> sensitive<00:02:23.000> so

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
type that is super super or sensitive so

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.680 
type that is super super or sensitive so
that<00:02:23.330> would<00:02:23.450> be<00:02:23.600> like<00:02:23.780> maybe<00:02:23.959> rosacea<00:02:24.590> or

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
that would be like maybe rosacea or

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.890 
that would be like maybe rosacea or
possibly<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.810> skin<00:02:27.380> type<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:27.890> is<00:02:28.390> acneic<00:02:29.390> and

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
possibly a skin type that is acneic and

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.870 
possibly a skin type that is acneic and
can<00:02:30.290> take<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.500> lot<00:02:30.739> of<00:02:30.770> pressure<00:02:31.040> on<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.580> skin

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
can take a lot of pressure on the skin

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.280 
can take a lot of pressure on the skin
so<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.180> lot<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.390> people<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.840> made<00:02:32.989> me<00:02:33.110> have

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
so a lot of people that made me have

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.290 
so a lot of people that made me have
papules<00:02:34.040> which<00:02:34.370> are<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.640> red<00:02:34.819> little<00:02:35.030> raised

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
papules which are the red little raised

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.180 
papules which are the red little raised
bumps<00:02:35.720> this<00:02:35.840> would<00:02:36.020> be<00:02:36.140> excellent<00:02:36.560> for<00:02:36.950> them

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
bumps this would be excellent for them

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.820 
bumps this would be excellent for them
and<00:02:37.670> this<00:02:38.630> one<00:02:38.959> you<00:02:39.170> can<00:02:39.200> see<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.620> bristles

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
and this one you can see the bristles

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.309 
and this one you can see the bristles
are<00:02:40.280> a<00:02:40.310> little<00:02:40.850> bit<00:02:41.060> closer<00:02:41.330> together<00:02:41.720> and

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
are a little bit closer together and

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.490 
are a little bit closer together and
then<00:02:42.890> it's<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.160> lot<00:02:43.340> softer<00:02:43.610> as<00:02:44.060> well<00:02:47.500> now

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
then it's a lot softer as well now

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.280 
then it's a lot softer as well now
because<00:02:48.860> my<00:02:49.100> skin<00:02:49.489> is<00:02:49.910> neither<00:02:50.360> normal<00:02:50.810> skin

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
because my skin is neither normal skin

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.610 
because my skin is neither normal skin
type<00:02:51.530> or<00:02:51.769> sensitive<00:02:52.580> I<00:02:52.970> decided<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:54.140> order<00:02:54.320> the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
type or sensitive I decided to order the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.309 
type or sensitive I decided to order the
deep<00:02:54.860> pore<00:02:55.160> cleansing<00:02:55.760> because<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:56.720> have<00:02:56.959> more

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
deep pore cleansing because I have more

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.979 
deep pore cleansing because I have more
of<00:02:57.530> an<00:02:57.709> oily<00:02:57.920> t-zone<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.880> normal<00:02:59.420> on<00:02:59.569> the<00:02:59.720> outer

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
of an oily t-zone to normal on the outer

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.699 
of an oily t-zone to normal on the outer
portions<00:03:00.560> of<00:03:00.680> my<00:03:00.860> face<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.489> I<00:03:02.300> am<00:03:02.720> acne<00:03:03.319> prone

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
portions of my face and I am acne prone

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.460 
portions of my face and I am acne prone
because<00:03:04.100> I<00:03:04.640> have<00:03:04.850> an<00:03:05.000> oily<00:03:05.180> t-zone<00:03:05.569> so<00:03:06.440> I

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
because I have an oily t-zone so I

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.210 
because I have an oily t-zone so I
decided<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.280> get<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.970> deep<00:03:08.900> pore<00:03:09.319> one<00:03:10.069> that

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220
