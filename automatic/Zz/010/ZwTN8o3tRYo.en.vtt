 very good androids in today's video 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:13.809
 we will learn how to install the 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.059
 recovery stock in the one plus one a 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.489
 many people serve this tutorial 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.460
 because you have installed the recovery 

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:23.710
 for example tw erp to install the root 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.009
 and now he wants to go back to the stock recovery 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.869
 to retrieve the notes ie the 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.439
 official system updates 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.790
 so with this tutorial we are going to 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.630
 perform the recovery installation 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.740
 stock in this way to be able to recover 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.650
 official updates of the 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.900
 operational cyanogenmod 11-s in the one 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.910
 plus one what you will have to do is 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.550
 download the file that you will have the 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.320
 link in the description of the video me in 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.540
 my case he copied that I have it in this 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.040
 notepad we copy we paste you 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.190
 you will have it in the description of the video 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.230
 and we wait for the seconds once there 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.140
 loaded we give you in jump advertising 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.059
 as you see, do not redirect to mega like 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.680
 You see in the file that we are going to download 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.460
 is recovery this in this case 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.920
 the version is x nh 22 q of the one plus 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.590
 one clear point we give in download to 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.370
 your computer and automatically the cloud 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.040
 the percentage will start to be realized 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.530
 until you reach 100 and download the 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.500
 file the file is 1 as such 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.600
 this one with a decompressor 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.840
 files like winrar or seven can be 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.330
 yes or similar as we will extract here a 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 Once extracted , we create such a folder 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.220
 which is how we will open now 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.800
 what we are going to do is to go to 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.430
 our one plus one so here what 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.130
 we have let's slide and we're going to 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.500
 activate usb debug options 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.740
 so we 're going to go to adjustments we 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.630
 let's go to phone information and 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.310
 here we should go to number of 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.100
 compilation in which we will have to give 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.869
 up to 7 times once we have touched him 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.390
 seven times and tell us here we are 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.580
 developers we will go back and we 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.950
 a sub-menu called options will appear 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.120
 development in which we have to have 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.790
 activated web debugging 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.709
 once this is activated as you see it 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.569
 we activate we give you to accept this 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.590
 activated and now we will have it 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.540
 connect the micro usb to our 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.640
 one plus one device on this side 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.980
 at this end the micro usb and by the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.390
 another side the usb connected to our 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.670
 we connect to you, we will wait for 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.129
 that our computer installs all the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.290
 drivers corresponding to our one 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.019
 plus one and once finished 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.730
 install everything we will give you simply in 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.599
 case of operating systems 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.030
 windows we will give you in flash r stock in 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.379
 case of linux operating systems 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.470
 we will give in flash 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.720
 stock point s h in my case as is 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.209
 windows we will give in flash r stock 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.690
 double click the device will tend to 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:07.109
 restart and as we will see the window of 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.390
 cmd exe starts flashing all the 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.730
 file as you see at the end it tells us 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.920
 press a key to end by 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.829
 example press enter and now we 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.970
 we focus on the device as you see 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.550
 is restarting 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.850
 and we're going to wait until it's over 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.890
 restart and then start it in the 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.230
 recovery menu you can check how 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.740
 the recovery is really installed 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.360
 stock so we wait and now we go back 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.480
 As we can see, it has just started like this 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.300
 that we're going to restart restart in mode 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.750
 We give in accept and now 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.070
 let's wait for it to restart and 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.500
 check how it really has been installed 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.640
 correctly the stock recovery of 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.440
 cyanogenmod 11-s we hope be the 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.500
 start of the recovery always takes a 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.750
 little but nothing you do not have to worry about 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.320
 for nothing that will always start like this 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.320
 what we hope 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.490
 and as we see here, it has just started 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.700
 the record of cyanogenmod simple recovery 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:18.820
 that the compilation of android 4.4 point 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.940
 2 which is kv of 49 l 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.810
 as we see you can handle tactile mind 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.030
 we perform with your finger and to 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.090
 select press with the button 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.730
 power and ready we can also the 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.350
 navigation with the volume buttons 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.110
 but nothing else this recovery is 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.350
 practically very simple is not like the 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.150
 recovery tw erp and nothing else I hope that
