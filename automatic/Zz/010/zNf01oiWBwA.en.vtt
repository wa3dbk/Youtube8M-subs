00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
out this mixer right here - DDM 4000 all

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.110 
out this mixer right here - DDM 4000 all
right<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> behringer<00:00:58.940> one<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
right it's the behringer one of the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.950 
right it's the behringer one of the
things<00:01:00.359> about<00:01:00.539> what<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.440> mixer<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.100> cold

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
things about what this mixer is cold

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.770 
things about what this mixer is cold
because<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.290> cheap<00:01:05.030> no<00:01:06.030> that's<00:01:06.450> not<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
because it's cheap no that's not the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.380 
because it's cheap no that's not the
reason<00:01:06.900> why<00:01:07.220> reason<00:01:08.220> why<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.850> makes<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.270> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
reason why reason why this makes it is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.289 
reason why reason why this makes it is
cold<00:01:10.189> because<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.659> don't<00:01:12.659> know<00:01:12.750> too<00:01:12.990> many<00:01:13.049> mixes

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
cold because I don't know too many mixes

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.090 
cold because I don't know too many mixes
don't<00:01:15.299> let<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.600> control<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> frequencies<00:01:16.830> of

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
don't let you control the frequencies of

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.429 
don't let you control the frequencies of
your<00:01:17.790> channels

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
your channels

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.779 
your channels
like<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.610> go<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.479> display<00:01:22.789> in

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
like I can go in here in a display in

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:30.319 
like I can go in here in a display in
here<00:01:25.189> and<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.610> pick<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.439> common<00:01:28.439> set<00:01:28.829> up<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.460> if

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
here and you pick a common set up and if

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.639 
here and you pick a common set up and if
you<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.509> see<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.899> real<00:01:31.079> good<00:01:31.289> oh<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.409> gotta

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
you can see it real good oh I gotta

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.149 
you can see it real good oh I gotta
focus<00:01:31.920> right<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:33.259> can<00:01:34.259> change<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.619> frequencies

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
focus right I can change the frequencies

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.499 
focus right I can change the frequencies
right<00:01:35.340> here<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:36.600> these<00:01:37.140> right<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:38.509> most

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
right here of these right here most

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.850 
right here of these right here most
niggas<00:01:39.810> don't<00:01:39.990> let<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.259> do<00:01:40.409> that

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
niggas don't let you do that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.340 
niggas don't let you do that
and<00:01:41.789> this<00:01:41.909> de<00:01:42.060> chalma<00:01:42.360> cross<00:01:42.720> over<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.319> that

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
and this de chalma cross over so that

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.010 
and this de chalma cross over so that
means<00:01:43.679> is<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> cross<00:01:44.189> over<00:01:44.899> changing<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
means is a cross over changing the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.169 
means is a cross over changing the
frequency<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.619> therefore<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.149> a

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
frequency so therefore it's like a

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.850 
frequency so therefore it's like a
parameter<00:01:48.929> equalized<00:01:50.539> helping<00:01:51.539> you<00:01:51.860> with

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
parameter equalized helping you with

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.160 
parameter equalized helping you with
your<00:01:53.130> main<00:01:53.549> output<00:01:54.619> but<00:01:55.619> then<00:01:56.539> this<00:01:57.539> mixer

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
your main output but then this mixer

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:10.440 
your main output but then this mixer
also<00:01:59.039> has<00:02:02.569> also<00:02:03.569> has<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> sir<00:02:04.409> about

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450

maybe<00:02:42.470> get<00:02:42.710> another<00:02:42.920> man<00:02:43.160> now<00:02:43.370> at<00:02:43.640> our<00:02:43.820> RCA

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
maybe get another man now at our RCA

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.390 
maybe get another man now at our RCA
with<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.760> XLR<00:02:47.510> then<00:02:48.470> you'll<00:02:48.830> know<00:02:49.040> what<00:02:49.190> this

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
with the XLR then you'll know what this

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.810 
with the XLR then you'll know what this
give<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:49.820> an<00:02:49.940> XLR<00:02:50.510> sub<00:02:51.170> out<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:52.670> can

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
give you an XLR sub out and you can

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.450 
give you an XLR sub out and you can
control<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:53.300> frequencies<00:02:54.230> in<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:55.250> the

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
control the frequencies in that the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.240 
control the frequencies in that the
cross<00:02:55.790> over<00:02:56.240> in<00:02:56.390> there<00:02:56.630> in<00:02:57.530> two<00:02:57.830> ways<00:02:58.070> you

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
cross over in there in two ways you

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.890 
cross over in there in two ways you
should<00:02:58.310> control<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.060> frequencies<00:02:59.600> on<00:02:59.840> the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
should control the frequencies on the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.070 
should control the frequencies on the
cross<00:03:00.590> fader<00:03:00.950> right<00:03:01.280> here<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:05.780> you<00:03:05.930> can

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
cross fader right here and you can

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.650 
cross fader right here and you can
control<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.650> up<00:03:06.710> here<00:03:07.090> no<00:03:08.090> that's<00:03:08.390> called

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
control it up here no that's called

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.740 
control it up here no that's called
that's<00:03:08.960> precise<00:03:09.380> just<00:03:10.190> music<00:03:10.550> okay<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.150> played

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
that's precise just music okay I played

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.010 
that's precise just music okay I played
some<00:03:11.930> house<00:03:12.140> music<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:13.150> can<00:03:14.150> kick<00:03:14.450> this<00:03:14.690> at<00:03:14.990> a

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
some house music I can kick this at a

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.830 
some house music I can kick this at a
lower<00:03:15.380> frequency<00:03:15.500> bass<00:03:16.420> but<00:03:17.420> then<00:03:17.600> when<00:03:17.750> I

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
lower frequency bass but then when I

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.990 
lower frequency bass but then when I
open<00:03:18.200> this<00:03:18.320> up<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.740> put<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.010> new<00:03:19.190> on<00:03:19.400> here

open this up and put the new on here

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.050 
open this up and put the new on here
I<00:03:20.030> can<00:03:20.870> I<00:03:21.050> can<00:03:21.110> open<00:03:21.620> up<00:03:21.740> to<00:03:22.100> a<00:03:22.190> bigger<00:03:22.460> bass<00:03:22.790> on

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
I can I can open up to a bigger bass on

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.510 
I can I can open up to a bigger bass on
the<00:03:23.180> sub<00:03:23.450> so<00:03:24.410> I<00:03:24.470> can<00:03:24.650> be<00:03:24.710> playing<00:03:24.890> around<00:03:25.250> with

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
the sub so I can be playing around with

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.570 
the sub so I can be playing around with
the<00:03:25.670> basis<00:03:26.680> already<00:03:27.680> yet<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.190> can<00:03:28.370> emphasize

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
the basis already yet I can emphasize

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.320 
the basis already yet I can emphasize
this<00:03:29.300> I<00:03:29.540> can<00:03:30.020> emphasize<00:03:30.910> cause<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.090> highs<00:03:32.300> I

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
this I can emphasize cause the highs I

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.670 
this I can emphasize cause the highs I
have<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:33.440> this<00:03:34.040> has<00:03:34.310> all<00:03:34.610> I<00:03:35.500> don't<00:03:36.500> know<00:03:36.650> if

that it all this on on the highs and
mids<00:03:53.900> kick<00:03:54.320> out<00:03:54.500> what<00:03:54.710> they<00:03:54.860> are<00:03:55.040> and<00:03:55.340> then<00:03:56.180> on

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
mids kick out what they are and then on

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.630 
mids kick out what they are and then on
