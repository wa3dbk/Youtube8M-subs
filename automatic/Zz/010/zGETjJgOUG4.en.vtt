00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
school notebooks

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.990 
school notebooks
it<00:04:56.630> has<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:57.410> garter<00:04:57.710> to<00:04:58.280> keep<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.610> notebook

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
it has a garter to keep the notebook

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.499 
it has a garter to keep the notebook
close<00:04:59.240> and<00:05:00.080> you<00:05:00.349> open<00:05:00.710> it<00:05:00.860> and<00:05:01.039> it<00:05:01.400> is<00:05:01.729> lined<00:05:02.180> at

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
close and you open it and it is lined at

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.170 
close and you open it and it is lined at
slightly<00:05:02.900> line<00:05:03.380> past<00:05:03.979> blue<00:05:04.310> lines<00:05:04.639> and<00:05:05.030> I

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
slightly line past blue lines and I

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.909 
slightly line past blue lines and I
thought<00:05:05.360> would<00:05:05.570> be<00:05:05.599> perfect<00:05:06.259> to<00:05:06.440> just<00:05:06.650> stick

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
thought would be perfect to just stick

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.700 
thought would be perfect to just stick
down<00:05:07.160> notes<00:05:08.120> it<00:05:08.419> with<00:05:08.750> my<00:05:08.930> cute<00:05:09.320> colored

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
down notes it with my cute colored

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.339 
down notes it with my cute colored
pencil<00:05:10.310> came<00:05:10.580> in<00:05:10.759> my<00:05:10.910> tiny<00:05:11.300> little<00:05:11.599> chocolate

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
pencil came in my tiny little chocolate

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.909 
pencil came in my tiny little chocolate
bar<00:05:13.419> pencil<00:05:14.419> case<00:05:14.630> and<00:05:14.960> I<00:05:15.349> know<00:05:15.410> that<00:05:15.710> would<00:05:15.889> be

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
bar pencil case and I know that would be

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.980 
bar pencil case and I know that would be
taking<00:05:16.400> a<00:05:16.520> lot<00:05:16.729> of<00:05:16.759> notes<00:05:16.940> for<00:05:17.360> any<00:05:17.570> of<00:05:17.810> my

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
taking a lot of notes for any of my

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.279 
taking a lot of notes for any of my
classes<00:05:18.280> so<00:05:19.280> I<00:05:19.669> figured<00:05:20.300> just<00:05:20.330> one<00:05:20.840> notebook

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
classes so I figured just one notebook

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.129 
classes so I figured just one notebook
that<00:05:21.830> is<00:05:22.099> this<00:05:22.430> size<00:05:22.699> would<00:05:23.419> be<00:05:23.479> sufficient

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
that is this size would be sufficient

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.409 
that is this size would be sufficient
for<00:05:24.169> me<00:05:24.409> I<00:05:24.590> also<00:05:24.889> went<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.430> picked<00:05:25.729> up<00:05:25.970> three

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
for me I also went and picked up three

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.629 
for me I also went and picked up three
many<00:05:26.720> notebooks<00:05:27.259> and<00:05:27.470> I<00:05:27.740> honestly<00:05:28.340> don't<00:05:28.520> know

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
many notebooks and I honestly don't know

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.790 
many notebooks and I honestly don't know
what<00:05:28.789> I'm<00:05:28.880> going<00:05:29.060> to<00:05:29.150> do<00:05:29.360> with<00:05:29.509> this<00:05:29.599> I<00:05:29.930> just

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
what I'm going to do with this I just

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.370 
what I'm going to do with this I just
found<00:05:30.949> them<00:05:31.190> really<00:05:31.610> cute<00:05:31.970> and<00:05:32.210> adorable<00:05:32.360> so<00:05:33.199> I

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
found them really cute and adorable so I

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.230 
found them really cute and adorable so I
got<00:05:33.620> these<00:05:33.889> notebooks<00:05:34.159> there's<00:05:34.789> like<00:05:34.940> many

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
got these notebooks there's like many

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.689 
got these notebooks there's like many
notebooks<00:05:35.509> that<00:05:36.220> don't<00:05:37.220> really<00:05:37.430> have<00:05:37.669> a

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
notebooks that don't really have a

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.240 
notebooks that don't really have a
purpose<00:05:38.030> for<00:05:38.210> me<00:05:38.449> but<00:05:38.659> I<00:05:38.690> figured<00:05:39.110> I<00:05:39.470> could

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
purpose for me but I figured I could

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.820 
purpose for me but I figured I could
probably<00:05:40.520> write<00:05:40.759> reminders<00:05:41.360> in<00:05:41.810> them<00:05:42.020> and<00:05:42.440> do

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
probably write reminders in them and do

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.420 
probably write reminders in them and do
dates<00:05:43.039> and<00:05:44.139> you<00:05:45.139> know<00:05:45.259> other<00:05:45.560> dude<00:05:45.949> be<00:05:46.159> rudely

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
dates and you know other dude be rudely

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.249 
dates and you know other dude be rudely
stuff<00:05:46.820> hopefully<00:05:47.509> they<00:05:47.630> will<00:05:47.750> come<00:05:47.960> in<00:05:48.110> handy

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 
stuff hopefully they will come in handy

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:49.899 
stuff hopefully they will come in handy
I<00:05:48.590> breathe<00:05:48.889> I'll<00:05:49.070> find<00:05:49.280> something<00:05:49.490> to<00:05:49.669> do<00:05:49.789> with

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:49.909

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
to turn into a pencil case but when we

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.029 
to turn into a pencil case but when we
went<00:06:04.940> to<00:06:05.090> off<00:06:05.479> this<00:06:05.690> warehouse<00:06:06.169> I<00:06:06.440> found<00:06:06.800> this

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
went to off this warehouse I found this

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:10.390 
went to off this warehouse I found this
vent<00:06:07.310> for<00:06:07.490> case<00:06:07.699> and<00:06:08.060> I<00:06:08.120> was<00:06:08.270> like<00:06:08.860> that<00:06:09.860> so<00:06:10.340> I

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
vent for case and I was like that so I

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.779 
vent for case and I was like that so I
