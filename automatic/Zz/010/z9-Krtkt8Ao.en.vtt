00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.960
 hello we will detail together 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.590
 the first power on your 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.880
 system 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.039
 aion 30 this is an important phase that 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.470
 allows to program the keyboards 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.510
 commands and configure the system 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.370
 according to its use 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.250
 we will let the system work 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.000
 quietly until the display of the 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.000
 next screen 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.350
 when this device display needs to be 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.200
 press the key at the same time 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.270
 evs and for 5 seconds to address 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.360
 the keyboard and that it is recognized 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.890
 by the central it is the central 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.590
 we propose the first options a 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.300
 selected using the keypad 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.920
 navigation i'm going to select the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.920
 language and country 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:04.129
 I validate each time with the key 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.320
 validation the choice between the world 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.119
 partition and partial is important because 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.259
 that he will determine how 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.780
 operate the system 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.910
 partition mode allows you to use the 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.369
 system like four systems alarmed 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.729
 independent this solution applies 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.170
 rather tertiary facilities the 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.420
 partial mode has rather a use 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.190
 residential a total commissioning 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.619
 which is the protection of the whole 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.840
 home and one or more set 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.450
 partial service to protect 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.780
 parts of this one i press b for 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.580
 select the partial mode we are going 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.350
 now choose the type of wiring from 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.270
 the central several possibilities 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.490
 are offered to us the first is a 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.340
 wiring with resistors these 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.140
 resistors supplied with the central us 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.380
 will connect up to 10 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.960
 detector refer to the instructions 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.960
 installation of laâyoune 30 to have 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.310
 the detail of the wiring it is possible to 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.880
 select other values ​​from 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.310
 resistance 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.470
 this can be used in case 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.409
 I have to recover some wiring or 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.600
 existing detectors 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.750
 nf four wire option for normally 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.310
 closed and the most used 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.250
 it allows cables and detectors 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.530
 in four wires an alarm loop a 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.660
 self-protection loop and not 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.630
 use resistance but be careful 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.620
 in this case the central aion 30 does not 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.049
 will be able to receive only five detectors for 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.049
 the example I will choose two sons with 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.170
 resistors of 2 2 and 4.7 which the 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.450
 home 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.590
 the first phase of initialization of the 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.760
 system is made mistakes are 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.069
 reported it's perfectly normal 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.200
 since the central is open and that 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.140
 some self protection is not 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.690
 closed press the cross for 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.130
 ignore the problem 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.910
 here you are in the menu 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.980
 installers if during the phase 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.810
 initialization you do not have 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.060
 correctly program is a parameter 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.640
 you can always do it in mode 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.350
 installers and to finish we 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.709
 will detail the features of the 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.709
 keyboard 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.959
 the selector button of the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.200
 selections the navigation pad that 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:27.620
 Scrolls through the menus at the bottom 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:29.299
 left right the number pad that you 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.650
 allows you to enter numbers and 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.549
 letters 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.480
 exactly like your phone 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.590
 notebook we now come to the 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.870
 end of this first phase 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.079
 thanks for your attention there are very 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.079
 soon
