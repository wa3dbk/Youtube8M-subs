I<00:00:18.860> built<00:00:19.490> earlier<00:00:20.000> I<00:00:22.390> have<00:00:23.390> made<00:00:23.570> some

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
I built earlier I have made some

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.350 
I built earlier I have made some
improvements<00:00:24.800> on<00:00:25.630> this<00:00:26.630> engine

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360

improvements on this engine
among<00:00:29.360> other<00:00:29.600> I<00:00:30.850> have<00:00:31.850> made<00:00:32.059> a<00:00:32.090> system<00:00:32.860> that

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
among other I have made a system that

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.240 
among other I have made a system that
make<00:00:34.190> it<00:00:34.340> possible<00:00:34.550> to<00:00:35.530> reduced<00:00:36.530> the

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
make it possible to reduced the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.640 
make it possible to reduced the
injection<00:00:37.730> timing<00:00:38.110> when<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:39.260> engine<00:00:39.530> is

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
injection timing when the engine is

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.510 
injection timing when the engine is
running<00:00:40.690> this<00:00:41.690> is<00:00:41.900> the<00:00:42.079> handle<00:00:42.470> that<00:00:42.980> controls

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
running this is the handle that controls

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.930 
running this is the handle that controls
the<00:00:43.820> system

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
the system

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.270 
the system

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.819 
the handle is connected turn it
eccentric<00:00:52.850> in<00:00:53.829> the<00:00:54.829> injection<00:00:55.130> pump<00:00:55.579> handle

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
eccentric in the injection pump handle

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.049 
eccentric in the injection pump handle
which<00:00:57.829> is<00:00:58.239> situated<00:01:00.040> between<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.550> injection

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
which is situated between the injection

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.859 
which is situated between the injection
pump<00:01:02.329> cam<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:04.100> injection<00:01:04.610> pump<00:01:07.539> so<00:01:08.539> when

the<00:01:08.959> handle<00:01:09.289> is<00:01:10.299> activated<00:01:11.499> like<00:01:12.499> this<00:01:13.929> it

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
the handle is activated like this it

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:20.230 
the handle is activated like this it
moves<00:01:16.389> the<00:01:17.389> injection<00:01:17.899> pump<00:01:18.139> handle<00:01:18.939> in<00:01:19.939> and

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
moves the injection pump handle in and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.819 
moves the injection pump handle in and
out<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:21.459> thereby<00:01:22.459> changing<00:01:23.029> the<00:01:23.209> time<00:01:23.829> when

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
out and thereby changing the time when

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.269 
out and thereby changing the time when
the<00:01:24.950> injection<00:01:25.279> pump<00:01:25.759> camp<00:01:26.109> hit<00:01:27.109> the<00:01:27.920> handle

00:01:28.269 --> 00:01:28.279 
the injection pump camp hit the handle

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:31.599 
the injection pump camp hit the handle
and<00:01:28.459> thereby<00:01:29.029> the<00:01:29.389> injection<00:01:29.779> pump<00:01:30.279> so<00:01:31.279> an

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
and thereby the injection pump so an

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:35.050 
and thereby the injection pump so an
earlier<00:01:32.060> or<00:01:32.329> later<00:01:32.469> injection<00:01:33.469> time<00:01:33.880> can<00:01:34.880> be

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
earlier or later injection time can be

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.620 
earlier or later injection time can be
found<00:01:35.329> in<00:01:36.639> this<00:01:37.639> position<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:40.310> camshaft<00:01:40.849> is

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
found in this position the camshaft is

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.730 
found in this position the camshaft is
turning<00:01:42.229> in<00:01:42.829> that<00:01:43.069> direction<00:01:44.259> it's<00:01:45.259> a<00:01:45.560> low

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
turning in that direction it's a low

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.839 
turning in that direction it's a low
injection<00:01:46.700> time<00:01:46.909> and<00:01:47.349> in<00:01:48.349> this<00:01:48.529> position<00:01:48.849> it's

00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:49.849 
injection time and in this position it's

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:53.919 
injection time and in this position it's
an<00:01:50.689> earlier<00:01:51.200> injection<00:01:52.039> time<00:01:52.479> it<00:01:53.479> seemed<00:01:53.779> to

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
an earlier injection time it seemed to

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.330 
an earlier injection time it seemed to
work<00:01:53.959> okay

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.960 

after<00:01:59.060> several<00:01:59.409> experiments<00:02:00.790> with<00:02:01.790> the

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
after several experiments with the

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.289 
after several experiments with the
injection<00:02:02.390> timing<00:02:03.010> it's<00:02:04.010> now<00:02:04.310> possible<00:02:04.850> for

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
injection timing it's now possible for

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.639 
injection timing it's now possible for
me<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:05.770> start<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:07.070> engine<00:02:07.340> by<00:02:07.520> hand<00:02:08.050> even<00:02:09.050> when

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
me to start the engine by hand even when

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.870 
me to start the engine by hand even when
the<00:02:09.830> engine<00:02:10.100> is<00:02:10.220> cold<00:02:10.900> it's<00:02:11.900> gone<00:02:12.170> now<00:02:12.410> so

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
the engine is cold it's gone now so

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:22.210 
the engine is cold it's gone now so
let's<00:02:13.880> see<00:02:14.180> if<00:02:14.480> it's<00:02:15.290> get<00:02:15.470> started<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:21.220> little

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
let's see if it's get started a little

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.160 
let's see if it's get started a little
more<00:02:22.580> frog<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:24.400> adduced<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:26.060> timing<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:27.050> the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
more frog and adduced the timing to the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.670 
more frog and adduced the timing to the
part<00:02:27.500> here<00:02:27.910> it's<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:29.120> bit<00:02:29.300> late<00:02:29.569> but<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.320> bit<00:02:30.650> more

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
part here it's a bit late but a bit more

00:02:30.680 --> 00:03:36.089 
part here it's a bit late but a bit more
problem<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:33.650> see<00:02:34.100> it<00:02:34.330> start

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:41.890 

the<00:03:37.099> engine<00:03:37.370> is<00:03:37.519> rather<00:03:38.090> quick<00:03:39.730> at<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:41.120> gamma

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
the engine is rather quick at the gamma

00:03:41.900 --> 00:04:01.839 
the engine is rather quick at the gamma
handler<00:03:42.379> I<00:03:59.530> will<00:04:00.530> try<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.709> reduce<00:04:01.159> the

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
handler I will try to reduce the

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.099 
handler I will try to reduce the
ejection<00:04:02.150> timing<00:04:03.670> when<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.790> engine<00:04:05.030> is<00:04:05.109> under

it's<00:04:13.489> a<00:04:13.609> rather<00:04:14.299> early<00:04:15.250> injection<00:04:16.250> timing

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
it's a rather early injection timing

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:28.089 
it's a rather early injection timing
nice<00:04:17.630> try<00:04:17.870> -<00:04:21.940> it's<00:04:22.940> knocking<00:04:23.389> at<00:04:23.510> me<00:04:26.949> then<00:04:27.949> I

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 
nice try - it's knocking at me then I

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.020 
nice try - it's knocking at me then I
put<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.550> handle<00:04:28.849> in<00:04:29.389> this<00:04:29.539> precision<00:04:31.030> the

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
put the handle in this precision the

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.810 
put the handle in this precision the
rather<00:04:32.240> date<00:04:32.570> engaging<00:04:33.380> time<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.610> engine

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
rather date engaging time and the engine

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.750 
rather date engaging time and the engine
is<00:04:37.970> not<00:04:38.180> nothing<00:04:38.630> anymore<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:39.380> the<00:04:40.370> problem

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
is not nothing anymore and the problem

is not nothing anymore and the problem
is<00:04:41.630> much<00:04:42.440> better
