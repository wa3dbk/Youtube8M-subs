00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.520
 to 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.820
 Hello, how are we people today? 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.100
 new bukit video this time about 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.120
 multiple portals 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:23.590
 a little bit more of the multiverse team 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.590
 and many taxpayers 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:33.719
 ok well first of all this after 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.390
 It requires two things as dependent on 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.390
 two things once in multi bars cord 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.180
 who already made a video of it in this in 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.579
 the channel and an optional one that is the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.050
 chubby but it is advisable to have the ok 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.449
 good here is you and in the link is the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.839
 description once it's downloaded 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:59.129
 they call their server and they place it 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:02.640
 here in my case to multiple pakistan 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.229
 portal 2.4 I forgot to tell you 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.500
 As always, you can go here 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.869
 the one that I have is 2.4 for 1.2 point 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.170
 5 that actually works by a 1.64 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.190
 for 1.72 not so they are making a 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.280
 new 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.380
 ok then since we are here we are 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.380
 in the super server I'm going to 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.450
 lower this a bit 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.640
 I'm going to do the portals here 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.100
 passion here the portal does not matter from 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.020
 its dimensions ok nor its size what 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.020
 You can do as you like 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.570
 one 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.860
 here it is 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.860
 the other 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:11.510
 and we occupy the ax of word edit 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.510
 ok we put the vp we are going to leave all 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.510
 the 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.890
 well rather do not leave the multiverse 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:33.870
 if the cases are from the multiverse ok 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:38.319
 then we select here we put here 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.190
 and we put mv p 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.720
 and the name of the portal 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.720
 portal 1 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:53.160
 new portal one stayed and selected 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:59.580
 ok then let's go here 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:03.030
 we place here here portal portal 29 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:09.000
 2 now says no to portal 2 degrees and 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:10.050
 selected now we put m vp moody 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.180
 efe 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.870
 from this 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.599
 space of two points this time of portal 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.630
 and the portal where you want it to be 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:26.350
 take then this case is portal 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.210
 I will try mv modifi to modify 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.720
 this portal that is the one that we have 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.420
 selected from this to put a 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.900
 destination ok 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:42.310
 that destination is going to be a portal p and 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.860
 that portal is a portal 1 ok 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.330
 I hope then understand the mo 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:52.900
 center and as it says property destiny of 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.090
 portal portal 2 be I could say 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.310
 placed paired with the portal 1 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.819
 so if we go through here it's going to 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.219
 carry out 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.410
 but if we go through here, it's not going 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:05.510
 to take nowhere 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.710
 then to select this portal 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:12.060
 we simply put emv 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.830
 select 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:19.040
 the name of the portal portal 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.650
 this is the portal 1 ok they were deported or 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.650
 has been selected then we write 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:29.470
 emv 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:31.570
 dif and portal portal space and the 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.440
 name of the portal where you want to want 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.910
 that go 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.700
 we put portal 2 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.830
 ok says it's already matched we crossed 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.830
 here he takes us here because they see 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.960
 I do not lie to them a taste here so 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.380
 we use here takes us here and now 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.380
 no this 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:05:01.080
 ok this can be used in multiverse core 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:04.020
 for different worlds for example this 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.560
 portal takes you to another world if we pass 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:12.410
 around here as you see, another world took us 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.410
 where are the video games 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.500
 ok that is good portal also not 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:21.940
 there was 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.940
 then we go to spam 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.530
 so here 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.710
 to ready this car 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.610
