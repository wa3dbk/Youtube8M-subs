let me go ahead and let you know what
I'm<00:00:36.149> talking<00:00:36.630> about<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.260> guys<00:00:37.380> aren't

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
I'm talking about so you guys aren't

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.880 
I'm talking about so you guys aren't
just<00:00:37.739> doing<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.100> blindly<00:00:38.690> basically<00:00:39.890> when

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
just doing this blindly basically when

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.680 
just doing this blindly basically when
you<00:00:41.070> actually<00:00:41.370> unroot<00:00:41.969> your<00:00:42.120> device<00:00:42.390> when<00:00:42.629> you

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
you actually unroot your device when you

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.270 
you actually unroot your device when you
flash<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:42.930> stock<00:00:43.410> tar<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.770> get<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.950> back<00:00:44.100> to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
flash that stock tar to get you back to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.830 
flash that stock tar to get you back to
complete<00:00:44.579> stock<00:00:44.879> if<00:00:45.120> you've<00:00:45.270> rooted<00:00:45.719> your

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
complete stock if you've rooted your

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
complete stock if you've rooted your
phone<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.710> most<00:00:47.190> likely<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:49.260> count<00:00:49.649> on

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
phone you most likely have a count on

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.459 
phone you most likely have a count on
your<00:00:49.980> flash<00:00:50.250> counts<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.030> basically<00:00:51.960> let's<00:00:52.320> go

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
your flash counts so basically let's go

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.420 
your flash counts so basically let's go
ahead<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.770> get<00:00:52.860> into<00:00:52.980> download<00:00:53.399> mode

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
ahead and get into download mode

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.430 
ahead and get into download mode

power button all at the same time and
then<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.379> show<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.710> exactly<00:00:59.100> what<00:00:59.730> I'm

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
people call it up at the top you will

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260 
people call it up at the top you will
see<00:01:10.080> right<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:10.799> custom<00:01:11.280> binary<00:01:11.549> download

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
see right here custom binary download

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.450 
see right here custom binary download
you<00:01:12.810> will<00:01:12.990> see<00:01:13.229> yes<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.830> then<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> number

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you will see yes and then a number

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.620 
you will see yes and then a number
basically<00:01:14.670> letting<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.240> know<00:01:15.330> how<00:01:15.479> many

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
basically letting you know how many

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.570 
basically letting you know how many
times<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.380> flashed<00:01:16.799> either<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> custom

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
times that you flashed either a custom

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.480 
times that you flashed either a custom
kernel<00:01:18.030> or<00:01:18.270> something<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.259> via<00:01:19.890> Odin

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
kernel or something like that via Odin

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.700 
kernel or something like that via Odin
or<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> custom<00:01:21.150> recovery<00:01:21.270> all<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.500> good<00:01:22.680> stuff

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
or a custom recovery all that good stuff

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.920 
or a custom recovery all that good stuff
that<00:01:23.310> will<00:01:23.549> trip<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.090> counter<00:01:24.479> right<00:01:24.630> there

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
that will trip that counter right there

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.030 
that will trip that counter right there
so<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.290> will<00:01:25.530> say<00:01:25.799> yes<00:01:26.570> basically<00:01:28.040> carriers

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
so it will say yes basically carriers

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.340 
so it will say yes basically carriers
most<00:01:29.400> likely<00:01:29.939> won't<00:01:30.240> look<00:01:30.659> at<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.960> some

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
most likely won't look at that some

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.020 
most likely won't look at that some

you're going to send it in to Samsung is

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.700 
you're going to send it in to Samsung is
they're<00:01:45.540> most<00:01:45.750> likely<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:46.229> going<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.470> take<00:01:46.680> it

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
they're most likely not going to take it

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.350 
they're most likely not going to take it
because<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.250> says<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.759> custom<00:01:48.180> binary
